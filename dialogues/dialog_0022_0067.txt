DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It’s… hard to explain. Seems to be getting worse, that's why I came. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. A while now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain with deep breaths. I understand. It’s alright if you don’t have an exact date; we'll try to figure it out. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… a dull ache, mostly. Like a pressure, right here… …and sometimes a sharp little stab if I really take a big breath. Not constant, thankfully. But it worries me. Old man stuff, I guess.
DOCTOR: I see. A dull ache with occasional sharp pains when you take a deep breath, located in your chest. That’s helpful. Is the pain on one side, or both?
PATIENT: Both sides, I think. Or… maybe it moves around? It's hard to say for sure. My memory isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. I wish I could be more specific. It just… aches when I try to fill my lungs.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll take our time. So, both sides of your chest, sometimes moving around, and it feels like an ache when you breathe deeply. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse when I… when I do too much. Like, carrying things, or working in the yard. I used to help my grandson with some building… but that’s been harder lately. Better when I… sit still, mostly. Not doing anything. That’s probably not a very good thing, though, is it?
DOCTOR: No, sitting still isn’t ideal, but it's good you’ve noticed that it helps. So, it's worsened with activity and relieved with rest. Have you had any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I get a little… short of breath sometimes. Not all the time, just when I'm really pushing myself. And… I cough a bit now and then. Just a little tickle in my throat, nothing serious. Been doing that for a long time, though. Old man cough, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion and a chronic cough. Is the cough producing any mucus, and if so, what color is it?
PATIENT: Mucus… yes, sometimes. Clear mostly. Or… white. I haven’t paid much attention, to be honest. It's not a lot, and it doesn’t bother me too much. I don’t want to take up too much of your time, Doctor. I know you're busy.
DOCTOR: You're not taking up too much of my time at all, Mr. Ruocco. It's important to get all the information we need. So, mostly clear or white mucus with your cough. Have you had a fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I recall. I don’t usually bother with a thermometer unless I’m really feeling bad. Chills… maybe a little sometimes, but I live in an old house, it gets drafty. And… night sweats? No, I don’t think so. I sleep pretty soundly, to be honest. Is this… is this something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good you sleep soundly. It's hard to say whether it's serious without a proper examination, Mr. Ruocco, but we're going to investigate to find out. I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your heart, if that's alright with you. It will only take a few minutes. Then we can talk about some possible causes and what we might do next. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds… alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have… things to do. But yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. I bruise easily these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I’ll be very gentle. . Please breathe in deeply through your mouth and hold it for a moment, then exhale slowly. Okay, good. I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds on both sides, particularly at the bases of your lungs. There’s a slight wheezing as well. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. I'm also noticing some mild swelling in your ankles. Can you tell me if that's new or has it always been there?
PATIENT: Swelling… Oh. Yes, I hadn't noticed that. It’s… new, I think. I usually wear socks, so I don't look at my feet much. But… yes, they do seem a bit puffy. Is that bad? Everything sounds… complicated.
DOCTOR: It's good you pointed that out, Mr. Ruocco. The ankle swelling is something we need to consider. It’s not necessarily bad, but it gives us more information. The diminished breath sounds, wheezing, and swelling combined could suggest a few possibilities, such as fluid retention, mild heart failure, or a chronic lung condition like COPD. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. The X-ray will help us see what’s going on in your lungs, and the EKG will check the electrical activity of your heart. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: X-ray… and… EKG? Sounds… serious. I don’t like hospitals much. But… if you think it’s necessary. I suppose it’s better to know, right? Just… how long will it take? And will it be painful? I hate needles.
DOCTOR: You're right, it's better to know, Mr. Ruocco. The tests are relatively quick and straightforward. The chest X-ray doesn’t involve any needles – you’ll just stand or sit in front of the machine while a picture is taken. The EKG does involve some small stickers placed on your chest, arms, and legs, but they don’t go deep and don’t usually cause much discomfort. It only takes a few minutes to set up and record. We can do both tests right here at the clinic, and it shouldn’t take more than 30-45 minutes total. Would you like me to explain a little more about why we’re doing each test?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain it to me. Just… not too much detail. I get confused easily. And… is there a cost? I don’t have… much money these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. Let’s start with the chest X-ray. Think of it like a photograph of your lungs and heart. It helps us see if there's any fluid buildup, inflammation, or other problems that might be causing your pain and shortness of breath. It doesn’t hurt at all, and the radiation exposure is very low. The EKG, or electrocardiogram, records the electrical activity of your heart. It tells us if your heart is beating regularly and if there are any signs of strain or damage. It's a quick and painless test – just a few stickers on your skin. As for the cost, I understand your concerns. Since you don’t have insurance, we can discuss options for assistance programs or a payment plan. I’ll have our billing department speak with you after the tests to explore what’s available. They can also give you a more accurate estimate of the costs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds better. Knowing there’s some help available. Yes, alright. Let’s get it over with. I just… want to feel better. And get back to helping my grandson. He needs me. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Ruocco. Your grandson sounds important. We’ll get you started with the EKG first. It's quicker to set up. If you could sit here, I'll explain what I’m doing as I go. We just need to expose your arms and legs a little so I can attach these stickers. Do you mind if I have a nurse come in to help with that?
PATIENT: No, that’s fine. A nurse… that’s alright. I’m not good with… undressing myself easily these days. Just… be quick, please. I don’t like being fussed over.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. We'll be as quick and discreet as possible. “Nurse Anya, could you come in here for a moment, please?
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: “Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Dr. Tosca explained what we’re going to do. I’ll just help get your arms and legs prepped for the EKG. We’ll just need to expose a little bit of skin – it’ll only take a moment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Just… don’t make a fuss. I haven't been feeling myself lately. Everything is… hard.
DOCTOR: “Okay, Mr. Ruocco, all the stickers are in place. I’m just going to start the recording now. Try to relax and breathe normally. It will only take a few minutes. Dr. Tosca will be with you shortly to review the results.” “Everything looks good so far, Mr. Ruocco. Just try to stay still for a bit longer. Dr. Tosca will be right with you.”
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: “Okay, Mr. Ruocco, all done! The recording is finished. Dr. Tosca is reviewing the results now. It should only be a few more minutes.” “Okay, Mr. Ruocco, I’ve reviewed the EKG and the chest X-ray results. The EKG shows some signs of a slightly enlarged heart, which could be contributing to your symptoms. The X-ray shows some fluid buildup in your lungs, and a little bit of congestion. It's not severe, but it’s enough to cause your pain and shortness of breath. It appears you're experiencing early stages of congestive heart failure and some mild pneumonia." "Now, before you get alarmed, it’s important to understand that this is often manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. However, we’ll need to run a few more tests to get a clearer picture of your overall health and to determine the best course of treatment. I’m going to order a blood test to check your kidney and liver function, as well as your levels of certain proteins that can indicate heart failure. I will also want to get a better look at your heart with an echocardiogram. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: That… sounds bad. Very bad. I'm… old. Is this just… old age? Is there anything… anything at all… I can do? I just want to be able to help my grandson. That’s all.
DOCTOR: “It is serious, Mr. Ruocco, but it’s not a death sentence, and it’s manageable. Many people live full and active lives with congestive heart failure. And, while age is certainly a factor, it’s not the sole cause. There are many things we can do to improve your condition. The echocardiogram will give us a much clearer picture of how your heart is functioning. The blood tests will help us determine the best medication to help reduce the fluid buildup and improve your heart's ability to pump. And yes, you can still help your grandson. With treatment and some lifestyle changes – like reducing your salt intake, managing your weight, and getting regular, gentle exercise – you can absolutely continue to enjoy spending time with him. We will take this one step at a time. First, we’ll get the results of the blood tests and schedule the echocardiogram. Then we'll discuss a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. I will explain everything in detail, and you can ask as many questions as you like. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. One step at a time… yes. Blood tests… and… echocardiogram. But… will I be able to work? My grandson… he needs help with the building. I promised I’d help him finish the roof before winter. Is there… any chance I can still help him? Even a little? That roof… it's important. It's for his family.
DOCTOR: “That’s a very important question, Mr. Ruocco. And it’s good you’re thinking ahead. Whether you can continue helping your grandson with the building depends on the severity of your condition and how well you respond to treatment. We need to get the results of the tests first. However, I can say that with proper medication and some adjustments to your activity level, it might be possible. We may need to limit strenuous activities, like heavy lifting or climbing on the roof, but you may still be able to help with lighter tasks, like handing him tools or holding materials. I can also write a note to his employer explaining your limitations, if needed. We’ll work together to find a solution that allows you to help your grandson while protecting your health. Would you like me to write that note now, just in case?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. A note… that would be good. Just… anything that would help. He worries about me, you know. He doesn't say it, but I can tell. Thank you, Doctor. You… you’ve been very kind. I was so scared. Still am, a little. But… you’ve given me hope. That’s… a lot. Now, let's get these tests done. The sooner we know, the better.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. That’s my job. And you’re right, the sooner we know, the better. Nurse Anya will draw your blood now, and then we’ll schedule the echocardiogram. It’s an outpatient procedure, so you’ll be able to go home afterward. I'll also have our scheduler reach out to you to discuss any potential costs and payment options. And please, don’t hesitate to ask any questions that come to mind, no matter how small. We’re in this together. Nurse Anya, could you please take Mr. Ruocco to the lab?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Thank you, Doctor. And… thank you, Nurse Anya. Let's get this over with. The sooner I know, the sooner I can help my grandson. And… maybe, just maybe, get back to living a little.
DOCTOR: “Of course, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll take good care of you. Just relax, and it will be over before you know it.” .
