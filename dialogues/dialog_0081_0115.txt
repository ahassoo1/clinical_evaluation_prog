DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my coloring, I suppose. My skin. It’s…yellowish. A friend noticed, and she insisted I come see someone. Something about my liver, perhaps? I don’t recall all the details. It’s been… a while since I’ve been properly checked.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, friends can be… concerned. It's good you're addressing it. Yellowing of the skin – jaundice, as we call it – can indicate a liver issue, but it's not always the case. We'll need to investigate. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying this change in skin color?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Symptoms… Let me see… I feel rather tired, I suppose. More so than usual. And… a bit of an ache, here and there. Nothing specific, just… general discomfort. Oh! And my stomach… it’s been a little upset. Not terribly, but… off. Does that make sense? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: “Tired,” “aches,” and “upset stomach.” Vague, but we'll clarify. When did you first notice this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s… a difficult question. It feels like it’s been building for some time. Perhaps… a month or two? It’s hard to say precisely. Everything seems to blur together these days. It wasn't sudden, that's certain. Just… a gradual lessening of energy. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so…unclear.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset over a month or two. Alright. And this "upset stomach" – is it nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, no vomiting, thankfully. Mostly just… a feeling of fullness, even when I haven’t eaten much. And… a bit of indigestion, I suppose. Nothing severe, just… uncomfortable. And sometimes, well, it feels a bit… bloated. Yes, bloated is a good word. I haven't been… regular, if you understand. It's rather unpleasant to discuss, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fullness, indigestion, bloating, and irregularity. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s… a personal question. I… I haven’t paid much attention, to be honest. I suppose… no, not that I recall. Everything seems… normal, in that regard. I haven't noticed anything… unusual. Is that important? I apologize. I really don't keep track of such things.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed as if there are no changes, but please do try to be more observant moving forward. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, or liver disease?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… a long time ago. I had something… with my gallbladder, many years ago. They removed it, I believe. And… I had hepatitis, quite a long time ago. It was… a bad bout. But I recovered, or so they said. I haven't really thought about it since. I can’t recall the specifics, it was so long ago. I’m afraid my memory is… patchy. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal and a past history of hepatitis. Very good. What year approximately did you have the hepatitis?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That is… difficult. It was… before the internet, I believe. Perhaps the 1980s? Or maybe the early 90s? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very good at remembering dates even then. I'm terribly sorry, I wish I could be more precise. I really haven’t thought about my medical history in decades.
DOCTOR: “Approximately the 1980s.” Right. And have you had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh… Let me see… I had a… a hip replacement, many years ago. Perhaps ten, fifteen years ago? It was quite painful, but it helped a great deal. And… I think I had a small growth removed from my arm, but it was very minor. Nothing to speak of, really. I can’t recall the exact dates, I’m afraid. My memory is… simply not what it used to be. I apologize for being so vague. Is this… is this important?
DOCTOR: Hip replacement and a minor growth removal. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no. No medications at all. I try to avoid them, if possible. I prefer… natural remedies, when I can. Just a bit of chamomile tea now and then. I haven’t needed anything prescribed in… well, decades. I’m a very healthy person, usually. This… this coloring is quite concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, allergies… I don't believe so. Not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that's long gone. And… I might be slightly sensitive to certain perfumes, but that's not really an allergy, is it? No, I don't think I have any serious allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, tell me a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I would never! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… just a small glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Very rarely, mind you. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not! I’m a very respectable woman. I’ve always lived a very… a very clean life. I'm a woman of simple pleasures – gardening, reading, spending time with friends. Nothing… unsavory.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, minimal alcohol, no smoking, no drugs. Now, let's do a quick physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check for any swelling or tenderness. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh… Must I? It’s been… a very long time since I’ve been examined. I’m rather… frail, you see. But… very well. Just… please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, with mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Palpable liver edge is slightly enlarged, approximately 3 centimeters below the costal margin. No splenomegaly. No ascites noted. No edema in the extremities. Skin is… as you mentioned, yellowish in hue. I’ll need to order some blood tests to evaluate your liver function and rule out any other potential causes for these symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh… That… that’s a bit uncomfortable. But… I understand. Blood tests, you say? What exactly are you looking for? Is it… is it serious? I’m afraid I don't understand all the medical terminology. Please, tell me, what do you suspect? I would appreciate honesty, even if it's… not good news.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will assess the levels of various enzymes and proteins in your liver. Elevated levels can indicate inflammation or damage to the liver. We'll also check your bilirubin levels, which are responsible for the yellowing of the skin you’ve noticed. Given your history of hepatitis, and the tenderness I felt in your right upper quadrant, I suspect there may be some degree of chronic liver inflammation. However, it's also possible this could be caused by something else entirely. We need the blood tests to get a clearer picture. I'll also order a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying conditions. It’s too early to say definitively whether it’s serious, but we need to investigate thoroughly. I’m ruling out the most likely possibilities, but further testing is required for accurate diagnosis. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… Chronic liver inflammation… that sounds… alarming. So, the hepatitis… it’s come back? I… I understand, as much as I can. What will happen if… if it is inflammation? Will I need… treatment? And… what kind of treatment? I confess, I’m rather frightened. This is all very overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Now, now, don't panic. It's not necessarily a recurrence of the hepatitis. Chronic inflammation can have various causes. If the tests confirm inflammation, the treatment will depend on the underlying cause. It could range from simple lifestyle modifications – dietary changes, avoiding alcohol – to medications to reduce inflammation or, in severe cases, more specialized interventions. We’ll discuss all the options thoroughly if that’s the diagnosis. It's crucial to remember that we don’t have all the information yet. Let's focus on getting the tests done first. I’ll have the lab draw a sample of your blood now. The results typically take a few days to come back. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. Do you have any immediate questions before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh… Lifestyle modifications… I suppose I could try that. And… the blood draw… yes, I suppose that’s necessary. Will it… will it be painful? I’ve always been rather… squeamish. And… what if the results are… bad? I appreciate your reassurance, Doctor, but… I’m still very worried. I suppose… let’s just get it over with.
