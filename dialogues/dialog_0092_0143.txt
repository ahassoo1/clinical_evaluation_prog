DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… nice to meet you as well. Hmm. What brings me in… well, it’s about… starting a family. Or, trying to. My daughter, she thinks I should… get checked out first. Before anything happens, you see? It’s all a bit new to me, honestly. I'm not a young man anymore!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Verrall. It's very responsible of both you and your daughter to consider a check-up before starting a family, regardless of age. It’s excellent that you're being proactive. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about your situation?
PATIENT: Situation… Well, I've never… had children before. Always worked, you see? Sales work, traveling a lot. Never really settled down. Now… now I’m thinking about it. My daughter, she's a lovely girl, wants grandchildren. I want to be… healthy enough to be a good… grandfather, if that makes sense. I’m single, always been single, really.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Verrall. It's wonderful that you’re thinking about this and want to be in good health for your family. It’s never too late to start a family, or to consider becoming a grandfather. To start, let's go over a bit of your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly over the years?
PATIENT: Regularly…? Hmm. That’s a good question. Not… not as much as I should, I suppose. Sales work, you see? Always on the road. When I was home, I’d usually just… ignore any little aches and pains. Thought they’d go away. Maybe a cold once a year, that's about it. Nothing serious, I don't think. I'm not sure I even have a regular doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s quite common with demanding careers. Alright. So, to get a better understanding of your overall health, let’s go through a review of systems. I'll ask a few questions about different parts of your body. If you've experienced anything unusual, even if it seems minor, please let me know. Let's start with your general health. Have you noticed any recent unintentional weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Weight… Hmm. I think I might have lost a little weight recently. Not much, but my trousers feel… looser than they used to. I haven’t been eating much, to be honest. Not because I’m ill, just… not hungry, I guess. Work has been stressful lately, even for me at my age. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Stress can definitely impact appetite and weight. And it’s good you’re mentioning these things. Now, have you been experiencing any fatigue or weakness lately?
PATIENT: Fatigue… yes. A bit. I get tired easily, I suppose. More tired than I used to. I always thought it was just… getting older. But now you mention it… yes, I’m tired a lot. I used to have so much energy, even with the traveling. Now I just… want to sit down after work. I do nap a bit during the day, which I never used to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Fatigue and napping are definitely things we want to investigate. Now, let's move on to other systems. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – like constipation, diarrhea, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s a bit personal, isn’t it? I… I think things have been a little… irregular, yes. Not diarrhea, not exactly. Just… not as regular as they used to be. A bit of constipation sometimes, yes. And… well, I think I might have noticed a little… blood once or twice. Just a tiny bit, after… you know. I didn't think much of it at the time. It could have been something I ate, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Verrall. It's important to discuss these things, even if they feel personal. Changes in bowel habits and any blood in the stool are important things to check out. Given this information, I would like to perform a physical examination, including listening to your abdomen, and I’d also like to order some lab tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical examination… yes, alright. And the tests… if you think it’s necessary, then yes, do what you need to do. I just want to… make sure everything is okay. For my daughter, you see. And… well, for myself, I suppose. I haven’t really been to a doctor in years, so I’m trusting your judgement.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Verrall. I appreciate your trust. Let’s start with the physical exam. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, I can do that. Is there anything I need to… do? Or just lie here?
DOCTOR: Just lie comfortably, Mr. Verrall. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I'll also take your blood pressure and pulse. I'm listening to your heart now. It sounds regular, but a little fast. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, a little. There. Right there, it's a bit tender. Not terrible, but… yes, that's where it hurts a little. And… maybe a little higher up too? It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. I’m noting some tenderness in your lower right quadrant and a bit higher up. It's not a sharp pain, but it's definitely sensitive to touch. I'm also checking your reflexes now… everything seems normal there. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated, and your pulse is 88, as I mentioned. Given the tenderness in your abdomen, the changes in your bowel habits, and the potential blood in your stool, I'm going to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a stool occult blood test, and a colonoscopy to further investigate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… a colonoscopy? That sounds… rather serious. What are you looking for exactly? And what does all that mean? The other tests, I understand, blood work, stool test… but a colonoscopy sounds… a bit frightening. I’m not a young man, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Verrall, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious about a colonoscopy. It’s a very important test, though, and often, the anxiety is worse than the procedure itself. Essentially, we're looking for any abnormalities in your colon, such as polyps, inflammation, or tumors. These can sometimes cause bleeding and changes in bowel habits. A colonoscopy allows us to visualize the entire colon and take biopsies if needed. The complete blood count will check for signs of infection or anemia. The comprehensive metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, as well as electrolyte levels. The stool occult blood test will confirm if there’s blood in your stool that we can’t see with the naked eye. Given your age and symptoms, it’s important to rule out any serious underlying causes. I want to be thorough and make sure we get a clear picture of what’s going on. Do you have any questions about the colonoscopy procedure itself?
PATIENT: A tumor… you said tumor? Is that… is that what you think it is? I haven't felt sick, not really. Just tired. And… the stomach problems. But a tumor… And the colonoscopy… what does that involve? Do they… do they cut you open? How long does it take? I’ve never had any surgery before. And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, I understand your anxiety. It's natural to be worried when you hear the word "tumor." I did mention it as a possibility, simply to be comprehensive, but it doesn't mean I believe that’s what's happening. We need to do these tests to find out what’s going on. Many things can cause the symptoms you're experiencing, and a tumor is just one possibility. As for the colonoscopy, it doesn’t involve cutting you open. It’s a minimally invasive procedure. A long, flexible tube with a camera on the end is inserted into your rectum and guided through your colon. We use sedation to make you comfortable and relaxed during the procedure, so you won't feel any pain. The procedure typically takes about 30-60 minutes. After the sedation wears off, you might feel a little bloated or have some mild cramping, but it's usually manageable. You'll need someone to drive you home afterward. I’ll give you detailed instructions on how to prepare for the colonoscopy, including a special diet and bowel preparation regimen. It's essential to follow these instructions carefully to ensure a successful procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns about any of these tests or the procedure?
PATIENT: Bowel preparation… that sounds… unpleasant. I suppose I should expect that. And someone to drive me home… my daughter can do that. She’s very good. So, you don't think it is a tumor? Just checking. And… what happens if they find something? What kind of things are we looking for exactly? Polyps… are those bad?
DOCTOR: You are right to ask these questions, Mr. Verrall. Bowel preparation isn't the most pleasant part of the process, but it's crucial for a clear view during the colonoscopy. And you are right to ask about whether I think it's a tumor. Based on the information we have so far, I’m not leaning toward a tumor. However, we can’t rule anything out without further investigation. That’s why we're doing these tests. Polyps are growths on the lining of the colon. Most polyps are benign, meaning they’re not cancerous. However, some polyps can become cancerous over time, which is why it’s important to remove them during the colonoscopy. If we find polyps, we can send them to a lab for analysis to determine if they’re cancerous or not. Other things we’re looking for include inflammation, ulcers, or any other abnormalities in the colon. I'll schedule you for a colonoscopy with a gastroenterologist I trust. They will explain the procedure in detail and answer any further questions you may have. I'll also give you a referral and all the necessary paperwork. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, that sounds… good. A gastroenterologist… someone who specializes in… the stomach. Good. I’d rather someone who knows what they’re doing. And you’ll give me the paperwork and the referral? And… instructions for the… preparation? I think I can handle that. As long as I know what to expect. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I still feel a bit worried, but… less so.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a bit. I'll have my nurse prepare a packet with all the necessary paperwork, the referral to the gastroenterologist, and detailed instructions for the bowel preparation. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results of the colonoscopy once they’re available. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about this, and I want you to know that I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before the procedure. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and… kindness. It’s good to know someone is listening. Thank you again. I suppose I should… go home now and… prepare myself. Mentally, at least.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take your time and remember to rest. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything comes to mind. My nurse will see you to the door with your paperwork. I wish you all the best with your preparation, and I’ll see you after the colonoscopy. Take care, Mr. Verrall.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye. .
