DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Wease. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s my waterworks, I suppose. They bother me. A lot. It keeps happening, and…and it’s quite unpleasant, truthfully. I don’t…I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it's been a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Waterworks” – you mean problems with urination?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. Urination. That’s a… a fancy word, isn’t it? Yes, problems with that. It feels…burning, mostly. And I have to go very often. It’s…disruptive, you understand. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Burning with urination and frequent trips to the bathroom. Has there been any blood in your urine, or any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. I… I don’t think so. It’s hard to say, really. I don't examine it closely, if you understand. And pain… sometimes my back aches, but I'm an old woman, Doctor! Everything aches. Is that what you mean? It's just…old age, probably. I don’t know if it’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, fair enough. And how about fever or chills?
PATIENT: Fever…chills… Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Not recently. I had a bit of a cold last winter, perhaps, but nothing…severe. No shivering, no feeling hot and bothered. Just…the waterworks. They are the main problem, truthfully. I just want some relief.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness. Well… no. Not for a very long time. I’m divorced, you see, and… that was many years ago. No, not at all. It’s…not relevant, is it? I just…I don't want to talk about it. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, perfectly alright. Let’s move on then. Now, can you tell me about any medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s…a difficult question. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. And…something with my blood pressure, I think? The doctor put me on a pill for it, but I don’t remember much else. It was a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things very well anymore. Is there a record here, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up your record… ah, yes. It says here you were diagnosed with hypertension approximately 10 years ago, and had a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – in 2008. Do you recall any other surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, you have it all written down! That’s… good. Helpful. No, I don’t recall anything else. Nothing major, I don’t think. A few broken bones when I was a child, but that was…ages ago. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn't what it used to be. It’s just… frustrating. I can’t seem to remember anything clearly. Are you going to help me with my waterworks? That's what I came here for.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Let’s focus on that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… the blood pressure pill, yes. A small, white one. And… sometimes I take something for my joints, when they are particularly achy. It’s… an over-the-counter thing. I can't recall the name, truthfully. I buy it at the drugstore. Is that important? I don't take it every day, only when needed. It’s just for the pain, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I've always been fairly robust, truthfully. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years without any trouble. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. I might get a bit of indigestion now and then, but that's just from eating too much, I suspect. No, I don't think I have any allergies. I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband did, bless his soul, but I always hated it. And alcohol… very rarely. A small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on special occasions. But nothing regular. Not at all. It doesn't agree with me, truthfully. Makes me feel quite unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any family history of medical conditions, such as kidney problems or bladder cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s…difficult. My mother had some sort of…trouble with her stomach, I think? And my brother had heart problems, but that was years ago. Kidney problems… bladder cancer… I don't recall anyone having that. We didn’t talk about these things much, you understand. It wasn't considered polite, perhaps. I really can't say. Sorry, Doctor. My memory is failing me. Can we get back to my waterworks now? I really want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your abdomen, and I’ll need to do a quick neurological check. Then I'd like to do a urine test, if that’s alright with you. That'll help us rule out infection.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A urine test. Very well. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want this to be over with, truthfully. It’s… tiring, having to worry about these things. Do with whatever you need to do. Please be quick, if you could.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. Your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual noises. Neurological exam is also unremarkable – reflexes are intact, and sensation is normal. Now, if you could just follow me to the restroom, and collect a urine sample in this cup… I’ll label it for the lab. It might be a bit awkward, but it’s important for figuring out what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh. The restroom. Very well. Awkward is… a good word for it. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you understand. I'll… try my best. Please give me a moment. It might take a little longer than usual.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Wease. No rush at all. I’ll be right here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: There. It’s…done. Not very much, I’m afraid. I didn't have a great deal to give. Hopefully it's enough. Is there anything else I need to do? I'm ready to go home now, if possible.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wease. This is plenty. We’ll send this off to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. While we wait for those, based on your symptoms – the burning sensation, the frequent urination, and no fever – it could be a simple urinary tract infection, or perhaps some bladder irritation. We'll see what the urine test shows. For now, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of an antibiotic, just as a precaution. It’s a common one, and usually well-tolerated. It's called Macrobid. I’ll also recommend drinking plenty of fluids – water is best – to help flush things out. Here's the prescription. Take it as directed, and finish the entire course, even if you start to feel better.
PATIENT: Oh. Antibiotics. That sounds…serious. But alright. If you think it's best, Doctor. I’ll take it. Water, you say? Yes, I can do that. Plenty of water. And then what? Do I need to come back? When? I really don’t want to be ill for long. I just want to get on with things, you understand. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week, just to check how you’re doing and see if the antibiotic is working. If your symptoms don’t improve within a couple of days, or if they get worse, please call the office right away. And if you develop a fever, or start experiencing back pain, call immediately. I'm writing down the number for the clinic here. As for the test results, my nurse will call you with the results as soon as they are in. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that…that sounds sensible. A follow-up appointment. A week. I’ll remember that. And call if it gets worse… I’ll try to remember. Nurse will call… Yes. I’ll be waiting for the phone. Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I believe… I believe that’s all for now, isn’t it? I really appreciate your help. I just want to feel better. I shall be on my way now. .
