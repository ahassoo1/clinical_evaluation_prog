DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you too. I’m here about a cruise, actually. I'm planning a trip – a rather lovely one, if I do say so myself – and the cruise line needs some… information. Medical information, that is. They sent a form. It's a bit much, honestly, and I thought it best to get a doctor to help me fill it out properly.
DOCTOR: I see. A pre-cruise medical form. Those can be quite detailed, yes. I'm happy to help you complete that accurately. To start, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Perhaps we can begin with any current medical conditions you may have?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I don’t have anything major, thankfully. My late husband, God rest his soul, he had a troublesome knee. But I… I suppose I’m fairly healthy for my age. I do get a bit of… well, not really pain, but a sort of ache in my joints sometimes, especially when the weather changes. It's just old age, I expect. Nothing that stops me from my work, mind you. I’m a merchandise displacer, you see – window trimming mostly. Keeps me on my feet, which is good, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you've noticed some joint aches, particularly with weather changes, but it doesn't interfere with your daily activities or your work as a merchandise displacer. That's good to hear. When you say “ache,” could you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, not at all. More of a… stiffness, really. And a sort of dull throbbing. It's usually in my hands and knees, and sometimes my lower back. It comes and goes, mostly when it gets damp. Like this morning, actually. A bit of a chill in the air, and I was feeling it in my fingers while I was having my tea. It eases up once I get moving, though. Like I said, it doesn’t stop me from doing anything. It’s just… there. Do you understand? It’s hard to explain sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. Stiffness and a dull throbbing in your hands, knees, and lower back, that worsens with damp weather and improves with activity. That gives me a better idea. Now, have you ever been formally diagnosed with anything like arthritis, or has a doctor ever specifically mentioned anything about the state of your joints?
PATIENT: No, never formally diagnosed with anything. I've seen doctors over the years, of course, for colds and such, but no one ever mentioned my joints specifically. My mother had some trouble with her hands when she got older, but it was just put down to “old age” again, I think. They didn’t have the fancy tests they have now back then. And to be honest, I didn’t bother to bring it up much. It wasn’t bad enough to warrant a visit, you see? I just got on with things. Is it important, Doctor? Should I have mentioned it sooner?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re bringing it up now. It’s certainly not a matter of having done something “wrong” by not mentioning it earlier. Many people manage mild symptoms on their own. However, it's helpful for me to have a complete picture of your health history, especially with your upcoming cruise. To clarify, you haven’t had any imaging – like X-rays – of your joints, and no doctor has specifically discussed arthritis or similar conditions with you?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. No X-rays, no discussions about arthritis. Just the usual check-ups over the years. I remember one doctor, Dr. MacLeod, he said my blood pressure was a bit high once, but it came down with a little less salt in my diet. That was years ago, though. And honestly, I can’t even recall the specifics anymore. It wasn’t anything serious, he assured me. Just needed to watch what I ate. Is that relevant, Doctor? I don’t want to bore you with things that aren’t important.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know, Ms. Squiers. Occasional elevated blood pressure that was managed with dietary changes is good information to have, even if it was years ago. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, thinking about other health concerns, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine, no problem. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. Though… now that I think about it, I did get a bit of a rash once, years ago, from a rose bush. But I expect that was just the thorns, really, and not an allergy. I’ve certainly never been told I have any allergies. Does that answer your question, Doctor? I’m trying to be thorough, you see.
DOCTOR: You are being very thorough, Ms. Squiers, and I appreciate it. No known allergies is good to know. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t take anything regularly. I used to take a vitamin C tablet in the winter, just to ward off colds, but I haven’t bothered with that for years. I find a good cup of tea does just as well. I believe in a healthy diet and getting plenty of rest. That’s always been my approach. I don't like to rely on pills and potions if I can avoid it. So, no, nothing at all, Doctor. Not even aspirin.
DOCTOR: Very good. No current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been hospitalized for any reason, or had any major illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… I was in hospital once, a very long time ago, when I was a teenager. It was for appendicitis. A perfectly routine operation, thankfully. I recovered very quickly. And… oh, I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was so long ago I barely remember it. Apart from that, no hospital stays, no major illnesses. I’ve always been quite robust, to be honest. I haven’t had the flu in years, and I've never had pneumonia or anything like that. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. Appendectomy as a teenager and tonsillectomy in childhood. Otherwise, no major illnesses or hospitalizations. Now, a quick question about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit tricky. My mother’s side of the family… well, they all lived to a good age, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses. My father… he died relatively young, of a heart attack, I believe. But he smoked heavily, so that wasn’t entirely unexpected. My grandmother had some trouble with her memory in her later years, but it was just put down to old age again. And my aunt… she had cancer, but that was a very long time ago. Apart from that… nothing springs to mind. They weren't a family to talk much about their ailments, you see. It was all rather hushed up. Do you think that's enough information, Doctor? I'm trying my best to recall everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. Squiers. Knowing your father had a heart attack at a relatively young age and a history of cancer in your aunt is helpful. We don’t need a complete family history, just a general overview. Now, to round things out, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, as I mentioned, I'm a merchandise displacer – window trimming mostly. Keeps me on my feet most of the day, which I enjoy. I live alone, as my husband passed away a few years ago. I don’t smoke, and I drink very little – perhaps a glass of sherry with my dinner on occasion. I enjoy gardening and reading, and I take a walk most days, weather permitting, of course. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fresh vegetables. I wouldn’t say I’m particularly active, but I keep myself busy. Is there anything specific you’d like to know, Doctor? I'm quite a simple sort, really.
DOCTOR: No, that gives me a very good picture of your lifestyle, Ms. Squiers. It sounds like you're quite active and maintain a healthy routine, despite your loss. Alright, to summarize, you've reported joint aches, but no formal diagnosis of arthritis, no current medications or allergies, a history of appendectomy and tonsillectomy, a family history of heart attack and cancer, and a healthy lifestyle. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to assess your joints and overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be perfectly alright, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgement entirely. I wouldn’t want to be a bother, though. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Should I change clothes, perhaps?
DOCTOR: No need to change clothes, Ms. Squiers. Just relax on the examination table, and we’ll begin. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then I’ll gently examine your joints – hands, knees, and back – to check for any swelling or tenderness. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, if you could just bend your fingers for me… and can you rotate your wrists?
PATIENT: There’s a bit of stiffness, Doctor. Especially in my right wrist. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… a bit creaky. Like an old door, I suppose. And my knuckles are a bit swollen, if you look closely. It's worse on this hand, too. I do most of my work with this hand, you see. Lots of small movements, arranging things, tying ribbons… it must be the strain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see some mild swelling in your knuckles, particularly on the right hand, and I can feel a bit of crepitus – that's the creaking sound – as you move your fingers. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, let’s check your knees. Could you sit on the edge of the table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: There we are. I hope I’m not being a bother, Doctor. It's just a bit awkward, you see. I don't usually sit with my legs like this.
DOCTOR: No, you're not a bother at all, Ms. Squiers. It's perfectly normal to feel a bit awkward. Your knees have a full range of motion, but I do note a small amount of tenderness on the inner aspect of both knees when I apply pressure. Your lower back appears straight, and there’s no tenderness to palpation. Alright, Ms. Squiers, based on our conversation and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have some mild osteoarthritis, particularly in your hands and knees. This is a common condition, especially with age and with repetitive hand movements, as you’ve described with your work. It’s characterized by stiffness, aches, and some swelling in the affected joints. It doesn’t seem to be severe at this point.
PATIENT: Osteoarthritis, you say? That sounds… rather official. Is it something to worry about, Doctor? Will I be needing pills and potions after all? I was hoping to avoid all that, if possible. I’ve heard some of those medications can have… unpleasant side effects. And will it stop me from continuing my work? I do enjoy what I do, you see. I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't arrange my lovely displays.
DOCTOR: It’s good you asked, Ms. Squiers. Osteoarthritis is very common, and in your case, it appears to be mild. It's not something to be overly worried about, especially since it’s not significantly interfering with your daily activities. Regarding pills and potions, not necessarily. We can start with more conservative measures. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed for any discomfort, and regular gentle exercise to maintain your range of motion. Heat or cold packs can also be helpful. We can also discuss some simple hand exercises and strategies to minimize strain at work. For many people, these measures are enough to manage the symptoms effectively. We can certainly discuss prescription medications if the over-the-counter options aren't providing enough relief, but let’s try the conservative approach first. As for your work, it doesn't necessarily mean you'll have to stop. We can focus on modifying your techniques to minimize strain and protect your joints. Would you like me to show you some of those exercises now?
PATIENT: That sounds… very sensible, Doctor. I think I’d prefer to avoid the pills if possible. And yes, please, I’d be very grateful if you could show me some exercises. And perhaps some tips on modifying my techniques at work? I’m always willing to learn new things, you see. I want to keep arranging my displays for as long as possible. And is there anything else I should be doing? Diet, perhaps? Or anything I should be avoiding? I do like my sherry with my dinner, you see…
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. Let’s start with these exercises. Make a gentle fist, then slowly open your hand, spreading your fingers wide. Repeat this ten times. Then, bend each finger individually, holding for a few seconds. These exercises help maintain flexibility and range of motion. And you can do them several times a day, especially before and after work. As for work techniques, try to use your whole arm when reaching for things, rather than just your wrist. And take frequent breaks to stretch your hands and wrists. Avoid gripping things too tightly for extended periods. Regarding diet, there’s no specific diet for osteoarthritis, but maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce stress on your joints. And a diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods – like fruits, vegetables, and fatty fish – may be beneficial. As for your sherry… in moderation, it shouldn't be a problem. Excessive alcohol consumption can worsen inflammation, but a glass with dinner is unlikely to cause any harm. Do you have any questions about the exercises or any of the advice I’ve given you?
PATIENT: These are… a bit awkward, Doctor. My fingers feel quite stiff. But I shall persevere. And I shall try to remember to use my whole arm, and take more breaks. It’s easy to get carried away when I’m arranging a particularly lovely display, you see. And yes, I think I understand everything. Perhaps I could have a written copy of these exercises, just to be sure? And perhaps a little note about the anti-inflammatory foods? I do like to be organized. And… one last question, Doctor. Is this something that will get worse over time? Will I eventually need a wheelchair, or something dreadful like that? I do hope not.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. I’m happy to provide you with a written copy of the exercises and a list of anti-inflammatory foods. Here you go. Now, regarding your question about the progression of osteoarthritis, it’s difficult to predict with certainty. For many people, it progresses very slowly, and they are able to manage the symptoms effectively with conservative measures. It's unlikely you'll need a wheelchair or anything dreadful like that. However, it’s important to be proactive and continue with the exercises and maintain a healthy lifestyle. We’ll monitor your condition regularly, and if the symptoms worsen, we can discuss other options, such as prescription medications or physical therapy. For now, let’s focus on these conservative measures and see how you do. Do you have any other concerns or questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and helpful. And you’ve put my mind at ease, which is a great deal. I shall follow your instructions carefully, and I shall come back and see you if anything changes. And… thank you again for explaining everything so clearly. I do appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I shall go and arrange some lovely flowers. It always cheers me up. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Squiers. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. And enjoy arranging your flowers! Have a wonderful day, and remember to take care.
