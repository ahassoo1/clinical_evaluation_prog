DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's... well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been giving me trouble. And my head… it spins sometimes. It’s hard to explain, really. It comes and goes. My daughter, she said I should come get it checked out. She worries, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, ears and dizziness. That’s good of your daughter to encourage you to come in. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. When did you first start noticing the trouble with your ears and the dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. It feels like... a while now. Not all at once, you understand? Little bits here and there. Maybe… six months ago? Or was it longer? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. It’s not constant, which is why I didn't rush in right away. And my memory isn't what it used to be, sadly. It just… happens suddenly sometimes. Like a switch flips. Then it’s gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been coming and going for about six months, not constant. And you mentioned it feels sudden, like a switch. That’s helpful. Can you describe what the dizziness feels like when it happens?
PATIENT: Well… everything just spins. Not like being sick, exactly. More like… the room is tilting. And I have to hold onto something, or I’d fall. It doesn't last long, usually. A few minutes, maybe? But it's frightening when it happens. Makes me feel very unsteady. And sometimes, with the spinning, my ear will feel… full? Like there’s pressure. Or… quiet. Like it’s blocked.
DOCTOR: Okay, spinning sensation, room tilting, lasts a few minutes, and you sometimes experience a feeling of fullness or blockage in your ear with it. Do you notice any ringing in your ears along with that, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Hmm. That's a good question. I… I don't know. I hear things sometimes, of course. Living near the road, there’s always noise. But a ringing in my ear… I don’t specifically remember. Maybe? It’s hard to tell what’s just the everyday sounds, and what’s… something else. I suppose it’s possible. I wouldn't know for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s move on to other things then. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting with these episodes of dizziness?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. Not at all. Just the spinning, and the feeling unsteady. That's it. Never any vomiting or anything like that. It’s just… unpleasant, mostly. And worrying, because I don't know why it happens. It’s a bit scary, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any issues with your hearing recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That's part of it too. Sometimes… my hearing just goes. Like someone turned down the volume. It's not all the time, but it happens. Usually in one ear, I think. And it comes back, eventually. But it's… concerning, you know? It makes it hard to hear people sometimes. Especially my grandkids. I hate missing what they say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fluctuating hearing loss, more noticeable in one ear. And it does return. Now, have you ever had any problems with infections, like ear infections, sinus infections, or any other kind of infection?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. As a child, yes, I had ear infections. Lots of them, my mother said. But not as an adult. Not for a very long time. Maybe a sinus infection once or twice, but nothing serious. Nothing that needed a lot of medicine or anything. It was so long ago, it's hard to remember the details. It’s been many, many years.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor gave me for my blood pressure. A little white pill. I take one every morning. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take something for that too, but not every day. That's it, I think. Oh, and a vitamin D supplement. My daughter says I need it. She’s very good at looking after me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things. And I haven't had any trouble with medicines. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Though, maybe I should ask my daughter, just to be sure? She remembers things better than I do these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he used to smoke, but I always made him go outside. It’s a bad habit, you know? Very bad for your health. I always told him that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Thank you for that information. Now, I’m going to do a quick examination of your ears, and check your balance and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to find out what’s causing all this. It’s just… unsettling, not knowing. Please be gentle, if you would. My balance isn’t the best, as you can probably tell.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s take a look in your ears. Please look straight ahead. Okay. A little cerumen buildup, but nothing significant. Hmm. A little redness behind the eardrum on this side. Nothing alarming, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to check your hearing with a tuning fork. I'll tap it gently and place it on the bone behind your ear. Please tell me when you can no longer hear the sound. Okay. Weber test is normal. Rinne test… slightly diminished on the right side. Finally, I’m going to have you stand and close your eyes. I’ll gently push you off balance to check your equilibrium. Okay. A little unsteady, but not significantly. Gait is stable. Based on the exam, you have some mild hearing loss in your right ear, and some mild difficulty with balance. The redness in your right ear is something to watch. Given your symptoms of dizziness, fluctuating hearing, and the exam findings, I suspect you might be experiencing some form of inner ear disturbance. It could be something as simple as fluid buildup, or it could be a bit more complex. I want to order a tympanometry test and an audiogram to get a better picture of your hearing, and possibly an MRI to rule out any other underlying causes. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot of information. Fluid… and an MRI? That sounds… serious. I just want to feel normal again. Is it something… bad, Doctor? I don’t want anything… serious. An MRI sounds frightening. What are we looking for, exactly? And… is it going to hurt? I don't like being poked and prodded, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Mayhugh. It sounds like a lot, and I apologize for that. But it’s important to rule things out and get a clear diagnosis. An MRI is a very safe procedure, and it doesn’t involve any poking or prodding. You'll simply lie on a table while a machine takes images of your head. It's a little noisy, and you need to lie very still, but it doesn't hurt at all. We're looking for anything that might be causing your symptoms – fluid in the inner ear, any abnormalities in the nerves responsible for hearing and balance, or anything else that could be contributing to your dizziness and hearing loss. Most likely, it’s something benign – a fluid imbalance, or perhaps age-related changes in the inner ear. The tympanometry test is a simple test that measures how well your eardrum moves, and the audiogram is a hearing test that will tell us exactly how well you're hearing different sounds. Both are painless. I want to be thorough, and it’s always better to know exactly what we’re dealing with. Would you like me to explain each test in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you say it's usually nothing serious, that’s… reassuring. And no poking, you say? Yes, please. Explain the tests again, if you don’t mind. Slowly. I get confused easily, as you’ve probably noticed. Especially when it’s… medical talk. And… will the results be quick? I hate waiting, if I'm honest. Especially when I'm feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Mayhugh. No problem at all. Let’s start with the tympanometry test. Imagine your eardrum like a drumhead. This test sends a little puff of air into your ear and measures how well your eardrum moves in response to that puff. It helps us see if there’s any fluid or blockage in your middle ear that might be affecting your hearing. It takes just a few minutes and doesn't hurt at all. Next is the audiogram, which is a hearing test. You’ll wear headphones, and we’ll play different sounds at different pitches and volumes. You’ll raise your hand whenever you hear a sound. This test tells us exactly how well you're hearing at different frequencies. It takes about 20-30 minutes. Finally, the MRI. As I mentioned, it uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your head. It’s completely painless, but you need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable and provide you with earplugs to reduce the noise. As for the results… the tympanometry and audiogram results should be available within a few hours. The MRI results will take a little longer – usually 1-2 business days – as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. I will personally call you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them in detail. Does that make sense, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… much clearer. A puff of air, sounds in headphones, and a quiet machine. And you’ll call me with the results? That's good. I don't like waiting, but knowing you'll call… that helps. One to two days… I can manage that, I suppose. What if… what if it is something bad, Doctor? What if it needs… surgery? Or something else frightening?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Mayhugh, and it’s good you’re asking. It's important to be prepared for all possibilities, but I want to emphasize that the vast majority of cases like yours are not serious. If the tests reveal something that requires further intervention – whether it’s medication, physical therapy, or, in rare cases, surgery – we’ll discuss all your options thoroughly and make a decision together. I will explain everything in detail, answer all your questions, and ensure you feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. We'll start with the least invasive options first, and only consider more aggressive treatments if absolutely necessary. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and gathering more information. Worrying about “what ifs” won’t help, and we don’t have enough information yet to make any definitive conclusions. I’m here to support you through this process, Ms. Mayhugh, and we’ll face whatever comes together. Now, would you like me to schedule those tests for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Schedule the tests. Anything to get this sorted out. The sooner it’s done, the better. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so patiently. And for not making me feel… foolish. I get so confused easily, as you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. It's my job to make sure you understand everything and feel comfortable. And please, never hesitate to ask questions, no matter how small they may seem. Okay, I’m scheduling the tympanometry and audiogram for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. They can be done here in the clinic. And I’ll get the MRI scheduled for next week. We'll need to get pre-authorization from your insurance, so I'll have my staff contact you with the details. They’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the MRI. Do you have any questions about the scheduling or the tests themselves at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all right. Tomorrow morning… and the staff will call about the MRI. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel… a little better now. Knowing what to expect… that helps a lot. I think that's everything for today. I just want to go home and rest. I'm rather tired now.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. Rest is a very good idea. I’ll see you tomorrow morning for the hearing tests. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good rest of your day, and I’ll see you tomorrow. .
PATIENT: .
