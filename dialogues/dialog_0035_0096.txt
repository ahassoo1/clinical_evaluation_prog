DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this light, you see. Seems like I'm getting really bothered by it lately. Like, much more than I used to. It’s making things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, “bothered by light”… can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, where to start? It's not just bright sunlight, though that’s bad. Even things like, you know, the fluorescent lights in the grocery store… they really hurt my eyes. And I've noticed I'm squinting a lot more, even indoors. It’s gotten worse over the last few months, definitely. It feels like a sharp pain sometimes, behind my eyes. Not all the time, but often enough to be annoying, and now… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not just sunlight, but also indoor lights – fluorescent lights specifically seem to be a problem. And you’re experiencing squinting and sharp pain behind your eyes, which has been increasing over the last few months. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. It’s not always there. Like, when I wake up in the morning, I'm usually okay. But after being out and about, or even just working under the lights at the clinic for a few hours… that’s when it starts. And it’s worse on really bright days, of course. It's not a throbbing pain, more like… a burning, stabbing feeling, right behind my eyes. It lasts for a while, then fades, then comes back. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Burning, stabbing pain behind the eyes, triggered by light exposure, and worsening throughout the day. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I guess. And… this might sound strange, but my eyes feel dry a lot. I'm blinking more, trying to keep them wet. I also think my vision's been a little blurry sometimes, but I thought that was just from staring at screens all day, you know, at work. It’s hard to say for sure if that’s connected, though. And, I haven’t really told anyone this, but… sometimes I see little spots floating around, like dust motes, but they don't go away when I blink. They’re small, but they're there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so along with the light sensitivity and pain, you’ve noticed increased fatigue, dry eyes, some blurry vision, and these floaters you’re seeing. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I was pretty healthy, to be honest. Just the usual childhood things, you know, colds and the flu. Nothing serious. My wife… she had high blood pressure, but that was her, not me. I’ve been to the dentist regularly, of course – that’s my job! – but never anything major wrong with me. Oh, and I wear glasses for reading, just in the last couple of years. Nothing too strong. And I’m on Medicare now, since… well, since my wife passed. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. No significant medical history, just occasional colds and the flu, reading glasses recently, and you're covered by Medicare. And I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was a few years ago now. As for surgeries or hospital stays… no, never. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football, but it wasn’t a bad break, just a cast for a few weeks. Other than that… nothing. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. I try to eat healthy and get enough sleep when I can, even if it’s tough sometimes. Do you need to know about vaccinations or anything like that? I think I'm up-to-date, but I don't have the records handy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations, broken arm as a child, generally healthy, and you believe your vaccinations are current. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had glaucoma, I think. She needed eye drops for it for years. And my father… he had diabetes, but that was later in life. He didn’t take care of himself very well, to be honest. My wife’s side… her mother had arthritis, and her brother had something with his heart, but I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about it much. I don't think anything else major… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, glaucoma in your mother, diabetes in your father, and arthritis and heart issues on your wife’s side. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped after my wife passed. Didn’t seem right, you know? And definitely no drugs. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. I like to garden, spend time with my grandkids when I can, and go to church on Sundays. That’s about it. I work long hours at the clinic, so I don't have much time for anything else, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs, and a fairly active social life with gardening, grandchildren, and church. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I've never had a problem with bug bites or anything like that. My wife was allergic to penicillin, but that's her, not me. I've never had to worry about carrying an EpiPen or anything like that. So, no, no allergies. I'm pretty lucky that way, too. I think I’ve told you everything I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Thank you for that thorough history, Arbin. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your vision, your pupils, and look at the back of your eyes. It shouldn’t take too long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I’m ready when you are. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my eyes. This light is really starting to bother me, and it’s making it hard to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking at your pupils, they react normally to light. Now, I’m going to look in the back of your eyes… Hmm. Okay. I see some mild optic disc cupping in both eyes, which can be normal, but we'll need to monitor it. Your retinas look clear, no bleeding or swelling. I also see some drusen, small deposits under the retina, which is common with age, but again, we'll keep an eye on those. Your vision is 20/30 in both eyes, which is slightly reduced, but consistent with needing reading glasses. Now, I'm going to check your eye movements and your peripheral vision… Okay, your eye movements are full and smooth. Peripheral vision is a little constricted, but not dramatically. Overall, everything looks relatively normal, but I do want to run a couple of tests just to be sure. I'd like to order a visual field test, and an Optical Coherence Tomography, or OCT, scan of your retina. This will give us a more detailed picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… complicated, but alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever tests you need. “Visual field test” and… “OCT scan.” I’ll try to remember those. So, these tests will show you more about my eyes, and what’s causing this light sensitivity? And the blurry vision? It’s just… frustrating, you know? Makes it hard to do my job properly. So, yes, let’s do the tests. When can I get them done?
DOCTOR: Yes, these tests will give us a much more detailed look at your retina and your optic nerve, and will help me determine the cause of your light sensitivity and blurry vision. Okay, I’m scheduling you for a visual field test and an OCT scan at the imaging center across the street. They can get you in tomorrow at 10 am. I’ll also send the results to my office, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them next week. In the meantime, I recommend wearing sunglasses whenever you’re outdoors, and trying to avoid bright fluorescent lights as much as possible. Given your symptoms, and the slight constriction in your peripheral vision, I'm also going to prescribe you a mild anti-inflammatory eye drop to try and reduce any inflammation, and see if that helps with the light sensitivity. It's not a definitive treatment, but it may provide some relief. I’ll also give you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Chen, an ophthalmologist, just in case we need a specialist opinion. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay, tomorrow at 10 am… got it. Sunglasses and avoid bright lights… I can do that. Anti-inflammatory eye drops… alright. And a referral to… Dr. Chen. That’s a lot of information, Doctor! So, just to make sure I understand… the tests will tell you more, the eye drops might help, and I see Dr. Chen if the tests show something serious? Is that right? And what could it be? I don't want to jump to conclusions, but… you mentioned my peripheral vision being a bit constricted. Is that something to worry about? I know you don't want to scare me, but I'd rather know.
DOCTOR: Yes, you've got it exactly right. Tests to get more information, eye drops for potential relief, and Dr. Chen as a specialist if needed. You’re right to ask about your peripheral vision. Constriction can be caused by many things, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. It could be normal variation, or related to your blood pressure, or even the aging process. However, it’s important to investigate, which is why I’m ordering the visual field test. We need to get a baseline measurement. The eye drops are just to see if reducing inflammation provides any symptom relief. We’re ruling things out. Potential causes for your symptoms could include age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, or even optic neuritis, but these are just possibilities. The tests will help me narrow down the diagnosis and create a proper treatment plan. I don’t want to worry you unnecessarily, and it’s far too early to jump to any conclusions. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes… a little more sense. One step at a time. That's good. Age-related macular degeneration… glaucoma… optic neuritis… I’ll have to look those up later. You're right, I shouldn’t worry yet. No, I think that's all for now, Doctor. Just the tests tomorrow, try to avoid bright lights, and try the eye drops. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s a lot to take in, but I feel a little better knowing we're getting it checked out. I appreciate you not scaring me unnecessarily, and taking the time to explain everything. And thank you for the referral to Dr. Chen, just in case. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests tomorrow? Or anything else I should know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. For the visual field test, try to get a good night’s sleep tonight, and wear your glasses or contacts if you normally do. You’ll be looking into a machine, and focusing on lights, so it’s important to have clear vision. No special preparation is needed for the OCT scan – it’s a non-invasive imaging test. I’ve included written instructions on both tests, as well as the prescription for the eye drops. Here’s also Dr. Chen’s contact information. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions before tomorrow. We'll get to the bottom of this. If your symptoms worsen significantly before your appointment tomorrow, or if you experience any sudden vision loss, please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, see you tomorrow at 10 am. Have a good rest of your day, Arbin.
PATIENT: Okay, good to know. Rest, glasses, and the prescription… got it. And emergency room if anything gets worse. I will remember that. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. You've been very helpful. I appreciate your time and patience. Have a good day too, and I’ll see you tomorrow.
