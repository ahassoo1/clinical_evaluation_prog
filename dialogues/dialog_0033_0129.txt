DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this… stuff. You know, when I… go to the bathroom. It’s black. Like tar. And I take those pain pills, the ones Dr. Henderson prescribed for my arthritis, every day. Been taking 'em for years, and now this starts. It's probably those pills, isn't it? It has to be. Don't tell me it's somethin' serious. I haven't got time for serious.
DOCTOR: Black stools… right. And you’re taking pain medication for arthritis, prescribed by Dr. Henderson. For how long, exactly, have you been noticing this… tar-like stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. It started… well, maybe a week? A little over? It wasn't right away when I started the pills again after that fall last month, but it's definitely been a week, at least. And it's consistent, you know? Not just once. Every time. Honestly, it's disgusting. I just want to know if I need to stop taking the pills. I can barely get around with them, let alone without.
DOCTOR: A week of consistent black stools… okay. And you said you recently restarted these pain medications after a fall?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Tripped over that silly rug in the hallway. Broke my wrist, thankfully Dr. Henderson fixed it right up. He gave me a new prescription of the same pills when the old one ran out, after the cast came off. Honestly, I don’t see what the big deal is. People take pain pills all the time, don’t they? It can’t be that serious, this… stool thing. I just want a quick answer and to get on with my day. I have canning to do, you know. Peaches are ripe.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, black stools can indicate bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which is something we need to investigate. It doesn't automatically mean it is bleeding, but it's a concerning symptom. I understand you’re eager to get back to your canning, Ms. Hatchard, but we need to rule out anything serious. I’m going to need to ask you a few more questions, and then I'll need to do a brief physical exam. Then we’ll likely need some bloodwork. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Bloodwork?! Honestly, Doctor, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. A little black stool and suddenly it's bloodwork? I'm 73 years old! Things happen! I don’t have time for a bunch of tests. Is there anything else I should know? Maybe it's just somethin' I ate? I had beets last week, maybe that’s it? Look, I’m telling you, it’s probably those pills. Just tell me if I need to stop takin' them or not! This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, I understand your frustration, but I am obligated to investigate this properly. While beets can sometimes cause discoloration, they usually present as a more reddish hue. And attributing this solely to the pain medication without proper investigation would be… irresponsible. I’m not dismissing your concerns, but black, tarry stools are a significant symptom. Now, let's try to be systematic. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or weakness alongside this change in stool color?
PATIENT: Weakness, maybe? I get tired easily, but I'm 73! What do you expect? No, no nausea, no vomiting, and the stomach… it feels a bit… achy sometimes, but that’s probably just from bending over the garden, you know? Honestly, this is just a waste of my time. And yours, probably. I just want a simple answer! Is it the pills, yes or no? If it's the pills, I'll stop taking 'em. If it’s not the pills… well, I don't even want to think about that.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no nausea, no vomiting, occasional mild abdominal discomfort. And fatigue, which you attribute to your age. I still need to perform a quick abdominal exam, Ms. Hatchard. It will only take a moment, and it will help me determine if there’s any tenderness or other abnormalities. Then, we will discuss next steps. And, I'm going to order a complete blood count, regardless. It's standard procedure. It's… prudent. Can we agree on that?
PATIENT: Fine! Whatever. Just get it over with. I have peaches waiting. And don't expect me to be happy about all this fuss over a little bit of… stool. Honestly, doctors these days. All tests, no common sense. But do it quickly, please. The quicker this is over, the better. Just... try not to poke too much. It's sensitive, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I’ll be gentle. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen, and then I'll palpate it lightly. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. Okay. I'm noting some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. No masses palpable. Bowel sounds are present, though a little sluggish. I'll need to check your vital signs as well. Blood pressure, pulse… Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 78. Slightly elevated, but not concerning given your… frustration.
PATIENT: See? Nothing. Just like I said. Everything's fine. Now can we be done? Honestly, Doctor, you’re makin' me anxious. All this poking and prodding… I need to go home and check on my canning. The peaches won’t wait. Just tell me what you’re gonna do about the pills. Are they the problem or aren't they? It’s a simple question! I swear, if you tell me I need a colonoscopy… I’m leaving. Right now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, I understand your anxiety, but I cannot provide a definitive answer without further investigation. While the physical exam doesn't reveal anything immediately alarming, it doesn't rule out a cause for the black stools. I need to review your bloodwork results. And, frankly, given your age and the symptom you're presenting, a colonoscopy is a reasonable consideration, but we can discuss that after we see the bloodwork. I will order a complete blood count and a stool occult blood test. These tests will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to temporarily discontinue the pain medication. Let’s see if the stool color changes. I also recommend a high-fiber diet and adequate hydration. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! No pain pills. Happy now? And a colonoscopy?! Absolutely not! I’ve lived 73 years without one, I’ll manage another few without sticking a camera where the sun don’t shine. Allergies? No, nothing special. Maybe dust, a little. But that's it. Just… get the tests done quickly. And tell me if those pills were the problem. That’s all I want to know. Honestly, it's probably just a bad batch. They make mistakes all the time, you know. Just… hurry up. I’m wasting a perfectly good canning day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I’ve ordered the bloodwork and stool occult blood test. The lab results should be available within 48-72 hours. My nurse will call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Until then, discontinue the pain medication, maintain a high-fiber diet, and stay hydrated. If you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, dizziness, vomiting blood – please go to the emergency room immediately. I will need to see you again once the results are in to discuss next steps. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, whatever. 48-72 hours. Just make sure your nurse calls! And don’t even mention that colonoscopy again. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of my time. Goodbye, Doctor. And try to be quicker next time. .
