DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it's about my patient, Mrs. Henderson. She’s been on warfarin for, oh, I don’t know, nearly five years now, and she’s started bruising… easily. It’s… concerning. I mean, she’s a very active woman, usually, and now she's got these… marks all over. It's really quite bothersome, and frankly, I’ve seen patients with less medication show more stability.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Farson. Bruising easily with warfarin use is definitely something we need to investigate. Five years on the same dose… that does warrant a closer look. To start, could you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Well, they just… appeared. She didn't recall any specific injuries. Nothing like a fall or bumping into furniture. Just… a mark here, a mark there. Mostly on her arms, I think, and her legs. Not huge, mind you, but noticeable. She's usually very meticulous about keeping track of things, so she'd know if she'd hit something. She's a bit of a worrier, admittedly, but generally reliable. She says they don’t hurt particularly, just… are. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. No associated pain and appearing spontaneously is concerning. It sounds like she's a good observer, which is excellent. Let’s get some more detail. Has she noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… she mentioned being a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But she's getting on, isn’t she? Seventy-eight. So… one would expect some fatigue. And she's been complaining of a little… nosebleeds. Nothing major, just a spot here and there. She usually just presses it and it stops. But… now that I think about it, it has been more frequent than normal. Though, again, she is prone to them.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and increased frequency of nosebleeds… that adds to my concern. We’re definitely going to want to look into this carefully. To get a clearer picture, let's talk a bit about her medical history. Do you have access to her electronic health record here, or would you like me to start from scratch with her past medical issues?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I have access. Though, to be frank, the system is… less than ideal. I find it often requires scrolling through far too much information to find what one needs. But yes, I can access it. I've got it right here on my tablet. Give me a moment…
DOCTOR: Perfect. Take your time. While you’re looking that up, could you tell me what dose of warfarin she's currently on, and how often she has her INR checked?
PATIENT: Right, let’s see… she’s on 5 milligrams daily. It's been stable for… well, as I said, almost five years. Her INR… ah, here we are. She has it checked every three months, religiously. Last check, a week ago, it was 2.1. Within the therapeutic range, technically, but… on the lower end, I’d say. She's always been a bit sensitive to dosage adjustments.
DOCTOR: Okay, 5 milligrams daily, INR 2.1 a week ago… that's helpful. A lower end INR with spontaneous bruising and nosebleeds… that doesn't add up. It suggests something else might be going on. Let me take a quick look at her record here. I’m particularly interested in any recent lab work beyond the INR – complete blood count, any liver function tests… and a medication list, just to confirm everything.
PATIENT: Yes, good. The medication list is important. She takes… let me see… hydrochlorothiazide for her blood pressure, a baby aspirin daily – she’s always been quite insistent on that, despite my reservations, and… oh, and she started taking a new supplement a few months ago. Something for joint pain… glucosamine and chondroitin, I believe. She read about it in one of those… magazines. I didn’t think much of it at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, hydrochlorothiazide, baby aspirin, and glucosamine/chondroitin… that supplement is very relevant, thank you for pointing that out. Both aspirin and glucosamine can have blood-thinning effects and potentially interact with warfarin. Hmm… looking at her recent CBC, her platelet count is slightly low, 135,000. The normal range here is 150,000 to 400,000. Not drastically low, but worth noting. Her liver function tests are normal, thankfully.
PATIENT: A low platelet count… that is concerning. I hadn't noticed that on the printout. She’s never had any bleeding disorders, to my knowledge. No easy bruising in her childhood, no prolonged bleeding after surgeries… Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite uneasy about this. I'm not convinced it's just the warfarin.
DOCTOR: I agree, Mr. Farson. A slightly low platelet count combined with the spontaneous bruising, nosebleeds, and warfarin use… we definitely need to investigate further. My initial thought is to consider a few possibilities: medication interactions, a possible bleeding disorder we hadn’t previously identified, or even a rare condition affecting her platelets. To be thorough, I recommend we hold the warfarin temporarily—obviously, we’ll discuss appropriate bridging therapy—and order a complete blood workup, including a peripheral blood smear, coagulation studies beyond the INR, and possibly a consultation with a hematologist. Would you be comfortable managing the initial hold and bridging, or would you prefer I arrange that directly?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… prudent. A hold on the warfarin is definitely the right course of action. And a hematology consult… absolutely. I am perfectly capable of managing the initial hold and discussing bridging therapy with Mrs. Henderson. I'm familiar with the protocol. Honestly, the thought of leaving it to chance... well, it doesn't sit well. I'll discuss it with her immediately and arrange the blood work.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad to hear you're comfortable with that. It’s good to know you’re familiar with the bridging protocol. And I agree – a proactive approach is always best in these situations. Just to document, we’ll hold the warfarin, initiate a full blood workup, and schedule a hematology consult. Let me give you the contact information for the hematologist I recommend. Dr. Anya Sharma. She's excellent. I’d like to see Mrs. Henderson back in a week to review the results and discuss the hematology consult findings. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, a week sounds reasonable. I’ll have her schedule an appointment immediately. Dr. Sharma… good, I’ve heard positive things about her. Thank you, Doctor Asami. I must admit, I was rather… perplexed by this case. I appreciate your thoroughness and guidance. I'll inform you of any developments.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. I’m glad I could help. It’s always better to be cautious when dealing with bleeding concerns. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if anything unexpected arises before our follow-up appointment. I’m here to support you and Mrs. Henderson. Let’s get this sorted out for her. Have a good day, Mr. Farson.
PATIENT: You as well, Doctor. And thank you again. .
