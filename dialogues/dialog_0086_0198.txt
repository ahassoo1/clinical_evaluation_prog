DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I've been thinking… I work a pretty physical job, out on the tracks, you know? Signal and switch repairs. It's good work, I enjoy it, but it can be… stressful sometimes. I was hoping to talk about maybe learning some mindfulness or meditation. I keep hearing it can help with stress and focus, and I thought I’d see if you had any thoughts or suggestions.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness, hmm. Well, it's...certainly a trend. While I appreciate you being proactive about your well-being, Ms. Sugino, before we delve into stress reduction techniques, I’d like to understand if there are any physical symptoms accompanying this stress. Are you experiencing headaches, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, perhaps changes in appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, good point. I hadn't really thought to connect it to physical things, just feeling… frazzled. Let me see… the fatigue, definitely. After a long day on the tracks, I’m exhausted, more so than I used to be. And, yes, I’ve been having trouble sleeping. Not every night, but often I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep for a while. My appetite… I think that’s okay. Maybe a little less than usual, but nothing major. No headaches, thankfully. I do get aches and pains from the work, but that's just part of the job, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and disrupted sleep. We need to rule out any underlying medical causes for those symptoms before we attribute it solely to stress. Do you have any history of, say, anemia, thyroid issues, or sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… my family doctor back in Bulgaria, she ran some tests years ago, maybe ten or fifteen years back? I don’t remember exactly what for, but she said everything was normal. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly since I moved here, to be honest. I feel pretty healthy otherwise. I don’t think I have any of those… what was it? Anemia… I don’t feel weak. And I don't snore, so I guess not sleep apnea? I really don’t know much about those things, sorry. I just assumed I was tired from work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it’s good you’ve been generally healthy, but “years ago” is… not particularly helpful. We’ll need some updated blood work, at least, to check for things like iron deficiency, vitamin D levels, and thyroid function. And given your weight and age, we should also rule out any early signs of diabetes. It's standard procedure, Ms. Sugino. It's best to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes perfect sense, I understand. Thorough is good! I don’t think I have any allergies, no. Nothing I know of, anyway. I've taken antibiotics a few times over the years, and painkillers for aches from work, and never had a reaction. I’m pretty sure. Wait… once, when I was a little girl, I got a rash after eating strawberries, but I don’t think I’ve had them in decades. It was a long time ago. Does that count?
DOCTOR: A childhood rash... okay. We’ll note “possible strawberry allergy, remote history”. Alright, Ms. Sugino, let's get these blood tests ordered. I’ll have the nurse draw them now. After we have the results – and we will have results – we can discuss your stress levels more effectively and consider if mindfulness techniques would be beneficial. In the meantime, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, regularly?
PATIENT: No, nothing regularly. Just ibuprofen when my muscles are really sore from work, maybe once or twice a week, sometimes not even that. I try to stretch a lot and avoid taking anything if I can. My grandmother always said, “Medicine is for when you have to, not for when you want to.” She was a very strong woman.
DOCTOR: Very well. Ibuprofen as needed. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. We'll get those results back as quickly as possible, usually within a few days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once they're available to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any significant changes in your symptoms – say, severe fatigue, chest pain, or difficulty breathing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand perfectly. Significant changes, go to the emergency room. Thank you, Doctor. That sounds good. I appreciate you being thorough, and I’ll try to remember everything you said. I’m a little nervous about the blood draw, I’m not the best with needles, but I’ll manage. Hopefully it won’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse is quite skilled; it shouldn’t be too unpleasant. We’ll get through this. Just try to relax, Ms. Sugino. And please, if you start to feel faint or unwell during the blood draw, tell the nurse immediately. We don’t want any complications. I’ll see you again once the results are in. The nurse should be with you any moment now.
PATIENT: Okay, I will. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I'll try to stay calm. I'm sure it will be alright. .
