DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. My husband insisted, you see. He worries so. New to the area, and he wants all the proper…visits done. Social, he called it. I feel perfectly fine, thank you very much. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: “Social visit,” right. Well, a check-up is never a bad idea, even if you’re feeling well. It’s good your husband is so attentive. Let's start with a little bit of background, then. Do you have any particular concerns at all – anything, even if it seems minor – that he may have mentioned?
PATIENT: Concerns? Really. The man exaggerates everything. He probably told you I can’t remember my own name. It’s simply that things…fade, you know? As one gets older. It’s not a concern, it’s…natural. I suppose he worries about my balance. I haven’t fallen, not recently, but…well, he's a worrier.
DOCTOR: Right. “Things fade.” And balance being a concern… I see. Has this been a gradual change, or something more sudden?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Sudden? Gradual? Doctor, I haven’t kept a log of my memory lapses, you understand. It just…happens. One minute I recall something perfectly, the next…poof. Like smoke. Honestly, it’s quite irritating, but not something to bother a perfectly good doctor with. I assure you, I’m perfectly capable of managing.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's helpful to know, even if it's vague. We can certainly try to get a better understanding. Let’s try a few simple questions, if you don’t mind. Just to get a baseline. Do you know what today’s date is?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Really? Do you expect me to keep a calendar glued to my forehead? Honestly. It's... August. Isn't it? Or is it July? My husband handles all of that. I simply don't bother with dates. It's quite unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's fine. Let’s move on then. Do you happen to know where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where are we? Honestly, Doctor, is this a test? It’s a…a doctor’s office, isn’t it? A perfectly ordinary doctor’s office. Rural, I believe my husband said. Not much to distinguish it from any other…establishment. Are we going to do this all day?
DOCTOR: Just a few more questions, Ms. Engelhaupt. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision? Well…everything seems a bit…fuzzy sometimes. But that’s to be expected, isn’t it? I wear glasses, you know. And I haven't bothered getting a new prescription in…oh, goodness, I couldn’t possibly say. Years, probably. It’s not as if I spend my time admiring the scenery.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any difficulty with your hearing?
PATIENT: Hearing? Sometimes. People mumble, you see. Especially my grandson. He thinks he’s talking clearly, but it’s just…a garbled mess. Though that could be intentional. He’s a mischievous boy. Honestly, I usually just nod and smile. It's easier that way.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s switch gears then. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Goodness. Let me see. My husband says I have…age. Is that a condition? I take a small pill every day, a little white one, for…something. He handles the medications. Honestly, I stopped asking years ago. It’s all so…fussy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, perhaps we can get a better understanding of things. I’m going to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. Just a quick check of your reflexes, blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, must you? Honestly, I’d rather not be poked and prodded. It's quite undignified. But I suppose…if you insist. Just be quick about it. And please, no cold instruments. My husband always said I’m sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Breath sounds are a little diminished. Blood pressure is 140/90. Now let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit slow, but they're responding. Now, I’d like to do a brief cognitive assessment to get a clearer picture of your memory. This will involve a few simple questions and tasks. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, more questions? Honestly, this is becoming quite tiresome. I'm perfectly capable of thinking for myself, you know. I used to be very sharp, before…well, before everything started fading. But if you must, get it over with quickly. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to ask you a few questions. First, can you tell me the year?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Are you serious? Honestly, I told you, I don’t keep track of such things! Isn't it enough that I’ve already answered a million questions? My husband…my husband knows. He remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s try something different. Can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Let’s get this over with. What are the words? Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: The words are: table, penny, orange. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Table…penny…orange. There. Is that satisfactory? Honestly, this is…rather demeaning. I used to be a dispatcher, you know. I had to remember all sorts of codes and important information. This is…simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you count backward from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Oh, for… Are you trying to frustrate me? Count backward by sevens? Honestly! That’s preposterous! I can barely remember what I had for breakfast, let alone count backward by seven! I believe I’ve had enough of this…testing.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's sufficient for now. Based on my assessment, and your husband's concerns, I believe further evaluation is warranted. It appears you are experiencing some cognitive decline, and it's important to determine the underlying cause. I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive neurological examination. They can conduct additional tests, such as an MRI or CT scan of the brain, to rule out any structural abnormalities. I will also order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies or other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A neurologist? More tests? Honestly, this is becoming quite…overwhelming. My husband will be pleased, of course. He’s always worried about something. But I… I don’t want to spend the rest of my days in doctors’ offices. Is it really necessary? I feel…fine, mostly. But…very well. If you insist. Just… please, no more counting backwards. And tell the neurologist I used to be a very efficient dispatcher.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Engelhaupt. While you feel "mostly fine", it’s important to address these changes early on. The neurologist will be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and recommend the best course of treatment. I will make the referral today. In the meantime, I would like you to continue taking any medications you are currently prescribed, as directed by your husband, and avoid any major changes to your routine. I'm also going to recommend that your husband accompany you to the neurologist appointment to help provide a more complete history. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My husband will want to be there. He always knows best. He handles everything, you see. But please…do try to keep the waiting room warm. I get chilly easily. And perhaps a comfortable chair? This is all rather… taxing. Honestly, I’m quite tired now.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will make a note to ensure the waiting room is comfortable, and to request a comfortable chair for you. I will have my assistant schedule the appointment for you, and they will provide you with all the necessary information. I'll also send the results of the blood work to the neurologist once they are available. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Engelhaupt?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s quite enough, thank you. Honestly, I'm ready to go home and have a nice cup of tea. My husband will be expecting me. Please, just…don’t bother me with any more questions. And tell the neurologist about the dispatching again. It was very important work.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will be sure to include that information in the referral notes. Please, let my assistant know if you have any difficulties scheduling the appointment. And don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before your visit. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Engelhaupt.
