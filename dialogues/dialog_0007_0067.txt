DOCTOR: Hi Murry, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… this pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It’s… hard to explain exactly where. Somewhere in here… <gestures vaguely to his chest>. It’s been a little while now, I guess. Not too bad all the time, but when I take a big breath… oof. I just want to get it checked out, if you don't mind. I don't like feeling like I gotta be careful with my breathing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain in your chest that worsens with deep breaths… that’s definitely worth looking into. “A little while now” is helpful, but could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. <frowns, looking upwards as if trying to remember>… Maybe… a month? Or two? Time… it gets away from me these days. It didn't come on suddenly, it was more… gradual. Started maybe with just a little discomfort after working hard, you know, on a building site. Now it’s… more noticeable even when I’m resting. Does that make sense? It’s just… pain. I don't remember anything specific happening that caused it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Gradual onset is important. So, about a month or two of increasing chest pain, worse with deep breaths, and it seems to have started after some physical work. And you said it’s noticeable even at rest now. <I type quickly into the EHR.> Before we go further, can you tell me a little about the type of pain?
PATIENT: Type of pain… <pauses, rubbing his chest> It’s not… sharp. Not like a cut or something. More… dull. Aching, maybe? And sometimes… feels tight, like a band around my chest. Not all the time, but when it really hurts. It doesn’t go anywhere, doesn't shoot down my arm or anything. Just… there. It’s hard to describe, I’m sorry. I’m not good with these things.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright – describing pain is difficult. Dull, aching, and sometimes a tight sensation, localized to your chest, not radiating anywhere. That's very helpful. <I continue typing.> Now, let’s do a quick review of your general health. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… <shakes head slowly> Not that I recall. I’ve lived a pretty simple life. Worked construction most of my life. Had the usual colds, maybe the flu a few times. Never been to the hospital for anything serious, if that makes sense. I don’t really… go to doctors unless I have to. My wife… my ex-wife… she always took care of that sort of thing. I’m probably forgetting something, but… nothing major. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical problems that you’re aware of. No hospitalizations, mostly just routine illnesses. <I note this in the EHR.> Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… <taps his chin thoughtfully> Hmm. Let me think. Oh! Yes. When I was younger, I had my appendix out. That was… a long time ago. And… <frowns> I think I had a bad knee fixed once, but that was years and years ago. Besides that… I don’t believe so. It was a long time ago, so I might be forgetting something. These old bones… they don’t remember much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a knee repair, both in the past. <I add these to the record.> Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… <shakes head firmly> Nope. Never had any. I can eat anything, take anything. My wife used to joke I had a cast-iron stomach. <chuckles weakly>. No, no allergies that I know of. I haven’t had any trouble with anything. That’s one good thing, I guess.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t take pills. Never really liked them. Just… plain water, mostly. And sometimes… a little tea. I try to keep things simple, you know? No medications at all. I try to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. <I finish updating his chart.> Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has had similar chest pain, heart problems, or lung issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… family… <pauses, looking distant> That’s a hard one. I haven't seen my family in a long time. We don’t… keep in close touch. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he worked hard all his life, like me. I don’t remember him having any chest pain or anything. My siblings… I honestly don’t know. We lost touch a long time ago. Sorry, I wish I could be more help. I’m not very good with family history, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Murry. It's perfectly fine. Knowing your mother had high blood pressure is helpful. <I make a note in the chart>. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought they were a bad idea. Worked around dust and things on the building site, but never smoking. Never. My wife… she tried a few when she was younger, but she quit. I’m a clean living man, if you don't mind me saying so. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I have a little beer sometimes. When I’m with friends, maybe a couple. Nothing much. Not every day, just… now and then. I don't drink to excess. I don't really like the feeling. It just makes me tired. So, not a big drinker, Doctor. Just a little beer sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol use. <I add that to the record.> And finally, just to get a complete picture, what kind of work do you do or have you been doing recently?
PATIENT: Still construction, Doctor. Been doing it my whole life. Mostly… framing, you know? Building the wooden skeletons of houses. It’s hard work, keeps me busy. Lately… <grimaces> I’ve been trying to slow down a little. My body isn’t what it used to be. Been doing lighter jobs, mostly supervising now. But still get out there and help when they need me. It’s all I know, you see? It’s what I’m good at. And it's how I make my living. I can't afford to stop working completely. I'm divorced and don't have much saved up.
DOCTOR: Okay, still working in construction, primarily framing, and recently transitioning to more supervisory roles, but still some physical work. <I finish typing.> Alright Murry, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your lungs and heart and check for any tenderness in your chest. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. I guess. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have some things I need to get to. But yes, go ahead. I want to know what’s going on. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I need to keep working, you see? It's important.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick as possible. Please sit back and relax. Okay, Murry. Your lungs sound a little quieter than I’d like, especially in the lower part of your chest. I felt a little tenderness when I pressed here, on your lower sternum. Your heart sounds regular, but a bit faint. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. I'm going to order a chest X-ray just to get a better look at your lungs. We might also want to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: X-ray… EKG… <frowns, looking worried> Sounds… complicated. Is it serious, Doctor? I just want to know what's going on. I don’t want any fancy tests if it’s nothing. I need to get back to work. Is it going to take long? And how much will it cost? I don’t have insurance, you see. I just want to get this sorted out quickly. I appreciate you looking at me, but I'm on a budget and I need to know what's going on with my breathing. I'm worried it will affect my job.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Murry. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. The X-ray and EKG are just standard tests to rule out potential causes of your chest pain and breathing difficulties. It's better to be thorough and get a clear picture of what's going on, especially since you're still working in a physically demanding job. Regarding the cost, I’ll have the billing department provide you with a breakdown of the costs before any tests are performed. We do have options for patients without insurance, and we can discuss those as well. I want to assure you that we'll work with you to make this manageable. The tests themselves shouldn't take too long – the X-ray will only take a few minutes, and the EKG is quick as well. We can get the results back relatively quickly. Let's proceed with these tests first, and then we can discuss the results and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: <sighs> Alright, Doctor. If you think it's necessary… I guess. But please, make it quick. And please, tell me if it’s going to be expensive before you do anything. I just… I don't have a lot of money. And I need to get back to work. I appreciate you trying to help, but I'm worried about the cost. I don't want any surprises. Just… quick, and cheap, if possible. I trust you, Doctor. Just let me know what it’s going to cost.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Murry. I will personally ensure you’re fully informed of all costs before proceeding with anything. I will also speak to the billing department about potential assistance programs for uninsured patients. We can also prioritize the most essential tests first to minimize expenses. Okay, a chest X-ray is $150, and an EKG is $80. We can start with those two tests, and if we need further investigation, we can discuss it with you upfront. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: $150… $80… <winces> That's… a lot. But I guess… if it’s necessary. Okay. Yes, go ahead with those two tests. But please, tell me what the results are as soon as you get them. And if they show something serious, let me know the cost of fixing it before you do anything. I need to be prepared. I don't want any surprises. Please, Doctor. Just be upfront with me about the cost. That's all I ask. I need to go back to work, and I can't afford a big bill.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Murry. I understand your concerns perfectly, and I promise to be completely upfront and transparent about all costs. I will personally review the results with you as soon as they are available, and we can discuss the best course of action and associated costs before proceeding with any further treatment. Okay, let's get you over to the radiology department for the chest X-ray, and then we'll do the EKG here in the office. I'll have a nurse come in shortly to explain the procedures. Just relax, and we'll get this sorted out. I’ll be right here when you get back.
PATIENT: .
