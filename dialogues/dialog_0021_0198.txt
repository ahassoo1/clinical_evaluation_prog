DOCTOR: Right. Well, Liza Sugino, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. It's nice to meet you, Doctor Havird. I hope you're having a good day so far.
DOCTOR: It's alright. Look, I'm not really one for pleasantries. Let's just get down to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. No problem at all. I came in because I was hoping to learn a bit about mindfulness, or meditation... I’ve been hearing good things, and thought maybe it could help me with… well, just generally feeling more centered, I suppose. Do you offer anything like that here?
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes. You know, taking time to focus on the present moment, being aware of your thoughts and feelings without judgement? Things like that. I’ve read a little about it, and some friends have taken classes, and they said it helped them with stress. I was hoping you might have some resources, or maybe know someone who teaches it? I’m not quite sure where to start, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Look, I’m a doctor. I deal with actual medical problems, not… feelings. Though, I suppose it’s the general trend these days. Do you have any… legitimate health concerns that brought you in?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. I hadn't... I guess I didn't explain myself very well. It is a health concern, in a way. I find I get quite overwhelmed sometimes, easily distracted, and just… not very peaceful. I thought maybe learning to quiet my mind could help with that, before it becomes something more serious. Like, maybe trouble sleeping, or… I don’t know. I just thought it was worth looking into, proactively. It’s preventative, isn't it? If I can learn some techniques now, maybe I won't need to come in with a bigger problem later. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Overwhelmed." Right. Well, everyone feels stressed these days. It’s called life. What specifically is making you overwhelmed?
PATIENT: Well, it's not usually one big thing. It's more like… a lot of little things piling up. Work can be demanding – signal and track switch repair isn't exactly relaxing, you know? – and I live alone, so there's that, and keeping up with everything just… adds up. I'm good at fixing things, mechanical things, but I'm not so good at fixing… this. <gestures vaguely at her head> It's hard to explain. It’s just a general feeling of being scattered, and I’d like to learn tools to help manage it. I'm a practical person, I just need a starting point. Perhaps even just some simple exercises?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Let's just look at your chart here… 136 pounds, 5'3". Medicare. Rural location. Signal and track switch repair… <mutters> Probably exposed to a lot of noise, then. Any history of anxiety or depression?
PATIENT: No, not officially. Never been diagnosed with anything like that. I just… worry sometimes, like everyone does, I suppose. And the noise at work is definitely a factor – it's constant, and can be quite jarring. But it’s not like it causes panic attacks or anything. It just... wears you down, you know? I'm generally a very capable person, and I like to be in control, and I feel like this constant feeling of being scattered makes it harder to do that. I really don’t think it’s anything serious, just something I’d like to address before it gets to that point. Is it alright if I explain a little more about what I'm hoping to achieve with mindfulness? I read that it can help with focus, which would be very useful at work.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Focus is… important, I suppose. But frankly, you're describing perfectly normal life stress. Everyone gets scattered. Let’s do a quick physical, just to be thorough, and then we can rule out any underlying medical causes. Blood pressure, heart rate… routine stuff. Then, if everything checks out, I suppose I can write you a pamphlet on… deep breathing exercises. Don’t expect miracles, though. It's not a cure-all. Roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time. A physical is a good idea. And I certainly don’t expect miracles, just… a little guidance would be wonderful. Deep breathing exercises sound like a good place to start. <rolls up sleeve> Just let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Just relax. 130 over 80. Not terrible. Heart rate is… 72. Regular. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. And I’m generally quite healthy, as far as I know. I eat reasonably well, try to get enough sleep when I can, and I stay active with my job, even if it’s a little… loud. I have never really been one for getting sick. Is everything alright so far?
DOCTOR: Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds… regular. Anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Oh! I do have a bit of a stiff neck sometimes, from working under equipment. Nothing serious, just a little discomfort. And my hands are often a bit sore, from gripping tools all day. But those are just work-related aches and pains, really. Nothing I'd bother you with normally. <pauses> Is that the kind of thing you're looking for? Physical complaints? I just thought I'd mention them in case they were relevant.
DOCTOR: Neck is a bit tight, yes. Hands show some calluses, as expected. Likely work-related. <types into computer> No fever, no rash, no obvious signs of infection… You seem physically healthy, frankly. Which is… good. Look, I'm going to write you a referral to a physical therapist for your neck and hands. That's the appropriate course of action. As for the… 'scattered' feelings?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful, thank you. I appreciate the referral – I’ve been meaning to address the neck pain. And I understand about the other thing. Perhaps with some physical relief, I’ll feel less… overwhelmed. So, you don’t really have any recommendations for mindfulness or meditation techniques, then? Or any resources you could point me to? I was hoping to get a starting point, even if it was just a book or a website. I don't mind doing some research on my own.
DOCTOR: Look, I'll be honest with you. I don't recommend self-help. Most of it is… nonsense. But fine. I'll print you a pamphlet on relaxation techniques. It has some basic breathing exercises, and a few suggestions for… reducing stress. Don't expect it to solve your problems. It's just… something to try. <starts printing a pamphlet> And honestly?
PATIENT: That’s perfectly alright. I appreciate anything you can offer, even just a starting point. I understand that self-help isn’t for everyone, and I certainly wasn't expecting a miracle cure. Just a little guidance would be wonderful. Thank you for taking the time to listen, Doctor Havird. And thank you for the referral. <smiles politely> I’ll be sure to schedule an appointment with the physical therapist as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: There. Now. <pauses briefly> Try to get some rest. And if things actually get worse, come back. But honestly?
PATIENT: .
