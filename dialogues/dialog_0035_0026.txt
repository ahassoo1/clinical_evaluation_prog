DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this tiredness, you see. Just…awful tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it comes, I can barely lift a teacup. And the young man at the lab said something about…kin-ase? Is that even a word? Honestly, these youngsters and their fancy words. My husband, bless his heart, said I should come in about it. He worries so.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness…that’s a good place to start. And you mentioned something the lab tech said about “kinase”?
PATIENT: Yes, kinase. He said it was…high? Something about my muscles. I don’t pretend to understand it. I just know I feel dreadful when this tiredness hits. It’s not like being simply tired, you understand. It's…deeper. And it’s been happening more and more lately. I used to be able to work all day, you know. Commercial diving is hard work! But these days… It's just not the same.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving, wow! That is hard work. Okay, so this tiredness is different than just being worn out, and it's been increasing. When you say it's "high", do you remember anything else the lab tech mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. He babbled on and on about numbers and…well, it all went over my head. Something about needing to see a doctor, which is why I’m here! Honestly, these tests…they just poke and prod and then tell you things you don't understand. It was a young man, very polite, but not much help explaining it in plain English. My husband, he tried to listen too, but he’s not good with medical things either. He’s a carpenter, a very good one, but…muscles and kinase…it’s all Greek to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly okay. We can definitely figure this out. Let's try to get a better understanding of this tiredness. When did you first start noticing this happening?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… it wasn’t sudden, you see. It crept up on me. Probably… six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It started after… well, after I slowed down the diving a bit. Not stopped entirely, mind you, just doing smaller jobs. Less time underwater. I thought it was just getting older, to be honest. You get a bit slower, a bit more tired, as you get on in years. But this… this is different. It’s more than just being tired, it’s…weakness, really. And it worries me. It really does.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, gradual onset, and it feels like weakness more than just tiredness. And it started around the time you reduced your diving. Now, when you say weakness, where are you feeling it the most?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly in my arms and legs, you see. It's like trying to lift something heavy when you haven’t had your breakfast. That sort of feeling. And sometimes it’s in my back too, a dull ache. It makes it hard to get up from a chair, you know? And I used to be able to carry all sorts of things, but now… now I have to ask my husband for help. It’s embarrassing, really. A woman my age shouldn't need help carrying groceries! It's not dignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness in your arms and legs, and some back pain, making it difficult to get up and carry things. That's helpful. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, I don't go to the doctor much, if I can help it. I always said, fresh air and hard work are the best medicine! But… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years ago? And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, nothing major, just a bit stiff in the mornings. And my husband says my blood pressure goes up sometimes, but I don't really pay much attention to that. He’s always fussing over me. Aside from that… nothing much. I've been quite healthy, all my life, really. Oh! And I had the flu a couple of winters ago, a bad one, but I recovered alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder out thirty years ago, some arthritis, and your husband monitors your blood pressure. You had the flu a couple of years ago. Good to know. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for the arthritis in the mornings. It’s a small white pill, I think the name is… uh… Nap-something? Naproxen, maybe? And sometimes, when my blood pressure is up, my husband gives me one of his pills. A little blue one, I don’t know what it’s called. He keeps them in a bottle, and I just take what he gives me. He knows what he’s doing, bless his heart. I'm not one for taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen for the arthritis, and occasionally a blue pill from your husband for blood pressure. It's good you tell me that. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm...allergies. Let me think. Not to anything I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Well, I got a bit of a rash once, years ago, from poison ivy, but that wasn't a medicine. And I can’t eat shellfish, makes me terribly ill, but that’s just food. No, I don’t think I have any allergies to pills or anything like that. I’m a pretty sturdy sort, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your strength, reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but I suppose it’s for the best. Just be gentle, dear. My old bones aren’t what they used to be. I suppose I should take off my coat, then?
DOCTOR: Of course, gentle is the name of the game. And yes, if you wouldn’t mind taking your coat off, that would be great. If you’ll just sit here for me, I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but rhythm is regular. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. Reflexes are a little diminished, but present. I'm noting some weakness in your arms and legs, as you described. Strength is about 4 out of 5 on a scale of zero to five. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Okay, thank you, Ardelle. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I'd like to run some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your CK levels, which can indicate muscle damage, and a complete metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes. We should also check your thyroid function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. So many tests… Well, if you think it’s necessary, dear. I don’t mind a bit of poking and prodding if it will help me figure out what’s wrong. CK levels…thyroid…it all sounds very complicated. My husband will be glad you’re taking things seriously. He worries so much. Very well. Let’s get these tests done. But please, don’t find anything too dreadful, alright? I’m not a young woman anymore. And will I have to come back again soon, after the tests?
DOCTOR: We'll take it one step at a time, Ardelle. These tests will help us get a better understanding of what's going on. It's good we're checking things out. I'm putting in the orders for the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of you. It shouldn't take too long. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It should be within a week or so. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they come in. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, severe muscle pain, or dark urine, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dark urine? That sounds…frightening. I’ll try not to think about that. And a week… a week is a long time to worry. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just…thank you, dear. You seem very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. My husband will be relieved. He always wants me to get everything checked out. I suppose I should go to the lab now, then? Is there anything I need to do before I go? Or… anything I should eat or not eat?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. I understand it can be worrisome waiting for the results, but we’ll get to the bottom of this. No, nothing special to eat or drink before the blood work. You can eat and drink as usual. Just try to relax. The lab technician will give you instructions on what to do after the blood draw. Yes, you can head to the lab now. They're expecting you. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll talk soon, Ardelle. Take care.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Thank you again, dear. I will try to relax. And I will call if anything changes. I suppose I should be going, then. Goodbye.
