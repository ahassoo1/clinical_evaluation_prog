DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It is… my sinuses, I think. They feel… bad. Very stuffy. It’s been happening for a little while now. I don’t remember exactly how long, but some weeks, yes?
DOCTOR: “Some weeks” isn’t terribly specific, Ms. Boham. Can you try to recall when you first noticed this congestion?
PATIENT: Oh… that is right. It is hard to remember. Maybe… after the really hot weather? Before that, I think I was okay. No… wait. Maybe it was after I helped my husband with the… the machines? He works with… big drills, yes? For the oil? It could be then. I’m sorry, Doctor. I do not have a good memory for dates.
DOCTOR: Right. So, potentially a few weeks, coinciding with either a heatwave or assisting your husband with his work. And you’re experiencing… stuffiness, you said. Anything else accompanying that?
PATIENT: Yes, stuffiness. And… a little bit of a headache. Not a bad headache, just… pressure. Behind my eyes, mostly. Sometimes it’s hard to breathe through my nose, yes. And… I feel tired. But, I always feel a little tired, so maybe that is not from the sinuses.
DOCTOR: Headache with pressure behind the eyes, nasal congestion, and fatigue. You say the fatigue is a constant issue, not necessarily new?
PATIENT: That is right, Doctor. The tiredness is… always there. I work very hard, you see. My husband, he works very hard. So, I help him. We both do. The headache and the stuffy nose… that feels new. It’s not every day, but it is… frequent now, yes? Is that a good word? Frequent?
DOCTOR: Frequent is perfectly acceptable. And you've noticed this… frequency increase over the past few weeks, coinciding with the hot weather and assisting your husband?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right, Doctor. The hot weather… it was very dusty, I remember. And with the machines… sometimes the dust flies around, even with the… the things we use to keep it down. It is hard work, very dirty work, yes. I wear a mask, but… maybe it is not enough? I do not know. It is possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned a mask. Do you experience any facial pain, fever, cough, or changes in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. Definitely no fever. No cough either. And… my smell? I think it is okay. I can smell when my husband is cooking, yes! He makes very good food. My taste… also okay. I tasted it, of course! No, no fever, no cough, smell and taste are fine. But… sometimes, when I bend over, I feel pressure in my face. Like… behind my cheeks, yes? Is that the cheeks? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Pressure with bending over, localized to the cheeks. Alright. Let's do a quick examination. I'd like to listen to your lungs, check your sinuses for tenderness, and take a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Please, do what you need to do. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Boham... and again... Good. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your sinuses. I'll be pressing gently on your forehead and around your cheeks. Please let me know if any of this is particularly tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. There. That one hurts a little bit. Not very bad, but… definitely hurts. The other side is okay. No pain there. The forehead is also fine. Just the right cheek, yes? It feels… a little bit warm, too, maybe? But it could be my imagination.
DOCTOR: Tenderness over the right maxillary sinus, with subjective warmth. Now, open your mouth for me, please. I'm going to take a quick look at your throat. Hmm. Throat is clear, no significant redness or swelling. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis – inflammation of the sinuses, probably on the right side. The dust exposure and assisting your husband with his work are likely contributing factors. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I do not think so. I have never been told I have allergies. Sometimes, when I am gardening, my eyes get a little itchy, but I just wash them with water. My mother… she was allergic to something, I think. Flowers, maybe? But me? No, I don't think so. I have never taken anything for allergies. No allergies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I do not take any pills. I try to stay healthy, yes? I eat good food, I help my husband, I work hard. I do not need any pills. But thank you for asking.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your symptoms and lack of other medical issues, we can try a conservative approach. I recommend over-the-counter saline nasal rinses twice daily to help clear the congestion, and a decongestant for a few days to help with the stuffiness. If you’re able, limiting your exposure to dust while assisting your husband would be beneficial. However, if your symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever, severe headache, or any vision changes, you need to seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Saline… for the nose. Twice a day. And the… decongestant. For a few days. And less dust. That makes sense. If it gets worse… fever, bad headache, things with the eyes… I come back, yes? I will try my best to remember everything, Doctor. Thank you for helping me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. If anything changes, or if you are not improving within a week, schedule a follow-up appointment. I will document these instructions in your chart. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is everything. You explained it very clearly. I will follow your instructions. Thank you again for seeing me today. I appreciate your help very much. Perhaps… one question. Where can I buy the… saline? The thing for the nose?
DOCTOR: Any pharmacy, Ms. Boham. Walgreens, CVS… any drugstore will carry saline nasal rinses. They’re usually in the cold and allergy aisle. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. Thank you for telling me. I will go to the… Walgreens, yes? You have been very helpful. I hope I do not need to come back, but if I do, I will remember your name. Dr. Paulino. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Boham.
