DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. I'm Dr. Trestrail. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been… myself lately. It’s a bit difficult to explain, but I just feel… down. Very down. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I’d like to get this sorted, if you don’t mind. I haven’t much time today, you see.
DOCTOR: “Down,” you say. Can you elaborate on that for me?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes. Hmm. It’s not a physical tiredness, Doctor, though I am getting on. It’s more… a heaviness. A lack of joy, really. Things that used to please me… they don’t anymore. I used to love my garden, but even that feels like a chore now. And I find myself… well, not angry, exactly, but irritable. Easily frustrated. It's been going on for… oh, I suppose a few months now, maybe longer. It’s hard to keep track these days.
DOCTOR: A few months, you say. Has anything specific happened in the last few months that might have triggered this change?
PATIENT: Triggered… now that’s a good question. Not that I can pinpoint, Doctor. My divorce was… some years ago now. The children are grown, doing well, thankfully. No recent illnesses, no losses… It’s just… a gradual thing. A slow dimming, if you will. Honestly, I've been quite busy with my work, keeping the beach safe this summer, and the ski patrol last winter. Perhaps… perhaps it's just the weight of things, the years adding up. I really don't know.
DOCTOR: Busy with seasonal work. So, beach patrol and ski patrol. And this feeling of… “dimming” – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Though… lately, it’s been more coming than going, if you understand. Some days are… bearable. I can get through my shift, smile at the tourists, make sure everyone’s safe. But then I come home… and the quiet just… weighs on me. It’s worse in the evenings, I think. And mornings can be difficult too, just getting started. It's not crippling, Doctor, I’m still functioning. But it’s… unpleasant. Very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: So, worse in the evenings and mornings, better during your shifts. Do you find yourself having trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. That’s a good question. Yes, I do. I often wake up in the middle of the night, and then I can’t get back to sleep. I lie there… thinking. Worrying, perhaps. Though I don’t know what I’m worrying about, specifically. Just… things. And when I do sleep, it’s not a restful sleep. More like… drifting. I wake up feeling tired, even after a full night, or what should be a full night. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Nothing significant, no. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. My blood pressure has been a little high at times, but nothing that requires medication, the doctor said. I had a bit of a knee injury years ago, from skiing, but that’s been managed. No history of… mental illness, if that’s what you’re asking. My mother… she suffered from anxiety, I suppose, but I never thought I inherited it.
DOCTOR: And any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. And sometimes, if my knee is acting up, I take ibuprofen. That’s it. I try to avoid medication as much as possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you see. Though… perhaps it needs a little help now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. My appetite… it’s not what it used to be. I used to enjoy cooking, a good, hearty meal. Now… I eat because I know I should, not because I’m hungry. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, though I haven’t weighed myself recently. It’s difficult to keep track of these things, you see. My clothes feel a bit looser, perhaps. Not drastically, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been experiencing any difficulty with concentration or memory?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. That’s… a bit embarrassing to admit. I used to pride myself on my sharp mind. Now… I forget things. Simple things, like where I put my keys, or the name of someone I just met. And I find it harder to focus, to really concentrate on things. I have to read things over and over again, just to understand them. It’s… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to perform a brief physical exam. Nothing invasive, just checking your vital signs and a basic neurological assessment. Afterwards, we can discuss some potential options. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a shift to cover this afternoon, you see. But yes, please proceed. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat here. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Finally, a quick memory test. Can you repeat these three words for me: apple, table, pencil?
PATIENT: Apple, table, pencil. Yes, I can. Is that… a trick question? It feels rather simple.
DOCTOR: Not a trick question. Now, can you recall those three words again?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… apple… and… table. I… I seem to be drawing a blank on the third one. Pencil… no, that doesn't sound right. I know I heard three words. It's right on the tip of my tongue…
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your symptoms, and the brief exam, it appears you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with mild depression. The memory lapse is also something to note. However, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Also, a more comprehensive cognitive assessment would be beneficial. Would you be amenable to those tests?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, that sounds… thorough. And the cognitive assessment, if it doesn't take too long. I really must get back to work this afternoon, you see. But yes, Doctor, if you think it's necessary, I’ll cooperate. I just want to feel… myself again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the nurse draw blood before you leave. I’ll also schedule you for a cognitive assessment at the clinic next week. In the meantime, I recommend trying to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even if you’re not feeling tired. And gentle exercise, if you’re able. It is also important to acknowledge your feelings. Talking to a friend or family member can be helpful. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience any thoughts of self-harm, please seek immediate medical attention. I’ll review the test results as soon as they’re available, and we can discuss further treatment options at that time. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Treatment options… yes. That sounds… serious. I suppose it is. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… what sort of treatment are we talking about? Medication? Therapy? I must admit, I’m a bit apprehensive. I’ve always been a very independent person. But I suppose I’m in your hands now. Just… please, no long waiting lists, if possible. My schedule is rather full.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension. Treatment options can range from lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise and improved sleep hygiene, to talk therapy—psychotherapy—and, in some cases, medication. We’ll discuss all the options in detail once we have the results of your tests, and we can tailor a treatment plan that's right for you. You're right to be cautious, and you have the final say in any treatment decisions. I will do my best to expedite the scheduling process. I’ll also give you a referral to a reputable therapist in the area, should you be interested. Do you want me to write that referral now, or would you prefer to wait until after the tests?
PATIENT: Please, write the referral now. It's best to have everything ready, just in case. I suppose it doesn't hurt to have options, does it? I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. It's… reassuring. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. This is a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a licensed therapist with excellent reviews. She specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy. The nurse will provide you with information on how to schedule an appointment. Are there any other questions I can answer before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s all for now. Just… thank you again. And please, let me know as soon as the test results are back. I’m relying on you to get me back to myself. I have a beach to protect, you see.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Derasmo. We’ll do our best to help you get back to protecting that beach. The nurse will escort you to the lab for your blood work. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns in the meantime. Have a good afternoon.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you, Doctor. Thank you. Goodbye.
