DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. I… how you say… telehealth visit, yes? My bones, they feel… old. Not broken, but… tired. And sometimes, a little pain. I am not sure what to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see you had a telehealth visit previously. “Tired bones” and some pain… okay. Can you tell me a little more about where you're feeling the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. Mostly in my knees, you know? And my back. When I stand for long time, it hurts. I used to work on cars, many years. Maybe from that? I do not know. It is not… sharp pain. More like… ache. A heavy ache. And sometimes, in the morning, very stiff.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and back, worse with standing, a heavy ache, and morning stiffness. That history of car work is helpful. Do you recall when this pain started, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh… that is difficult. It not start… sudden. Slowly, over many years, I think. Maybe… ten years ago? A little pain after work. I thought it was just… old age. But now… it is more. It bother me more. I try to walk, but it is… difficult sometimes. And lifting things… forget about it!
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a gradual onset over about ten years, and it’s impacting your walking and lifting. That's good information. Just to get a more complete picture, would you describe the pain as constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It come and go. Some days are better, yes? I can walk a little, do small things. But other days… very bad. Especially when it is cold, or wet. That makes it worse. And if I overdo it… you know, try to do too much… then I pay for it. For days! It is not always there, but… never really gone gone, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. It sounds like it's significantly impacting your daily life. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees or anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. Not that I notice, anyway. And no redness. Just… ache. And sometimes, the stiffness. In the morning, I feel very old. Like I need oiling, like one of my cars! But no… no swelling or redness. Just pain and stiff.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about other parts of your body, just to get a broader picture. Have you had any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever. No chills. And my weight… hmm. Maybe a little, over the years. But not sudden. I eat… normal, I think. Not much change in my eating. I like my dumplings! But no… no weight loss. Everything is… normal, except the knees and back. Mostly the knees.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And how about your energy levels?
PATIENT: My energy… hmm. Not like when I was younger, of course. But I can still do things. I take care of my garden, I like to read. I get tired… sometimes. But I think that is just… getting old. It is not… bad tired. Just… regular tired. I sleep okay. Maybe not as much as before, but… okay. I do not feel… weak, you understand? Just… slower.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My doctor, before, he said my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me a pill for that. I take it every day. And… no. Nothing else. No arthritis. No diabetes. My heart… I think it is okay. I get check-ups, you know. I am careful. But the blood pressure… that is the only thing. And I think that is all. I have good insurance, you know. Medicare. I see the doctor when I need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication. That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Just the pill for my blood pressure. Nothing else. No vitamins. No supplements. I eat my dumplings, that is enough vitamins! I try to be healthy, you know? Not too many sweets. But dumplings… those are special. No, just the pill. That is all. Simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll just check your knees, back, and range of motion to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Physical exam. Is good. I want to know what is wrong, you know? Maybe it is just… old age. But I want to be sure. You check my knees, you check my back. Whatever you need to do. Is okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you don’t mind, please sit on the exam table. First, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It hurts a little bit, you see? Not sharp, but… ache. Like… rusty hinges. I can bend them more, but then it hurts more. Not too much, but… I can feel it. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. I’m just feeling for any tenderness or swelling. I do feel a little crepitus – that’s that grinding sensation you feel – when you bend your knees, which is common with wear and tear. There’s some tenderness on the inside of both knees. No significant swelling that I can detect. Now, let's check your back. Can you stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Yes, I can stand. It pops, you see? Sometimes it does that. A little bit stiff, you know? Not too bad. I try to stretch it, but it doesn't help much. Now, what you want me to do?
DOCTOR: Okay. Just stand normally for me. I'm looking at how you move. And just bending forward a little... and back... Okay, good. I do feel some tightness in the muscles of your lower back, and some tenderness when I press here. No signs of nerve compression that I can detect. Overall, it seems like we're dealing with some age-related wear and tear in both your knees and lower back. Now, based on what you've told me and what I've found on the exam, I think it’s likely you have osteoarthritis in your knees and some muscle strain and age-related changes in your lower back. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Osteo… arthritis? Is that… bad? I thought it was just old age. Muscle strain… yes, maybe. I lift things sometimes. But osteoarthritis… Is that what you fix? Can you fix it? I want to be able to walk in my garden again, you know? And lift my groceries.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad,” Ms. Benites, but it is common as we get older. It simply means the cartilage in your knees has worn down over time, causing pain and stiffness. It’s very common, and many people live full, active lives with it. And it's good you asked if we can "fix" it. We can't cure it, unfortunately, but we can absolutely manage the symptoms and help you get back to doing the things you enjoy. There are a number of things we can try. We can start with some simple measures like physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knees and back, and pain relief medication when needed. Weight management can also help reduce stress on your joints. We can also discuss some other options, like injections, if those measures aren’t enough. Does that sound like a reasonable plan to start with?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… yes. I can try that. Medicine… I already take one, for my blood pressure. I do not want to take too many. Weight… I like my dumplings! But I can try to walk more. Injections… no, thank you. I do not like needles. So, physical therapy, and maybe some walking? And if it hurts too much, I take the medicine? Is that right? Is that what you think is best?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a perfect plan to start with. Physical therapy can really help strengthen the muscles around your knees and back, which will take some of the stress off the joints and reduce your pain. Walking is great too – low impact exercise can help keep everything moving and improve your overall health. And yes, if the pain becomes too much, you can take a pain reliever as needed. I’m going to write you a prescription for a prescription-strength NSAID, just in case, but we can always adjust it if you don’t feel comfortable taking it. And I’m going to give you a referral to a physical therapy clinic nearby. They’ll assess your needs and create a personalized treatment plan for you. Would you like me to write down the name and number of the physical therapy clinic for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Write down the number. I forget things easily, you know. And the medicine… is it safe with my blood pressure pill? I do not want any problems. I already have enough pills to remember! Thank you, Doctor. You are very helpful. I feel much better now, just knowing what is wrong, and what I can do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ve double-checked, and the NSAID is generally safe to use with your blood pressure medication, but it’s always a good idea to check with your pharmacist when you pick it up, just to be sure. And yes, it's perfectly understandable to be concerned about adding another pill to your routine. We can always explore other options if you prefer. Here’s the referral and the prescription. I also have some handouts here on osteoarthritis, with exercises you can try at home, and tips on managing your pain. Please read through them when you have a chance. I’d like to see you back in about four to six weeks, to see how you’re doing with the physical therapy and to discuss any further treatment options. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, four to six weeks is fine. Thank you for everything, Doctor. You have been very kind. I will try the physical therapy, and I will read the handouts. And I will see you in a few weeks.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. And remember, stay active, listen to your body, and don’t push yourself too hard. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
