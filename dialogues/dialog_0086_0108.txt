DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Gentz, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, Gentz. Brad Gentz. Look, I ain't one for paperwork, so I hope you got this all sorted. This… situation… started a couple days ago, and it’s not gettin’ any prettier, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: “Not gettin’ any prettier.” Right. Well, let's try to be a little more specific than that, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? Alright, fine. Blood. Lots of it. Coming from… well, you know. Down there. Not a little trickle, either. Enough to worry a man. And frankly, I don’t do worries. It’s…unproductive. I've been trying to ignore it, but it’s just gettin’ worse.
DOCTOR: Blood from the…rectum, you’re saying?
PATIENT: Rectum, yeah, that’s a fancy word for it. Look, I ain’t a doctor, alright? I just know where it’s comin’ from. It’s…dark. Not bright red like a cut, more… old. And it smells… well, it smells bad. Real bad. It’s kinda been happening off and on for a few days, but yesterday it was… significant.
DOCTOR: “Off and on” and “significant”… Right. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… I’ve been…tired. Real tired. But I’m always tired. Widowed life, you know? And… I dunno… kinda weak. Like I don’t have the energy to…do much of anything. No fever or nothin' like that, if that's what you're askin'. Just… run down. And hungry, actually. Real hungry, which is weird 'cause I usually don't have much of an appetite. It’s probably just old age catching up to me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Probably just old age.” Mr. Gentz, with all due respect, that’s not a diagnosis. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Look, I appreciate your…professionalism, but I ain't exactly a fan of doctors poking around. But alright, fine. I had…high blood pressure, years ago. Took some pills for it, but I stopped taking ‘em. Didn't like how they made me feel. Besides, it went down on its own, mostly. Nothing else really. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, mumps, chickenpox… You know, the normal things. No surgeries, no serious injuries. Just…a bit run down, as I said. And this…bleeding…is new. It’s just…worrisome.
DOCTOR: And your family?
PATIENT: Family… that's a tough one. My wife… she passed five years back. Cancer. Terrible thing. Had a brother, but he… well, he’s not around anymore either. Heart attack. It’s mostly me now, Doc. No family history to worry about, if that’s what you’re getting at. Just… bad luck, I guess. And this bleeding. It's just adding to it.
DOCTOR: Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Like I said, I don’t like takin’ pills. Never have. They just make me feel worse, and I’d rather deal with things on my own. I tried some of those antacids once, for heartburn, but they didn’t do much, so I stopped. I mostly just drink a lot of water. And try to… rest. Though, with this… situation… restin’ ain’t exactly easy. It’s… disruptive, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Despite your…reservations…I need to perform a physical exam. It's necessary to get a clearer picture of what's going on. If you’ll just disrobe from the waist down, we can get started.
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute. Disrobe? You expect me to… I ain't comfortable with that at all. I already told you what's goin’ on! Blood, tired, hungry... what more do you need? You got all my history, all my symptoms! And frankly, I’m not one for strangers lookin’ at… well, you know. I came here for advice, not a…strip search. There’s gotta be another way.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with all due respect, I am trying to provide you with appropriate medical care. I understand your discomfort, but a physical examination – including a rectal exam – is standard procedure when presenting with your symptoms. It’s not about invading your privacy, it's about ruling out serious conditions. We need to determine the source of the bleeding, and that requires a hands-on assessment. I can’t make a proper diagnosis, and I certainly can’t recommend a treatment plan, without it. We are wasting time here. Now, are you willing to cooperate, or would you prefer I refer you to another physician?
PATIENT: Another physician? You're threatenin' me with another doctor? Look, I came here 'cause I figured you could help, but you're makin' this a whole lot harder than it needs to be. All this poking and prodding... it's just not necessary. And frankly, I don’t trust you anymore. You're more interested in your procedures than in actually listenin' to me. I think I'll just… …I think I’ll just deal with it myself. It’s probably nothing serious anyway. You can keep your exam. I’m not stickin’ around for this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with all due respect, you are making a very poor decision. Ignoring these symptoms will not make them go away, and it could have serious consequences. I strongly advise you to reconsider. However, I cannot force you to undergo a medical examination. Before you leave, I will document your refusal of a rectal exam and advise you to seek immediate medical attention if your symptoms worsen—specifically, if you experience dizziness, weakness, or significant blood loss. I will also provide you with written information about the signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer. Here is a list of local gastroenterologists should you change your mind. Good day, Mr. Gentz. .
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! You win. You and your poking and prodding. But don't come cryin' to me when I’m right. I’ll take your pamphlet, but I ain't promisin' nothin'. Just… good day to you too, Doc. And try bein' a little less…judgmental next time. .
