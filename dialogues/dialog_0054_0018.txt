DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Hmm… let me see. It’s… it’s about going to the restroom, quite a lot, actually. More than usual, I think. It’s been… a bit disruptive, you could say. I apologize if that’s not a very… precise explanation. My memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. It’s very helpful to start anywhere. So, you're experiencing an increased frequency of urination. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Increased… frequency. It happens both during the day and… well, at night too. I find myself getting up… quite often. I suppose I should try to be more specific. It feels like I drink a normal amount of fluids – perhaps a bit of tea, some water – but then I’m… going to the bathroom shortly after. It's just… frequent. And a good quantity, if you understand. Not just a little dribble, you see. It's a full emptying, each time. I hope that… clarifies things. It's difficult to remember exactly when it started, though. Perhaps a few weeks? A month?
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency and volume, both day and night. And you estimate this has been going on for a few weeks to a month. No burning or pain with urination, correct?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not a bit. And… no, not burning either. It’s just… the volume and how often it happens. It doesn’t hurt, you understand. It’s… inconvenient, mostly. And a little… worrisome, if I’m being honest. I haven't noticed any change in the… color, if that's relevant. It seems normal. I do apologize for being so vague. It's just… details escape me these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. No pain or burning is good. And no change in color is also helpful to know. Now, besides the frequent urination, have you noticed any other changes in your body?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other changes… that’s a good question. I suppose I’ve been a little more thirsty than usual, perhaps? But honestly, I always drink a bit of tea, so it's hard to say if that’s new. And I might be… a little more tired, generally. But that could be the summer heat, couldn't it? It’s been rather warm. No weight loss, I don’t think. I haven't been weighing myself regularly. And no… no fever or chills, thankfully. I’m trying to recall… but it’s difficult. Is there anything specific I should be looking for? Perhaps that would jog my memory.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst and general tiredness are good things to mention. We'll explore those. Okay, Mr. Verbos, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions. Let me see… High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed several years ago, perhaps ten years. I take medication for it, a small pill each morning. I believe it’s… lisinopril? Yes, that’s it. Otherwise… no, I don't think I have any other conditions. I had a… a minor surgery on my knee, a long time ago. But that’s fully recovered, I assure you. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I see a general practitioner, Doctor… Kovac, I believe his name is. But I haven’t seen him in… well, it’s been a while, I suppose. Perhaps six months? A year? My memory… you understand. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. High blood pressure, managed with lisinopril, and a past knee surgery. Good to know. And you haven’t been seeing Doctor Kovac regularly recently. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s another good question. Let me think carefully. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. No reactions to any medications that I recall. I've had the usual… penicillin as a child, perhaps. But nothing severe. No food allergies, no hay fever, no skin reactions… I’m quite fortunate, in that regard, I believe. Sometimes a little sniffle during the winter, but nothing I would consider an allergy. I’m quite certain, actually. No allergies at all. Unless… do seasonal allergies count? But even then, it's just a mild… congestion. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: No, a mild seasonal congestion doesn't concern me. So, no known medication or food allergies. Just to be thorough, Mr. Verbos, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's… a tricky one. My mother, she had… heart trouble, I believe. She passed away several years ago. My father… he was quite healthy, actually, for most of his life. He had… arthritis, perhaps, in his later years. And my sister… she has high blood pressure, I think. Similar to me. As for anything else… hmm. My grandparents, they lived quite long lives, but I don't recall any specific illnesses they suffered from. It's… difficult to say, really. My family isn't particularly prone to any major health problems, if that makes sense. I apologize for being so vague. It's hard to recall details from so long ago. Is there anything specific I should be looking for? Perhaps you could prompt me?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. Knowing about your mother's heart trouble and your sister's high blood pressure is helpful. Now, just to finish up the history, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. Well, I’m retired now. Used to be an environmental engineer, quite busy. Now I mostly enjoy… reading, and taking walks, when the weather permits. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. I try to eat a healthy diet – lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein. Not much fast food, thankfully. As for exercise… the walks, mostly. I’m not very active, to be honest. I live alone, in a small apartment. It’s quiet, peaceful. I suppose that’s a good description. I don’t have any pets. Is there anything specific you're looking for? Perhaps about my work? It was fairly… sedentary, if that’s relevant. Lots of paperwork, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Verbos. Retired, enjoy reading and walks, non-smoker, occasional alcohol, and a mostly healthy diet. Sedentary work history is relevant. Alright, Mr. Verbos, based on what you've told me, the increased frequency and volume of urination, coupled with your high blood pressure, family history, and lifestyle, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and a few simple tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A physical exam and some tests… yes, please. I trust your judgment. Anything that might help to understand what's going on… I'm happy to cooperate. I understand you need to gather information. Please, proceed at your own pace. I'm not in any particular hurry, you see. Just let me know what to expect. Perhaps you could explain what kind of tests you have in mind? Just so I know what's coming.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. I also want to do a urinalysis – that’s a simple urine test – to look for any signs of infection or other abnormalities. And a blood test to check your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and electrolytes. It will help us to narrow down the possibilities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Blood pressure, pulse, listening to my heart and lungs… a urine test, and a blood test. Yes, please. I understand the purpose of each one, and I'm happy to proceed. I trust your professional judgment implicitly. Just let me know when you're ready, and where you'd like me to go. I'll follow your instructions precisely. I appreciate your thoroughness, you see. I'd like to understand what's going on, and I trust you'll do your best to find out. Perhaps you could tell me where we'll start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with checking your blood pressure and pulse. If you could just sit here, I’ll get everything set up. Then we’ll move on to listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Blood pressure and pulse… yes, of course. Take your time. I’ll just sit here quietly. Please, let me know if you need me to do anything. I trust your expertise completely. I’m ready whenever you are. It’s… a little cold in here, isn’t it? But that's alright. I'm quite comfortable, actually. Just let me know when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. Just relax your arm for me. Taking a deep breath now... and exhale slowly. Blood pressure is 145/88. Pulse is 72 and regular. Okay, that’s good. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breath in… and exhale. Deep breath in… and exhale. Heart sounds are normal. Lung sounds are clear, but a little diminished at the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses. Okay, everything sounds and feels normal so far. Now, we’ll need a urine sample. I’ll give you a container, and I’ll leave you a few minutes of privacy to collect it. There's a restroom just down the hall. Do you need any assistance getting there?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I can manage perfectly well. A urine sample… yes, of course. I understand. And you said my heart and lungs… sounded normal, mostly? A little diminished at the bases… hmm. That doesn’t sound too concerning, does it? I trust your judgment. I’ll just go to the restroom and collect the sample, then. You said just down the hall? Yes, alright. I’ll be right back. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Yes, just down the hall to your left. And the diminished lung sounds are not necessarily a cause for alarm, Mr. Verbos. It can be normal, especially if you're not taking very deep breaths. We’ll just take a look at the urine sample and blood tests to get a clearer picture. Take your time, and let me know when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. All collected. I tried to follow all the instructions… I hope I did it correctly. It’s… not a very pleasant task, you know. But I did my best. It was… a little difficult to get enough, perhaps? But I believe this is sufficient. Now, what’s next? The blood tests, you said? I’m ready whenever you are. Perhaps you could explain the process? Just so I know what to expect. I’m not particularly fond of needles, you see. But I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. This looks fine. And yes, the blood tests are next. I understand your apprehension about needles, many people feel the same way. It will just be a small prick in your arm, and it will be over very quickly. We’ll draw a few vials of blood to check your kidney function, blood sugar, and electrolytes. I’m going to tie a tourniquet around your upper arm to make the veins more prominent. It will feel a little tight. Then, I’ll swab the area with alcohol to sterilize it. And then, a quick prick. Just relax your arm. This will only take a moment. Okay, we’re getting some blood now. Almost done… just a little more. Okay, all done. Keep pressure on this spot for a few minutes to prevent bruising. And I’ll put a bandage on it. Now, we’ll send these samples to the lab, and it should take a few hours to get the results. I'll review them carefully, and we can discuss them then. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: That… wasn't as bad as I anticipated, actually. A little pinch, yes, but over quickly. Thank you for being so gentle, Doctor. You did a very good job. And a few hours, you said? To get the results? Yes, alright. I’ll wait patiently. I trust your expertise. While we’re waiting… is there anything I should be doing? Anything I should avoid? Perhaps drinking more water? Or less water? I don't want to interfere with the results, you see. And… what are you looking for, specifically? In the blood tests? What would a concerning result look like? I apologize for being so inquisitive. I just… like to understand what’s going on. And I worry, you know. It’s just… getting older. Everything starts to… break down.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear it wasn't too bad. And no, you shouldn’t worry at all. It's perfectly natural to be anxious, especially when it comes to your health. As for what you should do, just continue to drink a normal amount of fluids. No need to drastically change anything. And to answer your question about what we're looking for in the blood tests, we'll be checking your kidney function – specifically, creatinine and BUN levels. Elevated levels could indicate kidney problems. We'll also be looking at your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes. And finally, we'll check your electrolytes – sodium, potassium, and chloride – to ensure they're in balance. Concerning results would be elevated creatinine or BUN levels, high blood sugar, or significant imbalances in your electrolytes. But please, don't jump to conclusions. Many things can affect these levels, and we need to see the complete picture before drawing any conclusions. We’ll also be looking at the urine sample for signs of infection, blood, or protein. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, chills, pain in your back or side, or difficulty urinating – please let me know immediately. Otherwise, just relax and try not to worry. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: That… makes sense. Creatinine, BUN, blood sugar, electrolytes… yes. And signs of infection in the urine. It’s… reassuring to know you’re looking for all these things. And you said… a complete picture? That means you won’t jump to conclusions based on just one result? That’s good. Very good. And no fever, chills, or pain… Yes, I’ll keep an eye out for those. I haven’t experienced anything like that, thankfully. Just… the frequent urination. And the tiredness. But that could be anything, you said. Well, Doctor… I believe that’s all my questions for now. I’ll just sit here quietly and wait for the results, then. Thank you for your patience and thoroughness. You’ve been very helpful. And… perhaps you could let me know how to access the results, when they’re ready? Is there a website or a phone number I should use? Or will you contact me directly?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbos. I'm glad I could help. You're right to ask about accessing the results. Our clinic has a secure online patient portal where you can view your lab results, schedule appointments, and communicate with our staff. I'll have the receptionist send you an email with instructions on how to register for the portal. Alternatively, we can also mail you a copy of the results, or I can call you directly to discuss them. Whatever you prefer. In the meantime, just relax and try not to worry. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before the results are available. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that’s all. The patient portal sounds… convenient. I’ll look out for the email. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for your patience. I appreciate your thoroughness. And… I trust your judgment completely. Well, then. I suppose I’ll be going now. Thank you again, Doctor. And… have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbos. You have a good day as well. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
