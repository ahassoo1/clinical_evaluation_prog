DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse told me it was about my cholesterol. They said it was a little high on the blood work, and I wanted to talk about what that means. It’s just… I don’t really know much about it.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, I see here… your cholesterol levels were slightly elevated. It’s good you're addressing this. It can be concerning, but often manageable. To get a better picture, can you tell me a bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, good to know it’s manageable. I try to eat pretty healthy, I think. Lots of vegetables, some chicken, fish a couple times a week… I do like my cheese, though! And I have a sweet tooth, so maybe a little too many cookies sometimes. I bake them myself, you see. It’s a hobby.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Cheese and cookies… alright. And do you happen to know if anyone in your family—parents, siblings—has had high cholesterol or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother, she had high blood pressure, I believe. Not cholesterol, as far as I know. And my father… he was pretty healthy all his life, actually. Never had much trouble with anything. My brother, he’s a bit overweight, but I don’t think he’s ever mentioned anything about cholesterol. I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Just a multivitamin every morning, that’s it. And sometimes I take something for my allergies in the spring, but that’s it. Nothing regularly, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Not a fan, really. I prefer tea, if I’m having something with a meal.
DOCTOR: Good, good. And, Ms. Geho, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me approximately how much physical activity you get in a typical week?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn't say a lot. I walk my dog, Buster, every day – he’s a big fella and needs a good walk! Maybe 30-45 minutes. And I do a little gardening when the weather is nice, but that’s more bending and stretching than exercise, I suppose. I used to swim more, but I haven’t been to the pool in a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and check a few things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, if you could just have a seat here. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll check your pulse. Hmm… heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 132/84, pulse is 72 and regular. Weight is… 124 pounds, height 199 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. 199 centimeters. I’m quite tall, you know!
DOCTOR: Yes, you are. Alright, Ms. Geho, based on what you've told me and the exam, it seems your cholesterol is mildly elevated. We’re not talking about needing immediate medication, but it’s something we should address to prevent it from becoming a bigger issue. I recommend a few lifestyle changes. Primarily, focusing on reducing saturated and trans fats in your diet – things like full-fat dairy, fried foods, and processed snacks. And increasing your physical activity a bit, even just adding an extra walk or two a week. We can also repeat the cholesterol test in three months to see if things improve. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I can definitely try to cut back on the cheese and snacks. And maybe get back to swimming. Three months sounds good, to see if things are better. Will that be a full blood panel again, or just the cholesterol?
DOCTOR: We’ll repeat the lipid panel, which focuses specifically on your cholesterol levels. No need for a full panel at this stage, unless something changes. I’m going to give you a handout with some dietary guidelines and exercise tips. And if you don’t see any improvement after three months, or if you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you. Chest pain or shortness of breath… good to know. Hmm… no, I don't think so. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to talk it through with me. Will this affect my Medicare coverage at all, the repeat test?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. A routine follow-up lipid panel is fully covered by Medicare, Ms. Geho. Don’t worry about that. I believe that covers everything for today. We’ll see you in three months. If you have any questions before then, please don’t hesitate to call. Is there anything else I can help you with?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Sham. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Geho.
