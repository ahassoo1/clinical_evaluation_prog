DOCTOR: Hi Clide, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. It’s this fever… keeps comin’ back. I don't know what’s causing it, honestly. It goes away for a bit, then BAM, it’s back again. It’s been goin’ on for…oh, I’d say about a month now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recurring fever for about a month. That's definitely worth looking into. Can you tell me a little more about the fever itself?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts with chills, even when it's warm out. Then I get really hot, feel kinda shaky. It gets up to, I dunno, maybe 101, 102? I haven’t really been keepin’ track, to be honest. Just know I feel sick. And tired. Really tired. It lasts usually a couple of days, then breaks, and I feel okay for a week or so, then it starts all over again.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills, a temperature you estimate around 101-102, and it comes and goes in cycles lasting a couple of days, with periods of feeling well in between. That's helpful. Do you notice anything else happening when the fever comes on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my muscles ache, like I’ve been workin’ out really hard, but I haven’t. And… yeah, a bit of a headache usually. Not a bad one, just… there. Oh! And I don’t have much of an appetite when it hits. Food just doesn't sound good. I lost a couple pounds, I think. My wife's been worryin' about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches, headache, and loss of appetite with some weight loss. Those all sound like they could be connected. Now, just to get a better picture, have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who's been sick?
PATIENT: No, no travelin’. I mostly just go between the office and home. And no, not that I know of. Nobody at work's been sick, and we haven’t had any family visits recently. I'm a chiropractor, so people come to me when they're feelin' bad, not the other way around, ya know? So, I'd probably know if someone was bringin' somethin' in.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, being a chiropractor you're likely around a lot of people. Let’s talk a little about your past health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. I get a little arthritis in my hands, being a chiropractor and all, but that's it. Nothing the doctor’s ever really worried about. I try to stay active, eat reasonably well… well, when I have an appetite, that is. I've never been a big fan of takin' pills, so I try to avoid the doctor when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical conditions, just some arthritis in your hands. And you prefer to avoid medication when possible, I understand. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries, never been in the hospital. Knock on wood. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, playin' baseball, but that was it. Just a cast for a few weeks. Nothing serious. I pride myself on takin' care of myself, you know? Mostly. This fever thing is… frustratin’.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, a pretty clean medical history. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my parents, they’re both gone now. My mom died a long time ago, heart trouble. My dad, he had… I think it was diabetes, later in life. My wife's side, they're pretty healthy too, as far as I know. Nobody with anythin’ really serious that I can recall. No history of fevers like this, though. It's just… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, no strong family history of similar issues. And just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning with breakfast. And when my arthritis acts up, I take some ibuprofen. That's it. Really. I don't like relyin’ on pills if I can help it. I try to tough it out. But this fever… it's not somethin’ I can just “tough out,” ya know? It knocks me flat.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a problem with pollen or anything like that either. My wife always jokes I have a cast iron stomach. But honestly, this fever… it’s makin’ me feel pretty awful. I just wanna know what’s causing it and how to get rid of it. It’s been long enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very helpful, Clide. No known allergies, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen, no major medical conditions, and a clean family history. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Let's get it over with. I got patients waitin’ for me this afternoon, so the quicker, the better, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you have a busy schedule. Let’s start by checking your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Okay, your temperature is currently 101.3 Fahrenheit. Your pulse is 88 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm also going to take a look at your throat and ears. Your throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Ears look clear as well. Now, I'm going to feel your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are slightly swollen, but not significantly. Finally, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I’m documenting these findings now. So, to summarize, you have a low-grade fever, slightly swollen lymph nodes, and a red throat. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is normal. These findings could indicate a viral infection, but we need to do some further testing to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… thorough. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, X-ray… whatever you need to figure out what’s goin’ on. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… the quicker the better, ya know? I got a practice to run. Is there anythin’ I should be doin’ in the meantime? Drink more water? Stay in bed?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Clide. We'll get these tests ordered right away. The lab is right downstairs, so it shouldn't take too long. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and drinking lots of fluids – water, juice, or broth. You can also take some over-the-counter acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help manage the fever and muscle aches, if needed. Avoid strenuous activity until we have the results back. While we wait for the results, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, severe headache, stiff neck, or confusion – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. We'll review the results as soon as they're available and discuss a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything. Shortness of breath, chest pain… got it. I’ll let you know if anythin’ changes. I appreciate you takin' the time, Doctor. And gettin' these tests done quickly. I really just wanna get back to workin', but more importantly, feelin' better. So, where do I go for these tests? Downstairs, you said?
DOCTOR: Yes, downstairs to the lab. The receptionist there will have a copy of my order. They'll draw some blood and take a chest X-ray. It should take about 30-45 minutes, depending on how busy they are. Once you're done, you can come back up, and we’ll discuss the results as soon as they are available. We'll figure this out, Clide. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Get some rest, and I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate it. I’m headin’ down now. Hopefully, we'll have some answers soon. .
