DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor… well, it’s rather inconvenient, truthfully. I’ve been… not seeing things clearly, and the sounds… they’re muffled. It happened quite suddenly, you see. I simply must get this sorted; I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, suddenly, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, suddenly. Though… when exactly? Honestly, dates… they all blur together. It was… within the last week, I believe. Perhaps a few days. It's all rather upsetting, and I don’t have time for these sorts of things. I am a very important surgeon, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, within the last week. And it's both your vision and your hearing that’s affected?
PATIENT: Yes, both. Though, the vision is… more bothersome, naturally. One needs to see to operate, wouldn’t you agree? The hearing… well, it’s just… irritating. People mumble these days. Honestly, it’s probably nothing. I just want to be certain, and then I need to get back to my patients. They depend on me, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course. To get a better idea, can you describe how your vision is affected?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How to describe it… It’s not blurry, exactly. More like… a dimming. Everything seems… faded. And there’s a sort of… shadow at the edges of my sight. It's… difficult to explain. I suppose I just can’t see things as sharply as I used to. Though, I assure you, it hasn't interfered with my work… yet.
DOCTOR: Okay. And this shadow… is it in both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I… I haven’t really compared them. I simply noticed it. Both, I suppose? It feels… symmetrical, if that makes sense. Honestly, I don’t have time for detailed self-diagnosis. I’m a surgeon, not an optometrist. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. We'll get through this quickly. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. Then we can discuss next steps. I just need to check your eyes and maybe listen to your ears. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, finally. Yes, yes, get on with it. The quicker the better. Honestly, I have a very important case scheduled for tomorrow morning, and I cannot be delayed. And please, be gentle. I have a very delicate touch, you see, and I wouldn't want to… disturb it.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please, have a seat. I'll start with your eyes. Just look straight ahead, and I'll shine a light in each eye.
PATIENT: Very well. But do hurry. I have things to do, important things. And please, try not to poke me in the eye. It's happened before, you know. A rather clumsy fellow, the last doctor I saw. Honestly, the indignity of it all…
DOCTOR: Alright. Vision is 20/40 in both eyes. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. I do see some mild pallor of the optic discs, and the vessels appear slightly…attenuated. Ear canals clear bilaterally. Reduced bone conduction. Now, just to rule a few things out, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Blood pressure and pulse? Honestly, is all this necessary? I’m a perfectly healthy woman. I eat well, I sleep adequately… mostly… and I am extremely active. But… fine. Get it over with, then. Though, I do hope you don't have cold hands. I dislike that immensely.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Ms. Julie, your blood pressure is a little elevated. And the reduced bone conduction, along with the pallor of your optic discs… it's concerning. I need to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any dizziness, headaches, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing in my ears? Oh, yes, sometimes. A slight… tinnitus, I believe the last doctor called it. Though, I simply assumed it was the hospital's dreadful ventilation system. And dizziness… well, I do sometimes feel a little lightheaded when I’ve been on my feet for too long. But that’s hardly unusual, is it? I’m a surgeon! I spend hours in the operating room. Honestly, I hardly think a little lightheadedness is worth fussing over. Are we nearly done? I have a conference call scheduled for one o’clock.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ms. Julie, given your symptoms – the sudden vision and hearing changes, the tinnitus, the occasional dizziness, and the elevated blood pressure… I'm concerned about the possibility of a vascular event. We need to rule out a stroke or transient ischemic attack. I want to get a stat CT scan of your head. And I'm going to order some blood work to check for inflammation and clotting factors. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A stroke?! Honestly, Doctor, you are being rather dramatic. A stroke is what happens to old people, not vital, working surgeons. I assure you, my health is perfectly fine. This is simply a… a temporary inconvenience. A bit of stress, perhaps. I have a very demanding schedule, you see. A CT scan and blood work? Absolutely not. I have a meeting with the hospital board this afternoon. I simply haven't the time for such… excessive testing. Honestly, I think I need a second opinion. A competent second opinion. I do believe I'm wasting my time here. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your concerns, but I have a professional obligation to ensure your safety. Given the sudden onset of these symptoms, dismissing the possibility of a serious medical condition would be irresponsible. I strongly urge you to reconsider. I'm not trying to inconvenience you, but these tests are crucial. If you refuse, I'll document your refusal in your chart. However, I want to be clear that continuing without investigation carries significant risk. Would you at least consider a referral to a neurologist for a prompt evaluation?
