DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, doctor. It’s my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… well, a little while now. Honestly, I don’t keep track of such things. Just…hurts when I swallow. Is that all you need to know? I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: A “little while” can mean different things to different people, Ms. Ottaviani. Is it a few days?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Days? Weeks, maybe? It all blurs together after a time, you understand. It's not a serious pain, if that’s what you’re asking. Just…annoying. And it makes it hard to eat. Really, is there anything else? I don’t have a lot of patience for…details.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything made it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Well… dust. All that dust at the plant. It gets everywhere, you see. And… cold drinks. They always seem to aggravate it. Though, honestly, everything seems to aggravate it these days. Is that helpful? I truly don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I’m not a doctor, you know. I just know my throat hurts. No… fever, I don’t think. No cough. Just… this. It’s probably nothing. Honestly, I just need something to make it stop hurting so I can get back to work. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your neck?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. I… don’t think so. It feels normal. Maybe a little tired, but everything feels a little tired these days. Look, doctor, are we getting somewhere? I don’t have time for a whole examination, you see. Just a quick something for the throat.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I need to perform a quick exam to determine the cause of your sore throat before I can recommend any treatment. It will only take a few minutes. It's important to rule out anything serious. Can you please open your mouth and say “ah”?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? After all this questioning? Honestly. Fine. But make it quick. There. Is that good enough? I have a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your throat is a bit red, and I see some slight swelling. Your tonsils don’t look particularly inflamed, but there's a little bit of debris. Do you have any difficulty breathing or swallowing besides the pain?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? No! I’m standing here, aren’t I? I can swallow, though it hurts. Like I've told you repeatedly. Look, doctor, is this going to take much longer? Honestly, I'm starting to feel a bit lightheaded just sitting here. I need to get back to the plant. They're relying on me. Is there a quick pill you can prescribe or not?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I understand you're busy, but rushing through this isn't going to help. It’s possible this is just a common viral infection, but it’s also important to rule out other possibilities, like strep throat. I’m going to do a quick strep test. It’s a simple swab, and it will give us a definitive answer. Can I do that for you?
PATIENT: A swab? Oh, absolutely not. I don’t like things poked and prodded. And ‘strep’… that sounds dreadful! Look, I’ve felt unwell before, and I’ve always gotten over it. Just give me something for the pain, please. An antibiotic, maybe? Those always work. I really don’t have time for tests and… and nonsense. I'm sure it's nothing. Honestly, I've never needed a test in my life. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I understand your reluctance, but prescribing antibiotics without a confirmed diagnosis is not only irresponsible but can also contribute to antibiotic resistance. I am concerned about your sore throat, and I need to rule out strep before I can proceed. If you refuse the strep test, I cannot prescribe any medication. Given your symptoms and refusal of testing, and without knowing your medical history, I recommend you see a specialist for a more thorough evaluation. I’m referring you to Dr. Alistair Chen, an ENT specialist. Here's a referral slip. I suggest you schedule an appointment with him as soon as possible. .
