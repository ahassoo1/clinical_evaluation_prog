DOCTOR: Hi Burdette, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's rather obvious, isn’t it? I seem to be losing my senses. My vision…it's gone cloudy, and I can scarcely hear a thing. Honestly, I haven’t got all day to explain the bleeding obvious.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. It sounds concerning that you're noticing changes in both your vision and hearing. While it feels obvious to you – and I appreciate you pointing it out – it’s important for me to get a clear picture of how these changes have been happening. Could you tell me a little more about your vision?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t recall precisely when it started. Some time ago, I suppose. Things just…became less clear. It's not as if I spend my days cataloging the exact moment my eyesight deteriorated. It just…did. Is that sufficient detail for you? I have a luncheon appointment, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Burdette. It's perfectly alright if you don’t have exact dates. "Some time ago" is helpful. Is it a change in both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor, must you ask such basic questions? Both, naturally. Why would it be just one? Do you think I haven’t noticed which eyes are affected? Honestly, the questions you’re asking... It’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be frustrated, Burdette, and I apologize if my questions seem basic. It's just that I need to rule out different possibilities. Sometimes changes only affect one eye, and that can point to specific issues. Okay, so both eyes are affected. Has the cloudiness been getting worse gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been…a bit of both, I think. Some days it’s better, some days it’s worse. It's not a linear progression, if that’s what you’re asking. Really, it’s all rather muddled in my memory. I simply know it’s unpleasant and interfering with my life. Is that helpful? Because frankly, I’m not a medical historian.
DOCTOR: "A bit of both," fluctuating… alright, that's useful. And you said it's interfering with your life – can you tell me specifically how?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, how does one live when one can’t see properly and can barely hear? Reading is difficult, of course. Social engagements are tiresome, trying to decipher conversations. It’s all rather obvious, isn’t it? I prefer activities that require a certain… finesse. Things that are now simply… impossible. Honestly, must I spell everything out?
DOCTOR: No, you don’t need to spell everything out. It sounds very frustrating, and I appreciate you telling me how it’s affecting your daily life. Let's move on to the hearing. When did you first notice changes in your hearing, and how would you describe them?
PATIENT: Oh, the hearing. Another obvious issue, really. It’s been…gradual, I suppose. People mumble, you know? They simply don’t articulate properly these days. And everything sounds…distant. Like I’m underwater. It makes conversations terribly draining. Honestly, it's exhausting trying to follow what people are saying. It started…sometime after the vision, I think. A vague recollection, if that's sufficient.
DOCTOR: Gradual onset, sounds distant, like underwater… and after the vision changes. Okay. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, Burdette?
PATIENT: Ringing? Honestly, Doctor, I have a rather full life. I don't spend my time listening for phantom noises. I suppose…occasionally…a faint buzzing. But it’s hardly significant. Probably just the stress of dealing with these…ailments. Is that what you’re looking for? Because I assure you, I do not have time for a comprehensive audit of every sound my ears produce.
DOCTOR: No, of course not. Just trying to get a complete picture. So, occasional faint buzzing. Have you ever been exposed to loud noises, Burdette?
PATIENT: Loud noises? Doctor, I live in a city. The constant din is inescapable! Traffic, construction…people shouting. It’s a miracle I have any hearing left at all, frankly. I used to attend the opera, of course, but that was years ago. Before…everything. Do you really think that's relevant? I was always very careful to protect my ears.
DOCTOR: City living, exposure to noise, occasional opera attendance… Okay. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Doctor, are we seriously still at this? Must I provide a complete medical history? I was a surgeon for forty years! I understand the importance of thoroughness, but this is bordering on excessive. I’ve had the usual aches and pains that come with age, naturally. Some…cardiac issues, perhaps. Nothing significant. My former husband was a doctor, you know. He kept meticulous records. I haven’t bothered since the divorce. Is that adequate? I have a luncheon waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Burdette. It sounds like you've had a very full life and a career in medicine yourself. "Usual aches and pains," and some cardiac issues. Do you happen to know what those cardiac issues were diagnosed as?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it was years ago. Something about…irregular heartbeat, I think. Atrial fibrillation, perhaps? It wasn't anything serious. Managed with medication for a time. I stopped taking it years ago. It wasn't interfering with my life. Honestly, I find dwelling on the past rather unproductive. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply cataloging my life's misfortunes? I really must insist...I'm wasting valuable time. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Atrial fibrillation in the past, managed with medication. Okay. One last quick question before I do a brief physical exam: Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
