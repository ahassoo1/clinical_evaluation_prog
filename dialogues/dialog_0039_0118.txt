DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. Welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good morning to you as well, Doctor… Kamahele, was it? Honestly, I can’t quite recall all the specifics. Something about… a certification, I believe. Routine, I hope? One must keep up appearances, you understand. It’s simply good practice. Though, I do find these yearly checks rather… unnecessary, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Routine certifications… it can be a bit much to keep track of. I understand. Let's try to piece things together. When did you last feel completely well, or notice any changes in your health, even small ones?
PATIENT: “Completely well…” That’s a rather broad question, isn’t it? I suppose… well, it’s been some time since I felt particularly unwell. Though my memory isn’t what it used to be. Last autumn, perhaps? No, no, that was when the gardener nearly ruined my prize-winning hydrangeas. Utterly dreadful. As for my health… I suppose I’ve felt… adequately functional. Is that a sufficient answer? I do try to maintain a certain… standard.
DOCTOR: “Adequately functional” is a good starting point, Mr. Oriley. It sounds like things have been gradually changing, and that’s alright. We can take our time. Just trying to get a sense of anything new that's been bothering you. Any issues with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Well, Doctor, I am a man of routine, as I’ve mentioned. I retire at eleven, precisely. And awaken at six. Though, I must admit, the quality… isn't what it once was. A little restless, perhaps. But that’s likely due to… the neighbors, you understand. Dreadfully loud children. Always running about. It disrupts the peace. Though, I wouldn’t want to seem like a complainer. It’s just… one expects a certain level of decorum.
DOCTOR: Restless sleep and a bit of disruption… I understand. It’s good you have such a regular schedule, though. And it sounds like the neighbors are contributing to that restlessness. Aside from the sleep and the…neighbors, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, Doctor, are you suggesting I’m ill? I assure you, I’m perfectly…capable. Though, now that you mention it… I have been finding it rather difficult to…concentrate lately. It's a fleeting thing, you understand. A momentary lapse, perhaps. Nothing of consequence. I simply find myself… distracted. And occasionally, a slight ringing in my ears. But that’s probably just the plumbing. This building is quite old, you know. It creaks and groans constantly. Honestly, it’s enough to drive a man to distraction.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re noticing these things, Mr. Oriley. Difficulty concentrating and ringing in the ears… those are certainly things we should look into. Just to be thorough. Have you noticed any dizziness, or trouble with your balance at all?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Now that’s an interesting question. I did stumble slightly on the stairs last week… but that was undoubtedly due to the rug. My housekeeper, bless her soul, insists on moving things around. It’s utterly chaotic. And no, I wouldn’t say I’ve experienced any…persistent dizziness. Just a momentary wobble. Nothing to concern oneself with. Though, it did rather ruin a perfectly good waistcoat. A rather expensive one, I might add. Really, the inconvenience… it's quite dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no persistent dizziness, just the one instance with the rug. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, perhaps?
PATIENT: Vision… Well, everything seems… adequately clear. Though I do find myself needing to hold things a little further away when reading the newspaper. And the print is getting rather small these days, isn't it? It’s a conspiracy, I tell you! They’re deliberately reducing the font size to… to what, I’m not quite sure. But it’s terribly inconvenient. And I suppose the colors aren’t as…vibrant as they once were. But that’s likely due to the lighting in the room. It’s rather…dim, wouldn’t you agree? Honestly, it’s hardly conducive to comfortable reading.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Let's just do a quick check of your vision, reflexes and ears. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An examination, you say? Well, I suppose it can’t be helped. Though I must warn you, I do dislike being prodded and poked. It’s rather undignified. But very well, proceed. Quickly, if you please. I have a rather important appointment with my solicitor this afternoon. A matter of… estate planning. A delicate situation, you understand. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just look straight ahead, please. I'm just going to shine a light in your eyes to check the back of them. Okay, looking good. A little bit of age-related change, as expected, but nothing concerning. Now, let's listen to your ears. Ears look clear. A little wax buildup, but nothing that would explain the ringing you’re experiencing. Reflexes are a little diminished, but again, that's common with age. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Walking, you say? Honestly, Doctor, I walk perfectly adequately. Though my knees do occasionally creak. It’s the weather, you know. Dampness gets to them. There. Perfectly steady, wouldn't you agree? Though I must say, this floor is rather slippery. It’s a hazard, really. One could easily… lose one’s balance. Honestly, this building needs a complete overhaul. It’s falling apart, you know. A disgrace, really. Well? What’s the verdict? Am I about to succumb to some dreadful ailment?
DOCTOR: You're walking perfectly adequately, Mr. Oriley, and no, you are not about to succumb to any dreadful ailment. Your gait is slightly wider than usual and you are a little hesitant, which is common with age and can be caused by changes in balance. The hesitancy and creaking are likely due to normal wear and tear on your joints. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some typical age-related changes. The memory lapses, sleep disturbance, ringing in the ears, difficulty concentrating, and vision changes… they’re all things that can happen as we get older. However, it's good you mentioned these things, and we want to rule out anything more serious. To be on the safe side, I would recommend a hearing test and a basic cognitive assessment, just to get a baseline. And I also recommend a referral to an ophthalmologist to check your vision more thoroughly. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Assessments and referrals… Honestly, Doctor, it's always something, isn't it? So much bother. I suppose if you insist. Though I must warn you, I do dislike being subjected to these… tests. They're so undignified, and frankly, a waste of perfectly good time. Very well, proceed with your assessments and referrals. But quickly, if you please. And make sure they don't take up too much of my afternoon. I have a rather important engagement with my solicitor, you understand. A matter of… estate planning. A delicate situation, really. And please, ensure the hearing test is conducted in a quiet room. I have no desire to strain my ears any further. The neighbors are loud enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. I'll get the referrals scheduled for you. We'll find a quiet room for the hearing test, and I'll make sure the appointment times work as well as possible with your schedule. In the meantime, try to get a good night's sleep, and stay hydrated. I'll have my assistant schedule these for you and get you all the information you need. Here you are. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Oriley. .
