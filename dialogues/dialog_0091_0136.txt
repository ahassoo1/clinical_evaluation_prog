DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fogelstrom. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well... I keep belching. It's... embarrassing, really. A lot of it. It started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can certainly be disruptive and uncomfortable. A few weeks, you said. Could you describe what you mean by "a lot"?
PATIENT: Like... after I eat, mostly. And sometimes even when I haven't eaten much. Maybe ten or fifteen times after a meal? It's not constant, but... more than normal, you know? It's just... a lot of air coming up. Sometimes it doesn't even feel like I want to belch, it just… happens.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying. That does sound bothersome. And it’s helpful to know it occurs primarily after meals, and sometimes seemingly spontaneously. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the belching?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Sometimes my stomach feels a little full, even if I don't eat a big meal. And... maybe a little heartburn? Not bad, but it's there sometimes. Not every time, though. I don't really get sick to my stomach, or anything like that. Just those two things, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness and occasional heartburn. Thank you. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, my appetite is okay. I eat pretty normal. And no weight loss, no. If anything, I maybe gained a little, but nothing much. I like to cook, so I taste things a lot!
DOCTOR: That makes sense. It sounds like you have a good appetite. Now, let’s briefly go over your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Um... not really. I had the usual childhood things, like chickenpox. But nothing serious. No asthma, no diabetes, nothing like that. I don't go to the doctor much, if I can help it. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Everything has always been... okay. Until the belching, that is! It's just... annoying. And a little embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, regarding your family history – do any of your close relatives have any significant medical conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease , ulcers, or other digestive problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother, she had heartburn a lot when she was older. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, she had problems with her stomach, I think. Something with acid, maybe? But I don't really know a lot of details. They didn't talk about it much. It was a long time ago, and… well, we weren’t very close, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heartburn and some stomach issues. Thank you. And finally, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh! You mean... do I drink or smoke? No, not at all. Never have. I don't really go out much, either. I like to be at home, cooking, watching TV… things like that. Pretty quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. I like a lot of different foods, actually. Spicy food, sometimes. That doesn't bother me, at least. I think I'm okay with everything. No bad reactions to anything I can remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fogelstrom, thank you for providing me with this information. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing excessive belching accompanied by occasional fullness and heartburn, with no significant medical history or allergies. Before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes, if I have a headache, I take ibuprofen, but that’s it. Just when I need it. Not every day, or even every month. And no supplements, no vitamins... nothing like that. I try to get everything from my food.
DOCTOR: Thank you. In order to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything hurts.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, but there is some mild distension. I didn’t find any areas of significant tenderness. Now, I'm going to have you stand so I can auscultate for any abnormalities.
PATIENT: Okay. That's fine. I feel a little bloated sometimes, like you said. Especially after I eat. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fogelstrom. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on my examination, there are no immediate concerns, but the bloating and belching are certainly bothersome. At this point, I suspect this may be related to a functional gastrointestinal disorder, possibly related to increased gas production or altered gut motility. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, thyroid function, and celiac disease screening. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Um… okay, I guess. If you think it's necessary. I don't really like needles, but… if it will help find out what's wrong, then yes. How much blood will they take? And will it hurt a lot?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It’s perfectly normal to be apprehensive about needles. It’s just a standard amount, a few vials, and a trained phlebotomist will be performing the draw. It’s usually a quick pinch, and it shouldn’t hurt excessively. We’ll also provide a bandage afterward. The blood tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as thyroid problems or celiac disease. We'll also assess for any signs of inflammation. Would you like me to explain why each test is important?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I don't understand a lot of medical stuff. If you can explain it to me in simple words, that would be great. What's… celiac disease? And what does my thyroid have to do with my belching?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition triggered by gluten – a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including bloating, abdominal pain, and digestive issues. While it doesn't always present with classic symptoms, it's important to rule it out, as it requires a specific dietary management. Now, the thyroid gland regulates your metabolism. An underactive thyroid, called hypothyroidism, can slow down your digestive system, leading to constipation, bloating, and even altered gut motility. It's less common, but it’s a possibility we want to investigate. The complete blood count will check for any signs of anemia or infection, which could also contribute to digestive upset. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… so, it's just to check everything, to make sure nothing else is wrong? Gluten… I eat bread sometimes, but not a lot. And I think I had a sandwich yesterday. So, if I have celiac disease, I have to stop eating bread? Is that right? It sounds… complicated. And what if it's my thyroid? What do they do then?
DOCTOR: That’s exactly right – it’s to rule out other possibilities. And yes, if you were diagnosed with celiac disease, it would require following a strict gluten-free diet. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll get the test results first, and then we’ll discuss the next steps if needed. If your thyroid is underactive, it’s generally treated with a daily medication called levothyroxine, which replaces the thyroid hormone your body isn’t producing. It’s a very common and effective treatment. For now, let's focus on getting the blood tests done. I'll write you a lab order, and the phlebotomist will be able to answer any questions you have about the procedure. In the meantime, I also recommend keeping a food diary to track what you're eating and when your symptoms occur. This can help us identify any potential trigger foods. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay… a food diary. Yes, I can do that. I have a little notebook at home. And the blood tests… I guess I'll just go to the lab and they'll take the blood? How long does it take to get the results? Will you tell me when they come back?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. You’ll go to the lab, and they’ll collect a small sample of blood. They will give you instructions on any necessary preparations, such as fasting. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I'll have the results sent directly to my office, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very well. I was really worried, but I feel a little better now. I'll go to the lab and I'll try to keep a food diary. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fogelstrom. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or if anything changes. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment.
