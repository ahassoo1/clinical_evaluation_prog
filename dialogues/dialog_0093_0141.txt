DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. It’s just… everywhere, and it’s been going on for a little while now. Not horrible, but definitely annoying. It’s all over, arms, legs, back… you name it. I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. Itching can be quite disruptive, even if it isn't severe. “All over,” you say. That gives us a good starting point. To help me understand what might be causing this, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn’t really look like anything, you know? No rash, no bumps… just…itchiness. It comes and goes, sometimes worse at night. And it doesn't seem to be from anything specific, I haven't changed soaps or anything like that. I did start taking a new vitamin supplement about a month ago, a multi-vitamin, but I don’t know if that’s it. I’ve been trying lotions, but nothing seems to really help for very long.
DOCTOR: So, no visible rash or bumps, the itching is generalized, fluctuates in intensity, is worse at night, and hasn't been associated with any obvious triggers like new soaps or detergents. You also mentioned starting a new multi-vitamin about a month ago. That’s helpful information. And the lotions haven’t provided sustained relief, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor. The lotions help a little while you’re putting them on, but it doesn’t last. And yeah, about the vitamin… it's one of those all-in-one kinds, you know? Lots of different things in it. I figured it couldn't hurt to take it, but now I'm wondering if maybe that’s the culprit. It’s got… oh, let me think… Vitamin D, C, zinc, something called biotin… a whole list, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s very helpful. It's good you can recall the ingredients. We'll certainly consider that. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I was married for a long time, but my wife passed away a few years back. Aside from that… I haven’t had a lot of serious illnesses, thankfully. I had the usual childhood stuff – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing major. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but recovered fine. I take a little medication for my blood pressure, just a low dose. And, uh… I’m on Medicare, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. I see here that you were indeed treated for cholecystectomy ten years ago and are currently on a low dose of lisinopril for hypertension. Good to confirm. Now, regarding family history, are there any skin conditions, allergies, or other medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had eczema when she was younger, I think. Nothing serious, just itchy skin. And my father… he had high blood pressure, like me. Oh, and my sister… she’s got seasonal allergies, pretty bad every spring. Aside from that, I don’t really know of anything major. We weren’t a very… medical family, if you know what I mean. Didn’t really talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly. Many families aren’t focused on detailed medical histories. This is still helpful information, thank you. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never have. Always thought it was a bad habit. My wife didn't like it, either. I do drink a little… maybe a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. Nothing heavy, really. And I try to stay active, I walk most days, usually about a mile or so. I used to be a lot more active, but… well, things change.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about the walking. Maintaining activity is very important. And a glass of wine with dinner is unlikely to be a significant factor. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. No bee stings, no shellfish… nothing. I can eat pretty much anything. I sometimes get a little sniffly when the pollen count is high, but that’s just seasonal, I think. Not a full-blown allergy, just a little congestion.
DOCTOR: Good. That simplifies things. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, could you please tell me what medications you are currently taking, including the dosage?
PATIENT: Sure. Just the lisinopril, like I said. It's 10 milligrams, once a day. I take it every morning with my coffee. And the multi-vitamin… let me see, the bottle says it's one tablet a day, and there's a whole list of stuff in it, but I don’t have the exact amounts memorized, sorry. It's one of those big ones, you know? From the drugstore.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Thank you for that comprehensive history. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also take a close look at your skin to see if we can identify any visible clues. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to help in any way I can. Just let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Good. And another one… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your skin. I’m not seeing any obvious rash, hives, or lesions on your arms. The skin appears generally healthy, although it is slightly dry. Legs are similar – no rash, no visible abnormalities. Back is also clear. I do note some mild dryness overall. No significant findings on physical examination. The mild dryness is consistent with the itching you’ve described, but doesn't explain the widespread nature of the symptom.
PATIENT: So, what do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m a little worried, to be honest. It's just been going on for so long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Ferneding. It's natural to worry when something persists. Based on the history and the physical examination, it’s unlikely to be something serious, but we need to investigate further to determine the cause. Several things could be contributing to your itching. Dry skin, as we noted, is a possibility. However, given its widespread nature and persistence, we should consider other causes. It could be a mild allergic reaction to something you’re exposed to, even if you haven’t identified a specific trigger. The new multi-vitamin is also a potential culprit, as certain vitamins can sometimes cause skin reactions. Less commonly, it could be related to an underlying medical condition, though your other symptoms don't suggest that at this point. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These tests will check your liver function, kidney function, and rule out any common causes of itching. We will also test for a complete blood count. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Blood tests are fine. Anything to figure out what's going on. I just want to be able to sleep through the night again, you know? It's the scratching that bothers me most. So, what do I need to do? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Ferneding. Restful sleep is essential. As for the blood tests, yes, there are a few things. You will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand – meaning no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. Water is fine. You can take your usual medications, but please inform the lab technician about everything you're taking when you arrive. The lab is located just down the hall, and they'll give you specific instructions when you check in. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. I anticipate the results will be available in approximately three to five business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to review them then. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Three to five days is fine. I’ll make a note to fast and remember to tell the lab tech about my medication. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a lot better already just knowing we’re looking into it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I'm glad I could reassure you. In the meantime, you can continue using your lotion if it provides some temporary relief. Avoid scratching as much as possible, as that can worsen the irritation. Here is the requisition form for the blood tests. Please take this with you to the lab. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. I really appreciate it. Thank you again for seeing me today.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I am happy to have been of assistance. I will see you at your follow-up appointment in a few days. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Have a good day, and try to get some rest. .
