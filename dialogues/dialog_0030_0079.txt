DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly? I’ve been bruising like crazy lately, and it’s kinda worrying me. I’m on a blood thinner, so I figured I should get it checked out. It just seems…more than usual, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Bruising easily when you're on a blood thinner is certainly something we need to investigate. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Sure. Okay, so… they pop up really easily. Like, I bumped my arm on the doorframe the other day – just a little bump – and ended up with a huge purple spot. And I didn’t even remember bumping it, to be honest. They're also… bigger than they used to be, I think. And they last longer. It’s mostly on my arms and legs, but I think I saw one starting on my back yesterday. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. It sounds like the bruising is more frequent, larger, and perhaps appearing spontaneously, which is definitely something we want to look into. And you mentioned you're on a blood thinner. Do you know what medication you're taking, and how long have you been on it?
PATIENT: Yeah, um… let me think. It’s… Warfarin, I think? Something like that. It starts with a “W”. And I’ve been taking it for… oh gosh… maybe five years now? Something like that. It was after my… well, never mind. Five years, give or take a few months. I get it refilled regularly, so the pharmacy knows all the details, probably better than I do! I just take the pills, you know? I don’t really pay attention to everything else.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to leave those details to the pharmacy. Okay, Ms. Hainley. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, um… I had a blood clot in my leg a long time ago, that’s why I’m on the Warfarin. Other than that… I’ve had the usual stuff, you know? Colds, flu, a broken wrist when I was a kid. Nothing major, honestly. I don’t really go to the doctor much unless I have to. I try to stay healthy, eat well, walk when I can. I don’t really have any allergies that I know of. Does that help? I'm not sure what else you need to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good start. Knowing about the previous blood clot is very important. And are there any medications you take besides the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Just… the usual stuff. You know, over-the-counter things. I take ibuprofen sometimes for aches and pains, and a multivitamin. Oh, and I have a cream for my skin, it's got vitamin E in it. That's it, I think. Really. I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it. Is ibuprofen okay with the… Warfarin? I don't really remember the doctor ever saying anything about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Ibuprofen can interact with Warfarin, so it’s good you asked. Now, Ms. Hainley, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, my mom… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he had heart problems, but he didn't really go to the doctor much either. It wasn't something we talked about a lot. I have a brother, he’s healthy as a horse, as far as I know. And I have a couple of kids, but they’re both healthy too. Honestly, there isn’t much history of anything serious, if that makes sense? It's mostly just… everyday stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. It sounds like there isn’t a strong family history of bleeding disorders or other related conditions. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Nope, never smoked a day in my life. And I… I have a glass of wine sometimes, maybe once a week? Not even. It's mostly just to relax. I don’t drink beer or anything hard. I'm not much of a drinker, really. I prefer tea, if you can believe it. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t necessarily matter, but it’s good to have a complete picture. Alright, Ms. Hainley. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on with all the bruising, so go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay. I’m seeing quite a few bruises, as you mentioned, on your arms and legs. They range in color, which suggests they are at different stages of healing. They do feel somewhat tender to the touch. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at the moment. I don’t see any other unusual markings on your skin. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will help us assess your clotting factors and rule out any other potential causes for the bruising. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. If that’s what you think is best. I just want to know why this is happening, so yeah, go ahead and order the tests. As long as it figures out what's going on, I’m happy to do whatever.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m ordering a complete blood count , a prothrombin time and international normalized ratio – which are important for monitoring Warfarin – and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function. We’ll also do a coagulation panel to look at other clotting factors. It will take a few days to get the results back. Here's the requisition form. You can take this to the lab on the first floor. They will draw your blood. Do you have any questions about the tests or the process?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. First floor, right? I think I can manage that. It all sounds… complicated. But if you think it's necessary, then I trust you. Just… let me know when the results are back, okay? I'm kinda worried about all this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. We’ll contact you as soon as the results are back, usually within 3-5 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, if you experience any unusually heavy bleeding, such as nosebleeds that won’t stop, blood in your urine or stool, or severe headaches, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. You've answered everything. Just… thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It’s kinda scary when things just… start happening for no reason.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hainley. It’s my job to help, and we’ll work through this together. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please take care.
