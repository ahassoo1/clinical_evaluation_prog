DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste any time. Please, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. Took long enough to get an appointment, I’ll tell you that much. It’s my foot. A terrible sore. Been bothering me for weeks, and it just…won't heal. I've tried all sorts of things, you know. Things my mother used to do. But nothing seems to work like it used to.
DOCTOR: “Weeks,” you say?
PATIENT: Oh, at least six weeks, I’d say. Maybe longer. Time sort of…blurs when you’re uncomfortable, you know? It's on the bottom of my right foot. Right near my heel. It's not just a little scrape, either. It’s quite deep. And it smells… well, let's just say it’s not pleasant. I keep it covered, naturally, but it’s no use. It just gets worse and worse.
DOCTOR: Right. And you’ve been…self-treating. With remedies from your mother, you mentioned?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My mother was a very practical woman. She knew all sorts of things. Poultices, mostly. And soaking it in saltwater. And keeping it very clean. But this…this isn’t like the scrapes we used to get running around the island. This is different. And honestly, I suspect it’s this…sugar problem the last doctor mentioned. It feels connected, somehow. You know, everything is connected.
DOCTOR: “Sugar problem,” meaning diabetes, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s what he called it. Diabetes. Sounds…foreign. Not a word we used back home. He poked and prodded and said I needed to watch my sweets. As if that’s the reason for everything. My mother lived to be ninety-two and she ate pandan cake every single day. It's this foot, I tell you. Something’s wrong with my foot. Not just because of a bit of sugar. It’s deeper than that, I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Well, we shall see, Ms. Cannington. Let's have a look at this foot of yours, shall we?
PATIENT: Finally. It’s about time. Don’t mind the slippers, I try to keep it covered as much as possible. It's really quite unpleasant to look at, so don't be surprised. And please, be gentle. It’s very sensitive. It's right here, see? Underneath all this padding.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. A rather…extensive ulceration. And significant surrounding erythema. There is also a notable amount of…exudate. Do you have any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? No, nothing like that. Just…pain. Constant, throbbing pain. It’s worse when I try to walk, of course. And it keeps me up at night. I’ve been taking some of those little white pills the last doctor gave me, for the pain. They help a little, but not nearly enough. Honestly, I think he just wanted to get me out of his office. He didn't seem to understand the…severity of it. It’s not just a little ache, you know. It's a problem. A serious problem.
DOCTOR: And you mentioned these "little white pills"?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… they’re in a little orange bottle. Tylenol, I think it said. The standard kind, nothing special. Two at a time, whenever the pain gets bad. And I try to keep my foot elevated, like he told me. Though it’s not easy to prop it up all the time. I still need to cook and keep house, you know. Can’t just lie around all day. Though, truthfully, some days I wish I could. It’s just… exhausting. This whole thing. Oh, that's tender. Be careful!
DOCTOR: Yes, well, of course it’s tender. It’s an open wound, Ms. Cannington. Now, do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot?
PATIENT: Numbness? Not exactly… more like… a sort of…fuzziness. Like when your foot falls asleep. But it doesn’t go away completely. It’s always there, just a little bit. Especially in my toes. And they feel…cold, even when they're not. Honestly, it’s hard to describe. It’s not a sharp pain, it's just… not right. It feels distant, somehow. Like it's not really my foot anymore. It's getting worse, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given the size and appearance of the ulceration, coupled with your reported numbness and “fuzziness”, and your history of… elevated blood sugar… it is likely this is a diabetic foot ulcer. I need to order some labs to assess the extent of the infection, and we will need to obtain imaging to rule out any underlying osteomyelitis. This requires immediate attention, Ms. Cannington.
PATIENT: Immediate attention? Well, I told the last doctor! He just brushed me off. Labs and imaging… what does that even mean? Is it going to be painful? Will I have to be in the hospital? Honestly, all this talk of… infection and osteomyelitis is quite frightening. And I still have to cook dinner! What am I going to do? Will I lose my foot?
DOCTOR: Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Ms. Cannington. "Losing your foot" is an extreme scenario at this point. The labs and imaging will simply allow us to determine the severity of the infection and whether it has spread to the bone. As for the cooking, you will need to arrange for someone to assist you. This is a medical emergency, and your priorities must shift accordingly. I will write an order for blood work and an X-ray of your foot. The lab technician will draw the blood, and we will send you to radiology for the imaging immediately. I will also have my nurse prepare a referral to a podiatrist for further evaluation. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. Not to anything I know of, really. I eat everything. Fish, breadfruit, taro… I never had any trouble. Though, I did have a bit of a rash once, when I used a new soap. But that was years ago. My mother always said I had tough skin. Resilient. Oh, wait! I had a reaction to penicillin, when I was a little girl. A very bad rash. Swelling and everything. So, definitely no penicillin. That's the one thing I remember. And make sure it’s not…the red kind. The red penicillin always made me sick. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. Very good. We will, of course, avoid penicillin and related antibiotics. Now, I am going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an HbA1c to assess your overall health and blood sugar control. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide you with instructions for the X-ray. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Understand? Well, I understand that you’re ordering a lot of tests. And that I have to get blood drawn. And an…X-ray. It all sounds very…complicated. And frightening. And I still don’t know what any of it means. But I suppose if it will help my foot… Will the nurse explain everything? And how long will this take? I have to start preparing dinner soon. My grandson is coming over. He loves my pandan cake. Honestly, this whole thing is ruining everything.
DOCTOR: The nurse will provide basic instructions. I’m a physician, Ms. Cannington, not a hand-holder. The length of time will depend on the radiology department's schedule. It's a matter of prioritizing your medical needs. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else? Honestly! That's a rude question. I'm sitting here, worried sick about losing my foot, and you ask me if there's anything else? I suppose I could ask about all the pain medication I'll need. And how long I'll have to stay off my foot. And if I'll even be able to make pandan cake again. But honestly, I’m too overwhelmed to even ask. Never mind. Just…get the tests done. And please…be gentle. .
