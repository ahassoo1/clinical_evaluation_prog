DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to put it simply, I’m having some…difficulty with the masks at my work. Protective Services, you see. It’s causing me some trouble, and I was hoping we could discuss a possible exemption, or maybe find another way to handle things. I appreciate your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Protective Services… right. And this difficulty with the masks… is it a physical discomfort, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: It's…difficult to explain, Doctor. It isn’t so much a pain, you understand. It's more a feeling…a weight on my spirit, almost. It makes it hard to focus, to be present with the people I’m helping. It feels…wrong, somehow, to have something covering my face when I need to be…open. My people, the Lakota, we have traditions about the face, about breathing freely. It’s hard to explain to someone who hasn’t lived it, I suppose. I don’t want to sound foolish.
DOCTOR: I understand you have cultural concerns. While I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Knabenshue, we do need to establish a medical basis for any exemption. It's…unconventional, to say the least, to grant one based solely on spiritual discomfort. Now, have you experienced any physical symptoms while wearing the mask?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand completely. I wouldn't ask without a good reason. Physical…well, sometimes my breathing feels a little short. Not like I’m suffocating, not at all. Just…shallower. And my head…it feels a bit tight, like a pressure behind my eyes. It’s worse when I’m stressed, which, as you can imagine, happens often in my line of work. Is that the sort of thing you’re looking for? I haven't been to a doctor in a long time, so I don't know all the proper terms.
DOCTOR: “A bit tight,” “a little short”… these are rather vague descriptions, Mr. Knabenshue. We need to be more precise. Do you experience dizziness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t get dizzy. Not at all. It's not like that. It’s more…a feeling of being closed in. Like I'm not able to take a full, proper breath. My chest doesn't hurt, but it feels…restricted. Like there’s a band around it. And sometimes, when I’m wearing the mask for a long time, I feel…disconnected. Like I'm observing things from a distance, instead of being fully present. Does that make any sense? I’m trying my best to explain it. It’s not a physical pain, but it’s…unsettling.
DOCTOR: “Disconnected,” “unsettling”… I see. Well, let’s conduct a brief physical examination to rule out any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to these sensations. Perhaps we can identify a physiological cause. Please, take a deep breath for me, Mr. Knabenshue.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds sensible. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I just want to find a way to continue doing my job, and to feel…right while I’m doing it. Please, take your time.
DOCTOR: Lungs sound…clear. Though your respiratory rate is slightly elevated. Pulse is also a bit quick, but that could be due to anxiety. Blood pressure is within normal limits. Now, open your mouth and say “ah.” Throat appears normal. No visible inflammation. Lymph nodes are not swollen. Everything appears physically normal, Mr. Knabenshue. Which, frankly, complicates matters. Do you have any history of anxiety or depression?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not as far as I know. I’ve had difficult times, certainly, like everyone. My life hasn’t always been easy. But I haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything. My grandmother…she had strong medicines, traditional ways of dealing with things. She always said a clear mind comes from a clear spirit. I suppose what I'm experiencing could be…stress. But it feels deeper than that, Doctor. It feels connected to the mask itself. To having my face covered. It’s hard to explain…it feels like a violation, somehow. Not a malicious violation, but…a disconnect from who I am.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, with all due respect, we are venturing into…subjective territory. While I acknowledge your cultural beliefs and your description of this “disconnection,” a medical exemption requires a demonstrable physiological basis. I'm not equipped to diagnose…spiritual distress. Have you considered counseling?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. Perfectly. You’re a medical professional, and I respect that. Counseling…I haven’t, no. My people, we have our own ways of seeking guidance. Talking to Elders, spending time in prayer…things like that. It’s not that I’m against counseling, Doctor. It’s just…it doesn’t feel like the right path for this. I suppose I was hoping you might be able to offer some kind of…accommodation. Perhaps a different type of mask? Or a way to limit my exposure? I don't want to be a burden, but my work is important to me. And I want to be able to do it with respect for my spirit, as well as for the people I serve.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, I can document your concerns, and perhaps your supervisor will be willing to make some adjustments to your work schedule. However, I cannot, in good conscience, provide a medical exemption based on the information you've presented. You are within acceptable health parameters. I recommend you explore alternative coping mechanisms for stress, as well as discussing your concerns with Human Resources. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: I see. No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Thank you for your time. I appreciate you listening, even if we couldn't reach a…resolution. I suppose I will speak with my supervisor.
