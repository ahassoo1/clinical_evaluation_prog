DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Secondi. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Um… my pee. It’s orange. It started a few days ago, maybe four? I don’t… I don’t know why.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Secondi. Orange urine, starting about four days ago. That’s certainly something we should investigate. To start, can you describe the orange color a bit more?
PATIENT: Like… not bright orange. More… a dark orange? Like, if you mix orange juice with a little bit of brown. Is that… is that a good way to say it? And it doesn't hurt when I pee, just… the color is weird.
DOCTOR: Dark orange, like orange juice mixed with a little brown. No pain with urination, just the color change. Alright. And have you noticed any other changes in your urine – like cloudiness, or a stronger odor?
PATIENT: Um… I think it smells normal. Maybe a little bit stronger, but I drink a lot of water so… I don't really pay attention. No, not cloudy. Just the color. It kinda scared my wife, that’s why I came in. She said it’s not normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No cloudiness, normal odor, possibly a little stronger smell, but you drink a lot of water. Your wife’s concern is valid – changes in urine color should be checked. Let's go through some other things. Have you had any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain associated with this?
PATIENT: No fever. No chills. I didn’t throw up, and my tummy doesn't hurt. I feel… normal, except for the pee. I been working a lot, maybe that’s why I’m tired. But no sickness, you know? Just…orange.
DOCTOR: No fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. You’ve been working a lot and are feeling tired, but no other symptoms of illness. Okay. And are you taking any medications currently – prescription, over-the-counter, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No… nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. Just… water. Sometimes tea with mint, but not much. My wife gives me vitamins sometimes, but I forget to take them. I think they are for… energy? I don't know. They are little orange ones, funny enough.
DOCTOR: No medications, occasional mint tea. Vitamins sometimes, little orange ones... interesting. Alright, Mr. Secondi. Before we move on to a physical exam, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like kidney problems, liver problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I've been pretty healthy, I think. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, but… that’s it. I work hard, I eat okay, I try to sleep… No problems with kidneys or liver, I don't think. My wife always tells me to go to the doctor more, but I always say I’m fine.
DOCTOR: No prior medical diagnoses, no broken bones other than childhood arm fracture. Alright. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never had surgery. I'm a simple man, Doctor. Nothing broken, nothing cut. I just… work. My job is building things, not… being broken.
DOCTOR: No prior surgeries. Good to know. Now, regarding your family history – do either of your parents or siblings have any significant medical conditions – particularly kidney problems, liver problems, or any history of unusual urine color?
PATIENT: My mom… she has high blood pressure, I think. And my dad, he had… something with his heart when he was old. But no kidney problems, no liver things. And I don't think anyone in my family had orange pee. Everyone drinks tea, lots of tea, but… normal pee color. I think. I don't usually ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with hypertension, father with cardiac issues, no family history of kidney issues or unusual urine color. Alright. Finally, just a few quick social history questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No smoking. No… I drink tea, sometimes a little bit of juice with dinner. But no alcohol. And definitely no… other things. I work too hard to do things like that. I need all my strength. I like my job. It’s… building. Important work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Alright, Mr. Secondi, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to examine your abdomen and… well, I’ll need a urine sample, of course. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. A urine sample… of course. I brought a cup, just in case. And blood pressure is okay, I guess. I don't think it’s too bad. I work hard, but I’m strong. Let's just… get it over with. I have things to build.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Secondi. That’s good that you brought a cup. If you'll excuse me for a moment, I’ll show you to the restroom to collect your sample. Then we'll come back here, and I'll perform the rest of the exam. It shouldn’t take too long.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
