DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I received a letter saying I needed to come in about… vaccinations. My niece, she’s trying to get her husband to come to the United States. He’s from… well, not here, and I understand there are certain shots he needs before he can get a visa. I’m trying to help him understand what's required, and honestly, I’m a little lost myself. It's a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: Right, vaccinations… yes, I remember seeing something about that. Immigration requirements… it can be a bit complicated, you’re right. It's good you came in. Let’s see if we can sort this out. Just to confirm, you’re wanting to understand what vaccinations his husband will need, not for yourself, correct?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Not for me. I’m healthy enough, thankfully. It’s for my niece’s husband. He’s… well, he didn't have much access to good healthcare where he’s from. I want to make sure he gets everything he needs before he comes, so he doesn’t have any trouble. I believe his name is… Ricardo Alvarez. Do you need his birthdate or anything like that? I have it written down somewhere.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ricardo Alvarez… that would be very helpful, if you have his birthdate. That helps me pull up any potential records, even if minimal, and ensures we're looking at the correct requirements. While I'm doing that, could you tell me roughly where he's coming from?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me see… rummages in a worn leather wallet Here it is. His birthdate is November 14th, 1988. And he’s coming from… Honduras, I believe. Yes, Honduras. It’s a small village, I don’t have the exact name, but it’s near… Tegucigalpa, the capital city. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: November 14th, 1988… Honduras, near Tegucigalpa… okay. That’s helpful. Let me see… pauses, scrolling through a document Okay, based on his age and country of origin, he’ll likely need an updated Tdap booster – that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and the MMR vaccine, measles, mumps, and rubella. And depending on his prior vaccination history, which we may not know, he’ll likely need the varicella vaccine for chickenpox, and possibly the hepatitis A and B series. There are other considerations too, depending on his travel history within Honduras, but let's start with those. Do you have any idea if he's had any vaccinations previously?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot of shots. frowns, thinking Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know. He didn't grow up with much, and I don’t think healthcare was readily available where he is from. My niece said they didn’t keep good records, if they had records at all. He’s a strong young man, never been seriously sick, but… I just wouldn’t know. Is there a way to find out what he’s had? Perhaps a blood test? I don’t want him to get a shot he doesn’t need, either.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about avoiding unnecessary shots. A blood test can determine immunity to some, but not all, of these diseases. It’s not always completely reliable, and can be quite expensive. Given the uncertainty, and to be safe – and to meet the immigration requirements – we typically recommend following the CDC’s guidelines for unvaccinated adults. It’s the most conservative approach. We would administer the vaccines, unless there’s a specific contraindication, like a severe allergy. Let's start with a quick review of his medical history, if you know anything. Has he ever had any serious illnesses, surgeries, or allergies?
PATIENT: Well, as I said, he’s generally been very healthy. No serious illnesses that I know of. No surgeries, definitely. My niece said he did have a bit of a bad reaction to a bee sting when he was a boy, a lot of swelling, but it went down after a day or so. No known allergies otherwise. He’s a farmer, so he’s been around all sorts of things – plants, animals… He’s a very hardy fellow. pauses I don’t know if a bee sting counts as an allergy, though. Would that be a problem? He’s never been stung since.
DOCTOR: A bee sting reaction is good to know. A severe reaction – difficulty breathing, significant swelling of the face or throat – would be a contraindication to certain vaccines. A localized reaction like he described – just swelling at the sting site – is less concerning, but we should still proceed with caution. Okay. Now, just to be thorough, has he ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. He works very hard on the farm, lifting and carrying things all day. He’s strong as an ox. He doesn’t take any medications, either. He believes in natural remedies, mostly herbal teas and things like that. My niece worries about him sometimes, because he refuses to go to the doctor unless he’s really sick. She says he’s stubborn as a mule. chuckles softly I suppose that’s why he hasn’t had any of these shots.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No chronic conditions, no medications… that’s helpful. Alright, given his history – or lack thereof – and to err on the side of safety, we'll proceed with the recommended vaccination series. We can start with the Tdap booster today, and then schedule follow-up appointments for the other vaccines. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it’s the safest thing to do. I just want to make sure he’s healthy and strong when he gets here. pauses Will the shots make him feel sick? He's got a lot of work to do, and I don't want him laid up for days. And… how much will all this cost? I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern. The Tdap booster can sometimes cause some mild side effects – soreness at the injection site, a low-grade fever, fatigue. Usually, it only lasts a day or two. We can give him an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help manage any discomfort. As for the cost… let me see. types on the computer Each vaccine will be billed separately. With your insurance, the cost should be around… $50 to $100 per shot, depending on the specific vaccine and your plan’s coverage. I can have our billing department verify the exact cost for you before each appointment. We can start with the Tdap today and then discuss a schedule for the others. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… acceptable, Doctor. $50 to $100… I can manage that. And yes, let’s start with the Tdap. The sooner he gets started, the better. pauses, looking a little anxious Will you explain everything to him before you give him the shot? He doesn’t speak much English, so I’m worried he won’t understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I have a translator service available on my tablet, and we can use that to ensure he understands everything – the purpose of the shot, the potential side effects, and what to expect afterward. I will explain it slowly and clearly, and answer any questions he may have, through the translator, of course. We want him to feel comfortable and informed. Alright. Let’s get started. I’ll have the nurse prepare the Tdap, and then we can bring him in. Do you want to come with him, or would you prefer to wait here?
PATIENT: I’d like to stay with him, if that’s alright, Doctor. He’s a bit nervous about doctors, as I mentioned. Having me there will help him calm down. smiles weakly He’s a good man, just… not used to this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. That's a very good idea. Please come with him. The nurse will be right in. .
