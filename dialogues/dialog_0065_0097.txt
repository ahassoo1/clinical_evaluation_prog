DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband suggested I come. He’s become rather insistent about having some… paperwork completed. Something about what happens if… well, if I am unable to make decisions for myself. He calls it an “Advance Directive” or a “POLST” form. Frankly, I don’t understand the fuss, but he worries excessively. I suppose it's best to humour him.
DOCTOR: An Advance Directive and POLST form, yes. A sensible precaution, actually. Your husband is… prudent. Though I do find it rather unusual to present that as the primary reason for a medical visit. Still. We can certainly address that. Before we get to the forms themselves, it would be helpful for me to have a clearer picture of your overall health. Let's start with this: are you currently experiencing any health problems or symptoms that are concerning you?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I am perfectly fine. I maintain a very… disciplined lifestyle. I eat well, I exercise, I get enough sleep. I teach, you know. It keeps the mind sharp. I don't have time for illness. Though… my knees do ache a bit after a long walk, but that is simply a matter of age, I suspect. Nothing a bit of rest doesn't fix. It's hardly a problem, you understand.
DOCTOR: "Disciplined lifestyle... knees ache after walking." Alright. While I appreciate your… robust health assessment, Ms. Chilla, even individuals with excellent habits can benefit from a routine check-up. And knee pain can be more than “just age,” particularly if it interferes with your activities. To get a better understanding, could you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Interferes? No, Doctor, it does not interfere. It’s a mild discomfort. A slight… protest from the joints. It happens after a particularly long walk, perhaps up a hill. It’s not a crippling pain, I assure you. It’s… a dull ache, mostly on the inside of the knee. And it subsides with a bit of rest and a warm compress. It's really quite insignificant. I don't see what this has to do with these… forms my husband is so fixated on.
DOCTOR: It's important to establish a baseline, Ms. Chilla. These forms involve making decisions about your care, and even seemingly minor symptoms can be relevant. We need to know what constitutes normal for you, so we can accurately represent your wishes. Now, this pain… is it worse when you go down hills, or up hills?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, are we discussing my knees or my… end-of-life planning? It feels as though you are trying to find a problem where none exists. I came here because my husband is being… overly cautious, and I wish to fulfil his request so that he will stop fretting. This detailed inquiry into my perfectly functional knees seems… unnecessary. Though, if you must know, it’s worse going down hills. The impact is… more pronounced, naturally. But it’s hardly debilitating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Chilla. And you are correct, we should be discussing the Advance Directive. However, a comprehensive understanding of your health status is crucial before completing those forms. It ensures your wishes are accurately documented. Going downhill pain… that suggests a possible issue with the cartilage in the knee. We'll need to do a quick physical examination to assess the range of motion and stability. It’s just a precaution. Please sit on the examination table and extend your legs. I'll start with your knees. Then, we can revisit the Advance Directive. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Really, Doctor? This is becoming rather… excessive. My husband will be insufferable if he finds out I've been subjected to a full medical inspection over a slight ache in my knees. I came for paperwork, not a… diagnosis. I suppose, if it will finally allow us to conclude this visit and satisfy my husband, I will humor you. But I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. Please be quick.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will be as efficient as possible. Now, please relax your legs. I’m going to assess your range of motion. “Okay, Ms. Chilla. There's some crepitus – a grinding sensation – when you flex your knees. And there’s mild tenderness along the medial joint line of both knees. Range of motion is slightly limited, particularly with full extension. No significant swelling noted. Patellar tracking appears normal. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally.” “Anterior and posterior drawer tests are negative, and varus and valgus stress tests are stable. No evidence of ligamentous laxity." “Alright. That confirms my initial impression. We're likely looking at early osteoarthritis, which is common given your age and activity level. It's not severe, but it explains the pain and crepitus.”
PATIENT: Osteoarthritis? Doctor, I am a teacher! I walk. I do not engage in… extreme sports. This sounds rather… dramatic. And frankly, I find it difficult to believe. My husband will be delighted, of course. He always believes the worst. So, can we finally proceed with the paperwork now? I assure you, I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions, even with this… “osteoarthritis.” It’s hardly a debilitating condition.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I am not suggesting you are incapable of making decisions. I am simply documenting my findings. And osteoarthritis doesn't necessarily equate to “debilitating.” It’s a degenerative joint condition, and early intervention—simple things like physical therapy and maintaining a healthy weight—can significantly slow its progression. Before we complete the Advance Directive, I need to understand your wishes regarding end-of-life care. Do you have any preferences regarding life-sustaining treatments, such as mechanical ventilation or feeding tubes?
PATIENT: Doctor, I… I have never given these matters much thought. I simply… haven’t needed to. Life is… generally quite predictable, you see? My husband, perhaps, has considered these things more thoroughly. He’s always been rather… pessimistic. But I suppose… if it comes to a point where I am unable to… contribute meaningfully to society, then… no. No life-sustaining treatments. No tubes. No… prolonged suffering. I want to be allowed to… pass peacefully. Is that sufficient? Honestly, this is all rather… morbid.
DOCTOR: "No life-sustaining treatments, peaceful passing." That’s perfectly clear, Ms. Chilla. And it’s wise to have these conversations, even if they are difficult. Now, let’s discuss a POLST form. This is a medical order that outlines your preferences for specific treatments in an emergency situation. It’s different from the Advance Directive, which is a broader statement of your wishes. Do you have any preferences regarding resuscitation—CPR, for example—if your heart were to stop?
PATIENT: Resuscitation… Doctor, if my time has come, then my time has come. I do not wish to be… prolonged artificially. I’ve seen enough… unpleasantness in hospitals. No CPR. No… shocking. Just… allow me to go peacefully. And please, do not involve my husband in any… frantic attempts. He will become quite distraught. Is that clear enough? Honestly, this entire process is… deeply unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chilla. I’ve documented your wishes regarding both the Advance Directive and the POLST form. Here are the forms. Please review them carefully. I’ll initial and date them as witness. You’ll need to sign and date them as well. “These forms state your desire for no life-sustaining treatments, no CPR, and a preference for a peaceful passing. They also document your early osteoarthritis and any pain you may be experiencing. I’ll also note your husband’s preference to not be involved in frantic attempts. You can always revise these forms at any time.” “I recommend you discuss these forms with your husband to ensure he understands and agrees with your wishes. And I suggest a follow-up appointment in six months to reassess your knee pain and discuss potential physical therapy options. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no frantic attempts, you say? Good. Yes, this seems… adequate. Thank you, Doctor. I believe this will satisfy my husband. I doubt he will require any further clarification. No, I have no questions. This has been… quite an ordeal. I believe that concludes our visit. I shall take my leave now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. I will ensure these forms are placed in your medical record and that your primary care physician is notified of your wishes. “It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope you have a pleasant day.”
