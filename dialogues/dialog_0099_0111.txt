DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… a matter of appearance, really. I seem to be… darkening. And it comes with a dreadful weariness. Honestly, at my age, one expects some decline, but this is… unsettling. I haven’t the time for lengthy examinations, Doctor. Let’s get to the root of it, shall we?
DOCTOR: "Darkening," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. My skin. It isn’t… the color it once was. A sort of… dullness, accompanied by a constant feeling of being drained. It's quite obvious, wouldn't you agree? I certainly don’t need a detailed description of my own complexion. Is there a simple remedy? Perhaps a tonic?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "darkening" can mean a number of things, Mr. Drahota. Let's clarify. Is this a gradual change all over, or in specific areas?
PATIENT: Specific areas? Goodness, I haven’t been cataloging the precise locations of my… discoloration, Doctor. It's… everywhere, I suppose. As I said, a general dullness. Honestly, must we dissect this so meticulously? I've been a reinforcing iron worker for… well, a very long time. I'm exposed to the elements. It's likely just… the sun. Though I always thought my complexion remained rather… distinguished.
DOCTOR: And when did you first notice this change, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dates. A dreadful weakness of mine. Let me see… it was after the… the summer heat, certainly. Perhaps… a few months ago? It's difficult to say precisely. Time tends to… blur when one is occupied with important matters. It wasn’t sudden, that much I can recall. A slow, creeping… lack of vibrancy. Really, Doctor, is this information vital? I assure you, my work is quite demanding.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this change in skin color and fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Besides feeling… depleted? No, no, nothing of note. I sleep reasonably well, though not as soundly as in my younger days, naturally. Appetite is… acceptable. I don’t suffer from any… outlandish complaints. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I don’t concern myself with trivial aches and pains. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply documenting the inevitable decline of a man of eighty-five?
DOCTOR: It’s important to rule out all possibilities, Mr. Drahota, even if you deem them “trivial.” Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really! Is that… necessary? I find that question quite… impertinent. I assure you, my digestive system functions perfectly adequately. To delve into such personal matters is… beneath both of us. I came to you for a simple cosmetic concern, not a… physical examination. If you’ll excuse me, I’m beginning to regret this entire visit.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, with all due respect, dismissing potential medical concerns as "cosmetic" when you present with fatigue and changes in skin pigmentation is unwise. A change in skin color, combined with tiredness, could indicate a number of serious issues. I need to ask these questions to ensure I’m providing you with the best possible care. Now, are you willing to answer a few more questions, or should we simply conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But I warn you, Doctor, my patience is wearing exceedingly thin. Ask your questions, but do make it brief. I have pressing matters to attend to. And I reiterate: I am a robust man for my age. Don’t expect to uncover some… catastrophe. Proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? A negligible amount, perhaps. I haven’t been meticulously tracking my intake, Doctor. I eat when I’m hungry, and I’m quite sure I haven’t been… wasting away. Honestly, this line of questioning is rather… insulting. I may be aging, but I assure you, I’m not on my deathbed.
DOCTOR: Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? Good heavens, no! I haven’t been afflicted with a fever in decades. And night sweats? Preposterous. I sleep in perfectly respectable pajamas, thank you very much. This is… quite enough. I believe I've answered your… probing questions sufficiently. Is there a solution to this… dullness, or not? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination. I need to check your lymph nodes, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. This is standard procedure when investigating changes in skin pigmentation and fatigue. I also need to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Refusing a basic examination and necessary tests is… frankly, irresponsible. Do you consent to this, or do you wish to seek a second opinion elsewhere?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I will not be subjected to a… a poking and prodding. I came for a simple consultation, and you insist on treating me like a common invalid! I find your insistence utterly unprofessional. I will take my business elsewhere, thank you very much. And I suggest you refrain from questioning my health further. This has been a complete waste of my time. .
