DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie Ottaviani, 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor... Overgaard, is it? My throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: “A little while” isn’t terribly specific, Tammie. We need to figure out how long, and what the pain is like. Is it constant?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember exactly. A week? Maybe more. It’s just… sore. Like when you have a cold, but not as bad. And it feels worse when I… talk. Which is why I don’t like talking about it, really. Is that helpful? I work with… machines. Important machines. I need my voice.
DOCTOR: Right. “Sore throat for approximately a week, worse with speech.” Important machines, understood. We need to rule out anything serious. Have you had a fever, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I don't think so. I haven't been feeling well enough to check, if that makes sense. And aches? No more than usual. I’m a… a practical woman, Doctor. I don’t sit around feeling sorry for myself. Is this going to take long? I have a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: “Practical,” yes. Well, Tammie, a proper assessment takes time. But I'll be efficient. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or changes in your voice other than the soreness?
PATIENT: Swallowing… hmm. Maybe a little. Not much. It’s just… scratchy, you know? And my voice… well, you heard it. It’s probably just tired. I told you, I work with machines. Loud machines. It’s probably just that. Honestly, I think I just need a strong cough drop. Is that all there is to it? Because I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Let’s just take a quick look, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I haven’t got all day. And please, don’t poke around too much. I don't like that.
DOCTOR: Alright… tongue depressor. Hmm. Your tonsils are… slightly inflamed. No obvious exudate, but some redness at the back of your throat. Palate looks a bit irritated as well. Now, open wide and say "Ah."
PATIENT: Aaaah. There. Happy? Can we be done now? This is very… unpleasant. And I’m sure it’s nothing. Just a little irritation. I told you, machines. Loud, dusty machines.
DOCTOR: Your uvula is slightly swollen, and there’s some mild erythema in the posterior pharynx. It could be simple irritation, Tammie, but given the swelling and redness, we need to consider other possibilities. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I work with metal. And oil. And… things. I’ve never had allergies. Honestly, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. I probably just need some rest and a strong drink. Are you going to give me something or not? I really don’t have time for tests and… other possibilities.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. Given your insistence, and the fact you’re uninsured, I’ll be… pragmatic. I suspect a viral pharyngitis, possibly exacerbated by environmental irritants. But we need to be cautious. I’m going to recommend a course of supportive care: rest, fluids, over-the-counter pain relievers, and a throat lozenge. However, if you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or severe difficulty swallowing, you need to seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Throat lozenge… fine. Rest… I’ll try. But I have a shift. And fluids… yes. I understand. Don't tell me to come back if I get a fever, I won't. It's just a sore throat. Waste of time, honestly. Can I go now? .
DOCTOR: Here. For a throat lozenge. And, Tammie… if your condition worsens, do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It’s your health. You’re dismissed.
