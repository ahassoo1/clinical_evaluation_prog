DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, it’s my weight. It’s…increased, and I haven’t changed anything in my routine. It’s quite worrying, really.
DOCTOR: Increased how much, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… approximately fifteen pounds, perhaps a little more, over the last three months, I’d say. It’s…noticeable. My clothes feel tighter, and I haven't been eating any differently. I keep the same schedule, the same meals… it's just… appeared.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds in three months… Alright. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… Not particularly, no. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I attribute that to the summer heat. I haven't experienced any pain or anything of that nature. Just the weight, primarily. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Tiredness is a very vague symptom, Ms. Selbitschka. Many things can cause that. Now, let's talk about your typical diet a bit more precisely. You say you haven't changed anything, but can you describe a typical day’s meals for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, breakfast is usually oatmeal with berries, and a cup of tea. Lunch is a sandwich – perhaps turkey and cheese on whole wheat bread – and a small apple. And dinner… well, my husband usually cooks. It’s typically a protein – chicken or fish – with some vegetables, like potatoes or carrots. I don't typically snack. Really, nothing extravagant. It’s a quite simple diet, Doctor. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how much water do you drink each day, approximately?
PATIENT: Water… hmm. I wouldn't say a great deal, perhaps four or five glasses? I drink tea throughout the day, though. Does that count? It’s mostly herbal, not sugary. I find it soothing, you see. I’m not one for plain water, honestly. It tastes… bland.
DOCTOR: Tea does not fully substitute for water, Ms. Selbitschka. Now, let’s move on. Any family history of thyroid problems, diabetes, or weight gain?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother had some issues with her weight later in life, but it was attributed to age, I believe. And… my grandmother on my father’s side, I recall, had something with her thyroid, yes. Though I don't know the specifics, only that she required medication. It was quite some time ago. She passed many years ago, you see. I’m not certain of the details.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. Just a multivitamin occasionally, and only during the winter months. Nothing else. I believe in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and letting nature take its course, you see. It’s always been my philosophy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick physical exam then. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your thyroid gland. Please, have a seat on the table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though, if you don't mind, could you perhaps explain what you're looking for when you palpate my thyroid? I simply like to understand these things, you see. A little knowledge eases my mind.
DOCTOR: I am assessing for any enlargement or nodules in the thyroid gland. These can sometimes cause weight fluctuations, among other symptoms. It’s a routine procedure, Ms. Selbitschka. Please lie back. I will listen to your heart and lungs first.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As long as it's routine. Though, I must say, I feel perfectly fine otherwise. It's simply the weight…and a little tiredness, of course. But generally, I'm quite healthy, you see. I try my best to be.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear. Thyroid feels…slightly enlarged, but no immediately concerning nodules. Blood pressure is 138/85. That's a little elevated, but not alarming. I'd like to order a TSH blood test and a complete metabolic panel. This will give us a better understanding of your thyroid function and overall metabolic health.
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? Is that…serious, Doctor? And a metabolic panel… what exactly does that entail? I do hope it isn’t anything too invasive. I have always had a slight aversion to needles, you see.
DOCTOR: It's a mild enlargement, Ms. Selbitschka. Not necessarily cause for alarm. The metabolic panel is a simple blood test – we’ll check your blood sugar, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function… standard things. It requires a small blood sample, yes, but it's not invasive. We'll schedule it for tomorrow morning at the lab down the street. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your salt intake and increasing your water consumption. And perhaps a brisk walk each day. Basic things.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you believe that's sufficient. Though, I do take exception to the implication that I don't hydrate adequately. I simply prefer tea. Tomorrow morning, you say? I will make arrangements. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I trust these tests will provide some clarity. .
DOCTOR: Yes, hopefully. We’ll review the results next week.
