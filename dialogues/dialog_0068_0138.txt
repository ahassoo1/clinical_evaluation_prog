DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I'm Dr. Sham. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me see… my daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. Something about… well, a few little spells, I suppose you’d call them. And my family… there’s been trouble with headaches, you know? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I get so mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: "A few little spells," okay. And headaches in the family… I understand things can be a bit confusing sometimes. Let's try to sort through it. When you say "spells," could you describe what happens, as best you can remember?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… it’s like… sometimes my arm feels heavy. Really heavy, like I can’t lift it properly. And a little… clumsy, maybe? It doesn't happen all the time, thankfully. Just comes and goes. And it usually doesn't last long, just a little while. It’s hard to explain. And then… sometimes I get a terrible ache in my head, but that might be just a regular headache, I don’t know. My sister, she used to get them bad. Really bad. I think that’s what my daughter was worried about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so arm heaviness and clumsiness… comes and goes. And headaches. Let’s start with the arm. Does it happen on one side or both?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Let me think… I think it’s the right side. Yes, the right side feels… weaker. But like I said, it’s not always! Some days I don’t even notice it. It’s just… when it happens, it feels like it’s harder to do things with my right hand, you know? Like buttoning my coat or… reaching for something on the higher shelf. Is that making any sense? I’m sorry, I’m probably rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Ms. Tofani. It's helpful to hear what you're experiencing. Right arm weakness, intermittent… Okay. And when this weakness happens, do you notice any other symptoms at the same time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Sometimes, I feel a little… strange. Not sick, exactly, just… off. And maybe a little… confused? It’s hard to describe. And… sometimes my mouth feels funny. Like… I can’t quite get the words out right. It doesn't happen every time, though. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. My daughter says I should tell you everything, but it’s hard to remember everything, you know? I've had a long life!
DOCTOR: "Off" and some confusion… difficulty finding the right words sometimes. It sounds like we need to explore this a little further. Do you recall how long these episodes have been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a good question… Let me think… I suppose… a few months? Maybe six months, give or take? It started… gradually, I think. Little things at first, and I just put it down to getting older. You know, stiff joints and all that. But then it started happening more often, and my daughter got worried. She's a very practical girl, my daughter. Always looking out for me. I’m not sure exactly when it started, though. It all just sort of… blended together.
DOCTOR: Okay. Several months, gradually worsening. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better sense of things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A physical exam sounds fine. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. My knees aren't what they used to be, you know! But do whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 88. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished on the right side. And I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Squeezing… yes. Is that… okay? I'm trying, Doctor. It feels a little… difficult. My right hand just doesn't seem to want to cooperate sometimes. I hope I'm doing it right. I'm not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Tofani, you're doing fine. It's good you're letting me know what you're feeling. I'm just going to have you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger. First with your right hand. Okay, now with your left hand.
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Is that… alright? It feels… clumsy. My right hand just doesn't seem to want to listen. It feels… strange. I haven’t been able to do things like this as easily lately. It’s probably just old age, though. Is it bad? I'm a bit worried now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Tofani. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve seen during the exam, I'm concerned about possible neurological issues. The weakness on your right side, the difficulty with coordination, the diminished reflexes… these are things we need to investigate further. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but it could be related to a stroke, a transient ischemic attack , or another condition affecting the brain. I'm going to order a CT scan of your brain to get a clearer picture. And I also want to order some blood tests to rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. A CT scan? And blood tests? Is it… serious, Doctor? Is something really wrong? A stroke? That sounds… frightening. I… I don’t know. I just want to feel better. My daughter… she’s going to be so worried. Will it be painful? I… I’m not very good with hospitals and tests and all that. Is there… anything else I should be doing?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, I understand your concern, and it’s perfectly natural to feel frightened. It's important to remember that we're just gathering information at this point. The CT scan will help us see what's going on inside your brain, and the blood tests will give us a more complete picture of your overall health. The CT scan itself is painless, it’s just like a very quick X-ray. You'll lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. We’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. As for right now, the most important thing is to stay calm. I'm going to prescribe a baby aspirin to help prevent any further clots. I also want you to immediately notify me or go to the nearest emergency room if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – like a new onset of weakness, difficulty speaking, severe headache, or vision changes. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Baby aspirin… and go to the emergency room if things get worse… Yes… I think I understand. But… what if I do have a stroke? What happens then? Will I… will I be alright? I… I just don’t want to be a burden to my daughter. She’s already got enough on her plate. I… I just want to go home and have a cup of tea. This is all very overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. It’s perfectly natural to be scared and worried. And you are not a burden to your daughter. She loves you very much, and she wants to help you. If you do have a stroke, there are treatments available that can significantly improve your chances of recovery. We can start those treatments as quickly as possible if we know what's going on. That’s why it’s so important to get the CT scan. The sooner we have a diagnosis, the better. I’m going to write you a prescription for the baby aspirin and a referral to radiology for the CT scan. I’ll also have the nurse give you some information about stroke symptoms and resources. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help you every step of the way. Let's just take things one step at a time, alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. One step at a time… yes. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I… I appreciate you explaining everything. I just… I just hope it’s not too serious. I think… I think I’m ready to go home now. My daughter is waiting for me. I’ll… I’ll call her and tell her what you said. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Tofani. You're very welcome. Please, don't hesitate to call if anything changes, even if it seems minor. We want to be sure we catch everything quickly. The nurse will be with you in a moment to go over the discharge instructions and schedule the CT scan. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care of yourself, and give your daughter my best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
