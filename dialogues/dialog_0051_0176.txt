DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Over two days, that is quite a while for hiccups. Okay. And can you describe them to me?
PATIENT: They’re… normal hiccups, I guess? You know, the kind where your chest jerks and you make that “hic” sound. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s tiring. And embarrassing, to be honest. I was trying to watch a movie last night and I just kept interrupting myself. It’s happening pretty frequently, maybe every few minutes.
DOCTOR: Every few minutes… alright. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven't really noticed anything specific. I drank a lot of water yesterday, trying to make them go away, but that didn’t seem to help. And I ate a pretty big meal the day before they started, but I eat big meals all the time! I don't know if that’s related. It just… started. I was having tea with a friend, and then hic… there they were.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they began spontaneously while having tea. And no relief with increased water intake. Have you experienced hiccups like this before, or is this a new occurrence?
PATIENT: This is definitely new. I get hiccups sometimes, like if I eat too fast, but they always go away after a few minutes. Never anything this long. And never just… out of nowhere like this. It's a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve never had hiccups last this long before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Prolonged hiccups can be a bit unsettling. Let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I'm a little overweight, if that counts. And my doctor back home – I moved here about a year ago – always told me to watch my blood pressure, but it's usually okay. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy. I don’t take any regular medications, and I haven’t been to the hospital in years. I had my gallbladder out maybe ten years ago, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so overweight, history of hypertension monitoring, and a cholecystectomy ten years ago. No current medications. And no other significant medical history. Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Let me think… my mother had diabetes, and my father had heart problems. Both passed away several years ago now. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. We don’t talk much, to be honest. Nothing really… relevant that I can think of. No one in my family has ever had hiccups this long, though! That's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes and heart problems. No history of prolonged hiccups. And just to be thorough, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work at a resort, managing some of the entertainment. It keeps me busy, but it’s mostly desk work. I don’t get a lot of exercise, I admit. I used to swim a lot when I lived in Egypt, but I haven't been in a pool since I moved. I enjoy cooking, and I like to spend time with my friends when I can. I used to smoke, but I quit about fifteen years ago. I drink maybe a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My doctor back home did a lot of tests when I was younger, just to be safe, and everything was always clear. I’m pretty good with medications, if that makes sense. I don’t avoid them or anything. I just haven’t needed to take many in my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. Honestly, I just want these hiccups to stop! It’s really starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please. Breathing sounds are clear bilaterally. Heart rate is regular, a little elevated, but that could be from the hiccups themselves. Throat appears clear, no obvious signs of irritation or inflammation. No lymphadenopathy noted. Everything seems normal on the initial exam. It doesn't appear to be anything obvious causing the hiccups. We'll need to consider some other possibilities. Given the duration, and the fact that they've started spontaneously, it’s possible this is a vagus nerve irritation. It's also important to rule out any underlying medical issues, even though your history doesn’t suggest anything major. I'd like to order some blood work to check your electrolyte levels and complete blood count. Also, to be safe, I'm going to order a chest x-ray, just to ensure there's nothing going on in your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I mean, I don’t want to ignore anything. Blood work and an x-ray… okay. I just hope it doesn’t take too long to figure out what’s going on. And is there anything I can do now? Anything to stop them, even temporarily? It’s really distracting. Hic! See? It’s so annoying.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ivette. It is disruptive. While we wait for the results, there are a few things you can try. Simple things like holding your breath for a short period, drinking a glass of water quickly, or gargling with water might help stimulate the vagus nerve and temporarily stop them. Some people find sucking on a lemon helpful as well. They aren't guaranteed to work, but they're worth a try. We'll get those tests ordered right away. The lab is just down the hall, and we can schedule the x-ray for later today. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if the hiccups become severe, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or difficulty swallowing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It’s unlikely, but it’s always best to err on the side of caution. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Holding my breath, drinking water… I’ve tried holding my breath already, but maybe I didn’t do it long enough. I’ll try again. And I will definitely go to the emergency room if it gets worse. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. It was my pleasure. We'll get those tests ordered, and we'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before then. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood now. .
