DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I requested a general wellness check – a lab panel, I believe it was called. Just wanting to see how things are holding up, you know? At my age, one likes to be…proactive. I scheduled it myself, just a routine thing, really.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Mombrun. Being proactive about your health is very wise. A general wellness check is a great idea. Yes, I see here you scheduled a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a complete blood count – all good things to have checked. Before we get started, could you tell me a little bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I’m married, been with my wife, Elena, for…oh, goodness, nearly fifty years now. We both moved here from Venezuela many years ago. I still do a bit of construction work, though not as much as I used to. Keeps me moving, you see. No major complaints, really. A few aches and pains, what you’d expect at seventy-four. I have private insurance, thank goodness. I try to eat reasonably well, though Elena does most of the cooking – she’s the healthy one, always making sure I get my vegetables! I haven’t been to the hospital for anything serious in…oh, probably a decade, maybe more. Just the usual check-ups with my primary care physician.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. A long and happy marriage is something to celebrate! And staying active is fantastic. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a few more details. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Elena always asks when she’s trying a new recipe, and I always tell her the same thing – I eat just about anything. She worries, you see. A good woman, that Elena. I suppose I should mention… I used to be a smoker, many years ago, but I quit over thirty years ago now. It was the best thing I ever did. No other significant allergies or sensitivities that I can recall.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news about quitting smoking, Mr. Mombrun. Thirty years is a significant accomplishment, and it has a huge positive impact on your health. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a small one, Doctor. I take a low-dose aspirin every day, as my primary care physician recommended a few years back. Something about keeping my blood thin, I believe. And occasionally, when my knees are acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s it, really. No vitamins or supplements, Elena tried to get me to take some glucosamine for my joints, but I didn't notice any difference. She has a whole cabinet full of them, though! She means well.
DOCTOR: Okay, low-dose aspirin daily and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about fifteen years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for many years now. My primary care physician monitors it regularly. Other than that… nothing major, thankfully. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered fully. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older. I had a rather nasty fall about five years ago, twisted my ankle, but that healed up well too. Elena was very worried about that one, naturally. She’s always looking after me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, a history of pneumonia, and a twisted ankle five years ago. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, maybe ten or twelve years old. And… let me think… about twenty years ago, I had a small operation on my knee to repair a torn meniscus. It was a minor procedure, outpatient, and it went well. I had some physical therapy afterwards, and it helped a great deal. Other than those two, no other surgeries. Nothing major, thankfully. Elena drove me to both, of course. She’s a very capable woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendectomy as a child and a meniscus repair about twenty years ago. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My father had heart disease, unfortunately. He passed away when he was in his late seventies. And my mother… she had diabetes, later in life. My older brother also developed diabetes, but he’s doing well managing it with medication and diet. On Elena’s side… her mother had high blood pressure, and her sister had some issues with arthritis. So, a bit of a mixed bag, I suppose. Nothing too alarming, but those are the things I’m aware of. It's funny, Elena always keeps track of these things better than I do. She has a whole family tree documented, with all the medical histories meticulously noted. A very organized woman, that Elena.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Mombrun. It’s good you have a sense of your family history. Now, just to finish up the history, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As I mentioned, I still do a bit of construction work, though not as much as I used to. It keeps me active, and I enjoy it. I try to get a good night’s sleep, usually around seven or eight hours. I don’t smoke, haven’t for over thirty years, and I only drink socially, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on occasion. I wouldn't say I exercise regularly, but I do a lot of walking. Elena and I enjoy taking walks in the park, weather permitting. We try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Elena is the one who makes sure we stick to it, though. She’s very particular about what we eat. We don't have any pets, unfortunately, Elena is a bit allergic. Overall, I’d say I live a pretty quiet and healthy life. It's not too exciting, but it suits me just fine.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very balanced lifestyle, Mr. Mombrun. Okay, that gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, looking in your ears, nose and throat, and feeling your abdomen. It shouldn't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgment, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I'm not worried, but it's always good to be thorough, you know? Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I'm quite comfortable, really. Elena always tells me I’m a very patient patient!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Mombrun. And Elena sounds like a wonderful woman. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 138 over 82. It’s not alarmingly high, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your heart sounds regular, and I don’t hear any unusual sounds. Your lungs sound clear. Your ears look good, and your throat is a little red, but nothing concerning. Your abdomen is soft and doesn't hurt when I press on it. Everything feels normal. So, everything seems relatively normal, Mr. Mombrun. Now, let’s get those lab results ordered to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring, Doctor. Thank you for taking such good care of me. I appreciate your thoroughness. The elevated blood pressure is a little concerning, but I’m glad you’re keeping an eye on it. I trust your judgment implicitly. And yes, let’s get those lab results ordered. I'm eager to see what they reveal. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare for them. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if you have any concerns. I'd rather know everything upfront, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Mombrun. That's a very sensible approach. The lab results will give us a more complete picture. Okay, I've ordered the lab work. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. They will give you instructions regarding fasting – you'll need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the test. They'll provide a slip with those instructions as well. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, severe headache – please don't hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That’s excellent, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Fasting for 8-12 hours, got it. I’ll be sure to follow those instructions carefully. And yes, I think I do have one question. My wife, Elena, has been worried about my memory lately. I don’t feel like it’s gotten worse, but she says I sometimes forget little things. Is there anything in these tests that might indicate a problem with that? I understand it could be just age, but she’s quite concerned. She's a very caring woman, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Mombrun, and it’s good that Elena is looking out for you. The complete blood count can sometimes reveal vitamin deficiencies – like B12 – that can affect memory. However, memory issues can have many causes, and often aren't related to medical issues. If the lab results are normal and Elena remains concerned, we can discuss a more detailed cognitive assessment or a referral to a neurologist. It’s always best to investigate if there's a genuine concern. We'll take it one step at a time. For now, let’s focus on getting these initial tests done, and we can address this further if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. One step at a time is a very sensible approach. I appreciate you taking my wife’s concerns seriously. We’ll get these initial tests done, and then we can decide what to do next. I’m sure it’s just age, but it’s good to rule things out. Elena will be relieved to hear you’re taking this seriously. She worries a great deal, you see. Thank you again for your thoroughness and your kindness. I feel much better knowing I’m in good hands.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It’s my pleasure. And it's wonderful that you have Elena looking out for you. Alright, the phlebotomist should be with you shortly. Just let them know if you have any questions. Once you’ve had the blood drawn, you're free to go. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are back, typically within a few days. If anything changes or you develop any new concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and your attention. You’ve been very helpful and reassuring. I feel much better prepared now. I’ll be sure to follow all the instructions carefully and I’ll be in touch if anything changes. Please extend my gratitude to the phlebotomist as well. It's kind of you to ask. I appreciate everything. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and please give my best to Elena. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. I will certainly pass on your best to Elena. She’ll be delighted to hear it. And thank you again for everything. Goodbye.
