DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Press. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I requested a general wellness check, a full lab panel, if you will. Just wanted to see how things are holding up, you know? At my age, one likes to be… proactive. I feel quite well, thankfully, but better safe than sorry, as they say.
DOCTOR: A wellness check, very sensible, Mr. Mombrun. And you’re right to be proactive. I agree. Now, let’s get some details. First, can you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’m seventy-four years of age, as you can see from the chart. I’ve been a construction laborer for… well, for most of my life, really. It’s kept me active, though the knees aren’t what they used to be. I'm married, thankfully, to a wonderful woman, and we both have private insurance. No major illnesses to report, thankfully. A few aches and pains, naturally, but nothing that slows me down much. I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, though my wife does most of the cooking, and she enjoys her arepas!
DOCTOR: Construction, that's demanding work. And arepas are delicious. Alright. So, no major illnesses. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or any heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve had regular check-ups over the years, just the standard things, and nothing like that has ever come up. Blood pressure is usually… normal, I believe. The doctors have always said it was good, and I haven’t been given any medication for cholesterol or anything of that nature. As for diabetes… no family history of that either, thankfully. I did have a bit of trouble with my back a few years ago, but that was resolved with physical therapy. Nothing ongoing.
DOCTOR: Good. No history of those conditions is always reassuring. And physical therapy was successful, that’s positive. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, actually. Quite a few years ago, I had my appendix removed. It was an emergency, a rather unpleasant experience, but that was decades ago. And… oh, yes. I had a small tear in my rotator cuff repaired, perhaps fifteen years ago. A work injury, unfortunately. Other than those two, nothing at all. Both procedures went smoothly, and I fully recovered from them both.
DOCTOR: Appendix and rotator cuff repair. Noted. Now, regarding family history – are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My father, he lived a long life, but he did have some heart trouble towards the end. Nothing diagnosed young, it sort of crept up on him in his eighties. My mother… she was generally very healthy, thankfully. No cancers or anything like that on either side, as far as I know. A few instances of arthritis, but that's fairly common, isn’t it? I believe my aunt on my wife’s side had… high blood pressure, perhaps? But honestly, it was many years ago, and details are a bit hazy. I wouldn't say we have a family riddled with illness, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Heart trouble in your father, a bit of arthritis, and possible high blood pressure in your wife’s aunt. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and my wife keeps a very careful list of everything I take, just in case. No food allergies, no pollen allergies… nothing at all. I can take penicillin, codeine, all of the usual things, without any issue. It's one of the few things I don’t have to worry about, thankfully.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I take a multivitamin occasionally, just to be on the safe side, but that’s it. I've always tried to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in letting my body do its own work, within reason, of course. I have a small cream for my knees, sometimes, for the aches, but it's just an over-the-counter muscle rub. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I try to stay active, that’s my main medicine, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. That’s a good, thorough history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and check everything is as you describe. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. Please, proceed. I understand the need for a proper examination. I'll do my best to remain still and cooperate fully. Just let me know if there is anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and then a quick abdominal exam. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Not bad at all, Mr. Mombrun. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let me just check your ears… Ears look clear. And your throat… No swelling or redness. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. Bowel sounds are normal. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Now, I would like to check your reflexes and muscle strength. Please extend your arms… Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and muscle strength is 5/5 in all extremities. </stage>
PATIENT: That all sounds quite positive, Doctor. Thank you for being so thorough. I appreciate your care. Everything feels… normal, as it should, I suppose. Are there any concerns you’ve identified from the examination so far?
DOCTOR: Everything is within normal limits, Mr. Mombrun. Your physical exam is reassuring. However, given your age and the fact you haven’t had a full lab panel recently, I would like to order some routine blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. This will give us a more detailed picture of your overall health and help rule out any potential issues. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. That sounds very sensible indeed. A more detailed picture is always a good idea, especially at my age. Please, proceed with the lab work. I trust your judgment completely. Is there anything specific I need to do to prepare for the tests? Fasting, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, for the most accurate results, I would like you to fast for 12 hours prior to the blood draw. That means no food or caloric beverages – water is fine. We'll get the lab requisition form for you now, and the nurse will schedule the appointment for you. Once we have the results back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Does that sound alright, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Fasting for twelve hours is no trouble at all. Water is fine, of course. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for scheduling the appointment for me, that’s very kind. I look forward to discussing the results with you. Is there anything else I need to know or do before I leave today?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Mombrun, I don't think so. Just try to relax and stay hydrated until your appointment. The nurse will review the instructions with you as well. Here’s the lab requisition form. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Otherwise, we’ll see you soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Press. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. I appreciate your excellent care. I will certainly follow your instructions and contact the office if any concerns arise. I look forward to seeing you again. Have a good day to you as well. .
