DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though I confess, “pleasure” may be too strong a word. I was… encouraged to come. Something about…stress. Honestly, the youth these days have no stamina. It's simply…work, Doctor. A great deal of it. And frankly, not enough respect for proper cataloging.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds as though you're experiencing some difficulties related to your workload. To help me better understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about the type of work you do?
PATIENT: Library science, Doctor. Postsecondary. Meaning I deal with…students. Though “deal with” is perhaps the operative phrase. They lack discipline, I assure you. Proper Dewey Decimal System knowledge is…lacking. I’ve been doing this for…well, a very long time. Too long, perhaps. It’s all rather tiresome, frankly. Is this going to take long? I have papers to grade.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Schlatterer. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. To clarify, you’re a librarian at the postsecondary level, and you feel some stress related to your work and, specifically, working with students?
PATIENT: “Stress” is a rather…simplistic term, Doctor. It’s a matter of standards. My standards are high. Very high. And these students…they simply don’t meet them. It’s not a matter of feeling anything, it's a matter of professional…disappointment. And frankly, the university administration doesn’t seem to care. Is there a form I need to sign to prove I attended? I’m a busy man.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant burden from the challenges at work and a lack of support. We'll certainly document your visit. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, both physically and emotionally. To start, could you describe any specific physical symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Really, Doctor? At my age, one has symptoms. Aches, pains…the usual deterioration. What I’m concerned with is my mind, Doctor. My ability to maintain order! I find myself…forgetting things. Not important things, mind you, but…details. Catalog numbers, student names…irritating things. It’s likely just age, but it’s…unsettling. Though I assure you, I haven't lost my faculties entirely. Do you have any experience with…challenging students?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some memory changes that are causing you concern, alongside the general physical effects of aging. We’ll certainly address both. Memory changes can have a variety of causes, and it’s good you’re bringing them to my attention. Before we delve deeper into the memory concerns, could you tell me a bit more about these aches and pains?
PATIENT: They are…ubiquitous, Doctor. Everywhere. My back, mostly. From bending over books, you understand. And my hands, sometimes. From…writing. Though mostly it’s a general…weariness. It’s not as if I expect a cure, mind you. I simply…exist. But it’s becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate when one is constantly…discomforted. And the students, of course, exacerbate everything. They require…constant correction. Is this all being documented? I need a record of this visit for university purposes.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything is being documented thoroughly, Mr. Schlatterer. I’m noting your generalized aches and pains, particularly in your back and hands. We’ll be sure to have a complete record for your university. To get a better understanding of the scope of these pains, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your typical back pain?
PATIENT: A scale? Really, Doctor? Must everything be quantified? It fluctuates, naturally. Some days it’s merely a…nagging discomfort. Other days…it’s rather more pronounced. Perhaps a…four? On a good day. A six or seven when dealing with particularly…uncooperative students. Though I assure you, the pain is not the primary concern. It’s the principle of the thing! The disrespect, the lack of dedication… Honestly, I'm wasting my time here. Is there a summary I can have? I need to return to my work.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds as though the stress from your work is significantly impacting your well-being, both physically and emotionally. While I respect your desire for efficiency, a complete assessment is important to ensure we address all potential contributing factors. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? A few. For my…blood pressure, I believe. And something for my…joints, perhaps? My doctor, Dr. Petrov, prescribes them. Honestly, I don't pay much attention. I take what I’m given. I have no interest in pharmaceutical details. It’s all rather…unnecessary. I assure you, my mind is perfectly sharp. I simply require…competent students and respectful administration. Is this all being documented? Because I need a record of this visit for university purposes. A detailed record.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything is being documented, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm noting that you are taking medication for your blood pressure and joints, prescribed by Dr. Petrov. To help me understand the full picture, do you happen to know the names or dosages of these medications?
PATIENT: Dosages? Names? Doctor, I am a librarian, not a pharmacist! I leave such trivialities to…professionals. I take a small white pill in the morning and a larger blue one at night. That is the extent of my knowledge. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time. I have papers to grade, students to correct, and a university that clearly doesn't appreciate my dedication. I’m ready to leave now. I need a summary of this…encounter. A detailed summary. And a form proving my attendance. For university purposes, of course.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and desire for efficiency, Mr. Schlatterer. However, without knowing the specific medications you are taking, it’s difficult to assess potential interactions or contributing factors to your symptoms. Given the challenges we’ve had obtaining a complete medical history, and given your reported memory concerns, I recommend a comprehensive neurological evaluation with a specialist. This would allow for a thorough assessment of your cognitive function and rule out any underlying medical causes for your memory changes. I can provide you with a referral to a highly-rated neurologist in the area. Additionally, given your reported stress and frustration, I would also suggest exploring resources for stress management and coping mechanisms. I can provide information on local support groups and counseling services. For the record, I have documented your medications as "small white pill in the morning and larger blue pill at night," as reported. I will also document my recommendation for a neurological evaluation and stress management resources. Do you consent to me providing a referral to a neurologist?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Preposterous! My mind is perfectly fine. It’s the students who are deficient. And stress management? I’ve been managing stress for eight decades, Doctor. I assure you, I need no assistance in that regard. This entire encounter has been…fruitless. I wasted my valuable time coming here, and you’ve gained nothing but a description of the university’s appalling standards. No. I do not consent to a referral. And I require a detailed summary of this encounter, immediately. For university purposes, naturally. I’m leaving now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand your decision. I have prepared a summary of our encounter, detailing your reported symptoms, medications as described, and my recommendations for a neurological evaluation and stress management resources. I will provide this to the receptionist, who will ensure you receive it before you leave. I wish you all the best and encourage you to reconsider the referral if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any further cognitive decline. Thank you for your time. .
