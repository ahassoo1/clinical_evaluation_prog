DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure indeed. Well, to put it plainly, I’ve been… experimenting, shall we say, with some rather enthusiastic dietary approaches. And I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I… well, before anything untoward occurs. I’ve always been rather particular about maintaining my physique, you see, and one tends to fall down rabbit holes when striving for perfection. It’s become something of a habit, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you've been making some changes to your diet. Could you elaborate on what those changes have been, specifically?
PATIENT: Certainly. It began, innocently enough, with the “Breatharian Diet,” you understand. The idea of subsisting solely on prana – life force – quite appealing to a man of my… creative sensibilities. Didn’t last long, naturally. Far too draining for a chap of my age, even with my constitution. Then there was the “Carnivore Diet,” which I adhered to rather strictly for… oh, three weeks, I believe? A bit monotonous, frankly. Most recently, I’ve been attempting a modified version of the “Moon Diet.” Only consuming foods illuminated by moonlight. A logistical nightmare, as you can imagine. It’s all rather… exhausting, really. And I’ve begun to feel a slight… sluggishness. Not unwell, precisely, but not quite myself.
DOCTOR: I see. That is… a rather extensive series of dietary experiments, Mr. Vantine. And you've noticed a general feeling of sluggishness. Can you describe that feeling in more detail?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a debilitating sluggishness, Doctor, not at all. More a… lack of vim and vigour, shall we say? A certain… flattening of the spirit. I used to be able to work for hours on end, animating characters, crafting special effects – tireless, really. Now, I find myself needing… restorative naps. And my ideas aren’t flowing quite as freely. It’s as if the muse has taken a brief holiday. I also suspect my colour perception may be slightly diminished. Though, admittedly, I haven’t subjected myself to rigorous testing. It’s a subtle thing, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. A loss of energy, difficulty concentrating, and a possible change in colour perception. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight during these dietary changes?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the appetite. A curious thing. During the Breatharian phase, naturally, it vanished entirely. The Carnivore Diet… well, one develops a rather insatiable craving for red meat. Quite uncouth, really. The Moon Diet presented the greatest challenge. One can only consume so many pale fruits and vegetables! As for weight… it fluctuates, Doctor. Fluctuates wildly. I’ve lost some, gained some. It's rather difficult to maintain a stable weight when one is restricting oneself to such… unconventional sources of sustenance. I suspect I’m currently hovering around 148 pounds. Though, I haven’t weighed myself with absolute precision for some time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none whatsoever. Remarkably resilient digestive system, you see. I’ve sampled delicacies from across the globe, experimented with… exotic ingredients, shall we say. Never a moment’s trouble. My late wife, bless her soul, was a rather adventurous cook. And I, naturally, indulged her proclivities. A rather useful trait, I believe, for a man in my profession. One encounters all manner of substances when creating special effects. And one must be prepared for anything.
DOCTOR: Very good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter supplements or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely nothing. I’ve always prided myself on maintaining a… natural constitution. I find that a good night’s sleep, a brisk walk, and a stimulating conversation are far more effective than any pharmaceutical intervention. Though, I must confess, I did briefly experiment with a rather potent herbal tea marketed for enhancing creativity. Utterly ineffective, I assure you. Tasted dreadful, as well. A rather unpleasant shade of puce, if I recall correctly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. I think I have a good initial understanding of your situation. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. This will include checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a general neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. Though, I must warn you, my pulse may be slightly irregular. A consequence, I suspect, of my… enthusiastic lifestyle. And my hands may be stained with various pigments. A hazard of the trade, you understand. Other than that, I believe I’m in relatively sound condition for a man of my age. Do let me know if anything appears… unusual.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please, if you’ll step over here and lie down on the table. We'll start with your vital signs. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Now, your lungs. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Coordination appears intact. I do see some staining on your hands, as you mentioned. And I'm noting a slightly pale complexion. Overall, your physical exam is fairly unremarkable, but the paleness and your history of dietary restriction are concerning. Given your symptoms and recent diet, I suspect you may be experiencing some nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron deficiency anemia. To confirm this, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel . Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds… eminently sensible, Doctor. I confess, I suspected as much. A certain… lack of robustness, shall we say, has been creeping in of late. I’ve always been rather fastidious about my health, but even I can’t deny the allure of a… novel dietary approach. A CBC and a BMP seem perfectly reasonable. And if you have any recommendations for a… less adventurous dietary regimen, I would be most grateful for your guidance. Perhaps something a tad more… conventional?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll get those lab tests ordered right away. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on a well-balanced diet with plenty of iron-rich foods – lean meats, beans, spinach, fortified cereals. It’s important to reintroduce nutrients gradually. Perhaps start with small, regular meals and avoid any extreme diets. I also suggest consulting with a registered dietitian. They can help you create a personalized meal plan that meets your nutritional needs and preferences. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: That would be most kind, Doctor. A referral to a registered dietitian would be… invaluable. I’ve always been rather adept at creating meals, you see – elaborate, visually stunning creations. But the nutritional aspect… that’s always been my Achilles’ heel. I confess, I once attempted to sustain myself entirely on a diet of edible glitter. A spectacular failure, I assure you. A registered dietitian seems a far more prudent approach. And thank you, Doctor. Your guidance is… greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. We'll get that sent over to you electronically. The lab results should be available in a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss a more targeted treatment plan, if necessary. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe fatigue, dizziness, or shortness of breath – please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been most thorough, and your advice is… remarkably sensible. I confess, I’ve been rather reckless in my pursuit of… dietary perfection. But I’m prepared to embrace a more pragmatic approach. Thank you once again for your time and expertise. I daresay I’ll stick to animating for a while. Perhaps a nice, stable diet of biscuits and tea.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Biscuits and tea sound like a very sensible plan, Mr. Vantine. It was a pleasure meeting you, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and try to steer clear of the edible glitter.
PATIENT: Good day to you as well. And thank you once again. .
