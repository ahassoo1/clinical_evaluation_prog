DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again. It comes and goes, you see. And with it, these…water infections. They tell me it’s because of my kidneys. They’re not quite right, apparently. I’ve had it for quite a while now, this trouble.
DOCTOR: "Quite a while now"... Could you be a bit more specific, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… Let me think. It’s been… well, at least five years, maybe more. It started off just a little discomfort, easily ignored. But the infections… those started properly about three years ago, I’d say. Perhaps a bit longer. Time does seem to slip away these days, doesn't it? It’s hard to keep track. I've seen a few doctors about it over the years, too, so it all blends together a bit.
DOCTOR: Right. So, recurrent urinary tract infections for approximately three years, preceded by side pain for at least five. And you said you’ve seen other doctors for this… Do you recall who they were, and what investigations, if any, they performed?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… There was Dr. Sharma, back in Nadi. He did some tests, you know, with my water – urine, that is. And a blood test, I think. He’s the one who first mentioned something about my kidneys not being quite right, something about cysts. Then, after that, I saw Dr. Patel when I moved here. He also did water tests. I don’t recall any pictures being taken, though. Just the usual tests, I believe. I’m afraid I don’t have all the paperwork with me, Doctor. It’s all a bit of a blur. It was some time ago now.
DOCTOR: I see. We’ll need to review those previous test results if possible, Mr. Espinueva. It's important to get a complete picture. In the meantime, let’s focus on what's happening now. Can you describe the pain in your side?
PATIENT: Well, it's… a dull ache, mostly. It comes and goes, like I said. Sometimes it’s just a nagging feeling, other times it’s a bit sharper. It’s usually on my right side, but sometimes it spreads around to my back. It’s worse if I move quickly, or if I’ve been doing a lot of lifting. And it seems to get worse if I drink a lot of fluids, strangely enough. It’s not constant, thank goodness, but it’s always there, lurking in the background. And then, of course, the water infections… they make it much worse.
DOCTOR: And these urinary tract infections… how often would you say you’re experiencing them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… irregular. Some months I’m fine, completely fine. Then, other months, it feels like one after another. I’d say, on average… maybe three or four times a year? Sometimes more, sometimes less. The last one… hmm… I believe it was about a month ago, perhaps six weeks. It makes me feel very tired and weak, you see. And it’s uncomfortable, naturally. I have to keep going to the pharmacy, getting… medicine. It’s a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside these infections – fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your urine – blood, unusual smell, increased frequency or urgency?
PATIENT: Well, thankfully no fever or chills, Doctor. No nausea or vomiting, either. Just the tiredness, like I said. And yes… the urine. Sometimes it smells a bit…stronger than usual, perhaps? And yes, I do have to go more often. Especially when the infection is bad. Not a trickle, mind you, but more frequent visits to the…facilities. And sometimes, yes, there’s a little bit of blood. Not a lot, just enough to notice it, you see. It worries me, naturally. It's never a large amount, though. Just a tinge of pink, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for quite some time. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd like to perform a physical examination. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and check for any tenderness. I'll also need to collect a urine sample for analysis. That will help us confirm the infection and rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. A physical examination and a water sample… yes, that makes sense. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you see. It’s been dragging on for so long now. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could lie down on the examination table, please. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the examination. Okay, Mr. Espinueva. I'm not detecting any significant masses or distension. There is some mild tenderness in your right flank, which is consistent with your reported pain. Now, if you could please provide a urine sample for analysis. I’ll leave you some privacy, and I’ll be right back. There’s a specimen cup in the bathroom, and instructions on how to collect a clean-catch sample.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, certainly. Right flank tenderness… that sounds about right. I'll go and collect the sample now. A clean-catch sample, you say? I believe I remember how to do that, but if I forget, I'll just call you. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Please take your time, Mr. Espinueva. I’ll be here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Right, Doctor. I won't be long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Do you have the sample ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here you are. I hope I did it properly. It’s not always easy, you know. Getting a clean sample… It’s a bit tricky.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. It appears you’ve done a good job. We’ll send this to the lab right away. Now, while we’re waiting for the results, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, let me think. High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me about that a few years ago. I take a tablet for it, every morning. And…well, I suppose that's it. Nothing else, really. Dr. Sharma did mention something about my kidneys not being quite right, like I said before. Something about cysts. But he didn’t give me a specific name for anything. Just said to keep an eye on it. I haven't been diagnosed with diabetes, no. I'm generally quite healthy, aside from the blood pressure and the… kidney trouble. I try to eat a sensible diet, and I get a bit of exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: And what medication are you currently taking for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… It’s a small, white tablet. I think it’s called… Amlodipine. Yes, Amlodipine, 5 milligrams. I take one every morning with my breakfast. It seems to be keeping my blood pressure under control, thankfully. I have it checked regularly by my general practitioner. She’s very good, Doctor. Very thorough.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medication… well, aside from the Amlodipine, of course. But that’s not an allergy, it’s just something I take for my blood pressure. No, I’m not allergic to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those. Never have, never will. I used to enjoy a little glass of sherry with my dinner sometimes, many years ago, but I gave that up. It wasn't doing me any good. I don't smoke, and I certainly don't take any drugs. I lead a very quiet life, you see. I prefer it that way. I like my garden, and reading. Simple pleasures, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. The urinalysis confirms a urinary tract infection, as we suspected. The results are not surprising, given your symptoms. We’ll need to start you on a course of antibiotics. However, given your recurrent infections and the mention of cysts, I think it’s important to investigate this further. Do you have any family history of kidney disease or urinary problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Another infection. Well, that's not good, is it? Antibiotics… yes, alright. Do what you think is best, Doctor. Family history… let me see. My mother had a bit of trouble with her waterworks when she was older, I think. Not infections, though. Just…weakness. She needed help with things, you see. And my brother, he had high blood pressure, like me. But no kidney problems, as far as I know. Nothing specific, anyway. It wasn’t something we talked about much. We weren't a very close family, you see. But no, no known kidney trouble on either side.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history of recurrent UTIs, the tenderness in your right flank, and the mention of cysts, I recommend an ultrasound of your kidneys and bladder. This will help us visualize the kidneys, identify any blockages or abnormalities, and assess the size and number of cysts. Would you be willing to schedule that?
PATIENT: An ultrasound, you say? Yes, alright Doctor, that sounds sensible. If it helps to get to the bottom of this, then yes, please schedule it. I trust your judgment. When would that be, do you think? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? I just want to be ready, you see. I don’t want to cause any unnecessary delays.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. I've scheduled the ultrasound for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. You’ll need to arrive about 15 minutes early to fill out some paperwork. For the ultrasound itself, you’ll need to have a full bladder, so you’ll need to drink plenty of fluids in the hours leading up to the appointment, and avoid urinating. The technician will apply some gel to your abdomen, and then use a handheld device to create images of your kidneys and bladder. It’s a painless procedure, but it can be a little uncomfortable if your bladder is very full. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics to treat the current infection. I’m choosing Ciprofloxacin, 500 milligrams twice a day for seven days. Are you allergic to any fluoroquinolones?
PATIENT: Fluoroquinolones… hmm. That's a new one. No, Doctor, I don't think so. Not that I'm aware of. I haven't taken anything like that before. I've never had any trouble with medications, you see. Ciprofloxacin, you say? Seven days, twice a day? Alright, that sounds fine. Just let me know if there's anything I should be aware of, any side effects or anything like that. I just want to make sure I'm taking it properly. I’m always a bit cautious, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Here’s the medication list and instructions for Ciprofloxacin. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. It’s important to drink plenty of fluids while taking this medication, and to avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight, as it can increase your risk of sunburn. If you experience any severe side effects, such as dizziness, confusion, or muscle weakness, stop taking the medication and contact me immediately. I'm also going to give you a referral to a urologist. After the ultrasound, I want a specialist to review the images and help us determine the best course of action. Do you have a preference for a urologist, or would you like me to recommend one?
PATIENT: Oh, a urologist… yes, alright Doctor, that sounds sensible. I don’t have a preference, no. I haven't seen a specialist before. If you could recommend one, that would be very helpful. Someone nearby would be good, you see. I don’t like to travel too far. And someone…gentle, if you know what I mean. I’m not a very strong patient, you see. A bit nervous, perhaps. Just someone who explains things clearly, and doesn’t rush. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Mr. Espinueva. I'm going to refer you to Dr. Eleanor Vance. She's very good, and she has a reputation for being patient and understanding. Her office is located just a few miles from here, and she’s currently accepting new patients. I'll send the referral electronically, and her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. The antibiotics, the ultrasound, the referral to Dr. Vance… yes, I think that's all. I just want to thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining things so clearly. It’s a relief to finally have a plan. I’ve been worrying about this for so long. I appreciate your help very much. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, and I’ll see you next Tuesday. Have a good day.
