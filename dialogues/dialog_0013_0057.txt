DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My name is Chellsea Luft. I am here because… well, I have cancer. It's been… difficult.
DOCTOR: Chellsea, I’m so sorry to hear that. That is difficult. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It… started in my lung, the doctors said. They found it about six months ago. I had some trouble breathing, and a cough that wouldn’t go away. They did some tests and… that’s when they told me. It has spread to other places now, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago with shortness of breath and a persistent cough… and it’s unfortunately spread. Do you know what type of lung cancer it was diagnosed as?
PATIENT: I… honestly, no. They said a lot of things, and it was all very confusing. Something about cells, and… stages? I mostly just heard "cancer" and tried to listen to what they wanted me to do. I don’t really remember the specifics of the type, sorry. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Chellsea. It’s incredibly common to feel overwhelmed when you’re first given a diagnosis like that. A lot of information is thrown at you at once. We can definitely look that up in your records here, or if you have any reports from your previous doctors, that would be helpful. Okay, it looks like you were diagnosed with Stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. Has treatment already begun?
PATIENT: Oh. Stage IIIB… Yes, I have been having… chemotherapy. For about three months now. It makes me very tired and… sick to my stomach. I haven't been able to eat much. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, unfortunately, those are common side effects of chemotherapy. Nausea and fatigue are very frequent. Three months is a significant period, and it’s good you've been receiving treatment. To get a better understanding of where things stand now, and to see how we can best support you, could you tell me a little more about where the cancer has spread to?
PATIENT: Um… they said it was in my bones. My back mostly, and… my hip. It hurts a lot, especially when I move. And… … I’ve been having headaches lately. Sharp ones. They didn't know why. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Okay, spread to the bones—back and hip—and now experiencing headaches. It’s alright, Chellsea, you’re doing perfectly fine explaining. These details are very important. The headaches are new, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, they started about a month ago. They come and go, but… they've been getting worse. The doctors at the other hospital did a scan, but they didn’t say why my head hurts. They just gave me some pills to take for the pain. They weren't very helpful, to be honest. It feels like… everything is just getting harder.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds incredibly frustrating to not have clear answers, and to be dealing with increasing pain. It’s completely valid to feel overwhelmed by all of this. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll check your vital signs, listen to your lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess the headaches. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. If it helps. I’m not sure what a neurological exam is, but if it might tell us something, then yes, please. I just want to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A neurological exam is just a series of simple tests to check your reflexes, strength, sensation, and coordination – it helps us understand how your nervous system is functioning. It won’t take long. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety, which is understandable. Your lungs sound clear, but we'll want to compare these findings with your previous scans. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is this… normal to be so tired all the time? Even when I’m just sitting here?
DOCTOR: Strength is a bit diminished in your legs, and you reported some decreased sensation, which is consistent with what we’re seeing. Your coordination is also slightly off. Yes, extreme fatigue is very common with both cancer and chemotherapy, but it's important to rule out other contributing factors, like anemia or electrolyte imbalances. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam findings, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and some inflammatory markers. I also want to review your previous scans, if possible. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Anything that might help. I have copies of the scans with me, in this bag. And blood work is fine, too. I just want to know what’s happening, and what… what my options are.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll get those scans looked at right away. And the blood work will give us a much clearer picture of your overall health. Excellent. While I review these, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Not that I know of. I’ve never had any problems with any medicine before. Well… except for that one time when I was little, and I got a rash from some bug bite cream. But that wasn't a real allergy, I don’t think. Just a little itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Okay, these scans confirm the spread to the bones, as you mentioned, and we can see some areas of concern in your brain that could be contributing to the headaches. It appears there's some swelling present. Given these findings, I recommend a consultation with a neurologist as soon as possible. They can perform more detailed testing and help us determine the best course of action. Would you be comfortable with me arranging that for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A neurologist… that sounds good. Anything that might help. I… I trust your judgement, Doctor. Thank you. Is there… anything I should be doing? Besides wait for more tests? Anything to make myself more comfortable?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. While we wait for the neurology consultation, there are a few things that can help manage your symptoms. Pain management is crucial. Continue taking whatever pain medication you’ve been prescribed, and don't hesitate to let me know if it’s not effective. We can explore other options. For the nausea, try eating small, frequent meals, avoiding strong smells, and staying hydrated. As for fatigue, prioritize rest, but also try to incorporate gentle exercise, like short walks, if you're able. And most importantly, don’t hesitate to lean on your support system. Talking to family, friends, or a therapist can make a huge difference. I can also provide you with resources for cancer support groups and counseling services. I'll write everything down for you. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: That… that’s a lot to remember. Support groups… I hadn't thought of that. I lost my husband a few years ago. He… he was my support. I don’t really have anyone left. Would you… would you mind writing down those resources? And… maybe a phone number for a counselor?
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult. It’s completely understandable to feel alone right now. These resources are just a starting point. There are people who care and want to help, and it’s okay to ask for support. We also have a social worker here at the clinic who can provide additional assistance and connect you with local resources. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you with her?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. A social worker… that sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. Just… thank you. I feel a little less scared. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get everything scheduled for you—the neurology consultation and the appointment with the social worker. My nurse will be in shortly to finalize the paperwork and answer any questions you may have. Remember, you're not alone in this. We're here to support you every step of the way.
