DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I understand you’re here with us today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I want to... how you say... find out more about where my family come from. My people, long time ago. I hear you can do test, with spit, to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, I understand. You're interested in learning about your ancestral history through genetic testing. That is certainly something we can discuss, and it is possible to get a great deal of information from a saliva sample. Before we proceed with ordering any tests, though, it's important to understand what those tests can and cannot tell us. They can often provide information about your ethnic origins and potential relatives, but they aren’t always completely definitive. To start, could you tell me a little more about what specifically you’re hoping to learn?
PATIENT: Hmm. Definitive... that mean... not always right? Okay. I just... I always hear stories, you know? About people coming from different islands, different places. My mama, she tell me stories. But now she gone. I want to know for sure. I want to know where my people really from. I want to know if the stories are true.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Scobie. It's very natural to want to connect with your heritage, especially after losing someone who held those stories. It's admirable that you want to preserve that connection. You're right to be cautious about relying solely on test results, as they aren’t perfect, but they can be a valuable starting point. To clarify, when you say “stories,” are these stories about specific islands or regions within the Marshall Islands, or are they about origins further back in time, perhaps before your ancestors settled there?
PATIENT: Oh. Hmm. Both, I think. Mama say we come from... many islands, long, long time ago. Before Marshall Islands. She say some come from...Palau, maybe? And some from islands far away, she no remember the name. But she say all our people, good sailors, always travel the ocean. She say we mix with many people, many islands. She say that is why we strong.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like your mother's stories indicate a complex history of migration and interaction with other island communities. A genetic test could potentially reveal ancestry from Palau, and perhaps provide clues about other origins further afield, though pinpointing specific islands beyond that can be challenging. Before we order a test, let's briefly discuss your medical history. This isn’t directly related to the ancestry testing, but it’s standard practice for me to have a comprehensive understanding of my patients’ health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Medical… I no have much. I get old man problems, you know? My knees hurt sometimes. And my heart, it beat a little funny sometimes, but doctor say is okay, just old. I take pills for my blood pressure, that is all. Medicare pay for it. I go to doctor check up every year.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Scobie. “Old man problems” are common, and it’s good that you’re staying on top of your health with regular check-ups. So, you have a history of hypertension, managed with medication. Do you recall the name of the medication you are taking?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... the little white pill. It start with an "A"... Amlodi... something like that. Amlodi-pine, I think? The doctor, she write it for me. I no remember all the names.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes. Thank you, Mr. Scobie. That matches what I see in your records. Excellent. And just to confirm, you have no known allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I eat everything. I like fish and coconut. Everything okay.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. That’s all good to know. Now, returning to your interest in ancestral history, there are a few different companies that offer genetic testing. Some are more comprehensive than others, and the price can vary considerably. Before we proceed, it's important to be aware that these tests can sometimes reveal unexpected information about family relationships. Are you prepared for the possibility of learning something that might be surprising or challenging?
PATIENT: Hmm. Surprising? Like what? I no think so. My family, we good people. But… I guess. If it true, it true. I want to know. I no afraid of surprises. Maybe I find out cousin live far away? That would be good.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable attitude, Mr. Scobie. It's good you've considered that. Unexpected information can sometimes relate to paternity or previously unknown family members, but it sounds like you're prepared for that possibility. Okay, given your history and what you're hoping to learn, I recommend a test from 23andMe or AncestryDNA. They both provide detailed ancestry reports and have large databases, which increases the likelihood of finding relatives. They both cost around \$99. Would you like me to write you a requisition for one of those tests?
PATIENT: \$99? Okay. That not so bad. 23andMe… my grandson, he use that one. He find out he from…Sweden or something. Yes, Doctor. Write me requisition for 23andMe. That sound good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here you go, Mr. Scobie. This is the requisition form for 23andMe. It includes instructions on how to collect a saliva sample and mail it to their lab. It typically takes several weeks to receive the results. Once you receive the results, you can review them online. If you have any questions or would like me to help interpret the findings, please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This very helpful. No, I think I okay for now. I just hope I find out more about my mama’s stories. Okay. Thank you for coming in. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I sincerely hope the test provides you with the information you’re seeking. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please feel free to reach out if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye bye!
