DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I got this headache, right here in the back of my head. It's been botherin' me for… oh, let me think… about three days now, I reckon. Not the worst pain ever, but it’s constant. Like a dull ache, never really goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant dull ache in the back of your head for about three days. That’s helpful. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn’t really throb, more like… pressure. And it feels worse when I’m lookin’ down, like when I’m readin’ or workin’ on the computer. I do a lot of financial reports for folks, you know? Gotta keep those numbers straight. It doesn’t hurt when I’m just relaxin’ or lookin’ straight ahead. Oh, and bright light doesn’t seem to make it worse, either. That’s good, right? I used to get migraines when I was younger and light always set those off.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Mr. Gibbel. It sounds like the pain is positional, meaning it’s affected by your head position, and isn’t triggered by light, which is certainly different from a migraine. You mentioned it's worse when you’re reading or working on the computer. Is there anything else that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Layin’ down seems to help a little, but not much. I tried takin’ some of those over-the-counter pain relievers – you know, ibuprofen – but they didn’t really do much good, to be honest. Didn’t change a thing. And… oh! Now that I think about it, my neck feels a little stiff on the right side. Not awful, just… tight. I probably should stretch more, I guess. Old age, you know? Things get creaky.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, lying down offers minimal relief, ibuprofen isn't helping, and you’ve noticed some stiffness in your right neck. That’s all very useful information. Before we go further, let's just do a quick review of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, nothin’ major, thankfully. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on some medicine years ago and it’s been under control ever since. And… oh, my knees ain’t what they used to be, but that's just from a lot of years of walkin’ and helpin’ folks with their fields back home. No surgeries or nothin', just a little achin’. I haven't seen a doctor regularly in… oh, goodness, probably five years or more. I usually only go when somethin’ really bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, well-managed with medication, and some knee pain, but no surgeries. And it's been about five years since your last check-up. Thank you for letting me know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, other than the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for the blood pressure. It's called…let me see if I can remember... Amlodipine, I think? Little white pill. Take it every morning with my breakfast. And that's it. I try to stay away from too many medicines if I can. My mother always said, “Too much medicine is worse than the sickness,” and I kinda believe that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Gibbel. Amlodipine daily for your blood pressure. And I understand your mother's philosophy – it’s always best to be cautious with medications when possible. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat just about anything, and I spend a lot of time outdoors, workin’ in the garden and such. Never had no trouble with pollen or nothin’ like that. My wife used to tease me, sayin’ I had a cast iron stomach. She’s… well, that’s another story for another time.
DOCTOR: I see. No known allergies, which is excellent. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, stroke, or headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father had… he had some trouble with his heart later in life, I think. Had to go to the hospital a few times. And my mother, she had arthritis, real bad. Lots of pain in her joints. My older brother, he got diabetes when he was younger, but he didn’t take care of himself very well. As for headaches… no, not really. No one in my family ever complained about headaches much. We were all pretty tough, I guess. Mostly just aches and pains from hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart disease, arthritis, and diabetes, but not much in the way of headaches. That's helpful. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I live alone now, like I said. My wife, she passed away about ten years ago. I keep busy, though. I do a lot of gardening, grow my own vegetables. Helps me stay active. I also do some financial planning for folks in the Hmong community – help them with their taxes and investments. I walk most days, usually a couple of miles. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little bit of beer sometimes, with dinner. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and rice. I don’t get out much socially, mostly just see my grandkids once in a while.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very active and fulfilling life, Mr. Gibbel, despite everything. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your neck and head. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I haven’t had a good lookin’ at in a while, so I reckon it’s a good idea. Just let me know if anything feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gibbel, everything seems to be generally okay, but your neck muscles are definitely tense and tender on the right side, and you have some limited range of motion. Your blood pressure is a little high, but that could be due to being in the doctor's office. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a tension headache, possibly related to muscle strain in your neck. The limited range of motion and tenderness support that. However, given your age and slightly elevated blood pressure, I want to be cautious and rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a few tests, if you're willing. A complete blood count to rule out any infection, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes. I'd also like to get an X-ray of your cervical spine to rule out any structural problems. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If you think it's best to be careful, then go ahead and order those tests. I don't want nothin' serious sneakin' up on me. X-ray and blood work, you said? Just let me know what I need to do and where to go. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write you a referral for the blood work and X-ray. The lab is just down the hall, and the imaging center is across the street. They should be able to schedule you for the X-ray quickly. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I recommend taking some over-the-counter pain relievers – either ibuprofen or naproxen – as directed on the label. Also, try applying a warm compress to your neck muscles for 15-20 minutes several times a day. And gentle stretching can help, but don't push yourself too hard. I'm also going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, to help relieve the muscle spasm. It’s a low dose, but it can be effective. You’ll take it at bedtime. I’ll send the prescription to your pharmacy. I’d like to see you back here in one week to discuss the results of the tests and see how you’re responding to the treatment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Pain relievers, warm compress, stretches, and that medicine. I'll get the prescription filled and start those things right away. One week to come back and check on things. I appreciate you takin’ the time to look into this. My wife always said, “Better safe than sorry,” and I reckon she was right.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. I agree – it’s always best to be cautious. Here are the referrals for the lab and imaging center, and a printout with instructions on how to prepare for the tests. If you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, severe headache, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking – please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything clearly. I feel much better knowin’ what’s goin’ on and havin’ a plan to deal with it. Thank you again for your help. I reckon I'll head down to the lab now and get those tests done.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll see you back here in one week.
PATIENT: .
