DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Liza. I'm Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Noordin. Well, to be honest, it's something a little different than a usual check-up. I’ve been thinking about trying mindfulness or meditation, and I thought maybe you could point me in the right direction. I keep hearing how good it is for stress, and… well, life gets busy, you know?
DOCTOR: Mindfulness, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. I’ve read a few articles, and a friend mentioned it helped her sleep better. But honestly, I don’t really know where to start. There are so many apps and classes… it’s a bit overwhelming. And I wondered if it was something that would even work for someone like me. I'm… practical, I suppose. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Practical. Right. Well, it’s…trendy, I suppose. A lot of people are trying these things. Before we get into apps and classes, let’s just clarify a few things. Are you experiencing significant stress?
PATIENT: Significant stress… that’s a good question. I wouldn’t say it’s debilitating, but my job… it can be demanding. Signal and track repairs aren’t exactly relaxing, you know? Long hours, sometimes odd locations… and you have to be very focused. I worry a lot about getting things right, keeping everything safe. It’s mostly mental, I think. Not… panic attacks or anything, just a constant low-level anxiety. Does that count as significant? I don’t really know the medical terms.
DOCTOR: Okay, “constant low-level anxiety.” And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… probably for the last ten years or so, really. It comes and goes, but it’s always there in the background. It’s gotten a bit worse in the last few years, I think. More responsibility at work, things like that. I used to be able to just switch off when I got home, but it's harder now. I don’t sleep as well as I used to, either. Not every night, but often I’ll wake up thinking about something I need to check or something that could go wrong.
DOCTOR: And you’re 47, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. I’ll be 48 in November. November 12th, if you need the exact date. I always remember dates, oddly enough. It's one of those things. My mother always said I had a good memory.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I haven't really needed much in the way of medication, thankfully. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, and a bad flu a few years back, but nothing ongoing. No high blood pressure, no diabetes… I try to eat reasonably well, though I admit it’s hard when you’re traveling for work. Medicare covers my check-ups, and they always tell me I'm generally healthy. Just… a little stressed. It feels silly to come to a doctor about stress, honestly.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s not “silly,” exactly. But it’s important to rule out anything else that could be contributing to how you’re feeling. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms alongside this stress?
PATIENT: Hmm… physical symptoms. Let me think. Sometimes I get headaches, mostly tension headaches around my neck and shoulders. And my stomach… it's a bit sensitive. Not really pain, but just… unsettled. I get heartburn sometimes, especially if I've had a late dinner. And I suppose I get tired more easily than I used to. But honestly, Dr. Noordin, I mostly just feel… wired. Like I can't quite switch off. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, but this feels different somehow. It’s more constant. Does that make any sense? I’m probably rambling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my mother had anxiety, although she never really talked about it. She just… worried a lot, like me. And my grandfather on my father’s side had high blood pressure, but that’s about it, as far as I know. No one really talked much about health problems. We weren't really that sort of family. More focused on getting things done, you know? I do remember my aunt having trouble sleeping, but I don't know if that was related to anxiety or something else. Does it matter a lot? I mean, I'm not expecting to suddenly develop anything just because my mother worried.
DOCTOR: It can give us a better picture, Liza. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. I don’t drink very often, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month, if that. And I've never smoked a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were terrible for you, and I listened. And recreational drugs… well, that’s just not me. I prefer a good book, honestly. Or a walk in the park, when I have the time. My job keeps me pretty busy, so there isn’t much room for anything else, really. I do drink coffee, though. A couple of cups in the morning, just to get going. Is that bad? I read somewhere that too much caffeine can make anxiety worse.
DOCTOR: It can, yes. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to rule out any underlying issues. Could you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly. There you go. I haven't weighed myself in ages, actually. I try not to focus on numbers too much. It's more important to feel healthy, isn't it? Though, I suppose knowing is helpful.
DOCTOR: 136 pounds, 5’3”. Okay. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72. Normal. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths, please. In… and out… Good. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds normal. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. And finally, a quick abdominal exam. No tenderness. Everything feels… within normal limits. Physically, you appear to be in good health. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing stress-related symptoms. We’ve ruled out anything more serious.
PATIENT: That’s… good to hear, honestly. I was worried it might be something else. So, stress… what now? You mentioned mindfulness earlier. Is that something you’d recommend? I’m just not sure where to begin. I feel a bit silly trying to “meditate,” if that’s the right word. It feels… unnatural, I suppose. I’m a practical person. I do things. Sitting and… thinking? It doesn’t sound very effective, does it?
DOCTOR: It’s not about feeling effective, Liza. It’s about learning to manage your body’s response to stress. It takes practice. And honestly, it’s not for everyone. I’ll be frank. You’re right, it is a bit… unconventional. But it has been shown to be helpful for some people. There are apps, like Headspace or Calm, that can guide you through it. Alternatively, you could consider talking to a therapist. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to can make a difference. Before we go any further, have you ever considered therapy?
PATIENT: Therapy… no, I haven’t, actually. It feels a bit… extreme, I suppose. I mean, I’m not depressed or anything. Just… stressed. I can usually manage on my own, just by keeping busy and focusing on work. But maybe… maybe I'm wrong. It’s just… I’m not really comfortable talking about my feelings, to be honest. It feels… vulnerable. And I’m not sure what I would even say to a therapist. Would they just tell me to… relax more? I'm a bit skeptical, I admit. Is it really effective? What does it involve, exactly?
DOCTOR: It involves talking, Liza. It’s a space where you can explore your feelings without judgment. And no, they won’t just tell you to “relax more.” A good therapist will help you identify the root causes of your stress and develop coping mechanisms. Look, you’ve managed on your own for a long time, clearly. But sometimes, it’s helpful to have an objective perspective. I’m not telling you to go to therapy. I’m simply suggesting it as an option. As for apps, you could try Headspace or Calm for a week and see if it helps. If it doesn't, we can explore other options. But I strongly recommend ruling out any underlying medical conditions first, just to be safe. Perhaps a vitamin D check?
PATIENT: Okay. A vitamin D check sounds sensible, just to rule things out. And the apps… I suppose I could try them. Headspace, you said? I’ll download it tonight. But I’m still hesitant about therapy. Maybe… maybe if the apps don’t help, I’ll reconsider. But right now, I’m just not sure it’s for me. It feels a bit… overwhelming, to be honest. Just adding another thing to my already busy schedule. It’s a lot to think about. Thank you, Dr. Noordin. For being honest, and not dismissing my concerns. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll order the vitamin D test. The nurse will draw blood before you leave. Try the app for a week, and if you don't see any improvement, schedule another appointment, and we can discuss therapy again. In the meantime, try to prioritize self-care. And consider reducing your caffeine intake. Here’s a handout with some relaxation techniques. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That’s… a lot to take in. Thank you again, Dr. Noordin. And thank you for the handout. I appreciate your time. I think that’s all for today.
DOCTOR: Alright then. Get some rest, Liza. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes. .
