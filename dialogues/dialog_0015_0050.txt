DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… this cough. Been hangin' on for a while now. A dry cough, mostly. Not much… not much phlegm, you know? Just… scratchy. It's bothersome, especially at night. Honestly, I don't remember exactly when it started, but it feels like a long time.
DOCTOR: A long time… can you be a bit more specific, Mr. Pavlovic?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. That’s… difficult. Maybe… a few months? Or longer? I used to work with a lot of… dust, you see. Body shop work. Lots of sanding, sprayin’… could be somethin’ from that. But I retired… oh, a good ten years ago now, maybe more. Time… it slips away, doesn't it? I just… I just want it to stop coughin’. It keeps me up.
DOCTOR: A few months, potentially longer, with a history of dust exposure from body shop work. And it's primarily a dry cough, worse at night. Do you notice anything that makes it better or worse, besides lying down?
PATIENT: Hmm… better? Not really. Not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes… a little water helps soothe it, maybe? But it comes back. Worse… well, cold air, I think. And… when I try to talk too much. Makes it tickle more. It’s funny… or not funny, really… but it feels like somethin’ stuck in my throat sometimes. Not pain, just… irritation.
DOCTOR: Irritation… okay. And have you experienced any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… Oh! Now that you mention it… I get a little… winded easier. Used to be able to walk anywhere, now… I have to stop and catch my breath going up the stairs. But I figured that was just… old age. And maybe a little weight gain. I don't move around as much anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: Windedness with exertion, and you attribute that to deconditioning… Alright. And have you noticed any fever, chills, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I know of. My wife, bless her heart, always took care of checkin' those things. She… she passed a few years back. Chills, no. And weight loss… no, not really. If anything, I’ve gained a little. Like I said, not as active. Sorry… I’m ramblin' again. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling, Mr. Pavlovic. It's important to provide as much information as possible. No fever, no chills, no unintentional weight loss. And your wife took care of monitoring your temperature – that's good to know. Now, have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, thankfully. Not a sharp pain, not a dull ache, nothin’. Shortness of breath… well, a little, when I walk. Like I said, I get winded easier. And… … now that you mention it, my ankles do seem a bit puffy sometimes. Especially at the end of the day. I figured it was just from sittin’ too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Before we proceed, can you tell me about any allergies you have to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I remember. I used to take some… some pills for my blood pressure, a long time ago. But my doctor took me off ‘em. Said it was makin’ me dizzy. Otherwise… nothin’ comes to mind. I’m pretty simple, you see. Don’t eat fancy foods, don’t use fancy creams… nothin’ like that.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. And you previously took medication for blood pressure, but were discontinued due to dizziness. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ now. Stopped everything when my wife… well, stopped everything. I just haven’t bothered startin’ anything back up. I figure… at my age… … what’s the point? Just take things as they come, you know? I drink a lot of water though, like I said. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pavlovic, I understand your perspective, but it’s still important to have a complete picture of your health. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history. Let me think… I had… a touch of pneumonia, a long time ago. When I was younger. Spent a week in the hospital. But I recovered. And… my wife said I had high blood pressure, like I mentioned. But that was years ago. Other than that… nothin’ that I can recall. I’ve always been pretty strong, you see. Worked hard all my life. Didn’t have much time for gettin’ sick. I think I just wore myself out, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia in the past, and a history of hypertension. Okay. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reasons?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think... Oh! Yes. When I was a boy, I had my tonsils taken out. That was… a long time ago. And… when I broke my arm fallin’ out of a tree. Had to get a cast. Other than that… no. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly bumps and bruises from workin’ with cars. Nothing serious enough to need a hospital, except for the pneumonia. And, of course, the tonsils. I was always a bit of a climber, you see. A bit reckless, maybe.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and a broken arm in the past. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. My parents, they both passed away a long time ago. And I didn’t… I didn’t keep in touch with a lot of relatives. My wife did, but… she’s gone now. I know my mother… she had some trouble with her heart, towards the end. But I don’t know what kind of trouble. Just… her heart. And… my uncle, on my father's side, he smoked a lot. I think he had… something with his lungs. But that was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to him. Honestly, I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. I’m sorry. It’s just… faded away.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Pavlovic. Many people don’t have detailed information about their family history. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Not once. My wife… she didn’t like it. Said it was bad for your health. And… I always figured she was right. I drank a little sometimes, with dinner. A glass of wine, maybe. But nothing heavy. I always preferred water, to be honest. It’s just… better for you. Cleaner. I always tried to take care of myself, you see. As best as I could.
DOCTOR: No history of smoking, occasional alcohol use. Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Before I conduct a physical exam, is there anything else you’d like to tell me about your cough or any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… Oh! Sometimes, when I lie flat, it feels like somethin’ is drippin’ down the back of my throat. Makes me cough even more. Like… like a little bit of water. Not a lot, just enough to bother me. And… when I exert myself, like climbin’ the stairs, I get a little… wheezy. Not all the time, just sometimes. And I get short of breath, like I said. Other than that… I don't think so. It's just a cough, you see. A bothersome cough. But I'm sure it's just old age. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen saturation, and take your blood pressure. Please lie back on the examination table. It may take a few minutes.
