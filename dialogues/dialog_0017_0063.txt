DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I am Dr. Blim. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's my back. It's been really bad lately. Hurts to move, hurts to sit... pretty much hurts all the time now. It's the same back that… well, you'd know, with the cancer.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do recall. The previous malignancy, of course. Though, I trust you’ve been following up with oncology as scheduled?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Always. Every three months, like they tell me. Last appointment was… let me think… July 12th. Dr. Chen, she’s good. But she mostly checks if it’s back, not so much the pain. And this pain… it’s different. Worse, maybe? I don’t know, that’s why I came to you. It's just… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: “Different,” is rather vague, Ms. Meigs. We need specifics. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Um… it's not just a dull ache anymore. It's… sharp sometimes. Like a stabbing feeling. And it goes down my leg, both legs now, kinda. Before it was just the right side. And it’s worse when I try to stand up straight. I have to kinda… hunch over. It feels like something is… stuck. I don't know. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I'm not good at… describing things.
DOCTOR: “Stuck” is… unhelpful, frankly. However, the radiation from the previous treatment could certainly be contributing to musculoskeletal issues. We must, of course, rule out recurrence. Let’s begin with a thorough physical examination. Please, lie down on the examination table for me. We’ll assess your range of motion and neurological function.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good. Recurrence… that sounds scary. But checking is good. Yeah, I can lie down. Is it okay if I… if I just take it slow? I'm a little worried about moving too fast and making it worse.
DOCTOR: Of course, proceed at your own pace. However, we need to assess the extent of the problem. I assure you, slow and deliberate is perfectly acceptable. I will be palpating your spine and assessing your reflexes. Please inform me immediately if you experience any increased pain or discomfort during the examination. Now, if you would kindly lie supine…
PATIENT: Okay, supine… that’s on my back, right? Yes, that’s… that’s a little uncomfortable. But okay. Tell me what you need me to do. And… I will tell you if it hurts, I promise. Just be careful, please. It feels… fragile.
DOCTOR: Very well. I am simply feeling for areas of tenderness or muscle spasm. I observe some mild guarding in the lumbar region. Now, can you point to the exact location of the pain you described?
PATIENT: Right… here. And it kinda goes around, to both sides, but it's worst… right here. It feels… deep. Like something is pushing. And when I bend over… Oh! Sorry. That was bad. It shoots down my legs when I do that.
DOCTOR: Do not attempt to move against pain, Ms. Meigs. That is counterproductive. Now, let's assess your reflexes. Please keep your legs extended. I will gently tap your patellar tendons. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Sensory function appears intact. Now, straight leg raise. Can you lift your right leg, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. No bending over, got it. This is… hard. It pulls on my back. I can only go this far… It hurts, Doctor. Right in my back and down my leg. Does that tell you anything? It’s like… stretching a muscle that’s already pulled too tight.
DOCTOR: The positive straight leg raise suggests possible nerve root compression. However, given your history of malignancy and radiation therapy, the etiology is… complex. We must consider several possibilities. We need imaging. I’m ordering an MRI of the lumbar spine. This will help us visualize the spinal cord, nerves, and surrounding tissues. It's essential to rule out recurrence or other structural abnormalities. I also recommend a consultation with a neurologist. They can perform a more comprehensive neurological evaluation.
PATIENT: MRI and a neurologist… that sounds… serious. Is it bad? Is the cancer back? I… I was hoping it was just a bad muscle pull. What if it is the cancer? I just… I don't want to go through all that again. What are the chances it's just… something else? Could it be the radiation, like you said? Maybe just a pinched nerve? I get so scared…
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, allow me to be blunt. Your history necessitates a thorough investigation. While it could be a simple musculoskeletal issue, dismissing the possibility of recurrence would be… irresponsible. The radiation can cause inflammation and nerve damage, but the MRI is essential to differentiate between that and a more serious underlying cause. As for “chances,” I refuse to speculate. The neurologist will interpret the MRI results and provide a more definitive assessment. I'm ordering blood work to check for inflammatory markers and rule out other systemic conditions. Until we have those results, I recommend continuing your current medication regimen and avoiding any strenuous activity. I will schedule the MRI and neurology consultation for the earliest possible appointment. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: So… lots of tests. And waiting. Just waiting. No, I don’t think so. Just… when will I hear about the tests? And… will someone explain everything to me? I get so confused with all the… the words. Like, what is an inflammatory marker? And… is there anything I can take for the pain, in the meantime? Something stronger? It's really hard to do anything… even just sitting up. .
DOCTOR: The MRI results typically take 24-48 hours to be interpreted. The neurologist's office will contact you directly to schedule an appointment once they receive the report. As for "inflammatory markers," they are simply indicators of inflammation in the body. It's not important for you to understand the specifics. I will prescribe you a short course of Naproxen for pain relief. However, it is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, so be mindful of potential side effects. I trust that clarifies everything. I have a full schedule of patients. If you have further questions, please direct them to the nursing staff. Good day, Ms. Meigs.
