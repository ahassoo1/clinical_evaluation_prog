DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Something saying I’m able to fly. I’m going on a trip, and the airline needs a note from a doctor. It’s a little silly, I know, but they’re being very strict.
DOCTOR: Okay, a note for air travel. No problem at all, we can certainly do that. It's not silly at all – airlines are very cautious these days. Just to be sure I have everything right, is there anything specific about your health the airline is concerned about?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. They didn’t really say. Just a general “doctor’s note confirming fitness to fly.” I just… lost my husband last year, and I’m trying to go visit some family overseas for the first time since then. I think maybe they just want to cover themselves, considering. It’s a long flight.
DOCTOR: Oh, Kiante, I am so very sorry to hear about your husband. That must be incredibly difficult, and traveling for the first time since then… that takes a lot of courage. I understand. We want to make sure you're comfortable and safe, of course. Just to be thorough, even though they didn’t specify, let's just run through a few quick things. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. No complaints, really. A little tired, maybe, but who isn't these days? No pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that. I’ve been walking every day, trying to keep active. My energy levels are pretty good, all things considered. I had a check-up with my primary care doctor a few months ago, and everything was normal then.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, walking is excellent. And a recent check-up with your primary care physician is reassuring. Just to be complete, have you had any recent surgeries, or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No surgeries. And no medications, either. Just a daily multivitamin. I try to eat pretty healthy, but you know, it’s good to have a little extra insurance. I did have the flu shot last fall, and the COVID booster a few months ago, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Vitamins are fine. And the flu shot and booster are helpful. Any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. No food allergies, no medication allergies, nothing. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. I remember being stung by a bee when I was a child, but I didn’t have a bad reaction. Mostly just a swollen ankle.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No known allergies is good to know. And to confirm, you said you've been walking regularly and have no pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. About thirty minutes every day, usually. No pain, no dizziness, no problems at all. I walk up a bit of a hill sometimes, just to make it a little more challenging. I feel pretty strong, honestly. It helps with… everything. I’m just eager to get this letter so I can book my flight. It’s a long process, getting everything arranged.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, and very proactive of you. Exercise is truly one of the best medicines. Alright, I’m drafting a note here stating you are medically cleared for air travel, with no specific restrictions. Just one moment… Okay, I’ve included a statement about your recent check-up and your regular exercise routine. Would you like me to print that out for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be great. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this. It’s one less thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could help ease some of your worries. Here you go. Please review it, and let me know if there's anything you'd like me to change. And again, I’m so sorry for your loss. I truly hope you have a peaceful and restorative trip with your family. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: It looks perfect, thank you. Exactly what I needed. No changes at all. And thank you for the kind words, Doctor. I really appreciate it. No, that’s all, I think. I should probably get this sent off to the airline. Thank you again for everything. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. It was my pleasure. Safe travels, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a wonderful day as well.
