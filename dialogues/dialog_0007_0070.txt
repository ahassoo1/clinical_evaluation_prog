DOCTOR: Hi Kile, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Doctor… Hernandez, you say? Good to meet you too. I… moved here. Recently. From… somewhere. It’s all a bit blurry, honestly. Just need… the healthcare. The papers said to come here. Medicare, you know? New area. That’s it, really. Is this where I tell you everything that’s wrong with me? Because… I don't really remember everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. We can take things slowly. Don’t worry about remembering everything at once. “The healthcare” is a good starting point. We’ll figure things out together. And yes, this is where you tell me what's been bothering you – anything at all, even if it seems small. It sounds like you’re new to the area, and that's fine. We’ll get a good picture of your health. To start, can you tell me about any specific symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. What are symptoms? Like… feeling bad? I get tired, I think. Yes, definitely tired. And my hands… they shake a little. Not always, but sometimes. When I’m… doing things. Like, if I’m putting makeup on… which is what I do, you know? I used to be very good. Very steady hands. Not so much anymore. It’s annoying, more than anything. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and shaking hands – those can definitely be symptoms. And it's good you're noticing changes, even if it's just annoying. "Annoying" is a perfectly valid way to describe something that's affecting your quality of life. When did you start noticing the tiredness and shaking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. It’s all a bit of a… blur. Maybe a few months? Or longer? Before I moved here, definitely. I think. It’s hard to say. Everything feels… mixed up. I used to work a lot, always busy, always on my feet. Maybe it’s just… getting old? People get tired when they get old, don’t they? And hands shake. It’s normal.
DOCTOR: It is normal for things to change as we get older, but it's still important to figure out what’s going on. You're right, a few months is a bit vague, that's okay. Was it a gradual change, or did it seem to come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Yes, that’s the word. Slowly… getting worse. I didn’t really pay attention at first. Just thought I was… busier than usual. Working on a big project. But then it didn't go away, even when I… wasn't working. And the shaking… it started small. Barely noticeable. Now… well, now it’s harder to ignore. It makes applying eyeliner very difficult, let me tell you. Very difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset, worsening over time, affecting daily activities like applying eyeliner… that’s helpful information. Aside from the tiredness and shaking, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. My memory, definitely. I forget things. Like… names. And where I put things. Very frustrating. My wife… she used to remind me. But… she’s not here anymore. So now I just… forget. It’s… annoying. Is that another symptom? Everything seems to be “annoying” lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, memory problems can be a symptom. And it’s perfectly alright to be frustrated when things are difficult. It sounds like you’ve been going through a lot, Kile. When did you start noticing the memory problems?
PATIENT: Around the same time as the tiredness, I think. Maybe a little after. It started with small things. Like… misplacing my keys. Or forgetting appointments. But then it got worse. I started forgetting… important things. Names of clients. Details of projects. It’s… embarrassing. My wife used to say I was getting absent-minded. But she always knew what was going on. Now… I just feel lost.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the memory problems developed around the same time as the fatigue, worsening over time. It's completely understandable that you feel lost, Kile. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I'm going to ask you some more general questions. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Medical problems… hmm. That’s another difficult question. I used to see a doctor… regularly. But it was all a long time ago. I had… something with my heart, I think. A long time ago. Nothing serious. They gave me pills. I took them for a while. But I stopped. It was… a long time ago. And before that… I broke my arm, when I was a boy. But that’s not really a medical problem, is it? I don’t really… remember much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of a heart condition treated with medication, and a broken arm as a child. That's a good start. Do you remember what the heart condition was?
PATIENT: No… not really. Something with the rhythm, I think? They said my heart was… beating too fast. Or too slow. One of the two. They gave me pills to… regulate it. Little white pills. I took them for… a year, maybe? Two years? I don't remember the name of the condition. Or the doctor's name, for that matter. It was… a long time ago. Everything is so blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heart rhythm problem treated with medication for about a year or two. We can try to track down records if that's something you'd like. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. No… I don’t think so. Not that I remember, anyway. Maybe when I was a child? For my tonsils? But I don’t really remember. It was… a very long time ago. I’ve always been… careful. Tried to avoid hospitals as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recollection of any surgeries, possibly tonsillectomy as a child. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me see. No… I don’t think so. Not regularly. I might take something for… headaches, sometimes. But that’s it. Just… over-the-counter stuff. Little blue pills. Or white ones. I can’t really remember. I stopped taking the heart pills… a long time ago. As I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, occasional over-the-counter pain relievers. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t think so. But… sometimes I get a little itchy when I eat shellfish. But that might just be… old age. Or something I ate. I don’t really pay attention. It’s not serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible mild reaction to shellfish. Now, to get a more complete picture of your health, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members have had any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s… complicated. My wife’s family… they were all very healthy. Very strong. But my family… it was… different. My father… he had something with his heart. Like me. But… worse. He died… when I was young. And my mother… she had… problems with her memory. Later in life. She… forgot things. A lot of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems and memory issues. I understand that can be difficult to talk about. We don't need to go into a lot of detail right now if you're not comfortable. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… yes, yes, that’s fine. I suppose it’s necessary. Just… try not to poke too much. My wife… she always said I was very sensitive. I don't like needles, if that matters. And… be gentle, please. I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take things slowly and gently. No poking, I promise. And I'll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Neurological exam is… slightly diminished reflexes in the lower extremities, but no focal deficits. I’m noting some mild tremor in your hands, as you mentioned. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems relatively stable, but the tremor and mild memory issues are concerning, and the murmur warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Murmur… concerning? What does that mean? Is it… bad? I knew I should have taken better care of myself. My wife always told me… What kind of investigation? Will it hurt? And… what about my hands? Can you fix the shaking? I need to be steady… for my work.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take one thing at a time. A murmur simply means there's an extra sound when your heart beats. It doesn't automatically mean something is seriously wrong, but it's something we need to investigate further to understand the cause. As for the investigation, we'll start with an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart. We may also need to do an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart. It's non-invasive – it doesn't involve any needles or pain. It’s like a picture of your heart. As for your hands, the shaking could be due to several things. It could be essential tremor, which is common, or it could be related to other medical conditions. We'll need to do some tests to figure out the cause, and then we can discuss treatment options. We’re going to start with the EKG today. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: EKG… alright. As long as there are no needles. And it doesn’t hurt. You promise? My wife… she hated needles. What about the other test? The… echo-something? Do I have to come back tomorrow? I just moved here. I haven't even unpacked yet.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no needles for the EKG, I promise. It's just small stickers we place on your chest to measure the electrical activity of your heart. Very simple and painless. As for the echocardiogram, yes, you would need to come back for that. We can schedule it for sometime next week. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. We can work around your schedule to find a time that’s convenient for you, especially since you just moved. Now, while we’re waiting for the EKG, would you like me to order a blood test to check your overall health?
PATIENT: Blood test… hmm. More needles? I suppose… if you think it’s necessary. But… try to be quick, please. And gentle. I get… faint, sometimes. And… can you explain the results to me? In plain English? I don’t understand all those medical terms. My wife… she always explained things to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll do a blood test, and I understand your concerns about the needles. We’ll take extra care to make sure you’re comfortable. The phlebotomist is very experienced and gentle. We can have you lie down during the blood draw to prevent any dizziness. And absolutely, I will explain the results to you in plain English, no medical jargon. That's my job. We'll go through everything step-by-step. Okay, I’ve ordered the blood tests. Let's get you set up for the EKG now, and then we'll take it from there. The technician is just down the hall. Would you like me to walk you there?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Walk me there. I don’t want to get lost. This place is… confusing. And… thank you. For being patient. My wife… she would have liked you.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's completely understandable to feel a little lost in a new place. And you’re very welcome. Here we are. This is Sarah, she'll be taking care of you. Sarah, this is Kile. He's a new patient and a little anxious about the EKG. Sarah will explain everything to you. I'll be nearby if you need anything. Don't hesitate to let me know.
