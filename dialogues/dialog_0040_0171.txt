DOCTOR: Alright, Lacreasha, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, my nails. They just… look funny. Not good funny. They changed. I don't remember when exactly, just… they're different. I think they're thicker? And kinda… yellow? It's weird.
DOCTOR: Thicker and yellow, you say. Right. And how long have you noticed this change?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Long? A while. Months, maybe? I don’t keep track of things like that. Time just… goes. It's not like I did anything to them. I just… have them. You know? It's probably nothing, but they bother me when I'm gardening. I like to dig in the dirt. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Gardening, hmm?
PATIENT: Well, yeah! I grow tomatoes, mostly. And some peppers. It’s good for the soul, you know? But dirt gets under my nails now. It used to not bother me, but with these… changes… it feels worse. Like they're catching stuff. It's probably just my imagination. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you're experiencing changes to your nails – thickness and yellowing – and you're concerned about potential infection from gardening. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with your nails at all?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Just… annoying. Like, when I try to get the dirt out, it's harder. And they catch on things easier. My sweaters, mostly. I'm always pulling threads. It's a small thing, but it's irritating. It's not like a sharp pain, just… a nuisance. And honestly, they just don’t look nice. I used to have pretty nails.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I just told you about my nails. I don't know… I haven't felt sick or anything. I eat pretty good, I think. I make my own bread. Sometimes. When I have the energy. Is there something else I should be looking for? I’m not good at this doctor stuff. It always feels like I'm missing something.
DOCTOR: Right. No fever, no other skin changes, no pain… Let me just take a look. If you'll just sit here, please. I need to examine them.
PATIENT: Okay. Be gentle, please. I bruise easily. And I really don’t like having my hands touched. It’s just a… thing I have.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there is some thickening and discoloration. And a slight roughness to the texture. It appears to be onychomycosis – a fungal infection of the nail. It’s quite common, honestly.
PATIENT: On-icko-what-sis? A fungus? Oh, goodness. Like… mold? I don't want a fungus. I keep a clean house! How do you get a fungus in your nails? And is it… contagious? Don't tell me I've given it to my tomatoes!
DOCTOR: It's not that kind of mold, alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, good. Because I really need those tomatoes this year. What do I do about it then? Do I have to throw out all my gardening gloves? And what about my bread? Do I need to stop making bread? It’s my hobby! This is just awful. Is it going to spread?
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to spread to your tomatoes. As for treatment, we have a topical antifungal medication. It needs to be applied daily for several months. It's a long process, and you have to be diligent. As long as you're meticulous about hand hygiene, you should be fine. I'll write you a prescription. Don’t delay filling it.
PATIENT: Several months? Every day? Oh, goodness. That sounds… awful. I barely remember to take my vitamins. And meticulous… I try to be, but sometimes things just get away from me. What if I forget? Will it just… get worse? And is it… expensive? I’m on Medicare, you know. It just feels like a lot.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s not a life-threatening condition, alright?
PATIENT: No, I know it’s not. But it's… bothersome. And I like my tomatoes. And I don’t want a fungus. Honestly, sometimes I think I should just leave them alone. Maybe they'll go away on their own. Is that even possible? It just seems like so much effort for something… cosmetic. Is there anything else I can do? Some kind of… home remedy? Before I start slathering stuff on my nails every day for months?
DOCTOR: There are no effective home remedies. Honestly, the best thing you can do is follow the treatment plan. If you don’t, it’s just going to get worse. I’m going to write you the prescription. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… several months, every day… Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I should go fill this prescription then. .
