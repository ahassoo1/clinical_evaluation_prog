DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, I got… somethin' I wanna get done. A little touch-up, you understand. Don't have all day for this, so if we could just… get to it, that’d be nice. It’s about… makin’ myself look presentable. Clearance, that's what the lady on the phone said I needed. For somethin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're here for a clearance. To be clear, is this a medical clearance for employment or another purpose?
PATIENT: Employment? No, no. I ain’t lookin’ for a job. It's… personal. A procedure. A cosmetic thing. I told the lady, I just need a paper sayin’ I'm healthy enough, I guess. Don't rightly remember all the details. It’s for… appearances, doctor. That’s all. Now, can we just get this done? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I see. While I understand you’re wanting to be quick, I do need to gather some information to ensure it’s safe for you to undergo any procedure. Even cosmetic ones require a basic health assessment. It’s standard practice, and it protects your well-being. First, can you tell me a little bit about what kind of procedure you are planning?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, I barely recall. Somethin’ about… my face. Tightenin’ things up, maybe? A little lift, perhaps? The fella at the place… he explained it all, but my memory ain't what it used to be. It’s not a big deal. Just a little tweak. I just need the paper. Is that so hard to understand? I don't need a whole examination, I just need to be cleared.
DOCTOR: Okay. Even with a "small tweak," it’s important to know your overall health. We need to make sure there aren't any underlying conditions that could cause problems during or after the procedure. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Conditions? Doctor, I been workin’ with radio towers my whole life! Climb’n’ up and down, fixin’ things. That’s a healthy life, I tell ya. Never been much for sittin’ still. I wouldn’t have conditions. Maybe a little ache here and there, but that’s just… age. I ain’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I mostly just handle things myself. What exactly do you need to know? This is gettin’ ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand you've been active, Mr. Honcoop, and that's good. However, even active people can develop health issues. It's just part of getting older. And sometimes things develop without us realizing it. Let’s try this: Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Land sakes, no. Never been one for hospitals. Too many germs, you know? And all that waitin’… I’d rather fix it myself, thank you very much. I patched up a few cuts and scrapes over the years, climbed down from a tower once with a twisted ankle… but never needed hospitalizin’. I’m a practical man, doctor. I don’t waste time on unnecessary things. Now, are you gonna give me this clearance or what? This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness no! I don't believe in pumpin’ my body full of chemicals. That's just askin’ for trouble. I eat right, I stay busy, and that's enough for me. Maybe a little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. Vitamins? Supplements? Never. Just… natural livin’, doctor. That’s what I believe in. Are we gettin' anywhere with this, or am I talkin’ to a wall?
DOCTOR: Okay. No medications. And allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I been climbin’ those towers since I was a young man! Pollen, dust, who knows what else! Never had a problem. A little sniffle now and then, but that’s just… the seasons changin’. I ain’t allergic to nothin’ serious. Now, can we please wrap this up? I got a schedule to keep. This is gettin' absurd.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the delay. However, to responsibly provide a clearance for any procedure, I need a little more information. Even seemingly minor procedures can have risks. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, okay?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Now you’re just tryin’ to run up the bill! I came here for a clearance, not a whole check-up! I told you, I’m a healthy man! I don’t need pokin’ and proddin’! This is ridiculous, I’m leavin’. You’re wastin’ my time and my money. Just give me a form sayin' I’m okay and I’ll be on my way. I can’t believe this. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, please sit down. I understand your frustration, but I cannot ethically provide a clearance without a basic assessment of your health. It's not about running up a bill; it’s about ensuring your safety. Given your limited medical history and your insistence on declining an exam, I’m unable to provide you with the clearance you are requesting. I strongly recommend you consult with another physician who can perform a thorough evaluation and determine if you are a suitable candidate for the procedure. Here is the name of a doctor nearby. I wish you the best. .
