DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. Well, frankly, I’m here because my daughter, bless her heart, insisted. She says this… medical marijuana might help with my nerves. Though I must say, I find the whole thing rather… unconventional. I’ve always managed just fine on my own, thank you very much. But she worries so.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of your daughter to look out for you, and it’s perfectly reasonable to have questions about trying something new. So, just to clarify, it sounds like your daughter is suggesting medical marijuana for your nerves… could you tell me a little more about what you mean by your "nerves"?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not a condition, Doctor, if that's what you're thinking. It’s just… a general feeling of being unsettled. Things aren't as they used to be, you understand. The neighborhood… the people… it’s all rather… disruptive. And I find myself worrying about things. Small things, mostly. But it keeps one awake at night, if you follow. Not a proper ailment, just… a sensitivity, I suppose. My husband says I fuss too much, but he doesn't have to live in this world, does he?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ellan. It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of anxiety and worry related to changes in your environment and feeling less secure. That's certainly a valid concern, and it absolutely can affect your sleep and overall well-being. It’s not about whether it’s a “proper ailment,” but about how it’s affecting you. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about when these feelings started?
PATIENT: Well, it wasn't sudden, Doctor. It’s been… gradual. Perhaps a few years now. When the new families started moving in. Different sorts, you see. Not the kind who… maintain things. They leave rubbish about, play their music too loud. It’s just… unsettling. And then the shopkeepers changed. Everything feels… transient. My husband, bless his heart, doesn’t notice. He's always been a bit… oblivious. But I see things. It started with little things, really. A feeling of being… watched. Now it’s… well, a general unease. It’s difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. So, it sounds like these feelings of unease and worry have been developing over the past few years, coinciding with changes in your neighborhood. It's understandable that those changes would be distressing. To get a fuller picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed any physical symptoms along with these feelings of anxiety?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Naturally. One doesn't simply feel anxious without… repercussions. My stomach, for one. It’s terribly upset most mornings. And I find I’m always… fidgeting. Can’t sit still, even to watch my programs. My hands… they tremble sometimes. Not terribly, but enough to be… inconvenient. And the sleep, as I said. I wake up several times a night, thinking about… well, everything. It’s exhausting, frankly. My doctor – the old one, before he retired – gave me something for my stomach, but it only helps a little.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ellan. So, you're experiencing stomach upset, fidgeting, trembling hands, and difficulty sleeping – all of which seem to be linked to your anxiety. It's good you tried something for your stomach, even if it didn’t fully resolve the issue. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your overall health, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, nothing serious. My blood pressure, naturally. It runs a little high. The old doctor put me on a pill for that, years ago. I don’t take it regularly anymore. I watch my salt, you see. And my arthritis, in my hands. It flares up sometimes, especially in the cold. That's why my hands tremble, perhaps. But nothing… significant. I've always been a strong woman. I don’t believe in dwelling on ailments. My husband has the usual… a touch of diabetes, but he manages that with his diet, mostly. He’s a practical man, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you manage high blood pressure with diet, and you have some arthritis in your hands. Your husband has diabetes, which he manages with diet as well. Thank you for sharing that. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always been fortunate in that regard. A broken wrist as a child, a rather silly accident involving a swing set, but that’s it. Nothing requiring hospitalization, thank goodness. I believe in taking care of oneself. Proper diet, regular exercise – well, as regular as one can be at my age. And a strong constitution, naturally. My mother always said I had strong bones. She lived to be ninety-two, you know. A very practical woman, she was. A bit… stern, perhaps, but practical. This medical marijuana… honestly, I still don't see what good it can do. It sounds… frivolous.
DOCTOR: I understand your reservations, Ellan. It's perfectly reasonable to feel skeptical. We can certainly discuss other options if that’s what you prefer. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Well, just the occasional ibuprofen for my arthritis, when it flares up. And sometimes, a sleeping pill, if I’m particularly restless. But not regularly. I try to avoid taking pills, if I can. They always have such… unpleasant side effects. My daughter, bless her heart, keeps trying to get me to take something for my nerves, but I refuse. I’d rather… manage on my own. I don't trust these modern medications. Too many chemicals, if you ask me. Give me a cup of chamomile tea any day. More effective, and much more… civilized.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, occasionally ibuprofen and a sleeping pill when needed, but you prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I appreciate your honesty about that. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've always been fortunate in that regard as well. I eat most things, though I try to avoid overly processed foods. My mother always said to stick to natural ingredients. And I haven’t encountered anything in the garden that bothers me. A few mosquito bites, naturally, but nothing serious. I suppose I'm rather… resilient. This medical marijuana… honestly, I still maintain it seems a rather… drastic solution to a simple case of nerves. I simply don’t understand what my daughter is so worried about. She’s always been a bit… dramatic.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Ellan. It sounds like you've been quite healthy overall, and you prefer a natural approach to managing your well-being. Now, before we discuss potential options, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Certainly not. I find the very idea… appalling. I was raised to believe in proper conduct, you see. My husband and I… we occasionally have a glass of sherry with dinner, on special occasions. But nothing excessive. And I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother would have disowned me. This whole conversation… honestly, it feels a bit… intrusive. I came here because my daughter insisted, but I’m not sure I see the point of all these questions. I simply have a bit of unease, and I manage it as best I can. This medical marijuana… it seems a rather… undignified solution.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ellan, and I apologize if the questions feel intrusive. I assure you, I’m asking these questions to get a complete picture of your health and to determine the best course of action for you. It’s important for me to understand your lifestyle so I can provide the most appropriate advice. Given what you’ve told me, it sounds like you lead a very healthy lifestyle, and you’re experiencing anxiety and sleep disturbance related to changes in your environment. I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It would involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a basic neurological assessment. This will help me rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. But I must say, I find the whole thing rather unnecessary. I assure you, my heart is perfectly sound. And my blood pressure… well, it fluctuates, naturally. But I’m not about to collapse, if that’s what you’re thinking. But if it will appease my daughter… and get you to stop asking questions… then proceed, I suppose. But be gentle, please. I don't tolerate discomfort well. And do hurry. I have my programs to watch.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible, Ellan. And I’ll be as quick as I can. Okay, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… very good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. It’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so. And finally, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Just follow my finger with your eyes… and try to touch your nose with your finger… very good. Your reflexes are normal, and your balance seems stable. Everything seems within normal limits, Ellan, but as I mentioned, your heart rate and blood pressure are slightly elevated. This could be a result of anxiety, but we'll want to monitor them. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Well, naturally, my heart rate is elevated. I've been subjected to a rather intrusive examination! And my blood pressure... I told you it fluctuates. It depends on the weather, you see. And whether I’ve had my tea. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what all this proves. It sounds as though you’re simply confirming what I already knew. I feel a bit… flustered, to be frank. And still, you haven't said a single word about this medical marijuana. Is it going to help, or isn’t it? Because frankly, I’m starting to suspect it’s all a waste of time. And I have my programs to watch, you know.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask, Ellan. I apologize for not addressing the medical marijuana directly sooner. The examination was simply to rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms. Based on what you've told me and the brief examination, it doesn’t seem like there’s a clear medical reason for your anxiety and sleep disturbance besides the environmental changes and your general feeling of unease. Now, regarding medical marijuana, it can be helpful for some people with anxiety and insomnia. However, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it has potential side effects and risks, especially in older adults. Some of those include dizziness, drowsiness, and interactions with other medications. Before we discuss whether it might be right for you, I’d like to talk about other options. Have you considered therapy or counseling to address your anxiety?
PATIENT: Therapy? Counseling? Goodness, no. I’ve always managed perfectly well on my own, thank you very much. I don't need someone to tell me how to feel. I simply have a bit of unease, and I’d like to find a way to manage it without resorting to… drastic measures. Honestly, the whole idea sounds rather… undignified. I simply want a bit of peace and quiet, and a good night’s sleep. Is this medical marijuana going to provide that, or isn't it? Because if it’s going to involve a lot of… emotional navel-gazing, then I’m not interested. My daughter seems to think it’s a miracle cure, but I remain skeptical. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor, and I’ve learned to be… self-sufficient.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ellan. It sounds like you value your independence and prefer to manage things on your own. I respect that. And you're right to be cautious about any treatment that doesn't align with your values. Given your preference for avoiding therapy and your skepticism about medical marijuana, let's focus on other options. We can explore medication for sleep, but as you’ve mentioned, you’re hesitant about those as well. Before we make any decisions, would you be open to trying some simple lifestyle changes?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? Oh, very well. If it will appease you… and my daughter… then I suppose I can try a few things. But honestly, I don’t see how rearranging my schedule or… whatever it is you’re suggesting… is going to make a difference. But proceed, I suppose. I have nothing to lose… except my time, of course. What sort of… changes are you proposing? Hopefully, nothing too strenuous. I'm not about to start running marathons, if that's what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not marathons, Ellan! I was thinking of much simpler things. Things like establishing a regular sleep schedule – going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on weekends. Creating a relaxing bedtime routine – perhaps a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to calming music. And avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed. Also, regular gentle exercise, like a short walk each day, can help reduce anxiety and improve sleep. And practicing relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises, can help calm your mind. We can also discuss dietary changes – focusing on whole, unprocessed foods and staying hydrated. Would you be willing to try incorporating some of these changes into your daily routine?
PATIENT: Hmm. Some of those… sound reasonable. A regular bedtime routine… I suppose I could manage that. I already read before bed, though I prefer a good mystery to… calming music. And avoiding caffeine… well, I don’t drink much of that anyway. But regular exercise? A short walk each day? At my age? Honestly, Doctor. It sounds rather… undignified. I suppose I could try a gentle stroll in the garden, but I’m not about to start hiking up hills. And deep breathing exercises? Goodness, no. I’m not about to start… puffing and panting like a… a yoga instructor. I suppose I can try a few things, but I’m not making any promises. And if it doesn’t make a difference, then I’m not wasting any more time on it. I have my programs to watch, you know. And if none of this works… then what? Will you finally prescribe this medical marijuana? Because frankly, I’m starting to lose patience.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Ellan. We'll start small and see how you feel. And if those simple changes don't provide relief, we can revisit the possibility of medical marijuana. To clarify, before we discuss medical marijuana further, we should rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your sleep problems. I recommend a sleep study to assess your sleep patterns and identify any potential issues, such as sleep apnea. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A sleep study? Oh, goodness, no. I’m not about to spend a night hooked up to machines in a… a laboratory. Honestly, Doctor, the more you suggest, the more ridiculous this becomes. I simply have a bit of unease and difficulty sleeping. It doesn’t require a scientific investigation! I suppose I can try this… rearranging my schedule and… gentle stroll. But if it doesn’t work, I want you to be honest with me. And if this medical marijuana could actually help, then I want a prescription. No more tests, no more studies, no more… puffing and panting. Just a simple prescription to help me sleep. Is that too much to ask? I’m an elderly woman, Doctor, and I’m starting to feel rather… exasperated.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ellan. You deserve straightforward answers and a treatment plan that aligns with your wishes. And you’re right to feel exasperated – it sounds like you’ve been through a lot of questioning already. Given your strong preference against further testing and your desire for a simple solution, I will honor that. We can proceed with trying the lifestyle changes – establishing a regular sleep routine and incorporating gentle activity. However, I need to be upfront: medical marijuana is not without risks, and it may not be the right solution for everyone. I will discuss those risks with you in detail before prescribing it. If the lifestyle changes don't provide relief within a few weeks, we can discuss a trial of medical marijuana, after a thorough discussion of the potential benefits and risks. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Hmm. Very well. That… sounds acceptable. I suppose I can try this… lifestyle arrangement. And if it doesn’t work, then we’ll discuss this… medical marijuana. But I want you to be honest with me about the risks, Doctor. And I want a simple prescription, if possible. No complicated dosages, no elaborate procedures, no… puffing and panting. And if it doesn't work… well, I suppose I'll have to learn to live with my unease. But at least I’ll have tried. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have my programs to watch. And honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel rather… tired.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. You’ve been very patient and clear about your wishes, and I appreciate that. I’ll write down some resources on sleep hygiene and gentle exercise for you to take home. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to see how you’re doing. If you experience any concerning side effects, or if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Thank you for coming in today, and please, get some rest. And enjoy your programs. .
