DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Eaddy. The pleasure is all mine. I requested a general wellness check, a full lab panel, if you will. Just wanted to see how things are holding up, you understand. At my age, one likes to be…proactive. I believe the results are in?
DOCTOR: Proactive is…sensible, certainly. Yes, your initial results are available. However, I find it rather…unusual for a patient to request a “full lab panel” without specific concerns. It feels…excessive. Still. We do have your complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone. Before we delve into the numbers, may I ask about any current symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, well, I suppose it is a bit thorough. My wife, Eloisa, she always says I worry too much. No specific symptoms, Doctor. Nothing I can put my finger on, truly. Just…a general feeling of wanting to be certain everything is in order. Perhaps it is excessive, as you say. I apologize if it’s taken up too much of your time. I simply prefer a complete picture, you see. Is there anything particularly… noteworthy on those panels?
DOCTOR: “Complete picture” is…ambiguous. Very well. Your complete blood count is within normal limits. Metabolic panel is…largely unremarkable, though your creatinine is slightly elevated at 1.3 milligrams per deciliter. Lipid panel is a little high on the LDL cholesterol – 140 milligrams per deciliter. And your TSH is…also within normal range. Elevated creatinine can indicate some degree of kidney dysfunction, and elevated LDL cholesterol is, shall we say, suboptimal. Do you have a history of kidney problems, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Kidney problems? No, Doctor, not to my knowledge. My parents both lived long lives, and I don't recall any such issues in their families either. I’ve always been quite…vigorous, you see. I’ve spent my life working, construction, mostly. Heavy lifting, lots of sun. Perhaps that has something to do with it? The sun, the work… I drink plenty of water, though. Always have. And my cholesterol… is that something to be… concerned about? I eat a fairly balanced diet, though Eloisa does enjoy making arepas… and those are quite rich, I admit.
DOCTOR: “Vigorous” does not preclude physiological changes, Mr. Mombrun. And while I commend your hydration, a history of strenuous activity can contribute to mild kidney stress. As for the cholesterol… it is not an immediate emergency, but it does warrant attention. A reading of 140 milligrams per deciliter is above optimal and increases your risk of cardiovascular events. I would like to repeat the creatinine test to confirm the initial finding, and I recommend discussing dietary modifications to lower your LDL cholesterol. Specifically, reducing saturated fats and increasing fiber intake. Have you ever had a lipid panel checked before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. This is…new territory for me, as you can imagine. I’ve always felt quite healthy, to be honest. I suppose I’ve been…lucky. Dietary modifications… yes, I can certainly try. Eloisa will be pleased; she’s always urging me to eat more vegetables. Reducing saturated fats… that will be the arepas, then. And perhaps the occasional empanada. To be safe, repeating the creatinine test sounds sensible. Are there any particular foods I should avoid entirely, or is it more about moderation? And how often should I have this lipid panel checked, if I do manage to adjust my diet?
DOCTOR: "Luck" is a rather…unscientific term, Mr. Mombrun. For the creatinine, we'll repeat the test in one week. As for dietary modifications, it’s not about entirely avoiding foods, but prioritizing lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit red meat, processed foods, and fried items. The arepas, as you mentioned, are…a contributing factor. Moderation is key, but significant reduction is advisable. As for the lipid panel, if you adhere to dietary changes, we'll re-evaluate in three months. If the levels remain elevated despite your efforts, we may need to consider further investigation, potentially a consultation with a cardiologist. Do you have any family history of cardiovascular disease, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Cardiovascular disease… hmm. My mother’s brother, actually. He had a… a weak heart, they said. Passed away in his sixties. It was sudden. Otherwise, no. My father lived to eighty-eight, quite robust, though he did smoke cigars for a long time. A consultation with a cardiologist… that sounds rather… serious. Perhaps we should focus on the diet first, yes? And this repetition of the creatinine test… is it a simple blood draw? And will the results be available quickly? I have a small construction project I’m overseeing next month, and I prefer to avoid undue stress, if possible.
DOCTOR: "Undue stress" is…subjective, Mr. Mombrun. However, I understand your concerns. Yes, the creatinine test is a standard blood draw, and the results typically take 24-48 hours. Your family history of cardiovascular disease, coupled with your elevated LDL cholesterol, does warrant a cautious approach. We will begin with the dietary modifications and repeat the creatinine test as planned. However, I strongly advise you to be mindful of any symptoms of cardiovascular distress—chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness—and to seek immediate medical attention if they occur. And if the lipid panel remains elevated after three months, a cardiology consultation is…non-negotiable. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not to my knowledge. Eloisa does keep a rather extensive first-aid kit, just in case, but I’ve never needed anything from it. Chest pain, shortness of breath… those do sound unpleasant. I suppose I should be more attentive to my body. I’ve always been quite…focused on the task at hand, you see. Construction work requires a certain… single-mindedness. A cardiology consultation… well, I trust your judgment, Doctor. I simply hope it won’t be necessary. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any particular supplements to avoid, perhaps? Or foods that might interfere with the creatinine test? I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: "Preparedness" is…admirable, Mr. Mombrun. However, excessive concern can be…counterproductive. Regarding supplements, avoid creatine supplementation, as it can artificially elevate creatinine levels. As for foods, avoid a high-protein diet for 24 hours before the test, as that can also influence the results. And it is best to remain well-hydrated. I will schedule the repeat creatinine test for one week from today. The lab technician will provide specific instructions. Do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. None at all. I pride myself on being… quite resilient. A little ache here and there, perhaps, from the work, but nothing that requires intervention. Eloisa does try to give me vitamins, occasionally, but I usually politely decline. I prefer a good night’s sleep and a healthy diet, you see. So, no supplements, no medications… just a little more attention to the diet and a repeat creatinine test. I believe I can manage that. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the test itself? Fasting, perhaps? Or should I avoid strenuous activity beforehand? I don’t want to complicate the results.
DOCTOR: “Complication” is…a strong term, Mr. Mombrun. You do not need to fast for the creatinine test, but I recommend avoiding strenuous activity for 24 hours beforehand. It can temporarily elevate creatinine levels. And please, ensure you are well-hydrated prior to the test. I will provide you with a printed summary of these instructions, as well as the lab order. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe I do. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience with my… concerns. A printed summary would be most helpful, thank you. Perhaps Eloisa can help me monitor my diet. She's quite organized. I suppose that’s all for now. Thank you again for your time, Doctor Eaddy. I look forward to receiving the printed summary.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for review of the results. Please, do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms before your appointment. And I strongly encourage you to adhere to the dietary recommendations. Have a good day, Mr. Mombrun.
