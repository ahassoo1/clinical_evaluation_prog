DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s Melvenia, please. And honestly? Just needin’ some papers signed. Some health forms… for somethin’. It’s a long story, and I’m not real sure what all they need, to be honest with you. Hope you can help. I’d like to get this over with if possible.
DOCTOR: “Some papers signed.” Right. Well, Ms. Tippens, while I am happy to assist, simply signing forms without knowing why they need to be signed isn’t really… good medical practice. It’s my responsibility to understand your health needs before completing any documentation. Can you tell me anything at all about what these forms are for?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes. I knew someone would ask that. It’s… well, my niece, she’s tryin’ to get me some help. I need assistance at home, you see. She said these forms are for… somethin’ about gettin’ funds? From the county, maybe? I don't remember the name of the program, and I’m terrible with paperwork. She just handed me a stack and said, “Get these notarized, Aunt Melvenia.” I really just need a signature, Doctor. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: A stack of forms for county assistance… and no one explained what kind of assistance, or why you need it?
PATIENT: No, not really. She’s a busy woman, that niece of mine. Works two jobs, she does. She figured I could just explain it to whoever needed to know. She said somethin’ about bein’ eligible for help with… daily livin’, I think. Cookin’ and cleanin’ and… well, just helpin’ an old lady out. I'm not complainin', but it's been hard keepin' up lately. I just wish I understood these papers better. Do you need to know why I need help, specifically? It feels a little personal, if you don’t mind me sayin’ so.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, with all due respect, “feels a little personal” isn’t a sufficient answer when it comes to your health. I need to understand what limitations you’re experiencing to accurately complete these forms—and, frankly, to determine if you do require assistance. Are you having trouble with cooking?
PATIENT: Oh, well... yes. A little. My hands aren't what they used to be, you see. Arthritis, mostly. Makes choppin’ vegetables… difficult. And liftin’ heavy pots. I mostly eat soup these days, because it's easier. And toast. Lots of toast. But I used to love cookin’ big family meals. It’s just… harder now. And cleanin' up afterward? Forget about it. They just ache.
DOCTOR: Alright. Arthritis, difficulty with cooking and cleaning due to hand pain. Any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, my knees bother me somethin’ fierce when the weather changes. And my back… well, back pain is just a part of gettin’ old, I reckon. It's not constant, but it flares up if I bend over too much. I try not to bend over much these days. Easier said than done, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so arthritis in the hands, knee pain with weather changes, and occasional back pain. Do you have any difficulty with bathing, dressing, or using the restroom independently?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not those things. I can still manage those myself, thank you. I’m still… independent, I suppose. It's just the physical stuff, the heavy liftin’ and bendin’ and reachin’. That's what gets me. I don't need help with things, I just need someone to do things for me. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm explainin' this all wrong.
DOCTOR: It’s… becoming clearer, Ms. Tippens. So, you’re independent with personal care, but require assistance with household chores due to limitations with bending, lifting, and reaching. Are you experiencing any difficulty with memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Oh, well... sometimes. I forget things now and then. Names, mostly. And where I put my glasses. But nothing serious, I don’t think. Just… old age, again. I wouldn’t say it’s affectin’ my ability to think clearly, though. I know who you are, don’t I? And I remember why I'm here. It's just... little things. It doesn’t bother me too much. Is that enough information? Can we just get these papers signed now?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, while I appreciate your patience, simply signing these forms without a proper assessment isn't responsible medical care. We've established you have limitations with activities of daily living – specifically, household chores – due to arthritis and some age-related memory lapses. Before I can complete this documentation, I need to perform a brief physical examination and a short cognitive assessment. It won't be painful. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick range-of-motion test on your hands and knees. Then, I'll ask you a few simple questions to get a better sense of your cognitive function. This is standard procedure when evaluating someone for assistance programs. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes alive. A whole examination? I just wanted some papers signed! But… I suppose if you have to. I just really don't like bein' poked and prodded. But if it means gettin' this over with… alright. Alright, Doctor, you can poke and prod. Just be gentle, please. And quick, if possible. I have a luncheon date with my niece later.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please take a seat and extend your left arm. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs next. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Anything in particular that’s been botherin’ you regarding breathing?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little breathless sometimes, when I walk up the stairs, but that's just 'cause I’m old. Nothing to worry about, I reckon. It's just… gettin' winded easier. I used to be able to climb those stairs two at a time. Those were the days. Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's check your knees. Can you bend each knee for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… ouch. That’s a little uncomfortable. They creak somethin’ fierce. And feel a little stiff. Not terrible, but… yeah. Like rusty hinges, I suppose. There. How’s that?
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited range of motion in both knees, with crepitus upon flexion. I'm going to check your hands now. Please make a fist for me. Some mild swelling and tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal joints. Now, can you open and close your hands several times?
PATIENT: Oh, that stings a little, too. They’re a little stiff in the mornin', you know. I try to do my exercises, but it’s hard sometimes. The pain just… lingers. They used to be so nimble. I used to play the piano, you know. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Limited range of motion and tenderness in both hands, with reported morning stiffness. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. It's just a quick check, Ms. Tippens. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Let me see… It’s… August… the 2nd? No, wait… Is it the 2nd? I think it’s the 2nd. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I think so. It’s hard to keep track these days. Is that right? I hope I got that right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that's easy. This is... Doctor Versace's office. In… ... in town. A little ways out from the center of town, I think. It's a rural area, my niece told me. She said somethin’ about it bein’ a quiet place. It's a nice office, though. Very clean. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, based on my examination and our conversation, you have limitations with activities of daily living due to arthritis in your hands and knees, and some age-related cognitive decline. I recommend a referral to a physical therapist for evaluation and treatment of your arthritis, and a more comprehensive cognitive assessment to determine the extent of your memory loss. I will also need to discuss with you the possibility of assisted living arrangements to ensure your safety and well-being. I understand this may be difficult to hear, but it's important to address these issues proactively. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… land sakes. Assisted livin'? No! No, I’m not goin' to assisted livin'! I can still manage. I just need a little help with the chores, that's all. I don't need anyone takin' care of me! I… I don't want to leave my home. I've lived there for fifty years! This is… this is awful. I just wanted some papers signed. Is there nothin' else I can do?
DOCTOR: .
