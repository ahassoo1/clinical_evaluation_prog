DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have time for this. But my housekeeper insisted. Sudden deafness in one ear, and my face feels… droopy, on that side. It started yesterday, just woke up like that. Don’t tell me it’s a cold; I haven't got time for a cold.
DOCTOR: Sudden deafness and facial drooping, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. And it's not just a little droop, Doctor. It's noticeable. People are staring. It’s terribly inconvenient. And frankly, I have important meetings. Is this something serious, or can we just… fix it? I need to know if I can still attend them.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Nissenbaum, those are concerning symptoms, and it’s good your housekeeper urged you to come in. Sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness… those things need to be taken seriously. It could be a number of things, and frankly, the faster we rule things out, the better. “Fixing it” depends entirely on what’s causing it. Let’s start with a bit more detail. You said it started yesterday, just waking up like that?
PATIENT: Yes. Woke up, and everything sounded… muffled. Like my ear was stuffed with cotton. Then I looked in the mirror while brushing my teeth, and that side of my face… well, it wasn’t right. No pain, no dizziness, no headache. Just… off. I haven’t fallen or hit my head or anything. It’s simply appeared. Are you going to poke around in my ear now? Because I really don't like that.
DOCTOR: No pain, dizziness, or headache, that’s good. And no trauma. Yes, I will need to take a look in your ear, and I’ll also need to do a quick neurological exam, just to assess the facial weakness. It won’t be pleasant, but it’s necessary to figure out what's going on. It's a relatively quick exam, I promise. Do you have any history of ear infections, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ear infections? Goodness, no. I've always taken excellent care of myself. Ringing… sometimes, very faintly, but who doesn't have a little ringing? It’s probably just the stress of everything. Look, can we please hurry this along? I have a board meeting at two. And please, be gentle with the ear thing. It's very sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concerns about time, but I need to be thorough. We’ll be as quick as possible. First, let’s check your temperature and blood pressure. Then we'll do a quick look in the ears. Just relax and try to stay still. Nurse, can you get Ms. Nissenbaum vitals, please?
PATIENT: Honestly, the fuss. Fine. But if this takes more than fifteen minutes, I'm leaving. And tell your nurse to be careful; I don't want a scratched cornea or anything. Is this a newfangled blood pressure cuff? They used to be so much simpler.
DOCTOR: It's a digital one, Ms. Nissenbaum, a bit more accurate. Blood pressure is 130/80, temperature is normal. Now, if you’ll just lean your head back… Hmm… there’s some mild cerumen buildup, but nothing obviously obstructing the canal. Now, let’s try a few simple tests. Can you tell me if you can hear me when I whisper in your left ear?
PATIENT: Whisper? Really? Is that necessary? It's barely audible anyway. Fine. Go ahead. But don't expect much. My hearing is clearly compromised, as I've already explained. And please, speak up. I haven't got all day to play guessing games.
DOCTOR: Alright. Close your left ear with your finger. Now, can you hear me when I whisper this… “Football.” And now, the right ear?
PATIENT: Right ear? Yes, I can hear you perfectly fine in my right ear. As one would expect. It's the other one that's the problem, remember? Honestly, this is rather tedious. Are you writing all this down? Because it's all quite obvious. You're a doctor, aren’t you? Shouldn't you already know what to look for?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down, Ms. Nissenbaum. And I do know what to look for, which is why I’m asking these questions. Now, I need to perform a quick neurological exam to assess the facial weakness. I’m going to ask you to do a few simple things – close your eyes tightly, raise your eyebrows, smile, puff out your cheeks. Just follow my instructions as best you can. Start with closing your eyes tightly. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. This is humiliating. Fine. There. Happy? It feels… strange. Like I can’t quite control it. And I’m not smiling for a photograph, you know. It’s a board meeting, not a beauty pageant. Can we please get this over with? I have important things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. There is noticeable weakness on the left side of your face. Now, puff out your cheeks. Hmm. Alright. Now, can you try to raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: There! Is that good enough? Honestly, it feels ridiculous. Like I'm making faces at myself in a mirror. This is all very… undignified. And I'm quite certain my housekeeper is enjoying this immensely. Can we talk about what this means now? Or are you going to continue with this charade? I have a meeting to prepare for, you know. Real, important work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. Based on what I’ve observed – the sudden onset of hearing loss, the facial weakness that’s clearly affecting your ability to close your eye, raise your eyebrow, and puff out your cheeks… it’s highly suggestive of Bell’s palsy. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. Given the sudden onset, we should also consider a stroke, although other symptoms aren’t present. We need to order a CT scan of your head to rule out anything more serious. And I will likely refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation. This is not something we can “fix” immediately. Bell’s palsy often resolves on its own, but it can take weeks or months, and sometimes doesn't fully recover. We can start you on a course of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, which can improve your chances of recovery. But we need that CT scan first. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Inflammation? Corticosteroids? Honestly, this is dreadful. So, you're telling me I have… paralysis? And it might not go away? And I need to lie in a machine? This is simply unacceptable. I have a reputation to maintain. Board meetings. Important clients. I do not have time for this. And I am not insured. How much is this CT scan going to cost? Don't tell me it's thousands. I specifically told my housekeeper I didn’t want a prolonged, expensive investigation. This is precisely why I avoid doctors. Can’t you just give me something for the pain? And maybe a muscle relaxant? Honestly, this is a disaster. A complete and utter disaster. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your concerns, and believe me, I wish there was a quick and easy solution. But we need to rule out the possibility of a stroke first, which is why the CT scan is necessary. Ignoring this could have serious consequences. As for cost, I don’t have the exact amount at my fingertips, but I will have my staff research the cost and explore any potential financial assistance options available. We can also discuss alternative imaging options, but they may not be as comprehensive. As for pain, there is currently no pain to manage, and a muscle relaxant won’t address the underlying cause. I understand you’re concerned about your board meeting and your reputation. However, your health is the priority. I strongly recommend we proceed with the CT scan as soon as possible. We will explore all available options to make this as affordable as possible. Do you have any family members or close friends who could assist you with this?
