DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Barban. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is… a check-up, yes? For the… the papers. Before the insurance starts. I do not know much about it, to be honest. They just said I need to come.
DOCTOR: Okay, a physical for insurance purposes. That's perfectly alright. We'll get everything documented for you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… hmm. I work. A lot. It is… food processing. Not… fancy work. I eat, I sleep, I work. Is that what you need to know? I am not sick, if that is what you are asking. Mostly. Sometimes my back hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. You mentioned back pain. How long has your back been hurting?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Years, I think. From the work. Lifting… heavy things. It is not… a big problem. Just… there. Sometimes more than other times. I take… pills. For it. The red ones. I do not remember the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, years of back pain related to lifting at work, and you take red pills for it. Do you know the dosage of those pills?
PATIENT: Dosage? No. I just… take two. When it hurts bad. Maybe two times a day, sometimes. When I have to lift a lot. I do not… measure them. They come in a bottle. The doctor before… he gave them.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the back pain and the pills you're taking for it, are you experiencing any other symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No. I am… tired, always. But that is from work. And… sometimes my stomach feels… not good. But I eat many things. Maybe it is the food. I do not know. It is hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some stomach discomfort. Anything else?
PATIENT: No. I think that is all. I do not go to the doctor often. I do not… like it. Everything always hurts a little. It is normal, yes? From working hard?
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon to have aches and pains with physical work, Mr. Barban. But it's still important to make sure everything is alright. Just to be thorough, let's quickly go through a few things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. My mother always said I have a strong stomach. Never had a problem with… anything. Dust maybe? Sometimes I cough when it is very dusty. But that is not an allergy, yes? Just… dust. It is normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And how about any past medical conditions?
PATIENT: Past… medical? I broke my arm when I was a child. Fell from a tree. But that was a long time ago. They fixed it. It is fine now. Nothing else. I do not get sick easily. A little cold sometimes, but… I just rest.
DOCTOR: Alright, a broken arm as a child, otherwise generally healthy. Do you have any family history of serious medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he had problems with his… breathing. When he was old. And my aunt… she had something with her stomach. But I do not know what it was. They do not talk about such things. It is… bad luck to talk about sickness.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Alcohol… sometimes. With my friends. A little wine, maybe. Or beer. Not much. And… those other things? No. I do not need them. I have work. That is enough.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Diet? I eat. Whatever is available. Rice, bread, meat… sometimes vegetables. My wife… she cooks. I do not pay much attention. It is food. It fills the stomach. Is that what you need to know? I do not eat much junk food, if that is what you are asking. Mostly just… normal food.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Yes, I suppose. Just… make it quick. I have work, you know. It is important. I do not want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll keep it as brief as possible. Please, have a seat on the table here. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your abdomen, reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your stomach. Please lie flat.
PATIENT: Is it going to hurt? It always hurts when people push on my stomach. It is… sensitive. Just be gentle, please. And hurry.
DOCTOR: I'll be as gentle as possible. Just let me know if anything is particularly uncomfortable. Your abdomen is a little tender in the lower right quadrant, but no significant masses or guarding. Blood pressure is 130/80. Reflexes are normal. Now, let's take your temperature and pulse. Temperature is 98.6, pulse is 78. Everything seems within normal limits, though your abdomen is a bit sensitive. Do you experience pain in this area often?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes. It comes and goes. When I eat too much… or when I lift something heavy. It is just… a dull ache. Nothing serious, I think. I just ignore it. My wife says I worry too much. Is that all? Can I go now? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Almost finished. Given your history of intermittent abdominal pain, particularly related to eating and lifting, and the tenderness I found on examination, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel . These will help rule out any underlying issues. I also recommend following up with a gastroenterologist to investigate the abdominal pain further. It's important to get it properly assessed. Would you like me to write a referral for you?
PATIENT: A… what? A CBC? A BMP? More tests? And see another doctor? No. No, thank you. I do not want more tests. I just need the papers for the insurance. That is all. I do not have time for all of this. And I do not want to see another doctor. Can I just get the papers, please? I really must be going. I have work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your concerns about time and seeing another doctor. However, based on what you've told me and my examination, it's important to rule out any potential issues with your abdomen. Ignoring the pain could lead to complications down the line. I can complete the physical for your insurance, and I will document my findings. However, I strongly recommend that you reconsider the referral. I can provide you with a list of excellent gastroenterologists in the area. At the very least, could we agree to a follow-up appointment in one month to see if the pain has resolved?
PATIENT: One month… Fine. One month. But no other tests. And no seeing another doctor. Just… check me again. That is all. I do not want any trouble. And I need the papers for the insurance. Now. Can we be done now? I have lost valuable time already.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. I’ve documented my findings, including the tenderness in your abdomen and your desire to monitor the pain without further investigation at this time. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one month. I’m completing the necessary forms for your insurance. It will take a few minutes. Here are the completed forms. Please review them to ensure all information is correct. Mr. Barban, please remember, if the pain worsens or you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, you should seek medical attention immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That is all. Thank you… I think. I must go now. I have work. And… thank you for not making me see another doctor.
DOCTOR: .
