DOCTOR: Hi Tarin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Roseburroough. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… persistent enough that I thought it best to get it checked out. It’s primarily in my left leg, though sometimes it feels a little… distant in my right as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in the leg. And it's mostly on the left, but you've noticed it a bit in the right too. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began approximately three weeks ago, around the 10th of July, I believe. It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual onset. At first, I just attributed it to sitting for long periods while working, but it hasn't really improved with changes in posture or taking breaks.
DOCTOR: Right, gradual onset around July 10th. And it hasn’t gotten better with posture changes or breaks. Can you describe the numbness for me?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to explain precisely. It isn’t a complete loss of feeling, more like a… diminished sensation. Like when your foot “falls asleep,” but not as intense or focused. It's a sort of… dullness, and occasionally a tingling, but not consistently. It’s most noticeable when I’m standing for extended times, or after physical activity.
DOCTOR: Okay, diminished sensation, a dullness with occasional tingling, worse with standing and activity. Does anything relieve the numbness, or make it feel better at all?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Sitting down usually provides some relief, as does elevating my leg. Applying a warm compress also seems to help, though it's temporary. Honestly, nothing provides complete relief, it just… lessens the sensation for a time. And lying down flat doesn't seem to make much difference at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting, elevation and warmth provide some temporary relief. Any recent injuries to your leg or back?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I haven’t experienced any significant trauma or accidents recently. I was helping a friend move some furniture about a month ago, the 28th of June, but it was nothing overly strenuous. I didn’t notice any injury at the time, and there was no immediate pain or discomfort. It’s been a clean bill of health, so to speak, regarding any sort of physical impact.
DOCTOR: Good. No recent injuries. And just to be thorough, any weakness in your leg at all?
PATIENT: No noticeable weakness, no. I haven’t had any trouble with walking, running, or climbing stairs. I work with animation software quite a bit, which involves precise hand-eye coordination and steady movements, and that hasn’t been affected either. I’ve consciously tried to test my strength and balance, and everything feels… normal. Though, I admit, perhaps I haven’t pushed it too hard, wanting to avoid exacerbating the issue.
DOCTOR: Alright, no weakness. Good to hear. Now, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any pain in your back, hips, or buttocks, alongside this numbness?
PATIENT: That's a pertinent question. Actually, yes. I have been experiencing a mild ache in my lower back, on the left side, for about the same period as the numbness. It's not sharp or debilitating, more like a constant, dull pressure. It isn't always present, and it tends to fluctuate in intensity, corresponding somewhat with the level of discomfort in my leg. And, occasionally, a similar ache will manifest in my left hip.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild lower back ache on the left, fluctuating with the leg discomfort, and sometimes in the hip. Have you had any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no changes there at all. Everything is… regular, if you’ll excuse the bluntness. No issues with control, frequency, or consistency. It’s been a relief that at least something hasn’t been affected. I've been… mindful of such things, given the nature of the other symptoms.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No bowel or bladder changes. Let's quickly go over your medical history. Any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No major conditions, Dr. Roseburroough. I've always been fairly healthy. I had a bout of influenza a few years ago, in 2021, but nothing required hospitalization. I’ve had all my standard vaccinations, and I visit the dentist regularly. No surgeries, no chronic illnesses, no significant allergies—just a mild seasonal allergy to birch pollen in the spring, which I manage with over-the-counter antihistamines.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history. Just the seasonal allergies. Do you take any other medications regularly, even over-the-counter things besides the antihistamines?
PATIENT: Just the antihistamines during birch pollen season, which concluded about a month ago, the 20th of June. And occasionally, ibuprofen for headaches, but rarely—maybe once or twice a month, and usually for tension headaches related to work. I generally try to avoid medications whenever possible, preferring natural remedies or simply resting when I feel unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s move on to family history. Any history of back problems, nerve issues, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My maternal grandmother, on my mother’s side, suffered from sciatica for many years. She required regular physical therapy and, eventually, a corticosteroid injection to manage the pain. And my father’s brother has type 2 diabetes, diagnosed approximately ten years ago. Beyond that, no other significant history of nerve problems or back issues that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sciatica in your grandmother, diabetes in your uncle. Let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Roseburroough. I do not smoke. I occasionally consume alcohol—a glass of wine with dinner perhaps once or twice a week—but I wouldn’t consider myself a regular drinker. And I do not use any recreational drugs whatsoever. I maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle, prioritizing a balanced diet and regular exercise whenever my work schedule allows.
DOCTOR: Okay. No smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, no drugs. Do you do any repetitive movements at work, or spend long periods in one position?
PATIENT: That is… a very insightful question. Yes, as I mentioned earlier, I work with animation software. This involves spending long hours seated at a computer, and requires a significant amount of repetitive hand and wrist movements with a stylus and graphics tablet. I do try to take breaks regularly to stretch and walk around, but it’s undeniable that I spend a considerable portion of my day in a static position, performing the same motions repeatedly. It's quite possible this is contributing to the discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright, long periods of static position with repetitive movements at work. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Certainly. Please let me know if there’s anything specific I should do or any particular way I should position myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to feel along your spine here. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that’s a little tender. Just there, on the left side. It's not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, similar to the one I've been experiencing. The rest feels… generally normal, though it’s a bit sensitive overall.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now I'm going to have you bend forward, backward, and side to side. Let me know if any of these movements cause pain.
PATIENT: Bending forward is… uncomfortable, though manageable. It exacerbates the ache in my lower back, but it’s not debilitating. Bending backward feels relatively normal, with only mild discomfort. Bending to the left is particularly difficult; it causes a sharp twinge in my lower back and a slight radiating discomfort down my left leg. Bending to the right feels… better, though still not entirely comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, bending forward and left is difficult. Now, let's check your reflexes and sensation. This will just involve a quick touch with this little hammer, and then I'll lightly touch your leg and foot. Please tell me if you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. The reflexes feel… normal, I believe. And yes, I can feel the touch on my leg and foot. There's a slight… diminished sensation in the outer part of my left foot, though. It feels a bit… distant, compared to my right foot. It's subtle, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Diminished sensation on the outer left foot. Now I’m going to lift your leg up, keeping it straight. Let me know if this causes any pain down your leg.
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That… that’s quite painful. A sharp shooting pain down my left leg, almost like an electric shock. It's most intense in my calf and foot. Please stop.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, we’ll stop there. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings—tenderness in your lower back, diminished sensation in your outer left foot, and the pain radiating down your leg with the straight leg raise—it’s highly suggestive of Sciatica, likely due to a compression of the sciatic nerve. It's likely being irritated or compressed by something in your lower back. I'd like to order an MRI of your lower back to confirm this and rule out any other causes. Do you have any known contraindications to MRI, like metal implants?
PATIENT: That explains a great deal, actually. It's… reassuring to have a potential explanation, though concerning, of course. No, I have no known contraindications to MRI. I do not have any metal implants, and I have never had any reason to believe I would have an issue with magnetic fields. An MRI sounds… prudent, to confirm the diagnosis. What sort of timeline are we looking at for scheduling that?
DOCTOR: Good. No contraindications to MRI. We can get that scheduled through the clinic's imaging center. I'll have my assistant contact you with available dates—likely within the next week. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with over-the-counter pain relievers—ibuprofen or naproxen—and applying heat to your lower back. Avoid heavy lifting, prolonged sitting, and activities that exacerbate your pain. I’m also going to prescribe a short course of muscle relaxants to help alleviate some of the muscle spasms. We’ll review the MRI results together once they're available and discuss further treatment options—which may include physical therapy, or potentially injections if the pain persists. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds entirely acceptable, Dr. Roseburroough. I appreciate the thoroughness and the clear explanation of the next steps. Continuing with the pain relievers and heat is manageable, and I will certainly avoid exacerbating activities. A short course of muscle relaxants sounds beneficial, given the discomfort. I look forward to hearing from your assistant regarding the MRI scheduling and discussing the results with you further. Thank you for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have my assistant get that all set up for you. She’ll also provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the MRI. I'm glad I could help, Tarin. If your pain becomes unbearable, or you experience any weakness or bowel or bladder changes, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I believe you've covered everything quite comprehensively, Dr. Roseburroough. I’m grateful for your attention and guidance. I understand the precautions regarding increased pain or changes in bodily function, and I will heed that advice. Thank you again for your time.
