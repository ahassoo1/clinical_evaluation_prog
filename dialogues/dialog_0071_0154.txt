DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Claudene. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s… something with my waterworks, I suppose. It keeps… bothering me. It's happened a few times now, and it’s not very pleasant, you understand. I don't really… remember exactly when it started, but it's been a while.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” alright. So, you're experiencing some issues with urination. Can you tell me a little more about what's bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It… it just hurts when I go. A burning sensation, mostly. And I have to go very often, even when I haven’t had much to drink. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least. I don’t recall anything specific causing it, though. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Burning with urination and frequent trips to the bathroom… alright. It’s not uncommon to have those symptoms, Claudene, but we need to figure out why it’s happening. You said you don’t recall anything specific triggering it… has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… changed? Let me think. Oh, well, I did go on a little trip last month. To… to the coast, I think. Yes, the coast. Stayed in a small hotel. But that was weeks ago. And I don’t… I don't remember anything unusual happening at the hotel, specifically. I just wanted to get away for a bit. Is that helpful? I’m terribly sorry I can’t be more precise. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A trip to the coast… okay. It’s alright, don’t worry about being precise. We'll get there. Just trying to gather information. Now, besides the burning and frequency, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… oh! Sometimes, just a little bit of… discomfort. Down there, you know. Not a sharp pain, just… achy. And I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, but I just assumed it was the heat. Is that… is that something to do with it? I really don’t want to be a bother, Doctor. I just want this to go away.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not a bother at all, Claudene. We’re just trying to piece things together. Achiness and tiredness… alright. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. No, no blood. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. And no fever, or chills. I haven’t felt particularly warm, or cold. Just… tired. And a bit… uncomfortable. I do drink a lot of water, you know. Always have. I don't want to be here long, Doctor. I have a repair job waiting for me. A motorhome needs a new… thingamajig. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Alright, no blood, no fever. And you drink plenty of water, good. Now, Claudene, before we proceed, let me just ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… That was a long time ago. I… I think I had something with my blood pressure once, years ago. But it wasn’t serious, the doctor said. And no, I don’t have… what was it? Diabetes? No, I don't think so. I'm not a sweets person, you see. I really can't remember much about it, honestly. I've not been to a doctor in ages. Is it important? I just want to get this sorted and get back to work. This motorhome… it's a big job.
DOCTOR: Alright, Claudene. Previous blood pressure issue, but nothing current that you recall. We’ll proceed carefully. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And I’ve never been in the hospital, thankfully. Not ever. I’m a fairly healthy person, you see. I work hard, I eat reasonably well, and I drink plenty of water. Oh dear, is it alright if we hurry just a little? I promised the owner I'd call with an update. He's relying on me. It’s… a complicated repair.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries, no hospitalizations. We'll try to be quick. Now, one last thing, Claudene. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I… I don't think so. I haven’t taken much medication in my life, truthfully. Perhaps a pain reliever for a headache now and then, but nothing serious. I don't recall ever having a reaction to anything. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know what’s causing this and how to make it stop. This is very frustrating. And the motorhome… the owner is getting anxious. Is it alright if we just… get to the bottom of it? .
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Claudene. Based on what you've told me—the burning sensation, frequent urination, achiness, and the recent trip—it sounds like you might have a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, to be certain, I'd like to do a quick urine test right here in the office. Would that be alright?
