DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Or... is it Erle?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, Erle is fine. Though I prefer to be addressed with a bit more… respect, Doctor. And please, let’s not dawdle. I have a great deal to do today. This… stress, as you call it, is simply interfering with my schedule.
DOCTOR: Of course, Erle. My apologies. And I understand you're busy. So, let's get right to it. You mentioned stress… can you tell me a bit more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Going on? Really. What hasn't been going on? The standards at the college these days… appalling. Students who can barely string a sentence together, expecting a degree. And the administration… utterly clueless. It’s a constant battle to maintain… some semblance of order. Though, frankly, it’s a losing one. I suppose that is what’s brought me here. Though I doubt you can fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand it sounds… frustrating, Erle. It's good you came in. Even if I can't directly solve the issues at the college, we can explore how this stress is affecting you. Are you having trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleeping? Well, it isn’t… restful. I wake frequently, thinking about… papers, I suppose. And the constant noise! These youngsters and their… music. Though, to be frank, I’ve never been one for… lying about things. So, yes, I wake up. But it isn’t something I dwell on. A minor inconvenience, really. Do we have to go through all of this? It feels rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Trouble sleeping can contribute to a lot of other things, even if it feels minor. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, dear. Where do I begin? A general… weariness. A lack of… enthusiasm. And my appetite. It’s… diminished. Though I assure you, Doctor, I’m not one to complain about a few skipped meals. A little discipline never hurt anyone. Is this going anywhere? I had a perfectly good bibliography to revise this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, weariness, lack of enthusiasm, and a decreased appetite. Those can certainly be connected. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? I haven’t concerned myself with such trivial matters. I am a scholar, not a… a dietician. Though, if you must know, my tailor did remark that my trousers felt… a little looser. But that is likely due to… the cut of the fabric. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see the relevance. Are we simply cataloging my personal attributes now? It’s a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: It's helpful information, Erle. A change in weight, even if you haven't consciously noticed it, can sometimes point to underlying issues. And it's not about cataloging attributes, but about getting a complete picture. Have you experienced any dizziness or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Shortness of breath? Doctor, are you implying something? I walk to work every day! A brisk pace, I assure you. I may be 87, but I am not… infirm. Though, now that you mention it, I did feel a little… lightheaded on the stairs yesterday. But that was likely due to… the humidity. Honestly, the questions are becoming increasingly… impertinent. I think I’ve had enough of this. Perhaps I should just… leave.
DOCTOR: Just one moment, Erle. I apologize if my questions feel impertinent. I'm just trying to rule things out. Lightheadedness can be caused by many things, and it’s important to investigate. Perhaps we should do a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? At my age? Doctor, with all due respect, I think I’ve wasted enough of my time here. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of assessing my own physical state. I am a scholar, remember? Logic and reason are my tools, not… prodding and poking. No, thank you. I think I shall take my leave. This… experience has been most unsatisfactory. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Erle. I understand. Before you go, would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure and pulse?
