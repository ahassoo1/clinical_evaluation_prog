DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi. Good to meet you too, Doctor... Overgaard, right? I been feelin'… funny. Like my heart, it sometimes goes too fast, then normal, then fast again. It's not pain, just… flutters. Like a bird in my chest, maybe? It’s been happenin’ for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Overgaard, yes. And “funny” how?
PATIENT: Um... hard to say. Not ha-ha funny. Just… not right. Like when you run, you know? Heart goes fast. But I'm just sittin'. Or lyin' down. It does it then. Sometimes it lasts a few seconds, sometimes longer. Not always, but enough to worry me. My wife, she tell me to come see you. She get scared.
DOCTOR: Right, your wife is wise to suggest you come in. It's good you're getting this checked out. So, a few weeks now… has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I work with… machines. Big machines that make stuff. Chemicals and things. It's not more busy now than usual. I eat normal, sleep normal… maybe a little less sleep because I worry about it. But no, nothing special happenin' when it starts. Just… happens. It’s random, I think.
DOCTOR: Random occurrences are rarely truly random, Mr. Puder. We just haven't identified the pattern yet. Let's go through a bit more detail. When this happens—when your heart feels like it's fluttering—are you feeling any other symptoms at the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Sometimes I get a little… dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… light-headed. And maybe a little short of breath. Like I can't get a good deep breath. But those don’t always happen. Sometimes just the flutters. It's hard to say what comes with what, to be honest. It all feels mixed up. My wife says I look pale sometimes when it happens, but I don't notice.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pale, lightheadedness, shortness of breath... those are all things we need to consider. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I been pretty healthy, I think. I get checkups sometimes at work, they make us. But always okay. No high blood pressure, no sugar problems… nothing. I don’t take any pills, never had surgery… just little cuts and scrapes from work sometimes. Nothing big. My father… he had problems with his legs when he got old, but not heart. My mother… she was okay too, I think.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um… not really. I get a little sniffly sometimes with dust, but that’s all. Nothing serious. No bee stings, no food allergies, no… anything like that. My wife is the one with allergies. She gets bad with the pollen in the spring, always sneezin'. But me? No.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse. And perhaps take your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I want to know what’s wrong. My wife will be happy to hear you are lookin' at it properly. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Try to relax and breathe normally. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, even at rest—approximately 98 beats per minute. I'm hearing no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/85, which is a little high, but not critically so. Pulse is regular but somewhat strong. I'm going to feel your pulse again, and check your extremities for any signs of poor circulation.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I'm tryin' to relax. It's hard when I think about my heart beatin' fast. 98… is that bad? I don’t know what normal is. I do work with chemicals, sometimes my hands get cold, but it’s from the work. Not always, but sometimes. I hope everything is okay. My wife… she worries a lot.
DOCTOR: 98 is slightly elevated, Mr. Puder, but not alarming in and of itself. It can fluctuate due to stress or exertion. Your extremities feel cool to the touch, which, as you said, is likely related to your work environment. I'm not detecting any significant abnormalities in circulation. However, given your symptoms of palpitations, lightheadedness, and a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure, I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Namely, an EKG, to assess the electrical activity of your heart, and a basic blood panel to check your electrolyte levels and thyroid function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests sound… good. I want to know what’s wrong, so yes, please. EKG… that’s the one with the stickers, right? My friend had that done. Stickers and wires. I can do that. Blood panel too. Whatever you need. I just want to get back to normal, you know? And my wife will be relieved. Can I still go to work while I’m waiting for the results? I need the money.
DOCTOR: Yes, an EKG involves stickers and wires. It's a quick and painless procedure. And yes, you can continue to go to work while waiting for the results, unless you experience any worsening of your symptoms—severe palpitations, chest pain, significant shortness of breath, or fainting. If any of those occur, you should stop working immediately and go to the nearest emergency room. I'll have the lab draw the blood panel now. It’s just routine, looking for imbalances that could be contributing to your symptoms. Here is a referral to the lab. They're just down the hall. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay. No severe symptoms… I’ll remember that. I think I can handle the work, I just need to be careful. No, I don’t think I have questions right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For lookin' at it. My wife will be happy to know you're helpin'. I’ll go do the blood and the stickers now. Where is the lab exactly?
DOCTOR: It's just two doors down on your left. The receptionist will take care of everything. And you’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. I’m glad we’re getting this investigated. If you have any questions at all—even after the tests—don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Get that done, and we'll see what the results say. Don’t worry too much until we have more information.
PATIENT: Okay. I will. Thank you again, Doctor Overgaard.
