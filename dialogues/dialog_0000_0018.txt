DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Verbos, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Westly Verbos. Though, honestly, time… it does seem to slip away, doesn't it? I believe that is the name I go by, yes.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We have your information here. Now, let's get down to business. You’re 56, Czech… and a little light for your height, if I may say so. But that’s neither here nor there. What brings you into my office today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s rather… embarrassing, actually. I seem to be going to the bathroom quite a bit. More than usual, you understand. It’s… a lot of urination. I believe that’s the polite way to put it. It’s been happening for… well, I’m not entirely sure when it started. Time, you see…
DOCTOR: “Quite a bit,” you say. That’s… helpful. “More than usual” is subjective, Mr. Verbos. Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… goodness. That’s difficult. Let me think. Before… well, I don't know when exactly, but recently… I used to go, perhaps… four times a day? Normal, I thought. Now? Easily… eight. Maybe more. Perhaps even ten. It's difficult to keep track, honestly. At night, too. I wake up to go… usually once, sometimes twice. It’s rather disruptive.
DOCTOR: Eight to ten times a day… and nocturia, waking up one or two times at night. Is it a full bladder each time, or just a little dribbling?
PATIENT: Full bladder… mostly. Not a dribble, no. A proper emptying, each time. Though, sometimes… sometimes it feels like I just went, and then I need to go again shortly after. Not always, mind you. But… frequently enough that I noticed. It's unsettling.
DOCTOR: So, frequent urination, both day and night, complete emptying most of the time, but with a sensation of incomplete emptying occasionally… any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. And no burning. It's… just the volume, and the frequency. No discomfort at all, thankfully. It's rather odd, isn't it? To have such a… a nuisance without any accompanying pain.
DOCTOR: Odd, perhaps. But not unheard of. Alright. Have you noticed any change in the stream itself?
PATIENT: Change in the stream…? I’m not sure I follow, doctor. What do you mean by “stream”? Is that… the flow of… you know? I apologize, I’m not very good with medical terms, you see.
DOCTOR: The force of the flow, Mr. Verbos. Is it weak, strong, interrupted?
PATIENT: Oh! The… the pressure! Yes. Hmm. It's… normal, I suppose. Not weak. Not strong. Just… usual. No interruption, no straining. A steady flow, each time. Though… now that you mention it, sometimes it feels like it takes a moment to start, if I haven’t gone for a little while. But that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or back pain?
PATIENT: No, doctor. None of those. No fever, chills, nausea, no vomiting, and my back feels quite alright, thank you. It's truly just the… the frequent bathroom trips. I must confess, it's a bit disruptive to my… well, everything.
DOCTOR: Do you have any family history of diabetes, or any prostate issues?
PATIENT: Diabetes… My mother, I believe… she had something. A bit of weakness, needing to watch her sugar intake. Was that diabetes? It was quite some time ago. As for prostate issues… I am a male, of course, but I don’t recall any such history in my family, no. Perhaps my father… but my memory… it’s not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I need to check your abdomen, and I'm going to do a digital rectal exam. It’s standard procedure. If you would please… disrobe from the waist down and lie on your side. It's necessary to rule out any obvious issues. And it won't take long.
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Oh dear. Is that… absolutely necessary, doctor? It sounds… rather intrusive. I mean, I understand you're the professional, and I trust your judgement, of course, but… are there no other alternatives? Perhaps a… a urine sample would suffice?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, with all due respect, a urine sample will tell me if there's an infection. It won’t tell me about the size and shape of your prostate, or if there are any abnormalities. You’re 56. Prostatic enlargement is a common cause of these symptoms. It's a simple exam, and it's the best way to get a proper assessment. Unless you’d prefer I just guess what’s going on?
PATIENT: No, no, you’re quite right, doctor. I apologize for my… reluctance. It’s just… a bit unnerving, that’s all. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise, of course. Just… perhaps be gentle?
DOCTOR: Very well. Lie on your left side, knees bent. And try to relax. Hm. Your prostate is slightly enlarged, but not acutely tender. It feels fairly symmetrical. I’d like to order a PSA blood test and a urinalysis. The PSA will give us a more precise idea of your prostate size and help rule out prostate cancer. The urinalysis will check for infection. We will also check your blood sugar.
