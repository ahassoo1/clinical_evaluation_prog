DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… well, persistent enough that I thought it best to get it checked out. It started a few weeks ago, I believe around July 15th, and hasn’t really gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 15th. That’s helpful. Can you describe the numbness for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s primarily in my left leg, Doctor. It’s not a complete loss of feeling, more like… a tingling, almost like when your foot falls asleep, but it doesn't quite go away entirely. And sometimes it feels a bit… cold, even when the room is warm. It’s most noticeable when I’m standing for extended periods, or after I’ve been walking quite a bit. It doesn't really hurt, just… uncomfortable and unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, tingling and cold sensation in the left leg, worse with standing and walking, and starting around July 15th. Does it radiate anywhere else – does it go up into your hip, or down into your foot?
PATIENT: It does seem to travel a bit, Doctor. It’s not constant, but I’ve noticed it occasionally in my lower back, on the left side, and sometimes a slight tingling in my foot, primarily in the toes. The back discomfort is fleeting, though – it comes and goes. The foot sensation is more frequent, but not severe. It's... difficult to pinpoint exactly, as it shifts around.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's radiating from the leg up into the lower back and down into the foot, intermittent in the back, more consistent in the foot. Have you noticed anything that improves it – sitting, lying down, any particular positions?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Lying down definitely helps, Doctor. Especially if I can elevate my leg a bit. And sitting seems to alleviate it too, though prolonged sitting isn't ideal for other reasons, of course. There's also this one position, if I bend my knee a certain way while sitting, it feels… better. It’s hard to describe. It's like relieving pressure, if that makes sense. I discovered it quite by accident, really.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information – relieving pressure with a specific knee bend. Let's get a little bit of your medical history. Have you had any prior injuries to your back or legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, to my knowledge, I haven’t. I was fairly active growing up – some hiking and fishing, typical Alaskan things – but no major falls or injuries. I did have a mild sprain in my ankle about five years ago, playing basketball, but it healed completely and didn’t cause any lasting issues. Otherwise, I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully. I haven’t had any surgeries or broken bones.
DOCTOR: Good. No prior significant injuries or surgeries. Do you have any medical conditions currently—diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As far as I know, I don’t. I’ve had annual check-ups and haven’t been diagnosed with anything. My blood pressure is usually quite good, according to my general practitioner, and I don’t have any family history of diabetes or arthritis. I did have a bout of the flu last winter, but that resolved on its own with rest and fluids. I have private insurance, so I’m fairly diligent about getting regular check-ups, as a preventative measure.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any regular medications. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, if needed, but that’s infrequent – maybe once or twice a year. I do take a multivitamin every now and then, just to be safe, but it’s not a consistent habit. Nothing prescribed, and nothing I take daily. I try to maintain a healthy diet and get enough sleep, so I haven’t felt the need for anything more than that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As far as I’m aware, I don’t have any allergies. I’ve eaten a fairly wide variety of foods throughout my life without issue, and I’ve never had any adverse reactions to medications when I’ve needed them. I've occasionally been bitten by mosquitoes, naturally, living in Alaska, but that’s just standard irritation. Nothing serious or life-threatening.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies or significant medical history. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. I occasionally have a beer with friends, maybe once or twice a month, but I wouldn't consider myself a drinker. And I do not use any recreational drugs. I work as a special effects artist and animator, so I need to keep a clear head for my work. It requires a lot of focus and precision, and those sorts of things would certainly impede that. I'm fairly health-conscious, overall.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Finally, do you have any family history of neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis, neuropathy, or any other conditions that affect the nerves?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. To my knowledge, no. My mother’s side of the family has a history of hypertension, but nothing neurological. My father’s side is… mostly fishermen, honestly. A lot of wear and tear on their bodies, arthritis mostly, but no MS or neuropathy that I’m aware of. I can ask my mother if she remembers anything specifically, if you’d like, but I don't believe there's anything relevant. They’re… not always the most forthcoming with details, if you understand me. It's a very practical family.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant neurological family history. Alright, Tarin, that gives me a good starting point. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed. I’m happy to cooperate in any way that will help determine the cause of this numbness. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and examine me thoroughly.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Please have a seat here. I’m going to start by checking your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Okay, reflexes are… 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m trying to be as firm as possible without straining. Is that sufficient? I work with my hands a lot, so I’d like to think I have decent strength.
DOCTOR: That’s good, good strength in both hands. Now, I'm going to check your leg strength. Can you lift each leg while lying flat, against my resistance?
PATIENT: I'm lifting each leg as high as I comfortably can, resisting your pressure. Please let me know if there's anything specific you want me to do, or if I should adjust my technique in any way. I am trying to keep my core engaged and maintain a controlled movement.
DOCTOR: Leg strength is 5/5 in both legs, good. Now, let's assess your sensation. I'm going to lightly touch different parts of your legs and feet with this cotton ball. Just tell me when you feel it. Can you tell me when you feel this on the top of your foot?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. Right there. It feels… normal, like a light touch. Is that what you were expecting? I'm trying to be as precise as possible with my response. It’s a little difficult to describe the sensation accurately, but I can feel it distinctly.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensation is slightly decreased on the outer aspect of your left foot compared to your right. It’s not a dramatic difference, but noticeable. And finally, I'm going to palpate your lower back. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. There's a slight discomfort, a dull ache, right about… here. It’s not sharp pain, just a general soreness. It's been intermittent, as I mentioned earlier, but it's definitely present now when you press there. I hadn't consciously focused on it before, but I can feel it distinctly with your pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to palpation in the left lower back. Alright, Tarin. Based on the exam and your history, it sounds like we're dealing with possible radiculopathy – irritation of a nerve root in your lower back. The decreased sensation and tenderness in your lower back support that. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will allow us to visualize the nerves and rule out any structural issues like a herniated disc. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI sounds reasonable, Doctor. If it will help determine the cause of this discomfort and allow for a proper diagnosis, then yes, I am happy to proceed with that. I trust your judgment. Do you have any recommendations for how long I should wait to schedule it, or any particular facilities you prefer? I have private insurance, so I assume coverage shouldn't be an issue, but I can double-check with them if needed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm going to write a referral for an MRI at Coastal Imaging, they have a good reputation and quick turnaround times. As long as you schedule it within the next week or two, that would be ideal. Your insurance should cover it, but it's always a good idea to confirm with them beforehand. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication, like ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the label, to help manage the inflammation. Also, avoid any activities that exacerbate your symptoms – heavy lifting, prolonged standing, bending or twisting. Gentle stretching and light walking are okay, but listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That all sounds very sensible, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don’t believe I have any immediate questions regarding the medication or activity recommendations. Ibuprofen is something I’ve used occasionally in the past for headaches, so I'm familiar with its effects. I will certainly schedule the MRI within the next week or two, and I will confirm coverage with my insurance provider beforehand, just to be certain. Do you have any thoughts on potential causes for this radiculopathy? Is this something that's likely to resolve on its own, or should I be prepared for more involved treatment if the MRI reveals an issue? I understand this is speculative without the results, but any general guidance would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question. Radiculopathy can have several causes. A herniated disc is a common culprit, as is spinal stenosis – narrowing of the spinal canal. Sometimes it's just a result of muscle strain or postural imbalances. Many cases of radiculopathy do resolve on their own with conservative treatment – rest, anti-inflammatories, physical therapy. However, if the MRI reveals a significant structural issue, we may need to consider other options, such as physical therapy, injections, or, in rare cases, surgery. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Let's see what the MRI shows first. I'll also give you a referral for physical therapy, just to have it in place, should you need it. If the pain worsens significantly, or if you experience any new symptoms – weakness, numbness in your groin or saddle area, loss of bowel or bladder control – please go to the emergency room immediately. Those are signs of a more serious condition that requires immediate attention. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. I will schedule the MRI promptly, and I will start taking ibuprofen as directed. I will also be mindful of activities that exacerbate my symptoms. I appreciate the referral for physical therapy, and I will keep that in mind for when I have the MRI results. And thank you for outlining the warning signs – weakness, numbness in the groin, and loss of bowel or bladder control. I will be vigilant and seek immediate medical attention if I experience any of those. I believe that covers everything for now. Thank you for your thorough examination and helpful explanations. I feel much better informed and prepared to move forward.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help. I'll send the referrals electronically to your primary care physician and the imaging center. If you have any questions or concerns before your MRI, don't hesitate to call the office. I'll follow up with you after you've had the imaging done to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. Have a good day, and I hope you start feeling better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and professionalism. I will certainly contact you if I have any questions. I hope you have a pleasant day as well. .
