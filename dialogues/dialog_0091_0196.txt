DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it's nice to meet you too, I guess. Um… chronic… fatigue, that’s what the lady on the phone said I should mention. Honestly, I mostly just feel… tired. All the time. It’s been… a while now. I don't really keep track of time very well, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Licano. Chronic fatigue can be very debilitating, and it’s common for it to feel as though time is slipping away when you’re constantly exhausted. To help me understand what's been going on, could you tell me a little more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: Um… how to explain… It’s not like just needing more sleep, you know? I sleep. Plenty of it, sometimes. But I wake up… still tired. Like I didn’t sleep at all. And it's… everything feels harder. Even just… getting out of bed. Or making a cup of tea. It sounds silly, I know. And… sometimes I just… forget things. Not big things, usually. Just… where I put my glasses, or what I was saying mid-sentence.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Ms. Licano. These are all very common symptoms associated with chronic fatigue, and the fact that rest doesn’t alleviate it is quite important. Could you tell me approximately when you first began noticing this persistent fatigue and these memory difficulties?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That’s… a hard one. It was after… after my husband, George… passed. It’s been… a few years, I think? Maybe more? Everything sort of… blurred together after that. It didn't happen all at once, it was more… gradual. I just slowly started feeling… weaker. And… more forgetful. It’s hard to pinpoint a specific date, I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize. It’s perfectly understandable that pinpointing a specific date would be difficult given the circumstances. Losing your husband George must have been incredibly difficult, and grief can certainly manifest in a variety of ways, including fatigue and cognitive changes. To help me get a more complete picture, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Oh… a typical day. Well… I wake up. Eventually. Then I… usually have some tea. And toast. If I remember to put the bread in the toaster. I live alone now, you see. George… he did most of the cooking. I try to… keep the house tidy. A little bit. Mostly I just… sit. Watch television. Read. If I can remember what I was reading about. It's… quiet. Very quiet.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Licano. It sounds like a very quiet and solitary routine. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical history… let me think. I had… the usual. Flu shots, every year. George always made sure of that. And… I broke my wrist, once, when I was a girl. Fell off a… a fence. Silly thing. Oh! And… arthritis, in my hands. The doctor gave me some cream for that. That's about it, I think. Nothing… serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, seasonal flu vaccinations, a past wrist fracture, and arthritis in your hands, currently managed with topical cream. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I don’t think so. Not that I remember. George would have told me, wouldn’t he? He remembered everything. No, I’m pretty sure I haven't had any surgeries. Definitely not that I recall. I get a little… mixed up sometimes, but I’d remember something like that. I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Family… oh dear. That’s… tricky. My mother, she had… heart trouble, I think. And my father… he just… got old. Slowly. I don’t really know much about their medical history. We didn't talk about those things much. And I don't have any siblings, so… there's no one to ask. Sorry, I’m not much help on that front.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. It’s understandable that family medical history may be limited. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. George didn’t like it, and… well, I didn't want to upset George. And I certainly don’t now. No, not a smoker.
DOCTOR: Very good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little wine with dinner, sometimes. George and I would share a glass. Now… not so much. Maybe a small glass on special occasions. It doesn't… agree with me much anymore. It makes me… feel funny.
DOCTOR: Alright, so occasional, small amounts of wine. Now, are there any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, the arthritis cream, of course. And… I take a multivitamin, every morning. Just a general one. And… sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take… something. A little pill. A white one. I can't remember the name. The lady at the pharmacy… she helps me. She knows what I need. I don’t write things down very well.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Licano. It’s helpful to know about the arthritis cream, the multivitamin, and the sleep aid, even if we don't have the specific name yet. We can certainly look into that medication later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the dust. George always said I was sensitive to dust. No, I don't think I have any serious allergies. Nothing I've ever needed to go to the doctor for, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good to know. Now, Ms. Licano, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I suppose so. If it doesn’t take too long. I get… a little tired easily, you see. And I don't like being poked and prodded too much. But… yes. Alright. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Alright, Ms. Licano. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72 and regular, your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't hear any unusual sounds. It’s slightly tender in the upper quadrants, but nothing acutely concerning. Your reflexes are normal. Alright. Everything appears within normal limits, although the slight tenderness in your upper abdomen warrants further investigation. Overall, the exam does not reveal any immediate cause for your fatigue, but we'll need to run some tests to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Oh… that all sounds… alright, I guess. Tests? What kind of tests? I don’t like tests. They always make me nervous. And… what about my tummy? Is it something serious? I just feel so… tired all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Licano. Tests can be unsettling, but they are necessary to help us determine the cause of your fatigue and the tenderness in your abdomen. The tests I’d like to order include a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney and liver function, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid function, and a Vitamin D level. We can also check your iron levels and B12. These are all routine blood tests. The tenderness in your abdomen is likely not serious, but we need to rule out any underlying issues. The blood tests will give us a better understanding. If needed, we might consider an abdominal ultrasound to get a clearer image of your organs. But let’s start with the blood tests first. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear… so many tests. It all sounds… complicated. Um… will they hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don't like waiting. And… what if something is wrong? I… I don't want to be sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxieties, Ms. Licano. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. The blood draw itself is usually quick, and you’ll only feel a brief pinch. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make it as comfortable as possible. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back from the lab. I know waiting can be difficult, but we’ll contact you as soon as they’re available. Regarding the possibility of something being wrong, it’s important to remember that these tests are simply gathering information. Many conditions can cause fatigue, and often, they are treatable. We'll discuss the results thoroughly and develop a plan of action if anything requires attention. We will take it one step at a time. I'm here to support you throughout this process. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests scheduled. Would you prefer I have my assistant schedule them for you, or would you like to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Oh… well, if you don’t mind, I’d really appreciate it if your assistant could do it. I… I get very confused on the phone. And… I always forget what I'm supposed to say. Yes. That would be wonderful. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Licano. I’ll have my assistant, Sarah, schedule the tests for you. She’ll also provide you with clear instructions on how to prepare for them. In the meantime, please try to stay hydrated and get as much rest as possible. Is there anything specific that makes your fatigue worse?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… kind of you. Hydrated… right. I try to drink tea. And… resting… doesn't really help, honestly. But… I think… being on my own makes it worse. It’s… very quiet. And… I just sit and think. And then I feel even more tired. Does that make sense? I probably sound silly.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Licano. Loneliness and prolonged periods of inactivity can absolutely exacerbate fatigue and contribute to feelings of sadness and exhaustion. It’s not silly at all. While we await the results of your tests, I would like to discuss some potential support systems and resources available to you. Would you be open to exploring options like social groups or counseling services?
PATIENT: Oh… counseling? I… I don’t know. I don't really talk about my feelings much. George… he always listened. But… now… it’s just… quiet. Social groups… I haven’t really… done things like that since… well, since George. It sounds… nice, but also… scary.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you feel hesitant, Ms. Licano. It takes courage to consider these options, and it’s perfectly alright if you’re not ready for them yet. There’s absolutely no pressure. Perhaps, as a starting point, we could explore some resources that offer companionship or activities for seniors in the area. Something low-pressure, where you can simply socialize and meet new people at your own pace. Would that be something you might be interested in?
PATIENT: That… that sounds a little better. Not counseling, exactly. Just… meeting people. If it’s not too… overwhelming. And… if it’s close by. I don’t drive anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll find something close by and low-pressure. Sarah, my assistant, has a list of local senior centers and social groups, including some that offer transportation. She can provide you with information on those options when she schedules your tests. In the meantime, please focus on taking care of yourself, Ms. Licano. And remember, I am here to support you throughout this process. We’ll get to the bottom of this fatigue and find ways to improve your quality of life. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. You’ve been very… kind, Doctor. And patient. Thank you. I appreciate it. I just… hope these tests don’t take too long.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Licano. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Sarah will do her best to schedule the tests as quickly as possible. I will review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Licano. Take care, and please remember that you’re not alone.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I… I think I’ll just go home and have some tea. .
DOCTOR: You do that, Ms. Licano. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a good day, Ms. Licano.
