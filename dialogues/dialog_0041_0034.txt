DOCTOR: Hi Emileigh, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, I just moved here...and I need to, like, get set up with a doctor, you know? For, uh...healthcare. I have Medicare. It's all kinda new.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly reasonable. Getting established with a primary care physician is a smart move. And Medicare is good to have. So, besides getting things set up, are you currently having any health concerns or symptoms that you’d like me to take a look at today?
PATIENT: Hmm... Not really, I don’t think so. I mean, nothing major. I work with machines all day, so my hands get a little sore sometimes, but that’s just...work. Is that something you need to know about? It’s not a big deal, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, hand soreness from work. We should definitely document that, just to have it on record. It's good to know what you're exposed to day-to-day. And yes, even seemingly small things can be important. When you say "sore," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Like...achy? Especially after a long day. And sometimes they kinda tingle. Not always, but sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It doesn't really stop me from doing things, if that makes sense. I just…notice it. I don’t know if that’s normal for someone who works with machines all day?
DOCTOR: Okay, achy and tingling in your hands, more noticeable after work. And it doesn’t interfere with your daily activities. That's helpful to know. It could be related to your work, certainly, but tingling can sometimes point to other things, so let's get a bit more information. Have you noticed the tingling in specific fingers, or is it all over?
PATIENT: Um... I think it's mostly in my thumb and index finger on both hands. And maybe a little in my middle finger, but not as much. It’s kinda hard to tell, actually. Sometimes it feels like... all over, but when I really think about it, it's those fingers, I guess. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh. You’re doing fine. Thumb, index, and sometimes middle finger tingling – that's good detail. It sounds like it could be related to something called carpal tunnel syndrome, which is common with repetitive hand movements, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, aside from your hands, are you experiencing any other symptoms anywhere else in your body?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I get tired pretty easily, I guess. But I work long hours, so… I just figured it was that. And sometimes my neck is stiff, but I think that’s just from looking at computers all day. Is that… is that something I need to tell you about? I don’t know what’s important and what’s not.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and neck stiffness. It’s good you mention everything, even if you’re not sure if it’s important. That’s exactly what I want to know. Fatigue can be a symptom of many things, and neck stiffness is common with computer work, but we should explore it a bit. How long have you been feeling fatigued?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Probably…a few months now? It’s kinda gradual, you know? I just…get tired faster. I used to be able to work later, but now I just…need to go to bed earlier. It's not terrible, just…different. And it's been getting a little worse, I think. Does that make sense? I feel like I'm just rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Emileigh. That’s all very helpful information. A few months of gradually worsening fatigue… that’s something we need to investigate further. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… Now that you mention it… I have been feeling kinda… down, I guess. Not sad, exactly, just… not very motivated. And I haven't been sleeping very well, either. I toss and turn a lot. It’s hard to get comfortable. I don't know if that’s connected to the tiredness or not?
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, gradually worsening, along with low motivation and difficulty sleeping. Those symptoms can be connected, yes. It sounds like we need to rule out a few possibilities. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat about the same, I think. Maybe a little less, now that I'm tired all the time. I don't really feel hungry as much. And my weight… I don’t know. I haven't weighed myself in a while. It’s probably the same. I haven’t been exercising as much, though, because I’m so tired. I’m sorry, I'm probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Emileigh. It's good to hear you're eating about the same, and that your weight hasn't changed significantly. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I’m kinda nervous, though. I haven’t been to the doctor in a long time.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. No need to be nervous. It’s just a routine check-up. Okay, take a deep breath in…and out… good. Sounds clear so far. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Um… a little. Not like, pain, exactly, but… kinda uncomfortable. Especially on the left side. I don't know if that’s normal? I get bloated sometimes, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness on the left side, and occasional bloating. That’s good to know. Now, just relax your arm… good. And the other side… Reflexes seem normal. Now, I’m going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little on the higher side, but not dramatically so. Pulse is normal. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just…sometimes I take ibuprofen for my hands when they're really sore. But that’s it. And I haven’t taken any in a few days.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for hand soreness. No other medications or supplements. Given your symptoms – fatigue, low motivation, sleep disturbance, hand soreness, occasional bloating, and slightly elevated blood pressure – I'd like to order some blood work to rule out a few possibilities. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, or something else. It's important to get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Where do I go to get the blood work done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'll write you a lab requisition. You can go to any LabCorp location. There's one just down the street at 123 Main Street. It shouldn’t take more than an hour to get the blood work done. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for them to come back. Once I have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as you can and drink plenty of water. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been really helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s the requisition. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. You too. Bye!
