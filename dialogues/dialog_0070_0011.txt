DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, good morning to you. I got a... a paper. From… someone. Said I gotta get cleared for somethin’. A… a procedure. Cosmetic, they called it. Don't rightly remember fillin' out any papers, but here I am. Let’s just get this over with, shall we? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you received a referral for a medical clearance. We’ll get through this as efficiently as possible. Just to clarify, do you recall what type of cosmetic procedure this was for?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't recall. Some… face thing. Maybe? A lift, perhaps? It was suggested by… a fella. At a… a place. I don’t spend much time rememberin' names or places, if I’m bein’ honest. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now I'm here gettin' poked and prodded. Just tell me what you need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. No problem at all. We can proceed without all the details right away. Since this is for a facial procedure, it's important to ensure you are in good overall health. To start, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Heavens. That’s a long story. I... I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I keep myself goin'. Good food, good sleep when I can get it. No major illnesses, nothin' like that. I had… the sniffles once. And a bad back when I was younger, installin' those towers. But I worked through it. I ain't one for complainin'. Is that what you need to know? Just a strong constitution.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that, Mr. Honcoop. Even a history of minor illnesses or injuries can be helpful. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or any lung problems like asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Now you’re askin’ me things I don't rightly know! High… what? Look, I told you, I ain’t been sick! I work with antennas and towers all day, climbin’ around. That takes lung power, I can assure you. Diabetes? Sounds like somethin’ fancy folks get. I eat sensible. No, I have not been diagnosed with any of those… things. Honestly, are you sure you need all this information for a little face work? It feels… excessive.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. It may seem like a lot of questions for a cosmetic procedure, but it’s important to ensure your safety during and after the procedure. Even something seemingly minor can carry risks if there are underlying health conditions we aren't aware of. Let’s switch gears slightly. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Goodness no. Never. I fix things, I don’t need fixin'. And surgeries… let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. A long, long time ago. That’s it. Nothing else. And that was… well, before they even invented color television. I assure you, I’m a perfectly healthy man. This whole process is… a bit much. Are we gettin’ anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are, Mr. Honcoop. Thank you for clarifying. Now, could you tell me about any medications you currently take, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me see. I take… nothing. Absolutely nothin’. I don't believe in fillin' my body with all those chemicals. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's it. And that's hardly a regular thing. Vitamins? No. Supplements? No. I get all I need from a good, hearty breakfast. Really, doctor, I'm a very simple man. I eat, I sleep, I work. That's all there is to it. Is this really necessary? I'm startin' to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I appreciate your honesty. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not a one. I eat everything. I touch everything. I climb on everything! Never had a problem. Dust, pollen, cats, dogs… bring it on! I’m a sturdy fella. Seriously, doctor, are we almost done here? I have things to do. This is wasting my valuable time. Can we just sign whatever paper needs signin’ and get this over with?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Honcoop. We've covered a good amount of ground. Given your reported medical history, or lack thereof, and the absence of allergies or medications, I'm comfortable proceeding with a brief physical examination to ensure there are no immediate contraindications to the procedure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? After all this questionin'? Fine. Just get it over with. I suppose it can't hurt, but I haven't got all day. And please be quick about it. I have appointments. Let's just do it. But don't expect to find anything. I’m a perfectly healthy man, I tell ya. Perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. It will be a quick examination. First, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Excellent. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 160 over 95. I also notice your pulse is slightly irregular. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear a slight… wheezing on exhale. Now, I’ll just check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Elevated? What do you mean, elevated? I told you, I'm fine! A little wheezing? Everyone wheezes a bit when they climb around on those towers all day! It's the air, doctor, the air! And what's this about irregular? My pulse is perfectly… regular. It’s always been regular. Are you sure you know what you're doin'? This is beginnin' to feel… suspicious. I don’t like this one bit.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your concern. The elevated blood pressure and slightly irregular pulse warrant further investigation before proceeding with any elective procedure. The wheezing, while possibly related to your occupation, also needs to be assessed. I'm not questioning your overall health, but these findings indicate that you may have underlying conditions that need to be addressed. To get a clearer picture, I recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to evaluate your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to examine your lungs. Would you be amenable to those tests?
PATIENT: An EKG? A chest X-ray? Now you're talkin’ nonsense! I came in here for a clearance, not a full medical workup! I told you, I'm a perfectly healthy man! This is outrageous! I don't need any tests! This is a waste of time and money, and frankly, it's insulting! I suspect you’re just trying to get more money out of me. No, absolutely not! I will not be subjected to any tests. I want a sign-off, and I want it now! I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions about my health. Just sign the paper, doctor, and let me be on my way! This is… unacceptable! I'm leaving. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, please, sit down. I understand your frustration, but I am obligated to prioritize your safety. Signing off on a procedure without addressing these findings would be unethical and potentially dangerous. I am not trying to generate more revenue; I am genuinely concerned about your well-being. An EKG and chest X-ray are relatively simple tests that can provide valuable information. However, I respect your autonomy. If you absolutely refuse these tests, I cannot, in good conscience, sign off on the procedure. I would strongly advise you to consult with another physician for a second opinion. I can provide you with a list of qualified doctors in the area. Before you leave, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Second opinion? You think I need a second opinion? I've been climbin' towers for forty years! Forty years, I tell you! I know my body! This is… this is preposterous. You're saying I'm too old, aren't you? That's what this is about! You look at me, see an old man, and suddenly I'm a medical case! Fine. Do whatever you want. Write whatever you want on that paper. I don't care anymore. I'm leaving. And I won't be back. Don't bother with a list of doctors. I don't need one. Just… just give me the paper. I want to be done with this. This whole experience has been… a complete waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Honcoop. Here is the form. As you can see, I have documented my findings and your decision to proceed without further evaluation. Please understand that this means the procedure is being undertaken at your own risk. I strongly encourage you to reconsider and seek a second opinion. I wish you all the best. .
