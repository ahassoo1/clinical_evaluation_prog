DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, to be honest, I just… wanted to check things out. Never really been to a doctor before, not for me. Just makin’ sure everything’s okay, I guess. It’s kinda a curiosity visit.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Demondre. Preventative care is always a good idea. It’s good you’re being proactive. “Check things out” is a good enough reason to come in. To get a better idea of where we’re starting from, could you tell me a little bit more about why you decided now was the time to come in?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I been workin’ on the boats for a few years now… sailin’ and fixin’ things down below. No problems, really. But… my ex-wife, she always said I should get checked up. Said I was too tough for my own good. And now I got some time off, figured why not? Just want to make sure everything's still workin’ like it should, you know? For me, and… well, maybe for future stuff too.
DOCTOR: That's very thoughtful of you, Demondre. And it's good you’re listening to good advice – even from an ex-wife! So, working on boats… that sounds physically demanding. Any aches, pains, or anything that’s been bothering you specifically – even if it's minor?
PATIENT: It is hard work. Lots of bendin’ and liftin’. My back gets a little sore sometimes, after a long shift. But nothin’ I can’t work through, usually. And my hands get kinda rough, you know, from the ropes and tools. But that’s just… part of the job, I figure. Not really botherin' me, just… how it is. Honestly, I feel pretty good most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And “pretty good” is always a good starting point. Just to get a full picture, let’s do a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. Never been sick much, to be honest. Had the usual colds when I was a kid, maybe the flu once or twice. But never anything a doctor ever needed to look at. Oh! I broke my arm when I was little, fell outta a tree. But it healed up fine. That was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No major medical history to speak of, which is excellent. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries either. Never needed anythin’ taken out or put in. Always been pretty lucky, I guess. Just bumps and bruises from work, mostly. Nothin’ serious enough for a doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Demondre. Alright, let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. Didn’t really talk about health much growin’ up. My mom, she had high blood pressure I think, when she got older. And my grandpa… he had somethin’ with his heart, I think. But I don’t really know the details. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it much. Sorry I can’t be more helpful. Family wasn’t big on doctor visits either.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Demondre. It's common for families to not discuss health matters. Knowing even a little bit is helpful. So, high blood pressure in your mother and something with your grandfather's heart... we can make a note of that. Now, just a few more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Never had a problem with allergies. Can eat anything, take any medicine… never had a reaction or nothin'. Wait… sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I use certain soaps. But that’s just a little irritation, not a real allergy, I don’t think. Mostly I just use regular hand soap.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Don’t take nothin’. Never really been one for pills or nothin’. Just try to eat good and get enough rest. And drink plenty of water, especially when I'm workin' on the boats. That's about it. I'm pretty simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, Demondre. That gives me a good starting point. You seem to be in pretty good shape, which is fantastic. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, take a look in your ears and throat, and feel your abdomen. It won't take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll get started. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. Blood pressure is 128/82. That’s within the normal range. Ears appear clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses detected. Everything sounds and feels good so far, Demondre. Just routine, but good to get a baseline. Do you have any specific concerns or areas that bother you that you’d like me to take a closer look at?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Like I said, everything’s been feelin’ pretty good. Maybe… my back gets a little stiff sometimes after a long shift on the boat. But it usually works itself out with a little rest. I don't want to bother you if it's nothing.
DOCTOR: No bother at all, Demondre. That’s good information to have. Let me just have a quick feel of your spine, and I'll check your range of motion. There's some mild muscle tightness in your lower back, but no signs of acute injury. Range of motion is slightly limited due to muscle tightness, but no pain reported. Okay, Demondre. It seems you have some mild muscle strain in your lower back, likely from the physical demands of your work. It doesn't seem to be anything serious at this point. I recommend stretching regularly and practicing good posture. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help with any discomfort. Would you like me to show you some simple stretches you can do at home?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’d be great, Doctor. Some stretches would be really helpful. I always forget what to do. I appreciate you takin’ the time.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here are a few simple stretches you can do. First, the cat-cow stretch. This helps improve flexibility in your spine. Then, try the knee-to-chest stretch. This helps relieve tension in your lower back. And finally, try gentle lower back rotations while lying on your back. Hold each stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat several times a day. Remember to listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain. Do you have any questions about these stretches?
PATIENT: Nah, I think I got it. Cat-cow, knee-to-chest, and the rotations. Sounds easy enough. I’ll try to remember to do ‘em every day. Thanks again, Doctor. You been a big help. I feel a lot better just knowin’ everything’s okay. Is there anything else I should be worryin’ about, or… anything I need to schedule?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. I’m glad I could help. Based on today’s exam, you seem to be in good overall health. I don’t think you need to worry about anything at this time. However, since you're starting a new phase with some time off, it would be a good idea to schedule a follow-up appointment in about a year for a general check-up, just to monitor your health and address any concerns that may arise. Also, given the physical demands of your work, it might be useful to consider a bone density scan in a few years to ensure good bone health. Would you like me to schedule that follow-up appointment for you now, or would you prefer to do it later?
PATIENT: A year sounds good. Yeah, go ahead and schedule somethin’ for a year from now, if you can. That way I won’t forget. And I’ll keep the bone density scan in mind for a few years down the road. You really been lookin’ out for me today, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Demondre. I have you scheduled for a follow-up appointment on August 2, 2026. I’ll also make a note in your chart to discuss the bone density scan at that time. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that’s everything. Thanks again for all your help, Doctor Smetak. You have a good day now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a wonderful day as well. And remember those stretches!
