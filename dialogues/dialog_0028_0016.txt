DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Farson, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Nicky Farson. Though, honestly, most folks just call me Nick. And please, don’t bother with the “Mr.” It feels… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Very well, Nick. Let’s not waste time then. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this bruising, frankly. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m on blood thinners, yes, and I know I’m supposed to get a few bumps here and there. But this is… excessive. I keep finding them. Even just from, well, normal things. It’s quite bothersome, actually.
DOCTOR: Excessive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, excessive. Look, I’ve been taking these pills for… well, a long time now, since my wife passed. I know what’s normal. This isn’t normal. It’s like I’m made of glass these days. A slight tap and – boom – another colorful mark. It's embarrassing, to be honest. People stare.
DOCTOR: And what blood thinner are you currently prescribed?
PATIENT: Warfarin. Yes, Warfarin. Though, honestly, I don’t bother keeping track of the dosage myself. My… well, someone used to handle that. It’s all a bit much for me these days. It’s supposed to be, you know, a steady amount. But maybe something’s changed? I wouldn’t know.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, someone should be keeping track. Do you have any idea of when this increased bruising started?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. It’s been… gradual. A few more bumps here, a slightly bigger one there. It’s not like one day I woke up covered in them. It’s just… gotten worse over the last month or so, I suppose. Though, it's difficult to say for sure. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. Just… tired, I suppose. But that’s always the case these days, isn’t it? Old age. No dizziness, no bleeding gums, nothing like that. Just the bruising. And the annoying looks, naturally. It's the bruising, really. That’s what brought me here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at you, then. Please, roll up your sleeves and pant legs. We'll need to assess the extent of this… situation. And try to remember if anything specific might have caused these bruises, even if it seems insignificant.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Though I assure you, it's not a mystery. It’s the pills. And honestly, I do try to be careful. I’m not deliberately banging into things. There. Happy? Though I doubt you'll find anything helpful. It's all just… random.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there's quite a bit here, distributed rather… haphazardly. Any recent falls?
PATIENT: Recent falls? Absolutely not. I may be getting on in years, but I'm not falling over every five minutes. No. I haven’t tripped, stumbled, or done anything of the sort. I'm fairly steady on my feet, thank you very much. It's the medication, I'm telling you. It's the Warfarin. It’s clearly too much.
DOCTOR: Your INR was checked three months ago and was within the therapeutic range. We need to rule out other causes. Have you started any new medications or supplements recently?
PATIENT: Supplements? Good heavens, no. I take my Warfarin and that’s it. I’m not one for all those… fad remedies. No, nothing new. Look, I understand you need to “rule things out”, but I’m quite certain this is simply a matter of adjusting the dosage. It's logical, isn't it? More bruising, more thin blood… it all makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a repeat INR. Just to be thorough. And, frankly, to confirm you’re being truthful about your medications. I'd also like you to be more mindful of any unusual bleeding, even minor nosebleeds or bleeding gums. And, yes, do try to remember if you’ve taken anything else. It's quite important. We'll have the results in a few days. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the nurse. I'm quite busy.
PATIENT: Truthful? Are you implying I'm lying? That’s rather rude, you know. I simply don’t bother with all those… things. It's not a conspiracy, it’s a matter of preference. Fine, fine, I'll try to "remember." Though I doubt I will. And a repeat INR? Honestly. This is all quite unnecessary. But very well. A follow-up with the nurse, then. And please, don't patronize me.
