DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… pleasant. Yes. Well, I believe it’s about my… coloring. My skin, you see. It's a bit… yellow. A friend suggested I come see someone, said it wasn't normal. I don't recall exactly what she said, but it had something to do with my… liver, I think? I do have some trouble with that organ, from time to time. It’s all a bit… hazy, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Durig. Yellowing of the skin, or jaundice as we call it, can certainly have a number of causes. And it’s good you came in to have it checked out. You mentioned some trouble with your liver in the past – could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Troubles… yes. It was… a long time ago. I believe it was… hepatitis? Something like that. A sickness, certainly. There were… doctors involved. And a great deal of… discomfort. It wasn’t pleasant, not at all. I don't recall the specifics, I’m afraid. It was… decades ago. Many, many years. And I haven’t been to a doctor regularly since then. Honestly, I don’t remember when I last had a proper check-up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. That’s quite alright. We can work with that. Even a general idea is helpful. To get a better understanding of what's going on now, and whether it might be related to that past illness, could you describe the yellowing of your skin?
PATIENT: Oh… describe it? Well… it’s just… yellow. Not a bright yellow, mind you, more of a… sickly shade. It started, I believe, in my eyes. My daughter pointed it out, said I looked… unwell. And then I noticed it on my skin, particularly my hands, I think. It's… subtle, though. Not terribly noticeable, unless one is looking for it. It hasn’t… spread quickly, thankfully. It’s just… there. It is worrying me, a little. It reminds me… of something unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Durig. It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. Besides the yellowing of your skin and eyes, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… oh, dear. Let me think. Well… I’ve been rather tired lately. More so than usual, perhaps. And my appetite… it isn’t what it used to be. I don’t feel much hunger, really. And… sometimes, my stomach feels a bit… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just… unsettled. And… now that you mention it… my urine seems… darker than usual. A sort of… amber color, I believe. But perhaps that’s just the fluids I’ve been drinking? I do enjoy a bit of tea, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Durig. That's helpful information. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam. Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t believe I’ve had one in… well, decades. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Just… be gentle, dear. My skin is rather sensitive, you know. And… I don’t have much patience for discomfort. But… do what you need to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Hmm… Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that’s… a bit uncomfortable, actually. Not terribly painful, but… sensitive. Right there, on my… upper right side. Just below my ribs. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. And… now that you press on it… it feels… slightly swollen. But perhaps that’s just my imagination? I do tend to worry, you know. It's just… a bit unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. I'm just assessing your liver now. Your liver does seem a bit enlarged, and it's slightly firm to the touch. It's not a dramatic enlargement, but it is enough to warrant further investigation. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m finding on the exam, I suspect we need to run some blood tests to check your liver function. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh… blood tests. Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don't enjoy needles, you know. But… if it will tell us what’s wrong, then do what you must. What… what will these tests tell you, exactly? And… will they be painful? I do have… a rather low tolerance for discomfort, as you’ve probably noticed.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will give us a detailed look at how your liver is functioning. They can tell us if there’s any inflammation, damage, or blockage, and help us determine the cause of the jaundice and the enlargement. The tests themselves will involve a small needle prick, and you may feel a brief sting, but it shouldn’t be painful for long. We’ll be finished quickly. After the tests, we can discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Would you like me to explain the specific tests we’ll be running?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, please. If you wouldn’t mind explaining. I do like to know what’s happening, even if I don’t fully understand it. I suppose… inflammation sounds unpleasant. Is that… serious? And… what is a blockage, exactly? I do worry about… complications, you know. My friend… she had some trouble with her gallbladder, and it sounded… rather dreadful.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll be running a comprehensive metabolic panel, which includes tests to check your liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and albumin levels. Elevated liver enzymes suggest inflammation or damage to the liver cells. Bilirubin is what causes the yellowing of your skin, and high levels confirm the jaundice. Albumin levels can tell us about your liver's ability to make proteins. We'll also check a complete blood count to see if there are any signs of infection. As for a blockage, that would mean something is preventing bile from flowing out of the liver and gallbladder. That can cause a buildup of bilirubin, leading to jaundice and other complications. Your friend's trouble with her gallbladder is relevant, as the gallbladder works closely with the liver. We'll check to see if that could be contributing to your symptoms. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll get the results first and then discuss the best course of action. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a lot of information. Enzymes… bilirubin… albumin… It’s all rather… overwhelming, truthfully. But… yes, I think I understand, vaguely. So, the tests will tell you if my liver is… working properly? And if there’s anything… blocking things? And… what if there is a blockage? Will I need… surgery? My friend… she had a very long recovery. I do hope it won’t come to that.
DOCTOR: That's right. The tests will give us a clear picture of your liver’s function and help us identify any potential problems. If we do find a blockage, the treatment will depend on the cause and location of the blockage. Sometimes it can be treated with medication, and other times surgery may be necessary. But let’s not worry about surgery just yet. We haven’t even run the tests. It's important to remember that many liver problems can be managed with lifestyle changes and medication. The first step is to get the results and then we’ll discuss all your options. I'm going to order those blood tests now. A nurse will come in shortly to draw the samples. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I suppose not. Just… please tell the nurse to be gentle. And… try to be quick. I do dislike needles. And… honestly, Doctor, I'm rather tired. All this talk… it’s exhausting. I believe I’ll be glad when this is over. Perhaps a cup of tea afterward? That always helps.
DOCTOR: I will absolutely let the nurse know. And yes, a cup of tea sounds lovely after this. We’ll get this done as quickly as we can, and then you can relax and enjoy your tea. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. Let me think. Not that I know of, dear. I've always been rather… robust, truthfully. Perhaps a slight… sensitivity to dust, sometimes. But nothing serious. No medications, either. I try to avoid them whenever possible. My mother always said they did more harm than good. But… no, no allergies, to speak of. Just… try to be gentle with the needle, dear. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to call the nurse now to come in and draw the blood samples. It shouldn’t be long. Thank you for your patience. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available.
