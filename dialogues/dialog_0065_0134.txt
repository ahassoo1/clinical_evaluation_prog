DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s been my stomach, mostly. I just don’t seem to be able to keep much down these days, and I get full so quickly. It’s… unsettling, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now, I think. Honestly, the days sort of blend together sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Days blending together”... right. And you said it’s mostly your stomach – difficulty keeping food down and feeling full quickly. Can you tell me how long “a little while” is, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think... It's hard to say exactly. Maybe... three, four weeks? It started gradually, I think. Not a sudden thing. I used to be able to eat a good lunch, but now… even a little bit feels like too much. I just don't have the appetite I used to. It worries me, because my… my husband, bless his soul, he had trouble eating before… well, before he passed. I don't want to get… like that.
DOCTOR: Three to four weeks, gradual onset. And understandably concerning, given your husband's experience. So, besides the feeling full quickly and difficulty keeping food down, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I’ve been feeling tired a lot, even after a good nap. And… sometimes I just feel sort of… blah. Not really sick, just… not myself. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, but it's hard to say for sure. I don’t weigh myself regularly, you see. It's just... a general feeling of unwellness, I suppose. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, general feeling of unwellness, possible weight loss. Okay. Let's go through a bit more detail. When you say "tiredness", is it just feeling sleepy, or is it more like a lack of energy, difficulty getting through the day?
PATIENT: Oh, it's more like… not having the strength to do things, really. It's not just wanting a nap. Even simple things, like getting the mail or doing a little gardening, leave me feeling completely drained. I used to love my garden, but I haven't been out there much lately. It just feels like too much effort. I used to be so active, you know? Before… everything.
DOCTOR: Right. Fatigue impacting daily activities. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… Now that you mention it, sometimes my tummy feels a bit achy. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, mostly in the upper part. It comes and goes, though. It's not constant. And sometimes I get a little heartburn, but I always thought that was just from eating too much chocolate. Old habits, you know?
DOCTOR: Dull abdominal pain, upper abdomen, intermittent. Heartburn. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, yes, actually. Things haven't been… regular, if you know what I mean. Sometimes I feel a bit… stopped up, and other times… well, let's just say it's not as firm as it used to be. It's… embarrassing to talk about, I suppose. I haven't mentioned it to anyone before.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to experience changes in bowel habits, Ms. Kelder. It's important information. Constipation, and looser stools… Okay. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years ago? And the doctor always said I had a touch of arthritis, but it's never been too bad. I take a little something for it now and then. And… I had pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered from that just fine. Other than that… I don’t really think so. I try to stay healthy, you know? Fresh air, good food, that sort of thing. And my Medicare covers everything, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Cholecystectomy 30 years ago, arthritis, past pneumonia. Okay. And any medications you're currently taking for the arthritis or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something called… hmm… let me see… It's called naproxen, I think? Just when my joints are acting up. And sometimes I take a little something for my heartburn, like Tums. Nothing regular, though. I try not to take too many pills, you know? My daughter always tells me to be careful with those things. This is it, I think.
DOCTOR: Naproxen as needed for arthritis, Tums for heartburn. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I used to help my mother with her garden, and she grew all sorts of things, and I never had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, I suppose. I’ve always been a pretty healthy person, despite my age. Although, lately… I haven’t been feeling quite myself, as you know.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright, Ms. Kelder. Now I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement completely. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable, alright? I’m not as spry as I used to be, you know. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but with some diminished breath sounds at the bases. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender. Mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, no guarding or rebound tenderness. No masses palpable. Bowel sounds are… hypoactive. Diminished. Alright. Now I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect something is going on with your digestive system. It could be a number of things, frankly. We need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a liver function test. And I think we should get an upper endoscopy to look at your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum directly. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood work is fine, I suppose. I’ve had blood taken plenty of times. But… an endoscopy? What exactly is that? Does it hurt? And what are you looking for, Doctor? My husband… he had a lot of tests when he was sick, and… I just want to know what’s going on, you know? And I’m a little worried about anything invasive, if you don't mind my asking. I just… I’m not as strong as I used to be, and tests can be so draining.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Kelder. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about tests, especially given your husband’s experience. An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum – the first part of your small intestine. It allows us to directly visualize the lining of these organs and look for any abnormalities, such as inflammation, ulcers, or growths. It’s a very safe procedure, and we give you medication to make you comfortable – usually a sedative to help you relax and minimize any discomfort. Most patients don’t remember much of the procedure at all. There is some mild discomfort afterwards – a bit of a sore throat, maybe some bloating – but it's usually manageable. We’re looking to rule out things like gastritis, ulcers, or, less likely, something more serious. Given your symptoms – the difficulty keeping food down, the feeling full quickly, the abdominal pain, and the loss of appetite – it's the best way to get a definitive diagnosis. I wouldn't recommend it if it wasn't necessary. We can discuss the risks and benefits in more detail, and you can certainly decline if you’re not comfortable. But I believe it’s the most effective way to find out what’s going on and get you the appropriate treatment. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh dear… It sounds… a little scary, honestly. All those tubes and cameras… But you’re right, I do want to know what’s going on. And if it’s the best way to find out… I suppose I can do it. If you really think it’s necessary. But… will it take long? And who will be with me? I don't want to be alone during all this. And… is it covered by Medicare? I worry about bills, you know? My daughter helps me with those, but I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Kelder. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious. The procedure itself usually takes about 15 to 30 minutes. You’ll be given medication beforehand to make you comfortable and relaxed – most patients are lightly sedated, and many don’t remember much of it at all. You won’t be alone. A nurse will be with you throughout the entire procedure, and I will be performing the endoscopy myself. We'll monitor your vital signs closely, and we'll make sure you're as comfortable as possible. And yes, it is covered by Medicare, as long as it’s deemed medically necessary, which I believe it is in your case. We’ll handle all the paperwork and insurance details for you. You don't need to worry about that. I’m going to order the blood work first, and we’ll schedule the endoscopy for next week, once we have the results back. I’ll have the nurse call you with the scheduling details, and we can discuss any further questions you may have at that time. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or difficulty breathing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that sounds a little better, yes. Knowing there will be a nurse, and that you’ll be there… And Medicare covering it… That’s a relief. Alright. Blood work first, then the… the endoscopy. Next week, you said? Yes, alright. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything so well. I still feel a little scared, but… I trust you. I'm glad I came in today. I guess it's better to know, isn't it? Just… please let me know when the nurse will call. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It’s completely understandable to feel anxious, and you’re doing the right thing by getting things checked out. The nurse will call you within the next 24 to 48 hours to schedule the blood work and discuss the endoscopy appointment. If you don’t hear from them within that timeframe, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic and ask. Alright, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve answered all my questions. Thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor. It means a lot. I’ll… I’ll see you next week, then. And thank you again, for everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Goodbye, Ms. Kelder. .
