DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I'm a family medicine doctor. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Lahn. Nice to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, I been feeling… strange lately. I drink a lot of water, more than usual, and I still feel thirsty. And I eat, but I feel hungry all the time. It just… not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, “strange” is a good way to put it, and it’s good you’re coming in to get it checked out. Drinking more water than usual and still feeling thirsty, and feeling hungry all the time… those are definitely things we want to look into. To get a better understanding, can you tell me roughly how much water you’re drinking in a day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one to say exactly. But maybe… four, five big bottles? The kind you buy at the shop? And I used to just drink with meals, now I drink all through the day. It’s a lot more than before, I can tell you that. It just doesn't seem to quench me.
DOCTOR: Okay, four or five large bottles throughout the day – that is a significant increase. And you're feeling thirsty even with that amount, alright. Besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Well… now that you ask… I does feel tired a lot more. Just… sluggish, you know? And I does have to go to the bathroom more often. Especially at night. Waking me up sometimes, it does. It’s really bothering me, that part. I didn't really think it was important enough to mention at first, but now that you ask… yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information, Bianca. Feeling tired and needing to urinate frequently, especially at night… those symptoms, along with the thirst and hunger, are starting to paint a clearer picture. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your vision, any unexplained weight loss, or any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: My vision is alright, I think. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I always thought it was just my age. Weight… I haven't really been weighing myself. I does feel like I maybe losing a little bit, but I can't be sure. And no, no numbness or tingling, thankfully. Everything feels normal there. I does get a little cramps in my legs sometimes, but that's just old age, eh?
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. No numbness or tingling is good. Leg cramps can be common, yes. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I never been sick with anything serious, knock on wood. I does get a little cold sometimes, but that’s it. My husband, he does have high blood pressure, but not me. I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of fruits and vegetables, and I don't drink much soda. I does like my roti, though! But I try not to eat it too much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you generally stay healthy! And it's helpful to know your husband has high blood pressure - we'll keep that in mind. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a surgery, not a hospital. I does get a little headache sometimes, and I take a Panadol for it, but that's all. I always been a strong woman, never had to go to the doctor much, until now. I does worry about being sick, you know? My mother, she was sick for a long time before she passed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Bianca, especially with your mother’s health history. It's good you’re being proactive now. And you mentioned Panadol for headaches – do you take any other medications regularly, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the Panadol when I have a headache, and that’s not very often. I used to take a vitamin D in the winter, when I wasn't getting much sun, but I stopped that last year. I mostly try to get my vitamins from my food. I believe in natural things, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, before we do a quick exam, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband, he’s allergic to some kinds of nuts, but not me. I never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. I does sometimes get a little itchy when a mosquito bite me, but that's all. I live in Trinidad, you get plenty mosquito!
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine! Alright, no known allergies – that’s good. Okay, Bianca, I think we have enough information for now. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also do a quick check of your reflexes and feet. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. Whatever you need to do, I’ll cooperate. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable, eh? I does get a little nervous around doctors, but I’m trying to be brave.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Bianca. I'll explain everything as I go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. We’ll take it slow. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, which isn’t uncommon with stress or anxiety, but it’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your reflexes are normal, but I notice the sensation in your feet is a little diminished. Not alarming, but something to note. Alright, Bianca. Based on your symptoms and this quick exam, I'm concerned about the possibility of diabetes. The increased thirst, frequent urination, hunger, fatigue, and slightly diminished sensation in your feet are all consistent with that. But we need to confirm with some blood tests. Would you be okay with getting some blood work done?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear… My husband, he has it, so it runs in the family. I was hoping I wouldn’t get it too… Yes, Doctor, if you think it’s best, then do the blood tests. I rather know for sure, eh? Better to know and do something about it, than to just worry. I trust you. Just let me know what I have to do, and I’ll do it. It’s just… it’s a scary thing, diabetes.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Bianca. It is a scary diagnosis, but it's also very manageable with the right treatment and lifestyle changes. And knowing is absolutely the best thing we can do right now. I’m going to order these blood tests now. You'll need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw, meaning no food or sugary drinks. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of you. It’s a simple procedure. Once we have the results back – usually within a few days – we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water – not to quench your thirst, necessarily, but to stay hydrated – and avoid sugary drinks as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you explained everything very well. Eight hours fasting, no sugary drinks… I can manage that. I does drink my water anyway, so that’s not a problem. I was wondering… if it is diabetes, what does that mean? What will I have to do? I don’t want to end up like my husband, with all his pills and needles…
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Bianca. Everyone’s experience with diabetes is different. It really depends on the type of diabetes and how well it’s controlled. If it is type 2 diabetes, which is more common, it often starts with lifestyle changes – a healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management. Sometimes, that’s enough to control it. If not, we can add medication, usually in the form of pills. Insulin injections are often used, but not always necessary, especially in the early stages. We'll work with you, not against you, to create a plan that fits your lifestyle and helps you stay healthy. We’ll discuss diet, exercise, and medication options – if needed – and monitor your blood sugar levels to make sure everything is under control. There are also diabetes educators who can teach you about managing your condition and living a full and active life. Would you be interested in learning more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I would be very interested in talking to a diabetes educator. That sounds like a good idea. It's just… it’s a lot to take in. I never thought I would be in this situation. So, just to be clear… I need to fast for eight hours, go to the lab, and then come back here when I get the results? And then we’ll talk about diet, exercise, and maybe pills? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly right, Bianca. Fast for eight hours, go to the lab, and then come back here with the results. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as the results are available – usually within a few days. And then, yes, we’ll discuss diet, exercise, and, if needed, medication options. We'll also talk about how to monitor your blood sugar levels at home, and I can refer you to a diabetes educator who can provide additional support and guidance. Here’s the lab order and a slip with the instructions for fasting. Do you have any trouble getting to the lab, or do you need help with transportation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I can manage the transportation. My son, he will take me. He lives close by, and he’s always willing to help. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for not making me feel scared. It's a big worry, this diabetes, but I feel a little better now, knowing what to expect. I will fast for eight hours, and I will see you when I get the results.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bianca. I’m glad I could ease your worries a little. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We are here to support you. Take care, Bianca, and I’ll see you soon.
