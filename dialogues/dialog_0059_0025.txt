DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagarís. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I want to... how you say... find out more about where my family come from. I hear you can do tests for that? For... the old, old family? I want to know where they really from, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, I understand. You’re interested in exploring your ancestry, perhaps learning more about your family’s origins. We can certainly discuss options for genetic ancestry testing. It's become quite popular and can provide a lot of interesting information. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any health concerns today, or is this solely for genealogical purposes?
PATIENT: No, no health problems. Just… curious. My grandma, she always talk stories, but… hard to remember everything now. I want to see where she come from, not just hear stories. Is it… expensive? I have Medicare.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Scobie. It's wonderful you're interested in preserving your family history. Medicare coverage for genetic ancestry testing is a bit complex, and typically it’s not covered unless it's directly related to a medical condition or risk assessment. However, we can check your specific plan details to see if any portion might be covered. Generally, these tests can range in price, from a couple hundred to several hundred dollars, depending on the depth of the analysis. Before we proceed, let’s talk a bit about what these tests involve, and what kind of information they can – and can’t – provide. Would you like me to explain some of the different types of ancestry tests available?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain. I don’t know anything about… types. Just know they can find old family. Is it… do you take blood? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. It's good to know what to expect. The good news is, most ancestry tests don’t require a traditional blood draw. The most common method now is a saliva sample – you simply spit into a tube. It's a very simple and painless process. There are a few different companies that offer these tests, and they vary in what they analyze. Some focus on broad ethnic origins – like percentages of European, Asian, or African ancestry. Others offer more detailed regional breakdowns – for example, specific countries or even historical migrations. Some also include information about potential relatives through matching DNA with others in their database. Companies like 23andMe, AncestryDNA, and MyHeritage are popular options. Each has slightly different strengths. 23andMe, for example, also provides some health predisposition reports, while AncestryDNA has extensive family tree building tools. Would you like me to explain the potential benefits and limitations of these tests in more detail, before we discuss which one might be best for you?
PATIENT: Saliva… that’s okay. Better than needle. Hmm… so it tell me what part of the world my family from? Not just… Marshall Islands? I don’t need health stuff. Just family. What if… what if it say my grandma stories not true? That scary. What if she wrong about everything?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid point, Mr. Scobie. It can tell you about ancestral origins beyond the Marshall Islands, tracing lineages back potentially hundreds or even thousands of years. It’s important to remember though, these tests are estimates, based on comparisons to current populations. They aren’t definitive proof, and the further back you go, the less accurate they become. And you’re right to be cautious about potentially conflicting information. It's possible the results might differ from your grandmother's stories. Family histories are often passed down through oral tradition, and can be subject to embellishment or misremembering over time. The tests can offer another piece of the puzzle, but shouldn’t necessarily be seen as contradicting your family's narrative. Think of it as adding to the story, rather than replacing it. It can be fascinating to learn about potential migrations and connections, even if it differs from what you’ve always believed. It’s also possible the stories and the tests will align, which can be very rewarding. Before we decide on a test, perhaps you could tell me a little more about what your grandmother told you about your family's origins?
PATIENT: She say… long, long time ago, before even the big war, some of my family come from… she say islands far away. Not like Marshall Islands. She say brown people, but different brown. She say they good sailors, always on the water. And she say they have special songs. But I was small then, I don't remember everything. She show me a old picture once, but I can't find it now. It show people in… boats, maybe? And they had tattoos. It important to me, Doctor. She the one keep our family together. I want to know where she from. You think test can help with that?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Scobie. “Brown people, but different brown,” good sailors, special songs, and tattoos… that gives us something to work with. That description is actually quite evocative. And it’s wonderful you value your grandmother’s stories so much. Based on that information, and considering the potential for maritime heritage, it might be worthwhile to explore tests that focus on populations in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Specifically, tests that analyze DNA markers common in Polynesian, Micronesian, and Melanesian populations. Some companies also have databases that include historical migration patterns and connections between island groups. Given your preference for avoiding health-related information, we can definitely choose a test that solely focuses on ancestry. The cost for a detailed test focusing on Pacific Island ancestry can range between $250 and $400. Would you like me to provide you with some brochures detailing the different companies and tests available, so you can review them at your leisure?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Brochures would be good. I need to think about it. And… how long it take to get the answer? I not good at waiting. I old now, time go fast.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. Here you are. These brochures detail the most popular ancestry testing companies and outline their services and pricing. You're right, time does go by quickly. Generally, it takes between 6 to 8 weeks to receive the results after you send in your saliva sample. The companies need time to analyze the DNA and compare it to their databases. They will send you a report online, which you can then review at your own pace. They also have customer support available if you have any questions about the results. Take your time reviewing the information, and don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions. We’re happy to help you make an informed decision. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You been very helpful. I go home now, read the papers. Maybe talk to my cousin, she smart. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was a pleasure meeting you. Talking to your cousin sounds like a good idea – another perspective is always helpful. Please feel free to call if you have any questions at all. Have a wonderful day, and I hope you enjoy learning more about your family history.
