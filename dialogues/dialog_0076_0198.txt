DOCTOR: Right, Mrs. Sugino. Forty-seven… Bulgarian. Alright. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Ruocco. It's nice to meet you. Well, I’ve been thinking lately… about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I keep hearing good things, and I thought maybe I could learn a bit about it here. I’m just… feeling a little scattered, I guess, and hoping it could help me focus.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes. I… it’s hard to explain exactly. It’s like… being more present, I think? Paying attention to what's happening right now, instead of worrying about things that might happen, or things that already did. I read an article, and it mentioned it could help with stress and… well, just feeling calmer. I don’t really know much about it, to be honest. Is it something you offer here?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Sugino, this is a medical practice. We deal with illnesses, with… quantifiable problems. Not… feelings. I’m a doctor, not a… life coach. You’re feeling “scattered”?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. I… I didn’t realize. I just… I saw the clinic offered wellness checks, and I thought maybe… sometimes I get a little lost in my thoughts, and it affects my work, you know? Remembering the track sequences, making sure everything is right. It’s important. I suppose I was hoping for something to help with concentration. Is there… someone else I could talk to about this, perhaps? Or is it really not something you handle here at all?
DOCTOR: “Track sequences”?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I repair signals and track switches for the railway. It requires a lot of concentration, remembering the precise order of everything. If I get one thing wrong… well, it’s not good. That's why I thought maybe something to help me focus would be useful. I apologize if I’m wasting your time. I just… I’ve been reading about how stress can affect memory, and I thought maybe you could advise me on if that’s something I should be concerned about, even if you don’t offer mindfulness classes.
DOCTOR: Right. Stress can affect memory, yes. But we need to determine if there’s an underlying cause. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Not really, no. I sleep okay, eat pretty well. I get tired after work, of course, it’s a physical job. But nothing… unusual, I don’t think. Sometimes I forget where I put my keys, but who doesn’t? I just… worry about making mistakes at work, and I thought maybe stress was making it worse. Is there a test you can do to check my memory?
DOCTOR: Medicare doesn’t cover “stress tests,” Mrs. Sugino. Look, if you’re concerned about memory loss, we can do a basic cognitive assessment. But if it's simply work-related anxiety… frankly, I think you need to manage your expectations. What medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand about the Medicare. No, I hadn’t really thought about it being a “test,” exactly. Just… to know if something was wrong. Medications… let me think. Just the usual, for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And sometimes ibuprofen, if my back is bothering me. That’s it. Nothing else, I promise. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I prefer a good cup of tea, if that helps!
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril… And ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've always been pretty good in that regard. Even as a child, I never had problems with hay fever or anything like that. I eat everything, really. I’m Bulgarian, you know. We have a very… varied diet! Though perhaps not as much variety lately, with work keeping me so busy. But no allergies, definitely.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let's do a quick assessment. I want you to repeat three words for me, and then I’ll ask you to recall them later. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Ready when you are. Go ahead, Doctor Ruocco.
DOCTOR: Apple. Table. Penny. Now, I'm going to ask you a few other questions. What year is it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… 2025, isn’t it? Yes, 2025. August 2nd, actually. I remember because my cousin called yesterday. She's always good with dates. Now, about those words… Apple, table, penny? I’m trying to keep them in my head.
DOCTOR: Alright. And who is the current president?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… that’s a tricky one. I try not to pay too much attention to politics, honestly. It just… stresses me out. I believe… is it still Mr. Biden? Yes, I think it’s Mr. Biden. Though I couldn’t tell you much about his policies, I’m afraid. I’m much better with track sequences than presidents.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, tell me those three words I asked you to remember.
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Apple… table… and… oh dear, this is harder than I thought. Apple… table… and… was it… orange? No, that’s not right. It was… penny! Yes, apple, table, and penny. I think. I’m so sorry if I’m getting it wrong. It’s just… a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Fine. It's… acceptable. Look, Mrs. Sugino, your responses are… borderline. We could order some blood work to rule out any deficiencies, but frankly, it sounds like you’re just overworked and stressed. I recommend you take some time off, get some rest, and perhaps consider… a hobby. Something other than worrying about track sequences. .
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Well, alright then. If you think that's best, Doctor Ruocco. Blood work is fine, if it will rule things out. A hobby… I suppose I could try that. It’s just… I enjoy my work, you know? It keeps me busy. But I understand. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And for checking me over. I’ll schedule the blood work with the receptionist on my way out.
