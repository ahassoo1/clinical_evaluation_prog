DOCTOR: “Good morning, Clarke. Welcome. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They’re really red and…well, they hurt. Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: “Okay, bumps on your shins that are red and painful. I see. And when you say ‘a little while,’ can you give me a rough idea – a few days, a few weeks, longer than that?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Maybe…a couple of months now? It started small, just a little itchy patch, and then slowly got bigger and more painful. I didn't think much of it at first, figured it was just a bug bite or something, but it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: “A couple of months… alright. And has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I’ve been working pretty much the same job, moving boxes at the warehouse. Nothing different there. And…well, my wife and I haven’t been traveling or anything. Just the usual routine, you know? I can’t think of anything that would cause this, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Okay, no changes in routine. That’s helpful. Now, are the bumps just on your shins, or have you noticed them anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: Just my shins, Doctor. Both of them, pretty much the same. Not on my arms, not on my back… just these two shins. They’re… kinda ugly, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: “I understand. Let’s take a look, then. Would you mind if I examined your legs?
PATIENT: No, no, go ahead, Doctor. Please do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: “Okay… I’m seeing some redness and these raised areas, and they do seem tender to the touch. I’m also noticing some slight discoloration around them. Do you have any diabetes, or any issues with circulation in your legs?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, Doctor, not that I know of. Never been told that. And my circulation… well, I walk a lot at work, so I figured it was okay. Sometimes my feet get a little tired at the end of the day, but nothing bad, really. My wife always says my legs feel cold, though. She always asks me to wear thicker socks.
DOCTOR: “Alright, good to know. And has this affected your ability to walk or do your usual activities at work, Clarke?
PATIENT: Not really affected, Doctor, but it's uncomfortable. When I’m walking a lot, it kind of aches. And sometimes, if I lean on them too much, it gets pretty sore. I just try to avoid putting too much weight on them. Nothing stopping me from working, though. I can still do my job. It's just… a nuisance, you know?
DOCTOR: “I understand. It sounds like it’s definitely impacting your comfort. Okay, let’s talk about some possibilities. Given what you’ve told me, and what I’m seeing, it could be a few things. One possibility is stasis dermatitis – sometimes happens with circulation issues, even if you aren’t formally diagnosed with diabetes. Another could be a form of vasculitis, which is inflammation of the blood vessels. We'll need to do some tests to be sure. Would you be okay with me drawing some blood to check your blood sugar and some inflammatory markers?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Yeah, okay. That sounds… reasonable. If it helps figure out what’s going on, then sure. I don’t really like needles, but… if it's necessary, then I guess I can handle it. What kind of markers are you looking for? Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “It’s understandable to be a little worried, Clarke. We’re just gathering information at this point, and blood tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. We'll be looking at things like your blood glucose, your ESR and CRP – those are indicators of inflammation. And a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. It's not necessarily serious, but it's important to rule things out. I’ll send you to the lab just down the hall. They’ll need a small sample of your blood. It shouldn’t take too long. While we’re waiting for those results, let’s talk about some things you can do at home to help with the discomfort. Keeping your legs elevated when you rest and wearing compression socks could make a difference.”
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… okay. Elevated and compression socks. I can try that. My wife will be happy to hear that, she's always telling me to take better care of my legs! So, just go down the hall to the lab, then? Do I need to…fast or anything before the blood draw? I had breakfast a couple of hours ago.
DOCTOR: “That’s right, just down the hall. And yes, because we’re checking your blood sugar, it’s best if you haven’t eaten anything for at least eight hours beforehand. Since you had breakfast a couple of hours ago, you'll likely need to fast until after the blood draw, and then you can have a light snack. I'll write a note for the lab to let them know. Let me just get that written up for you, and then we can discuss some other things, like what to watch out for in the meantime.” “Here you are. Just take this with you.”
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. Eight hours… that'll be a long wait until dinner! But… it's okay, I can manage. What should I be watching out for in the meantime? Like, if things get worse… or something?
DOCTOR: “That’s right, it might be a little while. Good on you for being willing to do that. And that’s a very good question. If you notice any fever, chills, or increasing pain or redness around your legs – especially if it spreads rapidly – go to the emergency room immediately. Also, if you develop any blisters, sores, or open wounds on your legs, or if you notice any changes in the color or temperature of your skin, please come back right away or go to the ER. Also, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your feet or ankles, that would be something to seek immediate medical attention for as well. Basically, anything that seems significantly different or is rapidly worsening is a reason to be checked out. We're going to get these tests done and figure out what’s going on, but it’s always better to be cautious. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I think I got that. Fever, chills, spreading redness, blisters… and anything that feels really fast. And shortness of breath… okay. My wife can drive me to the emergency room if I need to go. She worries a lot, she'll be glad to know I have a list of things to watch for. Is there anything else I should be doing besides the elevating and socks? Like, any creams or ointments I can use?
DOCTOR: “That’s good that you have a plan. And yes, while we wait for the results, you can apply a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer to your legs a couple of times a day to keep the skin hydrated. Avoid anything with strong perfumes or dyes. Some people find that a cool compress can also help with the pain and inflammation, but that’s really just to provide some temporary relief. We don’t want to put anything on there that could potentially mask symptoms or interfere with the tests. Once we know what we’re dealing with, we can talk about more specific treatments. Do you have any allergies to any medications or creams that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I haven’t used any creams on my legs in ages, so… pretty sure I’m good there. I’m mostly just worried about…well, you know. About something serious. But I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little better. So, I guess I'll head down to the lab now? <
DOCTOR: “That’s good to hear. And you're very welcome, Clarke. It’s perfectly understandable to be worried, but we’re going to get to the bottom of this. Yes, go ahead and head down to the lab. They should be expecting you. Just let them know I sent you. After the blood draw, you can come back, and we can talk about what to expect while we wait for the results. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I will also have the nurse check in with you tomorrow to see how you're doing.” “You take care.”
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor. I will. And thank you to the nurse too, for checking in.
DOCTOR: “You're very welcome. Have a good day, Clarke, and we'll talk soon.”
