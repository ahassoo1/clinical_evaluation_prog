DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. McNabb, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Nicoletta McNabb. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor Ruocco. Though I must say, it feels a bit strange coming to the doctor when I’m not sick, exactly. More…tired of feeling old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Tired of feeling old… yes, well, that’s what people come to see me about sometimes. Though, frankly, it's rarely a medical problem. So, what exactly brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, my daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. She says I haven’t been myself lately. And she’s probably right. I just…lack the oomph, you know? Everything feels like a bit of a struggle. I used to garden all day, bake for the church… now, just getting out of the chair feels like work. I’m hoping you can give me a little…jumpstart, like I said. A reset, perhaps? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: “Oomph,” right. And how long has this…lack of oomph been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It didn't happen overnight, that’s for sure. But I’d say… maybe the last six months or so? It’s gradually gotten worse. At first, I thought it was just the weather, you know? We had a particularly damp spring. But it hasn’t improved with the sunshine. I find myself napping more, and I’m just…not enjoying things as much. Baking feels like a chore now, and the garden is mostly weeds. It's a bit sad, really.
DOCTOR: Six months. And are there any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my appetite isn’t what it used to be. Not that I’m not eating, just…not as much. And I’ve been a little more forgetful, I suppose. Nothing major, just…misplacing things more often. My glasses, mostly. And sometimes I have trouble remembering the names of people I know I should remember. It's embarrassing, to be honest. But nothing that keeps me up at night, you understand?
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness at your age?
PATIENT: Oh, now, Doctor. Don't you think that’s a bit rude? It happens to everyone, doesn’t it? And I’m not that old! Eighty-seven years is a long time, yes, but I still feel quite capable most days. I just want to feel…better. And I’d appreciate a little kindness while we’re figuring that out. Perhaps it’s just a vitamin deficiency? My daughter suggested that.
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. Let’s get this over with. Any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, back in… oh, goodness, I think it was 1978? And I had a bit of a heart flutter a few years back, but they put me on a little pill for that. I take it every day. Here, let me show you. It’s a little white one. And I've always had high blood pressure, but it’s usually well-controlled with medication as well. My regular doctor, Doctor Alvarez, handles all of that. He’s wonderful, you know. But I thought… well, he's a bit rushed, and I thought maybe you could just give me a fresh perspective.
DOCTOR: Metoprolol and…amlodipine. Standard. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No allergies. Never had any trouble with food or medications, not a one. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Though I do avoid shellfish, just because I never particularly liked the taste. But that’s not an allergy, just a preference. Is that important?
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to…confirm everything is as expected. Blood pressure, heart, lungs… routine.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds fine. As long as it won’t take too long. I have a bridge game this afternoon, you see. It's nothing serious, but I promised Millie I’d be there. She gets quite upset if I’m late. Do you need me to stand on the scale? Or… what’s first?
DOCTOR: Yes, please step on the scale. And then we’ll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart. Don't make this difficult.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, if you insist. I suppose it’s all part of the process. I haven't weighed myself in ages, to be honest. I try not to dwell on numbers these days. It’s better for my peace of mind.
DOCTOR: 149 pounds. Height is 199 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. I’m a tall Chamorro woman, you know. It runs in the family. My grandmother was nearly six feet tall! Is that a problem? Do tall people have different…ailments? I’ve never thought about it. I just always been…long.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140 over 85. Elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs clear to auscultation. Now, open your mouth… let me take a look. Tongue looks normal. No obvious issues. Alright. So, you're not actively sick. Just… old.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… not very encouraging, Doctor. I came here hoping for a little help, a little guidance. Not… a dismissal. Is that all you have to say? Just… old? I feel like I’ve wasted my time. Perhaps I should have stayed home and baked a cake. At least then I’d have something to show for my efforts.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. McNabb, at your age, some fatigue is expected. We can run some blood tests – vitamin D, B12, thyroid – just to rule out deficiencies. But frankly, I doubt we’ll find anything significant. I recommend staying active, eating a healthy diet, and… managing your expectations. I’ll write a referral for a senior wellness program. Perhaps they can offer some… emotional support. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Emotional support? Doctor Ruocco, I have plenty of emotional support. I have a loving daughter, a wonderful community, and a lifetime of memories. What I wanted was a medical professional to listen to my concerns and offer a solution, not a lecture about aging and a referral for…comfort. I think I’ll get a second opinion. And I certainly won’t be recommending your clinic to my friends. Good day.
