DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… my ear. It feels… full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? Not painful, just… stuffy. Honestly, I can’t really say when it started. Things haven’t been… clear lately, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Not clear”?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… memory’s not what it used to be. It’s just… a general fuzziness. But the ear… the ear’s been bothering me for a bit now, I think. Longer than a week, probably. It’s hard to say exactly. I just want it gone, really. This feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a feeling of fullness in your ear… and some difficulty with your memory. Let’s start with the ear. Is there any pain at all?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. More like… pressure? Like when you go up high in an airplane, you know? Just… stuck. And sometimes it feels a little… echoey, if I talk too loud. It’s mostly just annoying, to be honest. I'd rather not dwell on it if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: “Dwelling” on it is important, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Ignoring things doesn't make them disappear. Now, have you noticed any ringing in your ear?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe? It’s not constant, if that makes sense. Sort of a… faint hum sometimes. I usually just put the TV on louder and don’t think about it. Is that… bad? Honestly, I barely notice it. I really don’t know. It comes and goes. Sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: It’s… good that you’re telling me, even if it’s not precise. Okay. And have you had any trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: Balance…? Well, I'm not exactly a gymnast, you know? I’m a bit clumsy, always have been. But… no, not really trouble with my balance. I haven't fallen or anything. I just… try not to rush around too much. Old age, probably. Is that what you're asking about?
DOCTOR: Let’s not attribute everything to “old age” just yet, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Now, have you experienced any dizziness, or a spinning sensation?
PATIENT: Spinning… No, not really. Maybe a little lightheaded sometimes when I stand up too fast, but I always figured that was just… low blood sugar. I try to eat regularly. I’m not sure that’s what you mean though. I’ve never felt like the room was spinning or anything like that. It’s hard to explain. This is all a bit much, honestly. I just want my ear to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your ear, then. I'm going to use an otoscope. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Uh… not that I know of. I don’t take much, honestly. Just some vitamins. And… I think I had penicillin as a kid, but that was ages ago. I don’t remember having a reaction to anything. My wife… she always handled all the medicine stuff. I’m sorry. It’s… a blur. Can we just get this over with? I have some things I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax, and tell me if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Hmm… Yes, I see some cerumen buildup in both ears. And the tympanic membrane… appears slightly dull. It's not dramatically impacted, but it could certainly be contributing to the fullness you're feeling.
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… not very pleasant. It feels like pressure. Dull, you say? Is that… bad? Look, I'm not a doctor, you know. Just tell me what needs doing. I trust your judgement. Can we get it fixed quickly? I really do need to get going.
DOCTOR: It’s not bad, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It’s just… not ideal. The dullness suggests some fluid behind the eardrum, which could be related to the cerumen buildup, or… something else. I’m going to recommend we irrigate your ears to remove the wax. It’s a simple procedure. I’ll use warm water. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Do you have any tubes in your ears?
PATIENT: Tubes? No. No tubes. Never had tubes. What are tubes? My wife… she would have told me if I had tubes. I really don’t think I’ve ever had tubes. I don’t even know what you’d do with tubes in my ears. Is this a common thing? I'm getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Don’t worry. Tubes are something we sometimes put in children’s ears to help drain fluid. You don't have them, so we're fine. Okay, I'm going to start now. This might feel a little cool, and it might make you a little dizzy. Just let me know if it's uncomfortable. I’m going to use this bulb syringe to gently flush out your ear canal.
PATIENT: Oh! That is cold! And… wobbly. Yes, very wobbly. Slow down, please. It feels… strange. Like bubbles. Is this normal? I think I feel a little… sick. Just… just get it over with quickly. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. It’s almost done. Just try to relax. You’re feeling a little dizzy because the water is moving things around in your inner ear. It should subside once we’re finished. Okay. All done. Hmm. Much better. The tympanic membranes look clearer now. Still a little dull, but improved. I still suspect there might be some fluid behind the eardrum.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s better, actually. Less pressure. Still a bit echoey, but… better. Fluid, you say? What does that mean? Is it serious? I really don’t want to be stuck in a hospital or anything. I have… things to do. Can you just give me something for it? Some drops, maybe? To clear up the fluid? Please.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, Mr. Guerrerolopez, but it does mean we need to investigate further. Fluid could be caused by a simple cold, or… something else. I’m going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops to rule out an infection. However, if the fluid doesn’t clear up within a week, or if your symptoms worsen, I want you to see an ENT specialist. They’ll be able to do a more thorough evaluation. Here’s the prescription. Take the drops as directed. And please, try to get some rest. I also suggest avoiding getting water in your ears for the next few days. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: ENT specialist…? Oh. More doctors. Wonderful. No, I think… I think that’s all. Just… just the drops, then. I’ll… I’ll try to rest. And avoid water. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate it. Now, if you'll excuse me… I have things to do. My wife… she always handled all this. It's just… hard, you know? .
