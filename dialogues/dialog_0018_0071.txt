DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it's about getting some shots, if you will. My niece... she's trying to come here from over seas. She's got all her papers, but I think she needs some vaccinations before she can get her visa. I'm a bit confused about what exactly is needed, and I thought you could tell me what’s required. I’m helping her with everything, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. That’s very thoughtful of you to assist your niece. It can be quite confusing navigating the vaccination requirements for visa purposes. To ensure I provide the most accurate information, could you tell me where she is traveling from specifically, and what the purpose of her visit is – is she coming for a short stay, to study, or something else?
PATIENT: She's coming from...let me see... Poland. Yes, Poland. And she wants to come live here, permanently. She's got a sponsor, her husband, he's already here. It's a family visa, I believe. It's all very new to me, this whole process. She’s sent me a lot of paperwork, but I’m just an old librarian, not a lawyer!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Skarbek. It is a complex process, and you are right to seek guidance. A family-based immigration visa will have specific vaccination requirements set by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS. Before we proceed, and to be certain, do you have access to the official paperwork from USCIS outlining the required vaccinations?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It’s in my bag… just a moment. Here it is. It says…Form I-693, Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record. Does that sound right? I tried to read through it, but some of the medical terms… well, they went right over my head.
DOCTOR: Yes, Form I-693 is precisely the correct form. It outlines the required vaccinations for an immigration physical. Alright, it appears she'll need proof of vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella, varicella , tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, influenza, and hepatitis B. It also notes a screening for tuberculosis is required. Do you happen to know if she has had any of these vaccinations previously?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot. She mentioned getting some shots as a child, when she was little in Poland, but I don’t know specifics. I doubt she has records, truthfully. It was a long time ago, and things were…different there then, if you understand. I don't think she’s had any since she moved away. Would we need to start all over, then? Are there ways to find out what she already had?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Skarbek. Records from that time can be difficult to obtain. We will need to proceed as if she hasn't had these vaccinations, to be on the safe side, unless we can reliably verify her previous immunizations. We can discuss obtaining any available records from Poland, though it may be a lengthy process. In the meantime, we can begin the vaccination series here. She would need a two-dose MMR , a Tdap booster, a varicella vaccine , an influenza vaccine , and a hepatitis B vaccine series . Before we start, do you know of any medical conditions she has, or any allergies she may have?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. She's a very healthy woman, strong as an ox, she is. And no major medical problems, thankfully. Just… she sometimes gets a little dizzy, if she stands up too quickly. But that’s been happening for years, and she says it’s just her blood pressure. She doesn't take any medication for it, though. She's a bit stubborn, that one! Does that dizziness change things? Do we need to tell anyone about that?
DOCTOR: It's good to know she's generally healthy, Mr. Skarbek. The occasional dizziness when standing up, while likely benign, is worth noting. We should check her blood pressure today, and I would recommend she consult with a physician to evaluate it properly, especially given the planned vaccinations. While not an absolute contraindication, we want to ensure her blood pressure is well-controlled before proceeding, and to rule out any underlying causes of the dizziness. I'll document this in her record. We will proceed with the vaccinations today, but I will provide a referral for a blood pressure check as well. Now, before we begin, have you or your niece ever received a TB test before?
PATIENT: I don't believe so, no. Not that I recall, anyway. She's never lived in a crowded place, or been around anyone with... with sickness, if that makes a difference. She was a schoolteacher, always around children, but mostly healthy ones. Would we need to do a test of some sort? Is that the tuberculosis you mentioned?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I was referring to – a tuberculosis test. It’s a standard requirement for the immigration physical, regardless of her previous environment. The test helps determine if she has been exposed to tuberculosis bacteria. There are two types of tests we can perform: a skin test, also known as the PPD test, or a blood test. The skin test involves a small injection under the skin, and requires a follow-up visit in 2-3 days to read the results. The blood test can be done in a single visit, but may take a bit longer for the results to come back. Do you have a preference?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Another visit... and waiting... I suppose the blood test would be easier, if it means one less trip to the doctor. She doesn't travel well, you see. Gets very anxious. If that's alright with you, Doctor, that would be much appreciated.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. We can absolutely proceed with the blood test. It’s often more convenient, and minimizes the need for repeat visits. We will draw a sample of her blood today and send it to the lab. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. While we are waiting for those results, we can start the vaccination series. The first vaccine we'll administer today is the influenza vaccine, as it is currently the flu season. It will help protect her from the influenza virus. Do you have any questions about the vaccine itself?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. She gets a flu shot every year, usually at the pharmacy. So she's familiar with it. As long as it doesn't cause any bad reactions, that's fine. I just want her to be healthy and safe, you see. It's been a long journey for her to get here, and I want everything to go smoothly. Alright, let's do it. The flu shot first, then, if you think that's best.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Skarbek. The influenza vaccine is a good starting point. We will administer it now, and then discuss the other vaccinations in more detail. Nurse, could you please prepare the influenza vaccine for Mr. Skarbek’s niece?
