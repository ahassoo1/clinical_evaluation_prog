DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about these patches on my skin. They just…appeared, really. And frankly, they’re quite unsightly. I’ve never had anything like this before, and I assure you, my family has excellent skin.
DOCTOR: “Excellent skin,” you say. Alright. And when did you first notice these patches appearing?
PATIENT: Oh, it was…let me think. It must have been sometime in late June, I suppose. It was right after we returned from visiting my husband’s aunt in…well, it doesn’t matter where it was. It's a very…rustic place, honestly. Not the sort of establishment one usually frequents. But yes, June. Definitely June. Perhaps the beginning of June? It's hard to pinpoint exactly, you understand. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Rustic, right. And where on your body are these patches located, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly on my arms, Doctor. And a few on my…décolletage. It's not pleasant to discuss, truly. They’re rather noticeable if one is wearing…well, anything sleeveless. And I prefer nice things, naturally. Not that I'm vain, you understand. It's simply a matter of standards.
DOCTOR: Arms and décolletage…and are they itchy, painful, or causing any other symptoms besides being “unsightly”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, not painful! That would be dreadful. Itchy, sometimes, very faintly. But mostly just…there. A blemish on an otherwise perfect complexion, really. It's the appearance that bothers me. It simply won't do. I have a garden party next month, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything already to treat them?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I did try that lotion my friend recommended. Lavender, I think. It smelled lovely, but made absolutely no difference. Honestly, I suspect her skincare routine is rather…unsophisticated. I also considered a bit of lemon juice – my grandmother always swore by it – but I didn't want to risk irritating the skin further. One must be cautious, you see.
DOCTOR: Caution is wise. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Oh, nothing significant. I get a bit of a sniffle around certain lilies, if I'm close enough, but that's hardly an allergy. And I can't tolerate anything with artificial sweeteners - they give me the most dreadful headaches. Beyond that? No, I’m quite robust, really. My constitution is excellent.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, just a daily multivitamin. And a little something for my digestion – nothing that would interact with anything, I assure you. It’s a very gentle formula. I wouldn't dream of taking anything…harsh. My doctor – a perfectly lovely man, though he's retired now – always said moderation is key.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at these patches. If you don't mind. Could you please roll up your sleeves and… perhaps adjust your top slightly so I can see the ones on your décolletage?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I do hope this won't be too…undignified. But very well. Here. I trust you'll be quick.
DOCTOR: Hmm. They’re slightly raised, irregularly shaped, and appear to be…scaling. No significant redness or inflammation. Are these patches getting bigger, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Oh, I believe they are. Not dramatically, of course. It's very gradual. But if I look at old photographs – I keep rather meticulous records, you see – I can definitely see a difference. They weren’t quite as noticeable last month. It's very unsettling, really. One expects one’s skin to improve with age, not…deteriorate.
DOCTOR: Alright. And to be thorough, have you noticed any similar patches anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it...there is a very faint one on the back of my calf. Almost unnoticeable, really. I only spotted it when I was moisturizing yesterday. It's much smaller than the others, and rather pale. It hardly seems worth mentioning, honestly. I’m not one to fuss over every little imperfection, but I do like to be complete in my descriptions.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any skin conditions before, such as eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I have remarkably healthy skin, as I've mentioned. Never had anything like that. I've always been very diligent about sun protection, and I use only the finest skincare products, naturally. My mother always said, “A good complexion is a woman’s greatest asset.” And she was quite right.
DOCTOR: And what about any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I had the flu, I suppose, about ten years ago. A rather unpleasant affair. And I broke my wrist skiing in Switzerland once, but that was mostly just a nuisance. Nothing serious, really. I’ve always been blessed with excellent health. It's a family trait, you see. We’re a very robust line.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, about your family history. Do you have any relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had any skin problems, or any autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh, autoimmune diseases? Goodness no. My family is remarkably healthy. My mother was a picture of vitality until her passing, and my father still enjoys a daily brisk walk at the age of ninety! As for skin problems…well, my great aunt Beatrice had rather a lot of freckles, if that counts. But freckles aren’t a problem, are they? Just a bit of character. She was a rather eccentric woman, to be honest.
DOCTOR: And finally, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. I maintain a very active social calendar, naturally. And I garden, though I usually hire someone to do the heavy lifting. I enjoy fine dining and attending the opera. I try to stay abreast of current events, though I confess, the news is rather depressing these days. And I ensure I get at least eight hours of sleep each night - it's simply essential for maintaining one’s complexion. I wouldn’t say I exercise, exactly, but I do enjoy a leisurely stroll through the rose garden.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. Based on what you've told me, and the appearance of these patches, it could be a number of things. The gradual onset, scaling, and location… it’s possible it’s pityriasis rosea, though it’s not typical for someone your age to develop it. It could also be a mild form of eczema, though you haven't had it before. Or, and I need to be upfront about this, it could be an early sign of something else entirely, though I don't want to alarm you. To be certain, I’d like to order a skin scraping to rule out any fungal infection, and a biopsy just to have a definitive diagnosis. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A biopsy?! Oh, Doctor, that sounds… rather invasive. And fungal infection?! I assure you, I maintain impeccable hygiene! Are you certain it’s necessary? I mean, couldn't we just try a stronger cream? Perhaps something with cortisone? I really would prefer to avoid any…procedures, if possible. It all sounds terribly unpleasant, and frankly, a bit alarming. I’m quite sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Bartock. A biopsy is a very small procedure – we numb the area beforehand, and it usually causes minimal discomfort. It's the most reliable way to determine the exact cause of these patches, and knowing the cause is essential for proper treatment. Trying a stronger cream without a diagnosis could potentially worsen the condition, or mask the symptoms and delay proper care. I strongly recommend the biopsy. However, if you're truly opposed to it, we can try a mild topical steroid for two weeks and see if there's any improvement. But please understand that without a diagnosis, we’re essentially treating symptoms, not the underlying problem. If it doesn’t improve, or worsens, we'll have to revisit the possibility of a biopsy. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… two weeks isn't so long, I suppose. And a mild steroid… that doesn't sound too dreadful. Very well. But if it causes any redness, or irritation, or… anything unsightly, I’m stopping immediately. And I expect you to be very clear about how to apply it. I don’t want to overdo it. And if it doesn't improve, I’ll be expecting a full explanation of why, and what the biopsy will entail. Everything in detail, you understand. I dislike surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will write you a prescription for a mild topical corticosteroid – clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream – to be applied thinly to the affected areas twice daily for two weeks. Please ensure the skin is clean and dry before application. Avoid applying it to your face unless specifically instructed, and do not use it for longer than two weeks without consulting me. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your progress. If you experience any redness, irritation, burning, or worsening of the symptoms, please contact the office immediately. And I’ll be happy to explain the biopsy procedure in more detail should it become necessary. It involves a small skin sample taken with a local anesthetic. It is very well tolerated by most patients. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor. Just… please make a note in my chart that I'm sensitive. And that I dislike surprises. And that I prefer a gentle approach. Very well. I suppose we’ll see how the cream works. Thank you, Doctor. I trust your staff will be able to explain the billing process? I find medical paperwork rather confusing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I will add those notes to your chart. And yes, our billing staff will be happy to assist you with any questions you have regarding your bill. They can be reached at 555-123-4567. If you have any further concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Bartock.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. And… please do be careful with the diagnosis. I’m a rather anxious patient, you see. .
