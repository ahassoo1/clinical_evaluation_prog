DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I don't really do small talk, but... my mother, she’s been having some issues. Heart, mostly. And her mother… well, it wasn’t good. I just want to make sure I'm okay, you know? Preventative stuff. I don’t want to end up like them. It’s probably nothing, but… better safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Mr. Theriot. It’s always best to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart issues. So, let’s focus on you for now. When you say “issues,” can you be a bit more specific about what your mother has been experiencing?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, I don’t keep up with all the details. She complains a lot. Shortness of breath, mostly. And fatigue. She gets winded just walking up the stairs. And there was something about… irregular heartbeat? I think. Look, she goes to the doctor, I just worry. I'm here to make sure I don’t have the same problems. Are you going to run a bunch of tests? I have a meeting later.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your mother is under medical care, which is good. And you're right to be concerned about your own health given the family history. We’ll definitely assess your risk factors and determine if any testing is needed. To start, let’s go through your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or any other heart conditions?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’m fairly active, actually. I teach engineering, you know, a lot of moving around, building things. And I eat… reasonably well. Not a lot of fast food. Look, I’m not some unhealthy couch potato. I keep myself in shape. So, I doubt I have any of those problems. But fine, ask your questions. Though I really don't see what this is going to accomplish.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Theriot. Being active and eating well are fantastic foundations for good health. However, family history does increase your risk, even with a healthy lifestyle. And symptoms can sometimes be subtle at first. Let’s just cover all the bases. Have you ever experienced any chest pain, palpitations – that’s a fluttering or racing heartbeat – or dizziness?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Look, I told you, I’m fine. I'm probably wasting your time. My ex-wife always said I was a hypochondriac. She was… dramatic. But seriously, I feel perfectly healthy. Is this going to involve a blood draw? Because I really don't have time for a long appointment. And needles… aren’t my favorite.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and needles, Mr. Theriot. We’ll try to keep this as efficient as possible. Right now, I'm just gathering information. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Do I look like the type? I teach college students, for heaven's sake. I have a reputation to maintain. And frankly, I find those things… beneath me. It’s a waste of time and money. Look, I exercise reasonable judgment in all aspects of my life. I'm a professional. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your overall condition. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. And please, don’t poke me too much. I have a meeting with the department head later, and I need to look presentable. Is this going to be a long process? I really can't afford to be here all day.
DOCTOR: It won’t be long, Mr. Theriot. Just a standard check-up. If you could please have a seat on the table, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 128 over 80. That's within the normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulse is 72 and regular. Good. Everything sounds and feels normal so far, Mr. Theriot. However, given your family history, I do recommend an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An… EKG? Is that the one with the sticky things? Look, I really didn’t want to do any tests. I came here for reassurance, not a whole battery of procedures. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, you said everything sounds fine. Can’t you just… tell me I’m okay and send me on my way? This is becoming a huge inconvenience. I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Theriot. However, an EKG is a quick, painless, and non-invasive test that can detect subtle abnormalities that wouldn't be apparent during a physical exam. It's a preventative measure, especially with your mother's and grandmother's history. It would give us a more complete picture of your heart health and allow me to provide you with more informed reassurance. It takes about five minutes. Would you reconsider?
PATIENT: Five minutes, you say? And just sticky things? Fine. But if it delays my meeting, you're getting a strongly worded email. And I expect a full explanation of everything afterwards, in language a normal person can understand. No medical jargon. And honestly, I shouldn't even have to be doing this. It's ridiculous. But fine, let's get it over with. Just hurry up.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Theriot. Five minutes, just a few sticky patches. And I promise a clear, jargon-free explanation afterwards. I'll get the technician in here right away. Just to reiterate, we're doing this as a precautionary measure given your family history. It's better to be safe than sorry. The technician will explain everything during the procedure, but it involves placing electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart's electrical activity.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… make sure they're gentle with the sticky things. My skin is sensitive. And honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. This is all very… undignified. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Or can I just… lie down? This is a waste of my valuable time. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Theriot, you can just lie down. No preparation is necessary. The technician will clean the areas where they'll place the electrodes. They'll explain everything as they go, and it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Just relax, and we’ll get it done quickly. I'll be right outside if you need anything. .
