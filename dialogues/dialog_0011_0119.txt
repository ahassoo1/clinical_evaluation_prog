DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... well, it's rather embarrassing, to be frank. I don’t usually complain about these things, you understand. But it's... a discharge. A penile discharge, as the receptionist put it. My nephew’s, actually. He’s… indisposed at the moment. He insisted I come, said I should “get it checked out.” Honestly, the young people these days… no sense of propriety.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. It's perfectly alright; these things can be difficult to discuss. And you are doing the right thing by seeking medical attention for your nephew. We will do our best to provide him with the appropriate care. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Well, it's… not pleasant. It’s yellowish, I suppose you’d say. And… somewhat thick. He noticed it a few days ago, after… well, after a visit with a… companion. He’s not the most forthcoming young man, naturally. Keeps everything very close to the vest. I tried to get him to explain how long, exactly, but he just mumbled something about “a week or so.” He’s also been… agitated. A bit more irritable than usual, which is saying something.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Wartick. A yellowish, somewhat thick discharge for approximately a week, accompanied by increased irritability. That helps. Has he experienced any pain or burning during urination?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, I believe he did complain of a bit of a stinging sensation. Not constant, mind you, but when he… well, when he uses the facilities. He didn’t make a fuss, naturally, but I overheard him. He does have a rather high pain tolerance, I must say. Always throwing himself into things without a thought for his own safety. Very typical.
DOCTOR: Alright, stinging sensation during urination as well. Has he noticed any other symptoms – any fever, chills, lower abdominal pain, or swelling in the groin area?
PATIENT: Hmm… no fever, I don’t believe so. He’s been a bit… lethargic, perhaps. Sleeping more than usual. But he's always been a bit of a layabout, to be honest. As for swelling… I didn't notice anything when I… examined him. Though, frankly, I'm not particularly qualified to examine anything. I just… made sure everything looked alright, you understand.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of this with me, Ms. Wartick. It sounds like he's experiencing a combination of symptoms that warrant further investigation. Given the discharge, stinging during urination, and the reported lethargy, it's important to rule out a possible sexually transmitted infection. Would you mind if I ask a few questions about his sexual history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Sexual history? Doctor, really. I hardly think that’s appropriate. I mean, I'm his aunt. This is all very… indelicate. I suppose… I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. But I doubt he'll be very forthcoming, even with me. He's a very private young man, you see. And I certainly won’t be detailing my nephew's… activities.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Ms. Wartick. And I assure you, my intention is not to pry or cause any embarrassment. However, understanding the context of the situation is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment. I only need a general idea – for example, whether he has had multiple partners recently, or if he consistently uses protection. If he’s uncomfortable sharing specifics, even a simple “yes” or “no” to those questions would be helpful. We can also proceed with testing without a detailed history, but it may take longer to arrive at a diagnosis. What do you think would be most comfortable for both of you?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose I can ask him. He does have a habit of… flitting from one acquaintance to another. Young people these days have no long-term commitment, you know. As for “protection”… I wouldn’t dare ask. Honestly. It’s simply too… vulgar. I’ll tell you what. I’ll ask him if he’s had… recent acquaintances, and leave it at that. And perhaps… perhaps you can just proceed with the testing? It’s really the least embarrassing course of action.
DOCTOR: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Ms. Wartick. Thank you for being willing to ask about recent acquaintances. We can certainly proceed with testing. To start, I'd like to perform a physical exam to visually assess the area and collect a sample of the discharge for laboratory analysis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh dear. Well, I suppose it’s necessary. But I’m not sure I'm qualified to… assist. He's a bit… sensitive, you know. And I wouldn't want to make things worse. Perhaps you can just… explain it to him? Gently? He doesn't respond well to direct questioning. And please, be discreet. This is a very delicate matter.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. I will explain everything to your nephew directly and ensure the exam is conducted with the utmost sensitivity and discretion. I'll need to examine the area and collect a urine sample as well. It will only take a few minutes. If you’ll excuse me, I’ll go speak with him now. I'll be right back to let you know when we're ready.
