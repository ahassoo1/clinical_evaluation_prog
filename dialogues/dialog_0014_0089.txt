DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Osterholm, is it? Yes, well. It’s… the pain. It comes and goes, you see. Mostly in my lower abdomen. It’s been rather bothersome, and I… I believe it’s connected to my… condition. The one they told me about years ago. Systemic… something or other. Lupus, I think? It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest. It flares up sometimes, and this pain feels… similar. Though perhaps worse this time.
DOCTOR: Lupus, yes. It’s… common for symptoms to wax and wane, as you say. Though it’s unusual to have pain solely in the lower abdomen with lupus. Most of the time it's joint pain, fatigue… things like that. But we’ll see. How long exactly has this pain been going on this time?
PATIENT: Oh dear… well, trying to pinpoint it is difficult. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. But I’d say… a couple of weeks, perhaps? It started gradually, just a little discomfort. Then it built up. It's not constant, it comes in waves. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and others… well, others it’s quite debilitating. I had to take a day off work last week because of it. Is that… helpful information? I apologize for being so vague. I really do try to remember things…
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks. And it interferes with work, you say. Alright. And can you describe the pain specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specifics… That’s always the hardest part. It’s… a cramping sensation, I suppose. Like a very strong, persistent ache. It’s not a sharp, stabbing pain, thankfully. More of a dull, throbbing discomfort that spreads across my lower belly. Sometimes it feels like… pressure, almost as if something is pressing down. And occasionally… I feel a bit nauseous with it, though I haven’t actually been sick. Does that make any sense? I’m afraid I’m not very good at explaining these things. I wish I had a better way to describe it!
DOCTOR: Cramping, dull ache, pressure... nausea. Alright. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. Let me think… Nothing seems to reliably make it better, I’m afraid. I've tried warm baths, which usually soothe aches, but it hasn’t made much difference this time. Lying down sometimes helps, a little. As for what makes it worse… I believe it’s aggravated by movement. Walking around, bending over… anything that puts strain on my abdomen. And… I seem to have noticed it's worse after I eat. Not a specific food, just… eating in general. It feels… bloated and uncomfortable afterward. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Worse with eating… That's… concerning. And I see here in your chart you haven't had a recent pelvic exam or abdominal imaging. Alright, Ms. Glymph, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just to rule a few things out. We'll start with your abdomen, then a brief pelvic exam, if you're comfortable with that. It’s standard procedure, given your symptoms and history. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: Oh, well, no objections at all, Doctor. If it's standard procedure, then I trust your judgment entirely. I haven’t had any… tests like that in quite some time, so I suppose it’s a good idea. I just… I do get a bit anxious during examinations, if I’m being honest. But I understand it’s necessary. Please, do whatever you think is best. And please, don't hesitate to explain anything you’re doing beforehand, if you wouldn't mind. That would put me at ease.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. I’ll explain everything as I go. Please lie back on the examination table. We'll start with your abdomen. I'm going to gently press on different areas to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay. There's some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, as you described. No noticeable masses, but it's difficult to assess fully. It doesn’t seem… acute, but we need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds. Bowel sounds are present, though a bit sluggish. Alright. Now, for the pelvic exam. I'll need you to bend your knees and relax your muscles as much as possible. I’ll be using a speculum to visualize your cervix, and I’ll be palpating your uterus and ovaries. Again, just let me know if anything is uncomfortable. It may feel a bit… intrusive, but it’s important. ...Okay. Cervix appears normal. Uterus is normal size and shape. Ovaries… I detect some mild tenderness on the left ovary, but no masses. It’s difficult to say for certain without further testing. Alright. That concludes the physical exam. It’s not conclusive, but it gives us a starting point. We need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. You were very thorough, and your explanations did make me feel much more comfortable. I appreciate your patience. Mild tenderness… on the left ovary, you said? That… doesn't sound good, does it? What sort of… other possibilities are you thinking of? I understand you need to investigate, of course. I just… I worry about what it could be. Is it something serious? Perhaps a flare-up of the lupus? Or something… different? I truly apologize for being so anxious. I just get flustered easily.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Glymph, your anxiety is understandable. Lupus could be contributing to this, certainly, but it's important to rule out other causes, especially given the tenderness on the left ovary and sluggish bowel sounds. We need to consider things like ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, even something as simple as constipation, though I don’t suspect that’s the primary issue. I'm going to order a complete blood count to check for inflammation and infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a urine analysis to rule out a urinary tract infection. I’m also ordering a pelvic ultrasound to get a better look at your uterus and ovaries. And finally, a stool sample to assess your gut health. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. I'd also like to discuss a referral to a gastroenterologist. While lupus can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, it’s best to have a specialist rule out any other underlying issues. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… very thorough, Doctor. A lot of tests, but I suppose that’s what’s necessary. A gastroenterologist, yes, that sounds sensible. I trust your judgment completely. So, a blood test, urine sample, stool sample… and an ultrasound. Are these things I can do here at the clinic? Or do I need to go somewhere else? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a bit of a busy schedule, so I need to plan accordingly. I truly apologize for asking so many questions. I just want to understand everything that’s happening. And… are these tests expensive? I do have insurance, thankfully, but… I worry about the costs.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Glymph, you can have all of those tests done here at the clinic. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work, urine sample, and stool sample. The lab is just down the hall. And I’ll schedule the ultrasound for you—let’s say… Thursday morning at 9 AM?
PATIENT: Thursday morning… yes, that works perfectly. 9 AM is ideal. Thank you, Doctor. And the results…? Will they be sent to me, or do I need to schedule another appointment? And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any particular foods I should avoid? Or any activities I should limit? I know you said rest, but… I do try to stay active, you see. I just want to know if there’s anything I can do to… alleviate the symptoms while we wait for the results. Perhaps some over-the-counter medication? I truly apologize for being such a bother.
DOCTOR: The results will be sent to me, and I’ll contact you as soon as I have them—within a week, most likely. As for the meantime… given the sluggish bowel sounds and potential tenderness, I recommend a low-fiber diet for the next few days. Avoid things like whole grains, raw fruits and vegetables, and beans. Stick to easily digestible foods like white rice, toast, and cooked vegetables. As for medication… over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the pain, but do not exceed the recommended dosage. And if the pain becomes severe, or if you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. And, yes, continue to rest, and avoid strenuous activity. I understand you try to stay active, but it’s best to err on the side of caution for now. Now, are there any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. A low-fiber diet… yes, I can manage that. And I’ll be careful with the pain medication, and I’ll certainly go to the emergency room if things worsen. No, I believe that’s all for now. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience with me. I truly apologize for being such a… complicated patient. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you see. It’s unsettling not knowing what’s happening. But… you’ve given me a lot to think about, and I feel… a little bit better now, just knowing that you’re taking it seriously. Thank you again, Doctor Osterholm. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get the lab requisitions at the front desk. We'll be in touch. .
