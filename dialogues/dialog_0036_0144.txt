DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Bacy, was it? Honestly, I'm not entirely sure why I'm here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Said I should "get checked out." Something about keeping up with things, I think. I feel fine, mostly. Just… old, I suppose. Is that something you fix?
DOCTOR: It’s wonderful of your daughter to be so proactive about your health. And no, we don’t “fix” getting older, unfortunately! But we do want to make sure everything is working as well as it can be, and address anything that might be causing you concern, even if it’s just a little thing. So, “keeping up with things” sounds like a general check-up. That’s perfectly fine. To start, can you tell me a bit about how you’ve been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally… hmm. Well, I get tired, naturally. But everyone gets tired, don’t they? I used to be able to work all day on my feet, you know, surgical tech is exhausting, but that was… a long time ago. My knees ache sometimes, especially when it’s damp. And I forget things. Terrible with names now. Though, I remembered your name, didn't I? Is this like a quiz? Because I’m not good at quizzes.
DOCTOR: You remembered my name perfectly, Ms. Calvery. No quiz, I promise! It's very helpful to know what's changed for you, so knowing what you used to be able to do is good information. You mentioned fatigue, knee pain, and some memory concerns. Let’s try to unpack those a little bit. When you say tired, is it a new tiredness, or something you've lived with for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely… newer. I mean, I was always tired after a double shift at the hospital, but this is different. It’s like… a weight. Even after a good night’s sleep – well, as good as I sleep these days – I just feel… heavy. And it doesn't go away with resting. It's just… there. Does that make sense? I feel like I’m explaining it badly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Calvery. A constant “weight” even after rest is definitely something we want to explore. And you're doing a wonderful job explaining it. Can you tell me a little more about your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep. Well, I go to bed at a reasonable hour, I suppose. Around ten or eleven. But I don’t stay asleep. I wake up a lot. Sometimes just to use the bathroom, other times… I don't know. Just… awake. And then I lie there. Thinking. Worrying. It's not… restful. My husband used to fall asleep right away. Always a sound sleeper. I miss that.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Calvery. Frequent awakenings can certainly disrupt your sleep and leave you feeling unrefreshed. We'll definitely look into that. Let's move on to those knees for a moment. You said they ache more when it's damp. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. It’s worst in the morning, definitely. And like I said, when it rains. It’s a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, thank goodness. It just… makes it hard to get around sometimes. I used to love gardening, but I haven't been able to do much of that lately. Bending over is… difficult. I try to take it easy, but… a person needs something to do, doesn't she?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Keeping active is important. A dull ache that’s worse in the morning and with damp weather… that gives us some clues. Now, you mentioned some memory concerns. Can you describe what you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is the embarrassing part, isn’t it? It’s not like… forgetting who people are, usually. It's more… words. The right words just… slip away. And names, definitely names. I'll be talking to someone, and their name is right on the tip of my tongue, and then… gone. And sometimes I'll go into a room and forget why I went there in the first place. It's frustrating. And it’s not like I didn't have a good memory before. My daughter says I repeat myself, too. But I don’t mean to. I'm probably just rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Ms. Calvery. This is all very helpful information. Difficulty finding words, forgetting names, and repeating yourself… these are all things we can explore. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… I think I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. Nothing major, really. Oh! And arthritis, of course. They told me years ago, that's why my knees ache. But other than that… not much. I’ve always been a healthy person. Or, I used to be. I take a medication for high blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. My daughter handles most of my prescriptions, so I don’t always remember the names.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, a history of pneumonia, and arthritis. And a medication for high blood pressure. Do you happen to know the name of the blood pressure medication, or perhaps the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh dear. You’re asking a lot of a forgetful old woman, aren’t you? Let me think… It’s a small, white pill, like I said. And… it has letters on it. I think it starts with an "A"? Or maybe a "B"? I really don’t know. I honestly leave all of that to my daughter. She keeps track of everything. She’s a good girl, my daughter. Very organized. I’m quite the opposite.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s very common to have trouble remembering medication names. Let me just check your electronic medical record here… Ah, here we are. It looks like you’re currently taking Amlodipine 5mg daily for high blood pressure. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Amlodipine… Yes! That sounds right. Amlodipine. See? My daughter’s pills have labels. I just… don't always look at the labels. You’re a lifesaver, Doctor. Honestly, I’d probably be taking the wrong pills if she didn’t keep everything straight. Is that a lot of medicine? For someone my age?
DOCTOR: Amlodipine is a very common medication for high blood pressure, and 5mg is a standard dosage. It’s good that you’re taking it as prescribed, and it’s not necessarily a “lot” of medication. It’s important to manage conditions like high blood pressure to prevent other health problems. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not to food, I don’t think. I eat pretty much anything. And… I don’t recall having any bad reactions to medications in the past. I had a rash once, when I was a little girl, but my mother said it was just poison ivy. I am a little sensitive to the cold, though. Gets my nose all stuffed up. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication or food allergies. A sensitivity to the cold is common, but not usually considered a true allergy. Now, I’d like to ask a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s a complicated question. My mother lived to be 92, so she was pretty healthy, I suppose. But she had… arthritis, like me. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. He died when I was young, so I don’t remember much about it. And my sister… she had diabetes, later in life. There was a cousin, on my husband’s side, who had cancer, but that’s about all I can think of right now. Everyone dies of something, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: That's true, Ms. Calvery. A history of arthritis, heart problems, and diabetes in your family is good to know. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink since my husband passed away. He liked a little wine with dinner, but I never cared for it much. And… recreational drugs? Oh, no. I was a surgical tech, Doctor. We didn’t have time for all of that. I used to be very active, but… I don’t get out much anymore. Mostly just stay home and watch TV. My daughter comes over a few times a week, which is nice. It gets lonely sometimes.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve led a very full life, Ms. Calvery, and it’s wonderful that you have your daughter’s support. Alright, let’s move on to a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. I haven't had a proper check-up in… well, I can’t even remember the last time. Just hope I don't have to take my shoes off. My feet aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: No worries, Ms. Calvery. You don’t have to take your shoes off unless I specifically ask. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then I'll take a look at your knees. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your pulse is a little fast, 88 beats per minute, but that could be due to anxiety. Blood pressure is 142 over 85, which is a little elevated. Your ears look clear. Throat looks a little dry, but otherwise normal. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees. Here we go… There we are. Not very graceful, am I? They crack a lot. And they feel… warm. And a little stiff. Is that bad? I used to be able to squat down without any trouble, but now… it's just not the same. It's just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: There is some crepitus, which is that cracking sound you mentioned – common with arthritis. You have some mild swelling and tenderness on both knees, particularly on the inner side. Your range of motion is slightly limited, but you’re able to bend and straighten them. Based on what you’ve told me and what I've found during the exam, it seems like your knee pain is consistent with osteoarthritis, which is the wear and tear of the cartilage in your knees. It’s a common condition, especially as we age. Now, do you have any other concerns, anything else you want to discuss today?
PATIENT: Oh, osteoarthritis… Well, that doesn't sound very pleasant. Is there anything I can do about it? I don't want to be stuck in a chair for the rest of my life. My memory… it's still bothering me. It's not like I forget who people are, but… it's just frustrating. And I worry… what if it gets worse? Is there anything I can do to keep my mind sharp? I read somewhere that doing puzzles helps, but I can never seem to finish them.
DOCTOR: There are absolutely things we can do about both your knee pain and your memory concerns, Ms. Calvery. For your knees, we can start with some conservative measures, such as physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knees, weight management if needed, and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. We can also discuss the possibility of knee injections if those don't provide enough relief. As for your memory, it's good that you're proactive about it. Puzzles are good, and so are other mentally stimulating activities like reading, learning a new skill, or socializing. We can also do some cognitive screening tests today to get a baseline and see if further evaluation is needed. Given your age and reported symptoms, it’s also important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to memory loss, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I’m going to order some bloodwork to check those things. Would you like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss these things in more detail and start a treatment plan?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… a lot. But good. Good to have a plan. Bloodwork… all right. Physical therapy… I haven’t done that in years. Cognitive screening… is that like a test for my brain? A follow-up appointment, yes. That would be good. Just… not too soon, please. I need a little time to… process everything. And maybe find a good physical therapist. Do you have any recommendations? And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a little better, just knowing I’m not alone in all of this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Calvery. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed, and you’re absolutely not alone. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Yes, the cognitive screening is a simple test to assess your memory and thinking skills. It doesn’t take long, and it will give us a baseline to monitor any changes over time. As for physical therapy, I have a list of excellent therapists in the area. Here’s a handout with their names and contact information. I recommend calling a few and seeing who is a good fit for you. I’m going to order the bloodwork now. The lab is right across the street. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results and start a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor. And patient. My daughter would be so relieved to hear all of this. She worries about me constantly. Thank you again. For everything. I think that’s all. I’ll see you in two weeks. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Calvery. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. .
