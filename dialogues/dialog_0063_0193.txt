DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Goodstein. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Jules. It is very nice to meet you. Well, it is… a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I am having… too much gas. Yes, flatulence. It is… a problem. It happens often, and… it smells very bad. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: Flatulence, you say. Yes, well. It's…common. Though, frankly, patients often exaggerate. Now, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it started, I believe, about three months ago. Maybe a little longer. It was not so bad at first, just… normal. But then, it got worse. It is now… almost constant. I try to be polite, you understand, but it is… difficult. Do you need a more exact date? I can try to remember.
DOCTOR: No, no. "About three months" is sufficient. Though, pinpointing the start date rarely changes anything. Now, can you describe when this gas occurs?
PATIENT: Ah, when it happens… well. It seems to happen after I eat, mostly. Any food, really. But it is worse with… cabbage. And beans. Also, sometimes when I am nervous, it gets… worse. But even when I am calm, it happens. It is… a consistent problem. I do not understand why.
DOCTOR: So, exacerbated by certain foods… and stress. Are you experiencing any abdominal pain along with this gas?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. Not bad pain, you understand. More… uncomfortable. Like a fullness. And… bloating. It is mostly in the lower part of my stomach. It comes and goes, with the gas. It does not keep me up at night, but it is… annoying. And after I eat, it feels… heavy. Do you need me to be more specific?
DOCTOR: "Heavy"... Right. And are you noticing any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes in… how I go to the bathroom? Yes, actually. It is… more often. And… softer. Not diarrhea, you understand. But… looser than usual. I go maybe two or three times a day now. Before, it was… one time, usually. Is that important? It happens around the same time as the gas, mostly.
DOCTOR: More frequent, looser stools… Yes, that is relevant. Are you experiencing any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, not that I have noticed. If anything, maybe I have gained a little. I do enjoy a good pastry, you understand. And I do not exercise much. I am… quite steady in weight. I believe I am the same as always, maybe a pound or two. Nothing significant.
DOCTOR: Pastries… very well. Now, tell me about your diet in general. Be precise. What specifically do you eat on a typical day?
PATIENT: Ah, my diet… It is… not very healthy, I admit. For breakfast, I usually have a coffee and a… sweet roll, from the bakery near my work. Lunch is often a sandwich – ham and cheese, mostly – and some chips. And sometimes I have a soda. Dinner… depends. Sometimes I cook – pasta, usually – but often I get something from the fast food place where I work. Burgers, mostly. And… fries. I also like chocolate. Is this too much information? I try to eat, you understand, but I do not always make good choices.
DOCTOR: "Not always good choices." Indeed. Do you have any allergies, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have eaten many different foods in my life, and I have never had a reaction. Not that I know of. I can eat shellfish, nuts, dairy… everything, really. My mother always said I had a strong stomach, though perhaps that was not a good thing. Is there a specific allergy you are worried about?
DOCTOR: No, just routine. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. Just… sometimes an aspirin, if I have a headache. But that is very rare. I prefer to suffer, you understand. I do not like taking pills. I have Medicare, but I try to avoid using it unless it is absolutely necessary. It is better to be healthy on my own, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll excuse me, I'm going to need to do a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you wish. I hope it is not too… unpleasant. I am a little nervous, you understand. Is there anything I need to do before I lie down?
DOCTOR: Just lie flat and try to relax. I'll need you to loosen your trousers slightly, for better access. And please, try not to… anticipate. Normal bowel sounds… a bit… active, perhaps. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Tell me if anything is painful. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not yet. It feels… strange, but not painful. A little uncomfortable, perhaps, but I am used to… fullness. Oh… yes. There. That is… a little tender. Not sharp pain, you understand. But… uncomfortable. It feels… bloated, like a bubble. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the lower abdomen… suggestive. I'm going to need to check your reflexes. Please bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the table. Normal reflexes. Given your symptoms - the excessive gas, bloating, changes in bowel habits, and tenderness - it's likely you're experiencing Irritable Bowel Syndrome, exacerbated by your diet. It is… common.
PATIENT: Irritable Bowel Syndrome? Is that… serious, Doctor? Will I need… tests? Will I need to change my life completely? I enjoy my pastries, you understand. And I do not like… discomfort. Is there something I can do? A pill, perhaps?
DOCTOR: “Serious” is a relative term, Mr. Goodstein. It’s… manageable. Tests are rarely necessary unless your symptoms worsen or you develop other concerning signs. And yes, some lifestyle changes are advisable. The pastries… need to be reduced. Significantly. A pill may help with the symptoms, but it won't address the underlying cause. I can prescribe an antispasmodic to help with the bloating and cramping. But honestly, the most effective treatment is dietary modification: reduce processed foods, increase fiber intake, and limit your sugar consumption. I will write you a prescription for hyoscyamine, 0.125mg, three times daily as needed. And I recommend a low-FODMAP diet. Here. This handout details the low-FODMAP diet. And this is your prescription. Follow these instructions, and schedule a follow-up appointment in one month. If your symptoms don't improve, or worsen, we’ll discuss further options. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A low… what diet? It looks… complicated. And hyoscyamine… is that… safe? I do not like taking pills, you understand. But I suppose if it helps… Thank you, Doctor. I will try my best. But I do not promise I can give up my pastries completely. One month… Is that a long time? Will the symptoms… go away?
DOCTOR: The low-FODMAP diet restricts certain carbohydrates that can cause gas and bloating. It is restrictive, I admit, but it’s a starting point. Hyoscyamine is generally safe, but it can cause side effects like dry mouth and blurred vision. And as for your symptoms… it's impossible to say definitively. Dietary changes may alleviate them. But lifestyle modification takes time and commitment. One month is a reasonable period to assess your response. If you adhere to the diet and the symptoms persist, we can discuss other options. But frankly, Mr. Goodstein, you need to take responsibility for your own health. Do you have any further questions, or shall we conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that is all. I understand. It sounds… difficult. But I will try. Thank you for your time, and for the… prescription. I suppose I should go now? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Goodstein. That will be all. And please, attempt to follow the recommendations. Good day. .
