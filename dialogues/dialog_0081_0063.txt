DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I am Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my back. It’s been really hurting. Bad. Like, worse than usual. I already told the lady at the front desk, but I wanted to tell you how bad it is.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you mentioned back pain to the receptionist. "Worse than usual" is…vague, I’m afraid. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Vague? Okay, okay. Um… well, I had cancer, a long time ago. They took a lot out, and it hurt then, of course. But this… this is different. It's not just sore, you know? It feels… sharp. Like someone is sticking needles in me, but inside. And it goes all the way down my leg now, too. Not always, but a lot. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Sharp" and "needles"… alright. And this is a new development, the pain radiating down your leg?
PATIENT: Yeah, new. It started maybe… a week ago? It comes and goes, but when it comes… oof. It makes it hard to even walk sometimes. And sleeping is… forget about sleeping. I’m trying to take the pills the other doctor gave me, but they aren’t helping much anymore. They used to, a little.
DOCTOR: I see here Dr. Chen prescribed you… gabapentin, 300mg three times daily. And you're finding that's less effective now?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's the one. Gab… gab-a-pen-tin. Hard to say. I take them like he said, three times a day. But it's like… the pain just ignores them now. It’s not even a dull ache anymore. It’s really bad, Doctor. I'm worried it means… you know… the cancer is back?
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Ms. Meigs. While recurrence is always a possibility, there are many other reasons for back pain, even with your history. Now, you mentioned surgery previously related to the cancer – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Okay, okay, don't jump. You're right. It’s just… scary. The surgery… it was a long time ago, maybe ten years? They took out a lot from my stomach. And then they had to do more, a little bit later, 'cause it spread to… other places. They cut me open a lot. I remember that part, mostly the pain afterward. And then they did… radiation, too. A lot of it. It was rough. Does that help? I can tell you dates if you need, I remember things pretty good.
DOCTOR: Yes, dates would be helpful if you can recall them. But for now, let’s focus on the present. You said the pain is in your back… is it localized to one spot, or does it spread out?
PATIENT: It's... mostly in the middle of my back, right across where the scar is. But it feels like it's going all around, you know? It’s hard to explain. And when the pain goes down my leg, it’s just one leg. My left one. It starts in my butt, then down the back of my thigh, sometimes all the way to my foot. It doesn't always go that far, though. Sometimes it's just my butt and thigh. And it feels... different than just a muscle ache. Like, tingly and burning. Does that make any sense? I'm bad at explaining.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tingly, burning, radiating down one leg… This does sound like it could be involving a nerve. I'm going to need to perform a physical exam to get a better understanding of what we're dealing with. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just... be gentle, okay? I bruise easy, and my skin still feels funny from the radiation, kind of numb in places. I don't want to make it worse. But yeah, go ahead. I'll try to tell you exactly what it feels like. I remember things pretty good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And you're right to mention the numbness. I'll be as careful as possible. First, I’m going to palpate your spine, feeling for tenderness or any abnormalities. Please let me know immediately if anything causes you pain. Then I'll check your reflexes and muscle strength in your legs. Lie back for me, please. Can you tell me on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, what your pain level is right now?
PATIENT: Okay, lying back. It's… maybe a six right now? It’s not the worst it's been, but it's definitely there. And when you touch it… oof. Yeah, right there. That spot feels really tender. And… it kind of shoots a pain down my leg when you press on it. Not all the way, just a little bit. Be careful with that spot, Doctor. It's really sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm noting that tenderness with palpation at T10, with radicular pain down the left leg. And can you feel this?
PATIENT: Feel what? What are you doing now? It feels… different. Like… poking. Is that normal? Is this going to make it worse? I’m getting a little scared now, Doctor. I didn't feel this poking with the other doctors. It's not painful, exactly, but it's… weird. I feel like you're touching something I shouldn't feel.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Meigs. I’m assessing for nerve impingement, and I was attempting to elicit a response indicating irritation. It appears I may have been too aggressive. We can stop immediately if you prefer. It is not necessary to continue if it is causing you discomfort or anxiety. I should have explained more thoroughly before proceeding. Would you like me to explain what I am doing and why, before I continue?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain. I don't like being poked if I don't know why. It scares me when things happen and nobody tells me what's going on. It makes me think something's really wrong. So… tell me. What are you looking for? And what’s “nerve impingement”? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Nerve impingement means a nerve is being compressed or irritated, often by surrounding tissues – bone, muscle, or cartilage. In your case, given your history of cancer and surgery, it’s possible scar tissue or changes to your vertebrae are putting pressure on a nerve. The "poking" I was doing – it’s a neurological exam, assessing your reflexes and sensation to see if the nerve function is normal. If the nerve is compressed, it can cause pain, weakness, numbness, or tingling – the symptoms you've described. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… scar tissue. That makes sense. I have lots of scar tissue. And I do get numbness. And tingling. So you're trying to see if the nerve is… squished? Is that what you mean? And if it is squished, can you fix it? Is there something you can do about it? I just… I don't want to be in pain all the time. It's really hard to live like this.
DOCTOR: Precisely. You're articulating it perfectly. I'm attempting to determine if a nerve is compressed. And whether something can be done depends on the cause and severity of the compression. Options range from physical therapy and pain management to, in some cases, surgical intervention to relieve the pressure. However, we need further imaging to get a clearer picture. I'm going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. Will that be alright?
PATIENT: MRI… okay. I had one of those before, a long time ago. It's loud, isn’t it? And I have to lie really still. That’s hard for me. But… if it will help, okay. Yes, order the MRI. Just… tell me when, and where, and how long it will take. And if I need to do anything special beforehand. Like, can I eat? I always worry about that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m ordering an MRI of the lumbar spine, with and without contrast. The order will be sent to Suburban Imaging, which is located at 123 Main Street, just off the highway. They've assured me their equipment is updated and the technicians are experienced. You can eat and drink normally before the scan – there are no dietary restrictions. The scan itself will take approximately 45 minutes, and you will need to lie very still, as you mentioned. They recommend arriving 15 minutes early to complete paperwork. I’ll have the receptionist schedule an appointment for you, ideally within the next few days. While we await the results, I’m prescribing you a course of meloxicam, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, to help manage your pain. It’s a lower dose than what you’ve been on, but it may provide some relief. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay, meloxicam. That sounds… okay. Lower dose is good, I don’t want to feel too sick. 123 Main Street… I think I know where that is. And 45 minutes… I can lie still for 45 minutes. Hopefully. Just… will they tell me the results right away? Or will I have to come back? I hate waiting. Waiting makes me nervous. And I’m already nervous enough.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, the radiologist will need to interpret the images, which takes some time. They will send the results to me, and then I will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It typically takes 24-48 hours to receive the report. I understand your anxiety about waiting, Ms. Meigs, and I apologize for that. However, it’s crucial to have an accurate interpretation to determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if your pain becomes unmanageable or you experience any new symptoms – weakness, numbness, bowel or bladder problems – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Weakness… numbness… bowel or bladder problems… okay. I’ll watch for those. I don't think so. No, I think that’s everything. You explained everything really good, Doctor. Thank you. I’ll wait for the receptionist to call about the MRI. And I’ll try not to worry too much. But… it’s hard. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Meigs. And I understand your apprehension. We will do our best to get to the bottom of this and develop a plan to manage your pain. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care.
