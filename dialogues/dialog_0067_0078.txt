DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pfennig. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I’m hoping for… a bit of a fresh start, really. I feel like I need a “reset” or a “jumpstart” to my health, if that makes sense. I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Pitzel. A lot of people feel that way sometimes. We can definitely work towards a “reset” together. When you say you haven’t been feeling quite yourself, can you tell me a little more about how you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s… hard to pinpoint. It’s not one specific thing, you see. Just… less energy, I suppose. And a little more… forgetful than usual, maybe? Though, at my age… who isn’t? It’s just… everything feels a little dimmer, if that makes sense. Not sad, exactly. Just… less vibrant.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Dimmer” is a good way to describe it. Less energy and some increased forgetfulness… We can explore both of those. Let's start with the energy. How long have you been feeling this lower energy level?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's tricky. It hasn’t been sudden, you see. More… gradual. Perhaps six months, maybe? It started slowly, and I just… adjusted, I suppose. Told myself I was busier, working harder on my… well, on the castings. But it hasn’t really gotten better. It’s just… continued. It’s affecting things now, though. I have to admit that. I find myself needing more rest after a long day, and even then, I don't feel fully recovered.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of gradually decreasing energy levels, impacting your daily life now… And you mentioned "castings," is that related to work?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am a molder, shaper, and caster – except metal and plastic. Mostly ceramics, figurines, things like that. It requires a lot of… focus, and a steady hand. And it's quite physical, too, even though people don't always think so. All the kneading and shaping... It's satisfying work, but lately… it’s been a little harder to get through a full day in the studio.
DOCTOR: That sounds like demanding work, physically and mentally. So, focusing for long periods, combined with physical exertion… Okay. Now, you also mentioned increased forgetfulness. Can you give me some examples of what you’ve been forgetting?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly little things, really. I used to be very organized. I always knew where my tools were, had my orders straight in my head… Now, I misplace things constantly. I’ll start a casting and forget what glaze I was going to use. Or I’ll promise my husband I’ll do something, and it completely slips my mind. Nothing major... yet. It just feels… unsettling, you know? Like my brain isn’t working as smoothly as it should be.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those seemingly small things can definitely be unsettling. And it's good that you're noticing them. We'll want to explore this further. Before we dive deeper, let’s get a bit of background information. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I've been quite healthy, all my life, really. I’m on Medicare, of course, as I’m 45, but that’s mostly for routine check-ups. I haven’t had any serious illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. I do take a multivitamin, just to be safe. My husband insists, you see. He's very health-conscious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No major medical history, just a multivitamin. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, I’ve never had a reaction to any medication… and truthfully, I don’t take much, so I haven’t much experience with it! I haven’t needed to, thankfully. My husband is the one with the medicine cabinet full of things! He’s always a little worried about something.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, and just a multivitamin. Do you have any family history of medical conditions – anything like heart disease, diabetes, memory problems, or anything else that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she had some trouble with her memory towards the end, but we didn’t really… talk about it much. It was just… age, we assumed. My father was very healthy, lived to be 85. No heart problems, no diabetes… He was a farmer, very active. My husband’s side… his mother had high blood pressure, I believe. Nothing too serious. It's hard to say, really. We weren't a family that talked a lot about health problems. It was more… “tough it out,” you see?
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s quite common, unfortunately. Alright, so some potential family history of memory issues and high blood pressure. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. My husband and I both live very clean lives, you see. No smoking, very little alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And absolutely no recreational drugs. We wouldn't dream of it. We enjoy a good walk in the countryside, tending our garden… simple pleasures, really. That's how we stay healthy. Or, at least, used to, before… well, before I started feeling so dim.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s excellent. Very healthy lifestyle habits. Just a glass of wine occasionally. Alright, Ms. Pitzel, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment – just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. I just… I want to feel like myself again, you see? So, please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm… Good. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and do a few simple memory tests. Just follow my instructions as best you can. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm… let me think… it's August… August 2nd, 2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I’m fairly certain of that. It’s my husband’s cousin’s birthday, you see. I just remembered that this morning. Though… it took a moment.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s correct. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words… alright. Please, go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, pencil. Please remember those. I’m going to ask you about them later. Now, let's move on to some simple cognitive tests. Can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Counting backwards by sevens… that sounds… complicated. Let me try… 100… 93… 86… um… 79… Oh, goodness. I’m already losing track. This is… harder than it looks. I’m very good with numbers normally. I manage the accounts for my casting business, you see. But this… this is throwing me off. Let me stop there before I make a mistake. It feels… foggy, somehow.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Pitzel. It is a challenging test. No need to apologize. Now, let's try a different assessment. Can you tell me the names of three things that you ate for breakfast this morning?
PATIENT: Oh, breakfast… let me think. Hmm… this morning I had… toast. And… coffee, of course. And… a small piece of fruit. An orange, I believe. Yes, toast, coffee, and an orange. It was a simple breakfast, you see. Nothing fancy. I wasn't very hungry this morning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let me ask you to recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier – apple, table, pencil.
PATIENT: Oh dear… apple… um… table… and… hmm. This is… embarrassing. I feel like they were just on the tip of my tongue… pencil? No, that’s not right. I’m so sorry, Doctor. I had them just a moment ago, I swear! I’m usually very good with memory. It’s just… gone. It’s like a fog. Apple… something with a table… and a writing tool… Oh, goodness. I’m so frustrated with myself!
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Pitzel. Don't be frustrated. Memory tests can be tricky, and it sounds like you're experiencing some difficulties with recall. Okay, based on the physical exam and these assessments, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you're having some trouble with short-term memory and concentration. It’s a bit too early to jump to any conclusions, but it’s definitely worth investigating further. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No… I suppose I don't know what to ask, exactly. I just… what does it mean, Doctor? Am I… losing my mind? Is that what’s happening? I need to keep working, you see. My castings… they’re important to me. And I need to be able to remember things! I feel… frightened, truthfully. Is there anything you can do to help me? Or is this just… getting old?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Pitzel, and it's completely understandable that you're frightened. Let me assure you, "losing your mind" is very unlikely. What you’re describing could be a number of things, and it's far too early to make any definitive diagnosis. Many factors can affect memory and concentration, including stress, vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, thyroid issues, and even mild cognitive impairment, which is often related to aging, but not necessarily debilitating. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. We'll check your thyroid levels, vitamin B12 and D levels, and do a complete blood count to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'd also like to order a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Additionally, I think it would be helpful to get a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. I’m going to refer you to Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist specializing in memory disorders. He can conduct a thorough evaluation and help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… very reasonable. Blood tests, a neurologist… yes. Anything to find out what’s happening. I just want to feel like myself again. And to be able to remember things! The thought of… not being able to work… it’s frightening. Will the blood tests take long? And… how long will it take to get an appointment with Dr. Ramirez? Is he… good?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. I completely agree, getting to the bottom of this is the priority. The blood tests are relatively quick – just a standard draw, and it should only take about 10-15 minutes. The results typically come back within 3-5 business days. As for Dr. Ramirez, he's an excellent neurologist – highly recommended in the area, very thorough and compassionate. Getting an appointment can sometimes take a little time – let me see… It looks like the next available appointment is on August 16th. That’s two weeks from today. I'll go ahead and schedule that for you, and the office will contact you to confirm. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a few things you can do at home. First, try to maintain a regular sleep schedule – aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Second, stay hydrated – drink plenty of water throughout the day. Third, engage in mentally stimulating activities – puzzles, reading, or anything else that challenges your brain. And finally, try to manage stress – deep breathing exercises, meditation, or spending time in nature can be helpful. I’m also going to write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, along with the orders for the blood tests. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. That sounds… manageable. Blood tests, Dr. Ramirez on August 16th, sleep, water, puzzles… I can do that. Thank you. You’ve made me feel… much better, just knowing that there’s something we can do. And that it might not be… as bad as I feared. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. And writing me everything down. I do tend to forget things, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. We'll take things one step at a time. Remember, we’re here to help you every step of the way. Here are your referral and lab orders. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll review the results when they come back and discuss the next steps at that time. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much.
