DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. Been getting fevers, on and off. Happens now and then, mostly in the evenings. It’s been going on for…oh, maybe a month, give or take a week. It's a bother, really. I just want to get it figured out so I can get back to things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. A month of fevers, mostly evenings… I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about these fevers?
PATIENT: Well, they don’t get too high, you know? Not like I need to be rushed to the hospital high. But enough to feel pretty crummy. Chills, mostly. And tired. Real tired. Like I got no energy. It usually breaks with a sweat, then I’m just…weak for a bit. I can still do things, but I don’t want to, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Clide. And good you're able to describe it like that. Let's try to get a clearer picture. When the fever starts, do you notice anything that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a good question. Honestly, not really. It just…happens. No specific food, no certain activity. Sometimes it’s after being out in the sun, but not always. I've been tryin' to think about it, but I can’t seem to find a pattern. It’s random, as far as I can tell. Makes it hard to plan anything, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with the randomness of it all. Let's move on to other symptoms. Have you noticed any other things happening around the time you get these fevers?
PATIENT: Let me think... Sometimes my joints ache a bit, my knees mostly. Not all the time, just when I’m really feeling the fever coming on. And…oh, yeah. I’ve been a little more thirsty than usual. Gotta drink a lot of water, that’s for sure. No cough, no sniffles, no nothin' like that. Just the aches and the thirst, along with the chills and tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, joint aches in the knees and increased thirst alongside the fevers, chills, and tiredness. Thanks for telling me that, Clide. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite’s been…okay. Not much change there. Maybe a little less hungry, but I usually eat a good breakfast and dinner. As for…well, you know. Bowels? Everything’s been pretty regular, if you want to put it that way. No trouble there at all. I haven’t noticed anything different, thankfully. Old man problems, you know? Gotta keep things movin', ha!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Clide. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with gettin' old, ha! I had my share of bumps and bruises workin' as a chiropractor, but nothin’ serious. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin' like that. My wife keeps tellin’ me I should see a doctor more often, but I usually just tough it out. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I've had the usual shots, though. Flu, tetanus…you know the drill.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, just typical age-related aches and pains and up-to-date on standard vaccinations. And you were a chiropractor – that’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife. Always prided myself on bein’ able to fix things without resortin' to that. A few broken bones when I was younger, but they healed up just fine on their own. Nothing major. I’ve always been careful, you know? I gotta take care of my hands, that's my livelihood. That’s why I never went for surgery. Didn’t want to risk messin’ things up.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family - are there any medical conditions that run in your family that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a tough one. My mother, she had high blood pressure towards the end of her life. And my father, he had some trouble with his knees, arthritis, I think. On my wife's side…her brother had something with his heart, I believe. But beyond that, nothin’ really stands out. A lot of us just lived long lives, you know? Good genes, I guess. It's hard to keep track of things after a while, too. People forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of high blood pressure, arthritis, and heart trouble in the family. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, not a drop. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. My wife doesn’t approve of it, and frankly, neither do I. Alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but that's about it. And drugs? Absolutely not. Never been interested. Always been a pretty straight-laced fella. Gotta stay healthy, you know? Can’t be treatin’ patients if I’m…well, you know. My hands gotta be steady.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drug use. That’s good. And, finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin'. My wife always makes sure to check when I need to take somethin', just in case. But I've never had an allergic reaction, thankfully. I've taken a few different things over the years for aches and pains, but never had a problem. She’s got a good memory, my wife does. Better than mine, that's for sure. I trust her judgement completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Clide. That gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and feel your joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, go ahead. Get it over with. I got things to do, you know? But do what you gotta do, Doctor. Just try to be quick about it, if you could. I appreciate you listenin’ to me, though. I just want to figure out what's goin' on so I can get back to normal. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. I will be as efficient as possible. First, let’s take your temperature. Okay, slightly elevated temperature. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some slight wheezing. Your knees are a bit tender and swollen. And a little bit of warmth to the touch. I'll also feel your lymph nodes. No swelling in your lymph nodes. Alright. Just a few more quick checks.
PATIENT: Wheezing, huh? I hadn't even noticed. Maybe that's why I've been feelin' a little short of breath sometimes. I figured it was just gettin' old. The knees, well, that’s been goin’ on for a while. Workin’ on people all day, it takes a toll, you know? Still, I didn’t think it was anything serious. What do you think it is, Doctor? You got an idea? I'm ready to hear the bad news, if there is any. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. Given your slightly elevated temperature, the wheezing in your lungs, joint tenderness, and the history of intermittent fevers, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be a viral infection, like the flu, even though you don't have a cough. It could also be an early sign of pneumonia, although your lungs don't sound too congested right now. Another possibility, considering the joint pain, is a musculoskeletal condition, possibly arthritis, but the fever makes that less likely as the sole cause. To be safe, I want to order a few tests. A complete blood count to check for infection, a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia, and a basic metabolic panel to look at your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Well, I figured somethin' like that was comin'. I guess I don't mind. I just want to know what's goin' on. So, blood work, X-ray…anything else? And where do I go to get these done? I got appointments to keep, you know. I'm tryin' to run a business here. I'm not insured, so how much is this gonna cost me? Just gotta know what I'm lookin' at, price-wise. Let’s just get this done so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. Just the blood work and the chest X-ray for now. I'll write you a referral to the lab and the imaging center here in town. They'll both send the results directly to me. As for the cost, I understand your concern about being uninsured. The blood work will likely be around $75-$150, and the chest X-ray, around $100-$200. These are estimates, of course, and costs can vary. I can also check if there are any assistance programs available in the area to help cover the costs. I'll have my nurse, Maria, give you a list of local resources, and she can also help you explore payment options. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the fever and joint pain. And if you develop any new symptoms, like a cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please call the office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, $250 max, maybe. I’ll take the list of resources from Maria. I gotta be careful with my money, you know? Rest, fluids, ibuprofen… I can manage that. I appreciate you writin’ down the referrals and lookin’ into the assistance programs, Doctor. Hopefully, it’s nothin' too serious. I just want to get back to normal. When can I expect to hear back from you with the results? Don’t keep me waitin’ too long, I got people relyin' on me. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Clide. I understand. I'll make sure the lab and imaging center prioritize your tests. I expect to have the results back within 24-48 hours, and I'll call you as soon as I’ve reviewed them. Maria will be in shortly with the resource list and the referrals. If you have any questions or concerns before then, don’t hesitate to call the office. Thank you for coming in today, and I’ll be in touch soon.
