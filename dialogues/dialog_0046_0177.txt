DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s… something down there. A little leak, you know? Not good. A man problem, but I don't have a man! It just… happens. It’s embarrassing, really. I don’t even know why I’m here telling you this.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is difficult to discuss these things, and you’ve done the right thing by coming in. There’s absolutely no need to be embarrassed; these issues are quite common, even without a male partner. It sounds like you’re experiencing some urinary leakage – sometimes called incontinence. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when this happens?
PATIENT: Inconti… what now? Look, I don’t do fancy words. Just… when? Oh. When I laugh, mostly. And sometimes when I carry things. Groceries, you know? Heavy bags. It’s a mess, honestly. I have to change clothes sometimes. It's not like it's a flood, but… enough. And it smells funny. Not like roses, I can tell you that much.
DOCTOR: Okay, "incontinence" just means leakage of urine. No need to worry about the fancy words! So, it sounds like this happens when you laugh or when you’re carrying something heavy – when you put some strain on your body. And you've noticed a different odor, too. Has this been happening recently, or has it been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Maybe… six months? Longer? Time just… goes. It's gotten worse lately, though. Used to be just a little drop, you know? Now it’s… more noticeable. I thought maybe it was the fish. I like fish. But I still eat it, and it still happens. I don't know why things do what they do anymore. Everything’s just falling apart. Not just… that. Everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this has been a gradual process, getting worse over the past six months. It’s good you’ve been observing it, and it’s smart to consider if something dietary might be playing a role – even though it hasn’t seemed to make a difference with the fish. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, dear. That’s a long story. I… I’ve had children, of course. Three of them. A long time ago. And I broke my hip once, falling off a ladder. Trying to get mangoes. Don’t ask. And… I think I had the flu a few times? I don’t really go to doctors much. Never have. Too expensive. And honestly, they never seem to fix anything. I mostly just… deal with it. Is this going to cost me a lot of money?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Three children, a hip fracture… and the flu. That’s helpful to know. It’s completely understandable that you haven’t been to the doctor much, especially with the cost. We'll try to be as efficient as possible with the testing and see what we can find. Before we move on, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes? High… what? No. Never. I eat a lot of rice, is that bad? My mother always said rice was good for you. She lived to be ninety-two, eating rice every day. And she didn’t take any pills. Just rice and mangoes. I don’t know… I just feel tired a lot, is that something? Maybe that’s just old age. It’s creeping up on me, you know? Everything aches.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of diabetes or high blood pressure. That's good to know. And it’s wonderful that your mother lived such a long life! It sounds like you have a good constitution. Feeling tired and achy can be a sign of many things, including just getting older, but it's good we're looking into everything. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do any of your close relatives – your parents, siblings, or children – have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family. Well, my father… he had a bad heart. Died young. Too much coconut. He loved coconut. And my sister, she had… something with her kidneys, I think. Spent a lot of time in the hospital. Not a happy life. My children… they’re all healthy, thankfully. Too busy to visit much, though. Always working. I don’t want to bother them with my… problems. It’s probably just old age. I keep telling myself that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. A father with heart problems and a sister with kidney issues. That’s helpful information. And it's understandable you don't want to burden your children. Now, a few quick questions about your daily habits. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother would kill me. And alcohol… a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a small one. Helps me relax. And it tastes good with fish. Don't tell anyone, but I think it helps with the… leak a little. Probably just in my head, though. It's probably just old age. Honestly, doctor, what is wrong with me? It's probably just old age.
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you don't smoke. And a small glass of wine with dinner is fine. It's not unusual for people to feel that something helps, even if it's just a sense of relaxation. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmmm… Not that I know of. I eat everything. Mangoes, rice, fish… I haven't ever had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but that's just the wine. And the fish. And the rice. Honestly, I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I'm just… falling apart. Is this going to take long? I have to get home and feed my chickens. They get lonely.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. We’re getting a good picture of things. I understand you need to get home to your chickens, so I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never. I don’t like pills. They make me sick. I have some… ointment for my knees, that’s all. Rub it on at night. Smells like eucalyptus. Helps a little. But that’s it. Just the ointment. And the wine. And the rice. Honestly, I just want to know if this is something serious. Is it cancer? My cousin had cancer. It was terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the eucalyptus ointment. And no, based on what you've told me, this doesn't sound like cancer. However, it’s important to investigate the cause of the leakage to make sure we can help you feel better. Now, I would like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Oh, dear. Do I have to… you know? With everything? I don’t like anyone poking around down there. It’s embarrassing. Is there any other way? Maybe just give me some pills? Or some ointment? I really don't like the thought of someone… looking. Honestly, it's probably just old age. It’s probably nothing serious. But I guess… if you have to…
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Ms. Genard. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. I will explain everything before I do it, and I will only do what is necessary to help us understand what’s going on. It will be a quick and gentle exam, and I will do my best to make you as comfortable as possible. The exam will help us rule out any infections or other obvious causes of the leakage. We may also need some simple tests, like a urine sample, to get a clearer picture. Would you like me to explain the exam in more detail, or would you prefer I start with the urine sample?
PATIENT: A urine sample… that sounds… less scary. Less poking. Yes, let’s do the urine sample first. Where do I… do it? Do I have to undress? Honestly, this is all very… undignified. I just want to go home and feed my chickens. Is it going to be a long sample? I drink a lot of water. It's good for the rice. But it means… a lot of urine. Will I have to… strain? Honestly, I just want this to be over. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with the urine sample. That’s a great first step. You don’t have to undress, just loosen your pants a bit. There’s a private bathroom right over there. I’ll give you a cup and instructions. You’ll just collect a small amount of urine in the cup, about two ounces. You don’t need to strain. A normal flow is perfectly fine. It’s okay if you drink a lot of water; that’s actually good for your kidneys. And it shouldn’t take very long at all. Once you’ve collected the sample, just bring it back to me, and we’ll go from there. I'll leave you to it, and I'll be right here when you're finished. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Okay. Two ounces. Not too much. Not too little. Two ounces… honestly, this is ridiculous. Chickens don't ask for urine samples. Two ounces… It's probably just old age. I should have just stayed home.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: There. Two ounces. Exactly. It was… a lot of effort. Honestly, I think my bladder is exhausted. Now what? Do I have to lie down? Do I have to take off my shoes? This is all very… invasive. And I still think it's just old age. You'll probably just tell me to drink less water and get more rest. Is that what you're going to say?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Genard. You did perfectly. No, you don’t need to lie down or take off your shoes. This is just a routine test to help us understand what’s going on. I'll send this sample to the lab, and it should take about 15-20 minutes to get the results. While we're waiting, perhaps we can discuss your daily habits a little more. Do you have any difficulty with constipation or bowel movements?
PATIENT: Constipation? Sometimes. Not every day. Rice can be… binding, you know? My mother always said rice was good for everything, but it does… stick. I drink a lot of water, like I said, to help with that. And I eat prunes sometimes. They're not very tasty, but they do the job. Honestly, everything feels… stuck these days. My joints, my bladder… everything. Is this going to take much longer? I have to get home and check on the chickens. They get very anxious if I'm gone too long. They're very sensitive creatures.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you’re managing the constipation well with the water and prunes. It's good you're proactive about that. Okay, the results from the lab just came back. Your urine sample shows no signs of infection, which is good news. However, your basic metabolic panel shows slightly elevated creatinine levels. This could indicate that your kidneys aren’t functioning at 100% capacity. It’s not a drastic elevation, but it warrants further investigation. It’s possible this is due to dehydration, given your active lifestyle and the fact that you drink a lot of water, but we need to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: Dehydration? But I drink so much water! Honestly, this is all very confusing. Are you saying my kidneys are… broken? Like my sister’s? Is this serious? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t like hospitals. They’re cold and… sterile. And I have to get home to the chickens. They’ll be worried sick. Is this because of the rice? Maybe I should stop eating rice. But my mother… she lived to be ninety-two eating rice every day. This is ridiculous. Honestly, I think I just need a nap. And maybe a glass of wine. A large one.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Genard, your kidneys are not broken. Elevated creatinine just means they're working a little harder than they should be. It doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem. And we're not talking about sending you to the hospital right now. It's good you mention the rice, and while it’s unlikely to be the sole cause, it's something we can discuss. We don’t need to immediately eliminate it from your diet, but we can explore other factors. To get a clearer picture, I would like to refer you to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist. They can perform some additional tests to determine the cause of the elevated creatinine and recommend the best course of action. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a kidney specialist? More doctors? More poking and prodding? Honestly, I just want this to be over. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t I just… drink more water? Or take some pills? I don’t like going to specialists. They always want to do more tests. And they never seem to know what’s wrong. My cousin went to a specialist for her… problems, and it just made things worse. Honestly, I think I just need to accept my fate. I’m old. Things are going to fall apart. Why bother with more tests? I have to get home to the chickens. They’re very sensitive. And they get lonely. Just tell me it’s old age and let me go home. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Genard. You’re right to want to avoid unnecessary tests and procedures. And I completely respect your desire to just be comfortable and enjoy your life. However, slightly elevated creatinine can be a sign of a treatable condition, and it’s important to rule out any potential problems, especially given your family history. We're not necessarily looking for a cure, but for answers to ensure you're not overlooking something that could be managed. I won't force you to see a specialist if you’re truly uncomfortable, but I strongly recommend it. The nephrologist can perform a simple ultrasound, which is non-invasive, and review your medications. If everything checks out, we can reassure you and focus on managing your symptoms. Would you be willing to consider just the ultrasound?
PATIENT: An… ultrasound? No poking? No prodding? Just a… picture? Is it expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know. Honestly, I’m worried about the cost. And I have to get home to the chickens. They’re very demanding. If it’s not too expensive, and it doesn’t take too long… and it doesn’t involve anyone poking around… maybe. But I’m not promising anything. And if they tell me it’s all in my head, I’m walking out. Honestly, I think it is all in my head. Old age. It’s just old age. But… an ultrasound. Maybe. What does the nephrologist… look like? Are they scary?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Genard. An ultrasound is completely non-invasive. It’s like a pregnancy scan – a technician uses a gel and a wand to create a picture of your kidneys. No poking, no prodding, and it shouldn’t take more than 20-30 minutes. As for the cost, I’ll have my office check on the price and see if we can find a facility that offers a reasonable rate, perhaps even a payment plan. We’ll also explore any local resources that might be available to help cover the cost. And no, the nephrologist is not scary! Dr. Ramirez is a very kind and gentle doctor. Here’s her information. You can call her office to schedule an appointment at your convenience. In the meantime, let’s focus on managing your symptoms. I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water and eating a balanced diet. We can also discuss some exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles, which may help with the leakage. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay. An ultrasound. And a nice doctor. And exercises. Maybe. Pelvic floor exercises? What are those? Do I have to… lift weights? I don’t have any weights. And I have to get home to the chickens. They get very lonely. Honestly, I think they miss me more than anything. All right. Exercises. But not too strenuous. And if they tell me it's just old age, I’m walking out. And if it costs too much, I’m walking out. But… an ultrasound. Maybe. Thank you, doctor. I think. But I still think it’s just old age.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Genard. We’ll take things one step at a time. Pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, are simple contractions of the muscles you use to stop the flow of urine. No weights needed – you can do them anywhere, anytime. I'll give you a handout with instructions before you leave. And don’t worry, we’ll respect your wishes every step of the way. We won't push you into anything you're not comfortable with. Here's a handout about the pelvic floor exercises, and another one explaining slightly elevated creatinine levels. And here’s the contact information for a social worker who can help you explore financial assistance options. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And enjoy your time with your chickens. They sound like wonderful companions. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Thank you, doctor. For everything. And for not laughing at me. Honestly, I was afraid you’d think I was crazy. Just… old and crazy. I have to get home to the chickens. They’re waiting. And maybe I’ll just have a large glass of wine. For medicinal purposes, of course. Thank you, doctor. Goodbye. .
