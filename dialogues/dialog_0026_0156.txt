DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not good. Like, a lot of… going to the bathroom. It’s been going on for a while now, and it's just… persistent, you know? I can't really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like ages.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent stomach issues can be quite disruptive. You said it’s been going on for a while... vague recollections are common, don't worry about that. When you say “a lot of going to the bathroom,” can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Um… okay. It's… watery, mostly. Not solid. And… a lot of it. Several times a day, definitely. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes even when I haven't. It just… happens. It's really annoying, honestly. And… I feel tired a lot, too. I don't know if that's connected, but… yeah. It’s just been dragging me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, watery stools several times a day, sometimes related to eating, sometimes not, and you've noticed increased fatigue. I see. And is there any cramping or pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes, yeah. Like, a dull ache in my belly. Not bad pain, usually. Just… uncomfortable. It comes and goes. It's not with every bathroom trip, but… often enough that I notice it. It’s hard to explain. Like, it's not sharp, just… a general feeling of… wrongness, I guess? And it’s kind of all over, not one specific spot.
DOCTOR: A dull, generalized ache… that's helpful to know. Okay. And have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… um… I think I’ve been losing weight? Maybe. My husband keeps saying I look thinner, but… I don’t really weigh myself. And… sometimes I feel really bloated, even when I haven’t eaten much. Like, my stomach feels all puffed up and uncomfortable. Oh! And sometimes I feel… really, really hungry, even after I’ve eaten. It’s weird. I don’t know if any of that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jase. That's a lot of information, and it’s all very useful. Weight loss, bloating, and increased hunger despite eating… Those can all be connected. Just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any fever, nausea, or vomiting at all?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Definitely no vomiting. And… I don’t think I’ve been nauseous, not really. Maybe a little bit queasy sometimes, but nothing bad. It's more just the… constant bathroom trips and the feeling awful afterwards. It's exhausting, honestly. I just want it to stop. And I'm really tired all the time, like I said. I feel weak sometimes too.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no vomiting, occasional queasiness… Constant diarrhea, fatigue, and weakness. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I just… I really hope you can figure out what’s wrong. I feel like I’ve been dealing with this forever and… I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jase. We'll do our best to figure this out. Okay, I'm just going to press gently here… any pain with this?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, a little bit there. Not sharp, but… uncomfortable. Like, a dull ache, again. It’s… it's not terrible, but I can definitely feel it. It's been like that for a while, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant. That’s good to know. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. No obvious abnormalities there. I’d like to order some lab work to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I trust your judgment. I just want to get this sorted out. What kind of tests are we talking about? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: We’ll start with a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. We’ll also do a stool sample to check for any bacteria, parasites, or inflammation. It’s a fairly standard set of tests, and it will give us a good starting point. The stool sample will require a collection at home, and the blood draw will be done here in the clinic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… okay. A blood draw and a stool sample. Yeah, I can do that. A stool sample… I guess that's… part of it. Will it be… difficult? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bit of a busy schedule, so… just trying to plan around things.
DOCTOR: It's not the most pleasant part, I agree, but we have instructions to make it as easy as possible. We’ll provide a collection kit with very clear directions, and you can collect the sample at home. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully. As for the results, typically, it takes about 3-5 business days to get everything back from the lab. We’ll call you as soon as we have them and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for an anti-diarrheal medication to help manage the symptoms. It won’t cure the problem, but it should give you some relief. Is there anything you are allergic to, or any other medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No allergies, that I know of. And… I don’t take any regular medications. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if I need it. But nothing consistently. So, just the anti-diarrheal for now, then we wait for the results? And you’ll call when they’re back? That sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I’ve been feeling so lost about all this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jase. You’re very welcome. Here's the prescription for the anti-diarrheal medication, and these are the instructions for collecting the stool sample. Please read them carefully. We'll call you as soon as the results are back, usually within 3-5 business days. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly—such as high fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately, don't hesitate. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Finco. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a lot better just knowing we’re doing something about it. I’ll read the instructions carefully and get the stool sample done as soon as I can. And I’ll keep an eye on things and go to the emergency room if anything gets worse. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon.
