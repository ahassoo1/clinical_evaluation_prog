DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Alcorta. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, to put it plainly, things aren’t as clear as they used to be. It's… troublesome, really. I’ve noticed it gradually worsening over the past few months, and frankly, it’s impacting my ability to perform my duties at work. It’s quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes, I understand. Can you be a little more specific about what isn’t clear?
PATIENT: Specific, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s not a complete blackout, mind you. More like… a blurring at the edges, particularly when I’m reading reports. And street signs at night? Forget about it. I used to have a rather keen eye for detail, always did, but now… it’s as if someone smeared Vaseline across my glasses, even with them on. It's a subtle thing, but persistent. And rather irritating, if I may add.
DOCTOR: I see. So, blurring, primarily with reading and night vision... and it's been gradual over months. Do you wear glasses currently?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Have for… oh, goodness, must be twenty years now. Standard prescription, nothing fancy. I had them checked a couple of years ago, maybe three, by a different optometrist. Seemed alright at the time, but this is… different. It’s not like needing a stronger prescription, it’s more… a general haziness, you understand? A lack of… crispness. It's hard to explain to someone who hasn't experienced it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the blurring and difficulty with night vision, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, now that you mention it, there has been a bit of… difficulty judging distances. Tripping over things, bumping into furniture occasionally. I chalked it up to being a bit clumsy, truthfully. I’m a tall man, you see, and not always aware of my extremities. But perhaps it’s connected to this… vision issue. No pain, no floaters, no double vision. Just… a general lack of clarity and a bit of instability, spatially speaking. It's not severe, mind you, but it is noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything changed in your life recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Contributing, you say? Hmm. Not that I can readily discern. My diet hasn’t altered significantly. I’ve always been rather… particular about what I consume. No new medications. I retired from any strenuous physical activity some time ago. Divorced about five years back, but that hardly seems relevant to my eyesight, does it? It was a rather amicable parting, all things considered. I suppose I’ve been spending more time indoors lately, reading… which is ironic, given the circumstances. Is that what you mean by 'changes'?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, and then we can discuss further. Could you follow me into the exam room?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Lead the way. Though I must say, I do hope this won’t be a lengthy procedure. My time is, shall we say, quite valuable.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be, Mr. Alcorta. Just a few basic tests to assess your vision. First, let’s check your visual acuity. Could you please read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I warn you, I anticipate some difficulty. My eyesight, as we’ve discussed, isn’t what it once was. E… H… F… P… T… Uh… the next line… I can make out some of the letters, but they’re… indistinct. It’s rather frustrating, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And with your glasses on?
PATIENT: Let’s see… E… H… F… P… T… V… Just about make out the V. The next line… I can attempt to decipher a few, but it’s… blurry. The letters seem to be swimming before my eyes, quite frankly. It’s hardly a conclusive result, is it? I presume you expected something better?
DOCTOR: It is what it is, Mr. Alcorta. We'll get a clearer picture as we go. Now, I'm going to hold up a pen and ask you to tell me when you can see it in your peripheral vision, without looking directly at it. Please say "now" as soon as you see it. Keep your eyes focused straight ahead.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must confess, I always found these sorts of tests rather imprecise. It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact moment of perception, you see. Now… Now… Now. I believe. It's rather faint, Doctor. Are you certain this device is functioning correctly?
DOCTOR: The device is functioning perfectly fine, Mr. Alcorta. Alright. Let’s check your pupils and a quick fundoscopic exam. This will just allow me to see the back of your eye. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation. Fundi… mild drusen present, some slight pallor of the optic nerve. Not particularly concerning at this stage.
PATIENT: Drusen? Pallor? Those sound… ominous, Doctor. Are you telling me there’s something seriously wrong? I trust this isn't indicative of a deteriorating condition? I have… plans, you see. Important plans. Perhaps a second opinion is warranted? I’m not one to dismiss medical advice lightly, but this all sounds rather… alarming.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, please. Mild drusen are common with age. They're not an immediate cause for alarm. The slight pallor is… something we’ll monitor. It could be completely benign. But given your symptoms – the blurry vision, difficulty with distances, and the findings on the exam – I think it’s prudent to order some further testing. We'll start with a visual field test and an optical coherence tomography, or OCT, scan of your retina. That will give us a more detailed picture of what's going on. I'm also going to refer you to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive evaluation. It's best to rule out anything serious, and they're the specialists in this area. While waiting for the test and appointment, please refrain from driving at night. Here's the information for the testing center and the referral.
PATIENT: An ophthalmologist? Further testing? This is… excessive, Doctor, truly. I came to you for a simple vision check, not a battery of procedures. And to be advised to cease driving at night? That's… rather inconvenient, to say the least. I suppose I have little choice, but I must say, this all seems rather… drastic. I trust these specialists are reputable? I have a rather discerning taste in healthcare professionals, you understand. And what is the estimated timeframe for these… investigations? My schedule is quite demanding, you see. Very well. I shall arrange accordingly, though I maintain my reservations about the necessity of all this. .
