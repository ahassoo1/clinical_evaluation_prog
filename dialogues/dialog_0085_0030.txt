DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, honestly. I've noticed a change in my body odor recently, and it’s… different. Not worse, just different. It started a few weeks ago, I’d say, maybe around the beginning of July.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s good you’re bringing it up. Changes in body odor can be a little concerning, so it’s always best to get it checked out. When you say "different," can you describe what that means exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s hard to explain. I usually just smell… like me, you know? A normal, everyday smell. But now it's… sweeter, almost. Not like perfume sweet, but… like fruit, maybe? And it seems to be stronger under my arms, but I think I can smell it a little bit all over. It’s just… not my usual scent. Does that make any sense? I’m terrible at describing smells.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Kerriann. Describing smells is difficult! And you’re right to notice a change – your body knows itself best. A sweeter odor is definitely something to investigate. Okay, let’s try to narrow things down. Has anything changed in your routine around the time you noticed this – new soaps, detergents, lotions, even foods you’ve been eating?
PATIENT: Let me think… No new soaps or detergents, definitely not. I’ve been using the same things for years. Lotion… hmm, I did switch to a new brand of shea butter lotion in June, maybe around the same time. It is supposed to smell like mango. Could that be it? I hadn’t really thought about that. And food… I've been eating a lot more fruit lately, actually. Peaches are in season, and I just can't resist. Everything is so good in the summer!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Both the lotion and the increased fruit intake are possibilities. Sometimes changes in diet can affect body odor. Let's explore a bit further just to be thorough. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the odor – any sweating more than usual, any skin changes under your arms, or any unintentional weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: No, no weight loss or gain. I’ve been pretty steady. And I don’t think I’m sweating more, no. Maybe a little bit, it is August, but nothing out of the ordinary. Skin changes… now that you mention it, it feels a little bit more… sensitive under my arms. Not a rash or anything, just… tender to the touch, sometimes. It’s not constant, just now and then. I hadn't really paid attention to that before.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s helpful information. Tenderness under the arms alongside the odor change is something we should investigate. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, no diabetes or kidney problems. I had my check-up last year, and everything was normal. I do have high blood pressure, and I take medication for that – lisinopril, 20mg a day. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains for someone my age. I had a hysterectomy about ten years ago, and I haven’t had any problems with that since. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement, because my levels were a little low.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Lisinopril, vitamin D supplement, hysterectomy ten years ago. Good to know. And just to be complete, are there any allergies we should be aware of – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, and I haven't had any problems with medications. I used to be a little bit sensitive to penicillin, but I haven’t taken that in years, and I think I’ve outgrown it. My mother was allergic to bees, but I haven’t inherited that, thankfully. I love being outside, so that would be terrible!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your underarms to check for any visible changes. This will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I’m hoping it’s just something simple. This whole thing is a little bit embarrassing, honestly. I just want to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in, and we’ll do our best to figure it out. Alright, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Just take some deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Okay, your heart and lungs sound good. And I don't see any rash or significant irritation under your arms, although the skin is a little bit sensitive to the touch, as you mentioned. No noticeable swelling or lumps. I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes just to rule anything out. Your lymph nodes feel normal.
PATIENT: Okay, good. I’m glad everything sounds normal so far. It’s just… I’ve never experienced anything like this before. Everything usually just works, you know? It’s unsettling when something changes. So, what do you think it could be? Do I need any tests? Is it something serious? I’m probably worrying too much, but… it’s hard not to.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. It's good you're being proactive and bringing this to my attention. Based on the exam and what you’ve told me, it’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we do need to investigate further to be sure. Given the change in odor, the tenderness, and the new lotion and increased fruit intake, there are a few possibilities. It could be a mild skin irritation from the lotion, or a change in your body's natural flora. Sometimes, increased sugar intake can affect body odor, but that’s usually a less common cause. To rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a few simple tests: a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. We can also do a urine analysis just to be thorough. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable. I’d rather be safe than sorry. A CBC, CMP, and urine analysis… okay, that doesn’t sound too bad. Will I need to fast for any of those tests? And where do I go to get them done? I usually go to the lab over at County General, is that okay? I just want to get this figured out, and get back to my normal routine. I’ve got a lot of flooring to lay this month!
DOCTOR: That's a great attitude, Kerriann. Yes, you will need to fast for the CMP – that means no food or drinks except water for 8-12 hours before the test. The CBC and urine analysis don’t require fasting. And yes, County General is perfectly fine. They're a great lab. I’ll send the orders electronically to them right now. You can just tell them you’re here as a patient of Dr. Lahn, and they’ll take care of everything. They’ll likely draw blood and collect a urine sample. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I'd recommend switching back to your old lotion and trying to reduce your fruit intake slightly, just to see if that makes a difference. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Switch back to the old lotion, cut back on the peaches… I can definitely do that. It's a sacrifice, but worth it to get this sorted out. Sending the orders to County General… okay, I’ll go there tomorrow morning, first thing. So, if the tests come back normal, what then? What else could it be? I’m trying not to worry, but… my mind is racing. Is there anything I should be looking for, any symptoms that I should pay attention to? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: It's good you're thinking ahead. If the tests come back normal, it's likely a benign cause – possibly a mild skin reaction we haven't quite pinpointed yet, or a subtle change in your body chemistry that isn’t easily detectable. We can then explore other potential causes, like a less common bacterial imbalance. In the meantime, please pay attention to any new symptoms, such as fever, chills, excessive sweating, significant weight loss, or any changes in your skin – like redness, swelling, or pain. Also, if the odor becomes significantly stronger or different, or if it’s accompanied by any other unusual symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. I’m also going to give you a referral to a dermatologist. While this is likely something we can manage here, it's always good to have a specialist’s opinion, especially if the problem persists. They can perform a more detailed skin examination and rule out any less common dermatological conditions. Would you like me to go ahead and send that referral as well?
PATIENT: Yes, please send the referral to a dermatologist. It's better to be safe than sorry, as you said. Fever, chills, excessive sweating, weight loss, skin changes… okay, I'll keep a close eye on everything. I feel a little bit better now, just knowing we have a plan. It's reassuring to have someone take this seriously, and not just dismiss it as "old lady smell" or something. Thank you, Dr. Lahn. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. Should I schedule my follow-up appointment now, or wait until I have the test results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It's good you advocate for yourself and came in to get it checked out. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today, to give the lab time to process your results. That would be August 9th?
PATIENT: Yes, August 9th sounds perfect. That gives me plenty of time to get the tests done and hopefully figure out what’s going on. Okay, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. Lahn. I appreciate your help. I’m going to go home now and switch back to my old lotion! .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. It was nice meeting you. Please take care, and don't hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day! .
