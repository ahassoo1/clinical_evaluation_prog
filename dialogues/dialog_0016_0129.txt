DOCTOR: Hi Dawnetta, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello. Honestly, I don't have all day, so let's get on with it. It's my stool. It's… dark. Black, like tar, almost. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. I figured it might be something with those.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta, I understand you’re concerned about the dark stool and you’re wondering if it’s related to your arthritis pain medication. It's good you're being proactive about this. Just to be clear, when you say dark, like tar, is it consistently that color, or has it been happening just recently?
PATIENT: Consistently, mostly. It's not like it's bright red, thank goodness. More like… well, you know, when you see old motor oil? That color. And it's been going on for… oh, a few weeks now, I'd say. Maybe a month. I don't sit around analyzing my bathroom habits, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Dawnetta. You don’t need to analyze anything! A month of consistently dark, tarry stools is definitely something we need to investigate. It could be related to the pain medication, but it's important to rule out other possibilities. To get a better picture, could you tell me a bit more about your other bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Now you want to talk about that? Fine. It's… normal, I suppose. Not loose, not hard. Just… regular. I eat okay, mostly. Not a lot of vegetables, I'll admit, but I'm not living on junk food. And I go about once a day. Look, are we going to get to the point or are you just going to ask me about everything I do? I have a garden to tend, you know.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m being too thorough, Dawnetta. It's just important to gather all the information. Knowing it’s a regular bowel movement, not loose or hard, is helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the dark stool?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Besides the obvious? No, not really. I'm a bit tired, maybe. But who isn't at my age? And my stomach… it gurgles sometimes. But I always eat too fast, so that's probably it. Honestly, I feel fine. This whole thing is probably just a side effect of the pills. Can we just get a prescription for something to fix it, or are we going to be here all day?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and some stomach gurgling, but overall you're feeling okay. I understand your frustration, Dawnetta, and I want to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. However, dark, tarry stools can sometimes indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract, which is why we need to be careful and rule things out. To do that, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Bleeding?! Oh, for goodness sake. Fine, go ahead. But be quick about it. I haven't got all day to lay around while you poke and prod. I just want this sorted. It's probably nothing, honestly. Just the pills. I told you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any significant tenderness. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. Your pulse is a little elevated at 88, but that could be due to your concern, or just general activity. To be thorough, I’d like to order a stool test to check for blood and a complete blood count, just to see if your red blood cell levels are normal. We should also do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests. Honestly. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I suppose if it makes you feel better. But I'm telling you, it's those pills. Don't go looking for something complicated when the answer is right in front of you. And please, tell me how long this is going to take. I have tomatoes that need staking.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. I promise we’re not trying to complicate things, just being thorough. The tests will give us a clearer picture. The stool test will take a few days to come back, and the blood work should be available within 24-48 hours. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend we temporarily stop the arthritis pain medication. We can discuss alternative options once we have the test results. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Stop the pills?! Now hold on just a minute. Those pills are the only thing that keeps me moving! I can barely get out of bed without them. You can't just tell me to stop taking them. What am I supposed to do, lie around all day in pain? No. Absolutely not. I’ll wait for the tests, but I’m not stopping those pills until I hear a very good reason.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Dawnetta. You’re right to be cautious about stopping a medication that helps you manage your pain. We definitely won’t do anything without a good reason. In that case, let's proceed with the tests, and we'll discuss the results and a plan of action once they are available. To be on the safe side, though, let’s talk about warning signs to watch out for while we wait. If you experience any dizziness, weakness, or notice any bright red blood in your stool, please come to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Dizziness… weakness… bright red blood… honestly, you're scaring me now. Fine. Yes, alright. I'll watch for those things. But I still think it's those pills. And if those tests show anything other than "pills causing dark stool," I want a second opinion. A real doctor. Not someone who wants me to stop taking my medication.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dawnetta. That’s perfectly reasonable. You have every right to seek a second opinion if you’re not comfortable with the results, and I will be happy to provide you with a referral. I’m ordering the stool test and blood work now. The lab will call you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and create a plan that you’re comfortable with. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I think that's enough questions for one day. Just… please hurry with those tests. And don't make me come back if it's nothing. I have a garden to tend, remember? .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dawnetta. We’ll get those tests done as quickly as possible. I understand you have a garden to tend, and I won't keep you any longer than necessary. Thank you for coming in today. If anything changes or you experience any concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the clinic.
