DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I come talk about… preventative things. About staying healthy, you know? She mentioned something about a pill you can take, and I thought it might be a good idea to look into it. I don’t really know much beyond that, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you to consider preventative care, Ms. Trefren. It’s excellent that you’re being proactive about your health. There are several options we can discuss, and I’m happy to go over them with you. When your friend mentioned a “pill,” was she referring to anything specific – perhaps a vitamin supplement, or were you thinking about medications to help manage risk factors for certain conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. She said something about PrEP... that's what she called it. Said it helps with… well, she was talking about staying safe, sexually. I’m single, you see, and I want to be careful. That’s all I really know. Is that… is that what you’re talking about? I don't have a lot of experience with medical things, and all the names just… fly right over my head.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Trefren, PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis, and it’s a medication used to prevent HIV. It's very good that you're thinking about this, and it's perfectly normal to not be familiar with all the medical terminology. To make sure PrEP is appropriate for you, I’d like to ask a few questions about your sexual health and medical history. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That's… that’s why I’m here, isn’t it? Ask away. I’ll answer as best I can. It’s just… a little embarrassing, maybe, talking about some of this. But I understand it’s important.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Trefren. These conversations can be sensitive, and your privacy is very important to me. Everything we discuss will be kept confidential. Let's start with some basics. Have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times, actually. The last time was… let me think… it was about two years ago, I believe. At the health department. They said everything was clear then. I remember because they made me wait a long time for the results, and I was quite anxious. But yes, negative. All clear. Do you need the exact date? I might be able to dig up the paperwork if you do.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Trefren. Knowing your recent testing history is very helpful. The date isn’t absolutely critical at this moment, but if you happen to have that information readily available, it would be useful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your current sexual activity?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a lot, to be honest. I’m single, as I said, and haven't been with anyone regularly for a while. I do have… occasional partners. It's not a weekly thing, not even monthly, really. A few times a year, maybe. And I always use protection, a condom, every time. I thought that was enough, but my friend said PrEP offers extra peace of mind. She’s very informed about these things. Does that make sense? I don't want to… overshare, if that’s a bad way to put it.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Trefren, and you’re not oversharing at all. It’s good you’re being open with me. Using condoms is excellent, and a very important step in protecting yourself. PrEP can be a good additional layer of protection, especially for those who may be at higher risk. To help me determine if PrEP is right for you, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I know of, anyway. I’ve always been very careful. I haven’t… I haven’t had a lot of partners, so I’ve always been pretty safe. And like I said, I always use protection. I had a very strict upbringing, and I’m still quite cautious about things like that, even now. It’s just… getting older, you worry about different things. You worry about everything, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Trefren. It’s wonderful that you’ve prioritized safe practices. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My doctor tells me I'm remarkably healthy for my age, actually. A little high cholesterol, but that’s what the medication is for, right? And my blood pressure is usually pretty good. No diabetes, no kidney problems, nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. And a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that's it. Honestly, I’m pretty lucky, health-wise.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news, Ms. Trefren. It sounds like you’re doing a great job taking care of yourself. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think. I take a statin for the cholesterol, like I said. And I take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one. And… oh, sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees when they’re really acting up. That's it, I think. Nothing else regularly. I try to avoid taking too many pills, to be honest. It makes me feel… old, somehow.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Trefren. Now, before we discuss PrEP further, I'd like to do a brief physical exam and some lab work to ensure you're a good candidate. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I figured there would be some tests involved. I just want to be sure this is… safe. And effective, of course. I don’t want to waste my time, or yours, if it’s not a good fit. So yes, let’s get on with it. The sooner we know, the better, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Trefren. That’s a very sensible approach. First, I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your blood pressure. Then, I’ll need to draw some blood for some routine tests to assess your kidney function, liver function, and screen for any sexually transmitted infections. It will just be a standard blood draw, nothing too invasive. If you could please have a seat on the examination table, we can get started.
PATIENT: Alright. Let’s get it over with then. The sooner this is done, the better. I always hate needles, but… well, needs must, I suppose. Just… please be quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Trefren. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in... and exhale. Again... and exhale. Everything sounds clear so far. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Now, we’ll just need to draw a small amount of blood. I'll clean the area on your arm first. You might feel a brief pinch. Just relax your arm… excellent. Almost done… there. All finished. Apply gentle pressure to the area with this gauze pad for a few minutes. We’ll send these off to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. Everything went smoothly. Just keep that gauze pad on for a little while to prevent any bruising. Do you have any questions before we move on?
PATIENT: No, I think that was… alright, actually. Not as bad as I feared. Thank you for being so gentle. So, we just wait for the results then? And then what? If everything is good, will you just… give me the pills? I really appreciate you being so patient with me. I know I ask a lot of questions, and I'm probably being a bit of a bother.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Ms. Trefren. It’s my job to answer your questions and ensure you feel comfortable and informed. Yes, once we have the lab results back, we’ll review them together. If everything is within the normal range and you’re a suitable candidate, we can discuss starting PrEP. PrEP is typically taken as a daily pill, but there is also an injectable form available. We can discuss which option might be best for you, depending on your preferences and lifestyle. In the meantime, it’s important to continue practicing safe sex, including using condoms consistently. Do you have any questions about PrEP itself?
PATIENT: No, not right now, I think. I just want to… digest everything, really. And wait for the results. Is there anything I need to do in the meantime? Any symptoms I should watch out for? Or things I should avoid? I don't want to mess anything up. I'm just trying to be prepared. And… I guess I'm a little nervous. It's a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Ms. Trefren. It is a lot to take in. There’s nothing specific you need to do in the meantime, as long as you continue practicing safe sex. We’ll be able to address any concerns once we have the lab results. However, if you experience any unusual symptoms – such as fever, fatigue, nausea, or abdominal pain – please contact the clinic immediately. While these symptoms are unlikely to be related to PrEP at this stage, it's always best to err on the side of caution. I’ll also give you a handout with more information about PrEP, including potential side effects and important things to consider. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful and patient with me. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I'll just… wait for the results then. I suppose I should get going. I have errands to run. And… things to think about. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Trefren. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your results are back. We’ll be in touch as soon as they’re available, typically within 3-5 business days. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. And remember, taking proactive steps to protect your health is always a good thing.
