DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Creagh. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Mutnick. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ve been experiencing some…pressure in my bladder, and it’s been concerning me. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: “A little while” is unfortunately not a helpful timeframe, Ms. Creagh. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, you are quite right, my apologies. Let me think… It started, I believe, around the end of June. Perhaps the 20th? It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly, but definitely within the last six weeks, give or take a few days. It's been gradually getting more noticeable, if that helps.
DOCTOR: “Gradually” is also not terribly useful. Is this constant pressure, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It’s not a constant feeling. More…intermittent. There are times throughout the day when I don’t notice it at all, and then other times when it’s quite bothersome. Especially after I drink something, it seems. Though not every time, which is what makes it a little confusing.
DOCTOR: After you drink what?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I hadn’t really connected it to anything specific, to be honest. Now that I think about it…it seems to be more noticeable after I have coffee, or anything with caffeine, really. But also sometimes after a large glass of water. It's not consistent enough to be certain, though. I do drink quite a bit of water throughout the day, as I try to stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: And how much is "quite a bit," Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I would say, roughly three liters, perhaps a little more, on a typical day. I have a large water bottle that I refill several times. Is that…too much? I was under the impression it was good to drink a lot of water, but perhaps I’m mistaken.
DOCTOR: Three liters…excessive. Now, alongside this pressure, are you experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not pain. It’s purely a sensation of pressure, a feeling of fullness, almost like you need to go to the bathroom, even when you don’t necessarily. It’s uncomfortable, but not painful. And it doesn’t radiate anywhere, it’s just…there, in my bladder area. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your urinary stream itself?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit difficult to describe. I don't believe so, not drastically. It feels normal when I do go. The flow seems consistent, and I don't have any trouble starting or stopping. I haven’t had any burning or urgency, thankfully. Though, now that you mention it, I do sometimes feel like I don’t fully empty my bladder, if that makes sense? It's subtle, but it's a feeling I've noticed occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll need a sample. Please step into the restroom and collect a clean-catch urine sample. Instructions are posted on the wall. And Ms. Creagh, please try to be more precise with your descriptions; vague answers waste both our time.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I apologize for my lack of precision. I will do my best to be more specific. I will collect a sample right away. Thank you for your patience.
DOCTOR: Good. Be quick.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I followed the instructions as closely as possible. I hope that’s sufficient.
DOCTOR: We'll send this off for a basic urinalysis. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Any relevant conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I have been diagnosed with mild hypertension, controlled with a low dose of Lisinopril. Otherwise, I’m generally quite healthy. No major surgeries, no allergies that I’m aware of. And I am up-to-date on all my vaccinations. Is there anything specific you are looking for, Doctor? Perhaps conditions that run in my family?
DOCTOR: Hypertension. Predictable. Family history. Mother had type 2 diabetes, father had…nothing of note. And you, Ms. Creagh, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational substances?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol - perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I certainly do not use any recreational substances. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. Perhaps my hypertension is just a matter of genetics, despite my efforts.
DOCTOR: Effort is not always sufficient, Ms. Creagh. Now, regarding your Lisinopril, what dosage are you currently taking?
PATIENT: It’s 10 milligrams, Doctor. Taken once daily, every morning. I have been on that dosage for approximately two years now, and my blood pressure remains stable, according to my primary care physician. I have regular check-ups, every six months. Is that information helpful, Doctor? I’m happy to provide any further details, if needed.
DOCTOR: Adequate. We will await the urinalysis results. While we wait, I’ll perform a quick abdominal exam. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please let me know if there's anything specific I should be doing, or if you'd like me to adjust my position.
DOCTOR: Nothing remarkable. No tenderness to palpation. Bladder is palpable, but not distended. Normal bowel sounds. Alright. I'll have the results sent to my computer. It’s likely a simple urinary tract infection, but we must rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: That’s…reassuring to hear, Doctor. A urinary tract infection would be a relief, honestly. What sort of “other possibilities” are you considering? I apologize for asking, I’m just…a little anxious, naturally.
DOCTOR: We consider all possibilities, Ms. Creagh. Though frankly, you present as a fairly straightforward case. However, we must rule out overactive bladder, interstitial cystitis…though less likely given your age and relatively short duration of symptoms. Rare cases of bladder tumors are also considered, although exceedingly uncommon in patients like yourself. We simply follow protocol. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. It’s… sensible to be thorough, of course. You’re quite right, it’s best to rule everything out. It’s just… hearing “bladder tumor” is a little unsettling, naturally. But I appreciate you explaining everything. It makes me feel…more informed, if that makes sense. What’s the next step while we await the results? Will I need any further tests?
DOCTOR: For now, we wait for the urinalysis. Depending on those results, we may consider a post-void residual volume measurement to assess complete bladder emptying. And if symptoms persist…we may discuss referral to a urologist. Do not self-treat. Avoid caffeine, sugary drinks, and alcohol until we have a definitive answer. Any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That clarifies everything perfectly. I will certainly avoid those substances, and I will not self-treat. And I understand about the potential for further tests, and the possibility of a referral. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your time. I’ll await the results, and contact your office if my symptoms worsen. Thank you again, Doctor Mutnick.
DOCTOR: Very well. The staff will contact you with the results. Do not hesitate to call if absolutely necessary. .
