DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have other patients waiting, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. My name is Karry Skarbek. Well, it's about a friend... he’s hoping to get a visa to come visit from overseas. I believe he needs certain shots to be able to do that, and I thought it best to get things sorted out properly with a doctor’s help. I don’t want there to be any trouble when he arrives, you understand.
DOCTOR: A visa… yes, well. It's rather… unusual for you to be seeking medical advice on behalf of someone else, Mr. Skarbek. Still. It seems to be a matter of preventative measures, then. Do you have any documentation outlining specifically which vaccinations are required?
PATIENT: Documentation? No, not exactly. He just mentioned needing “shots” – that’s what he called them. He’s not very good with details, bless his heart. He’s coming from… let me think… Argentina. That’s right, Argentina. Perhaps there’s a list online somewhere? I haven’t looked yet, honestly. I figured a doctor would know what’s needed for travel from there. Is that not the case?
DOCTOR: "A doctor would know…" Well, Mr. Skarbek, while I possess a medical degree, I am not a travel agency. Regulations change frequently. However, I suppose I can attempt to ascertain some general recommendations. Do you know where in Argentina he is traveling from, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don’t. He didn’t say. He just said Argentina. He's been living there for… well, a good while now. He moved after… after my wife passed. It's a long story. He just wants to visit for a few weeks, that’s all. He’s a simple man, really. Doesn’t bother with a lot of details. I’m probably not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: No, you are not. A great deal of ambiguity here, Mr. Skarbek. It's… frustrating. Very well. Let’s proceed with some basic preventative measures, assuming the worst. Have you, yourself, had your tetanus booster within the last ten years?
PATIENT: Tetanus…? Let me see… I believe so. It was… around the time I retired, maybe? From the library, that is. That would have been… 2015, I think. Perhaps 2016. I get a little mixed up with the years these days, Doctor. I had it done at the local clinic, you know, the one down by the river? It’s a small one, but they were very nice. Would they have a record? I don't recall keeping one myself.
DOCTOR: A small clinic… yes, well. Records are not always… reliable. Very well. Let’s assume you are due for a booster. It’s a simple injection, really. Now, beyond this hypothetical visa, does your friend have any known allergies or current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Not that I’m aware of. He always seemed a healthy sort. He likes to garden, you know. Lots of fresh air and sunshine. As for medical conditions… he had a bit of a cough last winter, but it cleared up on its own. Nothing serious, I don’t think. He’s a proud man, doesn’t like to complain or bother with doctors. He’d sooner tough it out. I truly don’t believe he has anything… significant. Is it important? Should I ask him directly?
DOCTOR: Important?
PATIENT: Well, yes! I’m just trying to be helpful. I understand you need to know these things. It's just… he doesn’t like talking about his health. It's a bit of a sensitive subject, to be honest. He’s a bit private. But if it's necessary for his visa… I can certainly try. It might take some convincing. Is there a list of questions I can ask him? Perhaps a form? That might make it easier.
DOCTOR: A form… really. Very well. Here. This is a basic medical questionnaire. Have him complete it thoroughly. And I trust you'll impress upon him the importance of accuracy. I have other patients waiting, Mr. Skarbek. Once he has completed this, we can begin to assess his suitability for travel, and possibly fulfill your… visa requirements. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand perfectly. Accuracy… yes, I’ll make sure he understands that. It might take a day or two, but I’ll get it back to you. Thank you for your patience. And thank you for seeing me, even if I haven’t been the most helpful patient. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: Very well. See that you do. .
PATIENT: .
