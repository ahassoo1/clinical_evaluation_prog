DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… concerning. I have been… forgetting things. Small things, mostly, but… more recently, it feels like more than small. I do not like this. My blood pressure has been… not good, also. The nurse took it, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse did, and I see the reading. We’ll certainly address both of those concerns. Let's start with the memory issues. You say you’ve been forgetting things – can you give me some examples of what you mean by “small things” and what has changed recently that makes you feel it’s “more than small”?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Before… maybe six months ago? I would misplace my keys, or forget a name. But I always remembered quickly, or found the keys. Now… I forgot how to make my tea, Doctor. My tea! I have made it every day for thirty years. And yesterday, I went to the market, and… I could not remember why I was there. I stood there, in the fruit aisle, completely lost. It frightened me. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Thirty years of making tea, and now you’re having trouble recalling the process… That is concerning. And forgetting your purpose at the market… alright. To get a better picture, let’s talk about other things. Have you noticed any difficulties with other aspects of your thinking – like problem-solving, or following conversations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe my thinking is… normal, otherwise. I can still balance my accounts, and I read the newspaper every day. I can talk with my friends, and we have… complicated conversations, about politics and such. No, it is not thinking… it is remembering. Like a… a gap in the record. A missing piece. I feel… foolish to explain it. But it is true.
DOCTOR: It's not foolish at all, Ms. Alvara. It’s important to describe exactly what you’re experiencing. And you’ve done that quite well. Now, let's move on to your blood pressure. Have you been feeling any symptoms associated with that – headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, perhaps shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The headaches are… frequent. A dull ache, behind my eyes. And sometimes, when I stand up quickly, I feel… light. Not faint, exactly, but… unsteady. Blurred vision? Perhaps. I wear glasses, you see, and I thought it was just the lenses needing adjustment. But… perhaps not. I have not mentioned it to my optician, yet. I did not think it important. Is it connected to the memory, do you think?
DOCTOR: It’s certainly possible there’s a connection, Ms. Alvara. High blood pressure, if uncontrolled, can affect cognitive function, and can also contribute to visual disturbances. Let's review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. About… ten years ago, perhaps? My husband… he took me to the doctor. I remember he was very worried. They put me on a pill, I believe. A small white pill. But… after he passed, I… I stopped taking it. It made me tired, and… I did not want to feel more sad, if that makes sense. I have not seen a doctor regularly since then. I apologize. It was foolish.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, it's not helpful to dwell on “foolish.” Life happens. But stopping your medication, especially for hypertension, can have consequences. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I have taken many pills in my life, for headaches and such. Nothing has ever caused a reaction. Though, as I said, the blood pressure pill made me very, very tired. Like… a heavy weight on my chest. I did not like it. And I thought… if I just watched my salt intake, and rested more, it would be enough. Perhaps I was wrong. I am beginning to think I was very wrong.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re being honest with me. Alright, let's do a brief physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure again, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment – check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Then we can discuss some potential next steps. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment. I would like to know what is happening, and what can be done. The thought of… losing my memory… it is frightening. Please, do whatever you think is necessary. I will cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Very good. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 160 over 95. Higher than I'd like to see, unfortunately. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly… forceful. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Is this alright? I sometimes… my eyes get tired easily. I read for many hours each day. Perhaps that is it. A simple matter of fatigue.
DOCTOR: Your eye movements are a bit slow, Ms. Alvara, but not drastically so. Now, stand up slowly, if you can. Good. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Please stand with your feet together and close your eyes. A little unsteady, but not falling. Alright, please sit back down. Based on this brief exam, and your history, we need to investigate further. The memory issues, combined with the high blood pressure, are concerning.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. I am… relieved you are taking this seriously. What sort of investigation? Will I need… tests? I do not mind, you know. Whatever is necessary to find out what is happening. Please, tell me everything. And… is this something… serious? I do not want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, it’s too early to say definitively how serious this is. We need more information. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel – that will give us a baseline assessment of your overall health. More importantly, I want to order an MRI of your brain. This will allow us to visualize your brain and look for any structural abnormalities that might be contributing to your memory loss. We will also need to do a thorough cognitive assessment with a specialist. I will refer you to Dr. Elena Petrova, a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders. She's excellent. In the meantime, I want you to start a blood pressure log. Write down your readings twice a day – morning and evening. And, while we await the results, I am going to prescribe a low dose of lisinopril. It's a common blood pressure medication, and hopefully, it won’t cause the same level of fatigue you experienced previously. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds very thorough. An MRI… that is a little frightening, but I understand. I will do everything you ask. The blood pressure log, the medication… and Dr. Petrova, yes. I trust your judgment. I am relieved to have a plan. Thank you. When will I… hear about the results? And… how long will this take? I have appointments, you see. I must manage my property.
DOCTOR: The MRI scheduling will be handled by my office. They’ll contact you to arrange a time that works for you. It usually takes a few days to a week to get the results back. Dr. Petrova’s office will also contact you to schedule your cognitive assessment – that may take a little longer, as her schedule is quite full. We will discuss the results of both tests at a follow-up appointment, which I’ll schedule for approximately three weeks from today. In the meantime, please contact my office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Three weeks… I will mark it on my calendar. I am… grateful. Thank you for taking the time. And thank you for listening. It is… a relief to finally be addressing this. I will follow your instructions carefully. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. My office will be in touch regarding the MRI and Dr. Petrova. Take care of yourself. Goodbye.
