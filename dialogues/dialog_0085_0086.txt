DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if you don’t mind getting straight to it? I’m pretty busy today.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I appreciate you being upfront. Let’s get right to it then. I do want to make sure we cover everything, though, even if it’s just to confirm things haven't changed since we last spoke. Are you referring to the results of the blood work and urine sample we collected last week?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Blood and pee. Is everything okay? I feel fine, honestly. Just want to know what the numbers say, you know? No need to go over everything if it’s all normal.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re feeling well. Let’s take a look. Overall, most of your results were within the normal range, which is encouraging. However, there were a couple of things I'd like to discuss with you. Your white blood cell count was slightly elevated, and we did find some protein in your urine. Before we dive into what that could mean, can you tell me a little bit about any changes in your routine or diet since your last visit?
PATIENT: Hmm. Changes? Not really. Same job, same food, same everything. I’ve been trying to drink more water, if that counts? Honestly, I mostly eat takeout. I work long hours, logistics is… hectic. What does the protein in my pee mean though? Is it bad? I don’t even know what a white blood cell count is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It’s good you’re trying to increase your water intake, that’s always a positive. Let's break it down. White blood cells are part of your body’s defense system – they fight infection. A slightly elevated count can indicate your body is responding to something, which could be anything from a minor cold to something else. We’ll need to investigate a little further. As for the protein in your urine, that's not usually a normal finding. A small amount can sometimes happen temporarily, especially after exercise. But consistently finding protein can suggest your kidneys aren't filtering as efficiently as they should. Again, it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious right now, but it's something we want to look into. Before we jump to conclusions, do you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No swelling. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I’m on my feet all day at work, so my feet are always a little sore, but not puffy or anything. I haven't had a cold recently either, unless it was so mild I didn't even notice. What kind of tests are we talking about? More blood? More pee? I really don’t have a lot of time for this. Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the lack of swelling. And I understand your concern about time. Let’s try to be as efficient as possible. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a repeat urine test, just to confirm the initial finding. And I’d also like to do a blood test called a creatinine level – that helps us assess how well your kidneys are functioning. It’s a standard test, and shouldn’t take too long. We’re not necessarily looking for anything major right now, just trying to rule things out and get a baseline. It could be something as simple as dehydration, or a temporary infection. But we want to be thorough. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Repeat pee and blood. As long as it doesn’t take forever. Can I schedule it for first thing tomorrow morning? I have a really packed schedule all week. And… will I have to fast for the blood test? Seriously, I need to know. I don’t have time to sit around waiting to eat.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I’ve scheduled you for first thing tomorrow morning – 8:00 AM. And yes, unfortunately, the creatinine blood test does require a 12-hour fast. No food or drinks except water. I know it’s inconvenient, and I apologize for that, but it’s important for accurate results. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible – usually within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse call you with the findings. In the meantime, continue to focus on hydration. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No medications. Nothing. Just… a lot of coffee to get through the day. That's it. Look, is this going to affect my job? I can't afford to be sick. Logistics doesn't exactly have a sick day policy. It's… complicated. Can we just get this over with? I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. And I assure you, we are not jumping to any conclusions. We are simply gathering information. The coffee intake is good to know, as caffeine can sometimes affect kidney function, although it's unlikely to be a significant factor in your case. Okay, so to recap: we’ve scheduled a repeat urine test and a fasting blood test for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they're available. Before you head back to work, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No. That's it. Just… please call as soon as you have the results. I have a lot riding on this. Thanks, Doctor.
