DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let's just get straight to it. I want to get pregnant. Simple as that. My husband… well, he was my husband… and we always planned on kids, but things… happened. Now I just want to make sure I can have one, you know? Before it's too late. I don't want any surprises, and I definitely don’t want any trouble getting pregnant.
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. It's very practical of you to want to get everything checked out beforehand. We'll do our best to assess things and give you a clear picture. To start, could you tell me a little more about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, it's… fuzzy. I've been generally healthy, I think. Usual childhood stuff, but nothing major. I had… some things when I was pregnant before, but it was a long time ago, and I don’t really remember the details. It wasn't… successful. I've seen doctors regularly for check-ups, but I can't really recall specifics. Does that help? I really don't want to sit here listing everything I had for a cold in 1998.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Carmaleta. It's common for details to fade over time. We can focus on the important things. Since you mentioned a previous pregnancy that wasn't successful, could you tell me approximately when that was?
PATIENT: Ugh, approximately? Honestly, a long time ago. Like… over ten years ago. Maybe fifteen? Look, it was a difficult time, and I… blocked a lot of it out. I just want to know if I'm still able to have a baby. Not relive the past, okay? Is that going to be a problem? Will my age affect things? I'm not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: No, not a problem at all, Carmaleta. We won’t dwell on the past. It’s perfectly reasonable to focus on the present and future. Your age is certainly a factor we'll consider, but being 43 doesn’t automatically mean there will be difficulties. We just need to get a baseline understanding of your health. To start, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Oh, I take… something for my joints. They ache, you know? Getting old. And… occasionally something for sleep, if I can't quiet my mind. But that's it. Nothing regular, really. Just when needed. What kind of tests are you even planning on doing? Because if it's anything invasive, I'm not sure… I don't really like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. We’ll start with some relatively simple blood tests to assess your hormone levels, check for any underlying conditions, and evaluate your overall health. We can also do a physical exam. As for the physical exam, it would involve a standard check of your vital signs, and a pelvic exam to assess your reproductive organs. We can discuss each step before we proceed, and I absolutely respect your comfort level. We can always modify the plan if needed. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I mean, I get itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the dust. And I can't tolerate dairy, but that's a digestive thing, not an allergy. Look, I'm pretty low-maintenance. I just want to know if this is going to be a whole ordeal. I've got things to do, you know? I don't have time for endless tests and procedures. Just tell me straight: am I likely to have a problem getting pregnant, or not? Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It’s not easy dealing with uncertainty. Unfortunately, I can't give you a definitive "yes" or "no" without gathering more information. It's not about endless tests, it's about building a clear picture so we can make the best plan for you. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a little about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh, menstrual cycles. Seriously? Okay, fine. They're… irregular. They come and go. Sometimes they're normal, sometimes they're… late. Sometimes they're heavy, sometimes they're light. It's really unpredictable. Honestly, I stopped keeping track a long time ago. It’s just… a hassle. Is that going to be a problem? It's probably just stress, right? Everything's stressful these days. Is that what's causing it? I just want to skip all this and get a magic pill. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Irregular cycles can certainly be a factor we need to investigate, but it doesn’t automatically mean there’s a problem. Stress can definitely play a role, but it's important to rule out other possibilities. To get a better understanding, could you estimate how often you have a period, on average?
PATIENT: Average? Honestly, that's a hard one. Sometimes it's every month, sometimes it's every other month, sometimes… longer. It really varies. Maybe... six to eight weeks apart? But it's not consistent. Look, I'm not a scientist, okay? I don't track these things. Is this really necessary? Can't you just give me something to regulate it? I've heard of people taking herbs... Would that work? I really don't want to go through a lot of complicated procedures.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Carmaleta. We'll try to keep things as straightforward as possible. While herbs can be helpful for some, it’s important to know what’s causing the irregularity before trying any treatment. That’s why I’m asking these questions. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a physical exam, if you're comfortable. It will help me assess your overall health and rule out any potential issues. We can also order some blood tests to check your hormone levels and other important factors. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But no invasive procedures, okay? And the faster we can get this done, the better. I have a lot on my plate. Just… please, no surprises. And tell me straight, if it's bad news, okay? I don't want to be strung along. Just the physical and the blood tests, right? Nothing else? I'm really not a fan of doctors, you know. This is already stressful enough.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a physical exam and blood tests to start, Carmaleta. No invasive procedures without a thorough discussion first. And I promise to be upfront and honest with you about the results. I understand your stress, and I’ll do my best to make this process as smooth as possible. Let’s start with the physical exam. I'll need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a pelvic exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. And please be quick. Honestly, I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon sitting here. Just… tell me where to go. And I really don't want to talk about it while you're doing it. Just… do your thing. I'm not enjoying this. At all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. I respect your wishes. Please, come with me this way. I'll explain everything as we go, but feel free to let me know if you need me to stop at any point. .
