DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to talk about, truthfully. I suppose… I haven’t been feeling myself lately. A great sadness, you understand? It’s been… weighing on me. I hope we can get this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind. I have a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Derasmo. It takes courage to talk about these things, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. There's no need to rush, but I understand you're busy. When you say "not feeling yourself," could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain precisely. It’s not a physical tiredness, though I am tired, yes. It’s more… a heaviness in my heart, I suppose. I don’t enjoy things anymore. The garden… I used to love tending to my roses, but now… it feels like a chore. Even seeing my grandchildren… it doesn’t bring the same joy. I find myself just… wanting to be alone, mostly. And sleeping… I sleep too much, or not at all. It’s a muddle, really. A very frustrating muddle.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Derasmo. That sounds incredibly difficult, and it's good you're recognizing these changes. It's not unusual to experience these feelings, but it’s important to explore what’s going on. You mentioned sleeping too much or not at all. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it varies, Doctor. Some nights, I can’t close my eyes at all. I’ll lie there for hours, just… thinking. Worrying, mostly. About everything and nothing. Then, other nights, I’ll sleep for ten, twelve hours straight and still wake up feeling exhausted. It’s quite… disruptive. I used to have such a regular schedule, you see. Everything planned and orderly. Now… it's all gone to pot, as they say. I haven't been eating properly either, I suspect. Just picking at things. Not much appetite.
DOCTOR: I see. So, difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, and a loss of enjoyment in things you used to like. It sounds like these symptoms are impacting your daily life significantly. Do you mind if I ask about your medical history?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Though, truthfully, I haven’t been to the doctor much in recent years. I always thought I was quite healthy, you see. I was always active. Lifeguarding kept me in good shape, and the ski patrol… well, that was a good workout! I had a bad fall skiing about ten years ago, broke my wrist, but that healed properly. Other than that… nothing major. A few colds, the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. My mother… she had high blood pressure, if that’s relevant. And a touch of arthritis in her later years. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Derasmo. That’s helpful. A history of activity is good to know, and the wrist fracture is noted. The family history of high blood pressure and arthritis is also useful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not regularly. I take a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if my joints are particularly achy, I’ll take ibuprofen. Just a couple, when needed. Nothing prescribed, mind you. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. My daughter keeps suggesting all sorts of things, various herbal remedies and such, but I haven’t gotten around to trying any of them. Honestly, Doctor, I just thought I was having a bit of a… slump. A temporary thing. But it’s been going on for months now, and… well, that’s why I’m here, isn’t it? I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mrs. Derasmo. It’s good you're being proactive about getting to the bottom of this. Now, I’d like to ask a few more questions, just to get a more complete picture. Have you experienced any recent significant life changes or stressors?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? My husband… we divorced about five years ago. It was… amicable, I suppose. We’d simply grown apart. He moved to Florida, and… well, it was for the best, really. But it was still a… a wrench. And my son… he’s been having some trouble at work, financial difficulties, mostly. I try to help him, but… you know how it is. And my daughter… she's always been a worrier. Constantly fussing over me. It’s all rather… a lot. And I miss my work, truthfully. Retired life… it’s not quite what I expected. It feels… empty sometimes. Does that make any sense? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mrs. Derasmo. That makes perfect sense. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a lot of significant life changes and stressors, and that's completely understandable. It takes courage to share these things. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your physical health, just to rule out any other possible causes for how you’re feeling. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Well, yes, actually. I have. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes feel… looser. I suspect I’ve lost a good bit of weight, maybe ten or fifteen pounds. It's not intentional, mind you. I haven't been actively trying to lose weight. It's just… I haven't had much of an appetite, as I mentioned. And when I do eat, I don't feel hungry for very long. It’s rather worrying, to be honest. I used to have a very healthy appetite. I’m not one for dainty portions, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Derasmo. Weight loss, decreased appetite… I'm noting all of this. And have you been experiencing any fatigue, besides the tiredness you mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A deep, bone-deep fatigue. It’s… exhausting just to get through the day. I used to be able to go, go, go, and not feel a thing. Now… even simple tasks feel like a monumental effort. Getting out of bed, doing the gardening… it takes all my energy. I find myself just wanting to sit and do nothing, most of the time. And it’s not a restful sort of tiredness, either. Even when I do sleep, I don’t wake up feeling refreshed. It’s… a constant, draining exhaustion. It’s making everything so much harder. I used to enjoy being active and useful, and now… I feel like I'm just existing, rather than living.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Derasmo. That sounds incredibly debilitating. I think at this point, it would be helpful to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to check your vital signs and get a better sense of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. I suppose. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I’m ready whenever you are. Though I must warn you, my blood pressure sometimes runs a little high when I’m nervous.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Derasmo. That’s good to know. If you could please have a seat, we'll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, as you mentioned, but not significantly so given your nervousness. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft. Your reflexes are normal. I’m going to listen to your thyroid now, just to rule that out. Your thyroid feels normal. Now, I’m just going to check your skin. Your skin is a little dry, which is common with age. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal any obvious abnormalities, but it’s not enough to determine the cause of your symptoms. Based on what you've told me and this brief exam, I think it’s important to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to how you’re feeling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. Blood work seems sensible. Anything that might help. I trust your judgement. I just… I want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mrs. Derasmo, that’s not too much to ask at all. And we’ll do everything we can to help you get there. I’m ordering some standard blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid test, and a vitamin D level. We’ll also check your vitamin B12 level, just to be thorough. The lab will send the results to me, and I’ll review them as soon as they’re available, usually within a few days. In the meantime, I want to be cautious. Given your symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and decreased appetite, I'm also going to ask you a few more questions about any changes in your bowel habits or unintentional changes in your skin. Have you noticed any blood in your stool recently, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No… not exactly blood, Doctor. But… my bowels haven’t been regular lately. More… constipated, I suppose. And… sometimes I feel a bit of discomfort, a dull ache in my abdomen. I haven’t thought much of it, just put it down to getting older, you see. And… my skin… well, it feels a bit dry, as you noticed. And… …I’ve noticed a small lump on my neck, just here. It’s been there for a few weeks, I think. I hadn't mentioned it before, because it doesn't seem particularly large, and I didn't want to worry you unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mrs. Derasmo. It’s important that you told me about the lump. It’s good you’re being thorough. Given the lump on your neck, along with your other symptoms, I think it’s important to be cautious and get a more definitive assessment. I'm going to recommend an ultrasound of your neck to evaluate the lump further. An ultrasound will help us determine if it's benign or if further investigation is needed. I want to be upfront, Mrs. Derasmo. While it's likely nothing serious, it's best to rule out any potential causes for the lump. I’m also going to recommend a referral to a general surgeon for a consultation. They will be able to provide a more detailed assessment and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. An ultrasound and a surgeon… it sounds a bit frightening, to be honest. But… I suppose it’s better to know, isn’t it? I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. I don't want to be a burden to anyone. I just want to feel normal again, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? It's just... I've always been so active and independent, and now... I feel like a shadow of my former self.
DOCTOR: No, Mrs. Derasmo, it’s absolutely not too much to ask. And you are not a burden. We’re here to help you, and we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. I understand how frightening this must be, and I want to assure you that we'll take things one step at a time. We'll get the ultrasound scheduled as soon as possible, and I'll refer you to a highly skilled surgeon. In the meantime, I want to discuss some basic supportive care measures. I’m going to recommend that you stay hydrated, eat a balanced diet as best as you can, and get as much rest as possible. I also want to encourage you to reach out to your support network – your family and friends – for emotional support. It’s important to have people you can lean on during times like these. I'm also going to prescribe a mild stool softener to help with the constipation. We want to make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. I’ll also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the ultrasound results and any concerns you may have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. A stool softener and a follow-up appointment… I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. Thank you, Doctor Giganti. For everything. You’ve… you’ve given me a little bit of hope, which I haven't felt in a long time. I’ll schedule the ultrasound and the follow-up appointment. And I’ll try to stay positive, as you suggested. Thank you, Doctor. I truly appreciate it. I think… I think that’s all for today, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Derasmo, that’s all for today. And you’re very welcome. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you next week. Take care, and try to get some rest. .
