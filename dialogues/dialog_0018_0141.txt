DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Ferndeding. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this itch, see? All over. It's been going on for a couple of weeks now, and it's driving me a bit crazy, honestly. Not a sharp itch, more… persistent. Like a constant little annoyance. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, not that I can recall anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ferndeding. A persistent itch for a couple of weeks… that certainly sounds frustrating. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… everywhere, like I said. Arms, legs, back… even my chest a little. It doesn’t really seem worse in one spot than another. And it's not like a rash, there’s nothing visible, which is what’s so confusing. I keep thinking I’m imagining it, but then I start scratching and… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's generalized, meaning all over your body, and there's no visible rash. That is often more perplexing. And you haven’t noticed anything that seems to trigger it or make it better?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve tried different lotions – unscented ones, mostly, because I didn't want to make it worse – but nothing seems to help. Hot showers don't really do anything, cold showers don’t do anything. I even tried that oatmeal bath my wife used to take when she had eczema, but… no luck there either. It just… is. It's been pretty consistent, day in and day out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferndeding. So, no relief with lotions, temperature changes, or even an oatmeal bath. That gives us some helpful information. Let’s delve a bit deeper into your medical history. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don’t think so. Nothing I’ve ever been formally diagnosed with, anyway. I get a little sniffly in the spring with the pollen, but that’s just normal, you know? Nothing serious. I used to be stung by a bee when I was a kid, but I didn't have a bad reaction, just a bit of swelling. Oh! And I can’t eat shellfish. Not an allergy, exactly, more like… a very unpleasant experience. I learned that lesson quickly.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. Shellfish intolerance is important to note. And no significant drug allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just Medicare, really. I take a low-dose aspirin, doctor recommended it years ago for my heart, and that’s about it. Nothing else. No vitamins, no supplements, no creams or anything like that. I try to keep it simple, honestly. I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Low-dose aspirin for your heart. And no other medications. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or skin conditions?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor did mention some slightly elevated blood pressure at my last check-up, but he said to just watch my salt intake and it seemed okay at the next visit. Other than that… I had pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered fully. And… my wife, God rest her soul, she had eczema, so I’ve been around it a bit, but I've never had it myself. Oh! And I had my gallbladder out about fifteen years ago. I think that’s everything, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated blood pressure, pneumonia in the past, history of eczema exposure, and gallbladder removal fifteen years ago. Thank you for that detailed information, Mr. Ferndeding. Now, a few questions about your family history… Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or children – with skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: My mother had pretty bad eczema when she was a girl, I remember that. Lots of creams and bandages. And my sister, she has psoriasis, on her elbows mostly. Nothing too severe, but it flares up sometimes. My father was healthy as a horse, never had a day’s illness in his life. And I didn’t have any children, unfortunately. But no, no other skin problems that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Ferndeding. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle… Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking, never touched it. And I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing heavy, just a little red wine. And absolutely no drugs, never have, never will. I prefer a quiet evening at home, honestly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Ferndeding. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a closer look at your skin, despite the lack of visible rash, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Skin is warm and dry. No visible rash, hives, or lesions. Capillary refill is normal. I'm not detecting any significant abnormalities on palpation. No obvious signs of skin irritation or infection. However, I do notice some mild dryness on your forearms. Based on the examination, there’s no immediate indication of an obvious dermatological cause for the itch. Given your history and the lack of visible findings, several possibilities come to mind. It could be related to dry skin, a mild allergic reaction to something you've been exposed to, or, less commonly, an internal medical condition.
PATIENT: That’s… a relief, honestly, that it's not something obvious. But also a little frustrating, you know? If it's not something I can see… what is it? You mentioned an internal condition… what would that even look like? And what do we do about it? Do we need blood tests or anything like that? I’m not a fan of needles, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Ferndeding. It’s often more challenging to diagnose conditions without a clear visual component. And I completely understand your aversion to needles. Several internal conditions can present with generalized itching, although it’s not the most common symptom. These include liver disease, kidney disease, thyroid problems, and certain types of cancer, such as lymphoma. However, it’s important to emphasize that these are less likely possibilities, and we need to rule out simpler causes first. To start, I’d like to order some basic blood tests to assess your liver and kidney function, your thyroid levels, and a complete blood count to look for any abnormalities. This will help us to narrow down the potential causes and determine if further investigation is necessary. The blood tests will involve a standard venipuncture – a blood draw from your arm. It’s a relatively quick procedure, and the discomfort is usually minimal. We can also discuss some topical treatments to alleviate the itch in the meantime, such as an emollient moisturizer and, if needed, a mild corticosteroid cream. Would you be comfortable proceeding with the blood tests?
PATIENT: Okay… blood tests. I suppose it’s better to be thorough, even if I don’t like it. Yes, alright. Let's do the blood tests. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better. And the topical treatments sound good too, anything to get some relief. Moisturizer and cream… that doesn't sound too bad. Can we do the blood draw today, or do I need to schedule another appointment? And… where exactly will I go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Ferndeding. I'm glad you're willing to proceed. We can do the blood draw today. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. My nurse, Sarah, will escort you there and assist with the process. She's very skilled and will make you as comfortable as possible. While you’re at the lab, they will draw a vial for a Complete Blood Count , a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel which assesses your liver and kidney function, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test to check your thyroid levels. Once the results are back – typically within 2 to 3 business days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I'll write you a prescription for a high-quality emollient moisturizer, such as CeraVe or Eucerin. If the itch persists despite the moisturizer, we can consider adding a mild topical corticosteroid cream, like hydrocortisone 1%, which you can purchase over-the-counter. Do you have any questions about the blood tests, the moisturizer, or anything else at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Room 203, Sarah will help me, results in 2-3 days, moisturizer… and maybe cream if needed. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It makes me feel a little better, knowing we’re doing something. And… thank you for being patient with me. This itch is just driving me crazy. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferndeding. It's my pleasure. I understand how frustrating a persistent itch can be, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Sarah will be with you shortly to escort you to the lab. And again, thank you for coming in today. .
