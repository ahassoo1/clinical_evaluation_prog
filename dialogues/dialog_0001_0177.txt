DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard, good to see you, I guess. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Well, it's... down there. Something's...leaking. It's not right, you know? Never had this happen before. It’s kinda… gross.
DOCTOR: "Down there," huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, down there. What else would I be talking about? Honestly, doctors these days… you gotta spell everything out for them. It's like talking to a kid.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Let's try to be… specific. Is this… urinary leakage?
PATIENT: Urinary? What’s that even mean? No, no pee. It’s… different. Like… stuff coming out. Not when I go to the bathroom, but… just… coming out. I don't know! I just know it's not normal.
DOCTOR: Right. "Stuff." Okay. And how long has this “stuff” been… appearing?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… a few days, maybe? I don't keep track of things like that. Time just kinda… goes. It started after… well, after that young man came over. From the village. Helped me with the garden. Nice boy, but… I guess things happen, don't they?
DOCTOR: A young man… helped with the garden?
PATIENT: Yes! He pulled weeds, trimmed the bushes, the whole thing. Real strong boy. And polite. What’s that got to do with… this? Are you accusing him of something? He's a good kid, that one.
DOCTOR: No, no accusations. Just… gathering information. So, this started after he left the garden?
PATIENT: Well, yes! That's what I'm trying to tell you! A couple days after. I didn't think much of it at first, but it just… keeps happening. It's embarrassing, you know? A woman my age…
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there any pain, burning, or itching associated with this… discharge?
PATIENT: Discharge? You mean the… stuff? No, not really pain. It's just… uncomfortable. And kinda smelly, if I'm being honest. It's not pleasant, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Smelly discharge, no pain. Have you noticed any sores, blisters, or changes in the skin in that area?
PATIENT: Sores? Blisters? Goodness, no. I would know if I had something like that. I keep myself clean, thank you very much. Everything looks… normal. Except for the leaking, of course. That's why I'm here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just… take a look. If you don't mind. I'm going to need you to get on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Now you want to look? After all this questioning? Fine. But don't go poking around too much. I'm a delicate flower, you know. And make it quick, please.
DOCTOR: Just lie back. I'll be as quick as possible.
PATIENT: Ugh. This paper is cold. And thin. Honestly, the things we put ourselves through for doctors… Hurry it up, will you?
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some mild redness and… a small amount of discharge. It's difficult to say much without a proper exam. Looks like a possible case of vaginitis. Probably bacterial. We can do a quick swab to confirm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Vagi-what? What's a swab? Is that going to hurt? And what's "bacterial"? Is that… serious? I don't like the sound of "bacterial" at all.
DOCTOR: A swab is just a little cotton stick. We use it to take a small sample of the discharge to see what’s causing the irritation. “Bacterial” just means it’s caused by bacteria. It’s usually not serious, easily treated with some cream. We’ll just do a quick test, it shouldn’t be painful. Unless you’re overly sensitive.
PATIENT: Sensitive? I'm not overly sensitive! I've had children, you know. This is nothing. But… what if it's something worse? Something… catchable? From that boy? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Genard, let's not jump to conclusions. It’s probably just a minor infection. We'll do the swab, get the results, and then we'll talk about treatment. Worrying won’t help. Now, if you could just… relax.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright. Just get it over with. But be gentle, you hear? And don't go digging around!
DOCTOR: Okay, done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
PATIENT: Ugh. It wasn't pleasant. And now what? Do I have to wait forever for these "results"? And what if it is something bad? I just don't like being poked and prodded. It's undignified.
DOCTOR: The results will be back in a few days. We'll call you. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a general antibiotic cream. It covers most common infections. It's probably a waste of time, but it's better than nothing. Here. Use as directed. And try not to worry. Honestly. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Antibiotic cream? That sounds… strong. And what if it doesn't work? Oh, and what about that boy? Should I… tell him? He probably gave it to me! This is just a mess. No, I don't think I have any other questions. Just… get it over with. I want to go home.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, you have the prescription. Follow the instructions. If it doesn’t improve in a week, come back. And honestly, I doubt he gave it to you, but… you can tell him if you want. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
