DOCTOR: Hi Leander, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Hello Doctor. Um... my ear. It feels… blocked, I suppose. Full. Not painful, just… there. I don’t really… remember much about why it’s like that, to be honest. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blocked ear that’s been going on for a while. Not painful, just a feeling of fullness. I understand it’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, that’s alright. Let’s try to get a better idea of what’s going on. First, can you tell me, is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the one, I think. Yes, definitely the left one. The right one seems fine. Though… everything feels a bit muffled lately, doesn't it? Maybe that's just me getting old. I really can’t say for certain if the other one is affected or not. It’s… difficult to remember what “normal” sounds like anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, so primarily the left ear with fullness, and you’ve noticed some overall muffling of sound, which makes it tricky to compare. That's perfectly understandable. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness and muffling?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No dizziness, no… ringing, not that I recall. Sometimes it feels a little… itchy, deep inside. But that could just be the weather. Everything’s so humid these days. I don’t really… feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… this ear. And a bit tired, but who isn’t? I work outside, you know. Agricultural inspections. Long days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness or ringing, occasional itching in the ear, and you’re generally feeling tired due to your work. No fever, chills, or any drainage from the ear?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And definitely no drainage. It's just… full. Like when you're flying in an airplane, you know? But it hasn’t gone away. I… I don’t think I’ve been on a plane in years, actually. But that’s the closest I can describe it. It’s just… persistent. Is that… bad? I really just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent fullness, similar to the sensation during airplane descent, no drainage or fever. That helps. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else your other doctors have told you about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… difficult. My wife – she handled all that. I… I remember something about my cholesterol being a little high, maybe? And… she mentioned something about my blood pressure once, but I wasn’t really listening, to be honest. I mostly just followed her instructions. She passed away a few years ago, you see. So… I haven’t really kept up with all that sort of thing. I have private insurance, though, if that helps.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Leander. That must be incredibly difficult. It’s perfectly alright that you haven’t been keeping track of your medical details recently. We can work through this together. Okay, so potentially slightly elevated cholesterol and blood pressure in the past. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Not that I remember. A few… broken bones when I was a boy, climbing trees, foolish things. But nothing… serious. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. Just… this ear. And a bit forgetful, I suppose. That’s probably just age, though. Or stress. It’s… hard to keep track of things these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get a bit of a rash from poison ivy, when I was gardening, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? Nothing my wife specifically warned me about, anyway. She was always very careful about those things. I really don’t think so. No. Nothing I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my joints. They ache sometimes, you know, from being out in the fields all day. Nothing regular, just when they flare up. I think it’s… ibuprofen? Or naproxen? Something like that. I buy it at the shop, no prescription. And… sometimes a vitamin D supplement in the winter. My wife thought I wasn’t getting enough sun. That's all. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional ibuprofen or naproxen for joint pain, and a vitamin D supplement. Okay, that’s helpful. Let’s take a quick look at your ear, if you don’t mind. I’m just going to take a look inside your left ear to see what’s going on. It might be a little uncomfortable for a moment, but it shouldn't be painful.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, if you would. It’s… sensitive. I really don't like things in my ears. I always feel… off-balance afterwards. But do what you need to do, Doctor. I just want this feeling to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm seeing some cerumen – that’s earwax – buildup in the ear canal. It's quite impacted, actually, and slightly obscuring the view of the ear drum. The ear drum itself appears intact, but it's difficult to get a clear assessment with the wax present. No signs of acute infection at this time. Based on what I’m seeing, the fullness is most likely due to this earwax buildup. It's common, especially as we get older. The wax can become compacted and cause that blocked sensation. It could be contributing to the muffling you're experiencing as well. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: Wax? That’s… all it is? I thought it was something… serious. Oh. Well, that’s… good, I suppose. Is it… easy to fix? Can you just… take it out? I really don’t want to come back here again, if I can avoid it. I don’t like this feeling of being… poked and prodded, if you understand. It makes me nervous. So, yes. Can you just remove it? Please?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It's good news that it's likely just wax, and yes, we can certainly try to remove it. There are a few ways to do this. We can try earwax softening drops first, which you’d use at home for a few days, and then come back for a checkup and I can gently remove the remaining wax. Or, I can attempt manual removal right now. Manual removal can be a little uncomfortable, and there's a small risk of irritation, but it's usually quite effective. It depends on how much wax is present and how sensitive your ear is. Which approach would you prefer?
PATIENT: Hmm. Manual removal… sounds a bit unpleasant. The drops sound… easier. Less poking, I suppose. Yes, the drops. Please. Just the drops, if you don't mind. And… how long do I need to use them for? And will they… sting? Honestly, I just want this over with. This whole thing is making me very anxious. I just want to be able to hear properly again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The drops are a good option if you’re feeling anxious. It’s less invasive, and often very effective. I’m prescribing you ceruminolytic drops – they’ll soften the wax. You’ll use 5 drops in your left ear twice a day for five days. Lie on your side with the affected ear facing up, and remain there for 5-10 minutes after applying the drops to allow them to work. There may be a slight stinging sensation initially, but it should be brief. If it's severe or persists, stop using the drops and contact me immediately. After five days, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so I can examine your ear and remove any remaining wax. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Five days… alright. Yes, that sounds… manageable. Alright. Five days of drops, then come back. And if it stings badly, stop. Yes. I think I can remember that. And… what if it doesn’t work? What if the wax doesn’t come out? I really don't want to have to keep coming back here. This is… stressful.
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern, Leander. If the drops don't fully remove the wax, we can repeat the treatment for another five days, or consider a different method – like irrigation, which involves gently flushing the ear with warm water. It’s rare, but if the wax is particularly impacted, we might need to refer you to an audiologist for specialized removal. But let’s start with the drops, and see how you do. Here are the instructions again, just in case. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
