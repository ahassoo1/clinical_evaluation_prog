DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it's about this… letter. For a pet. I think. My daughter, she said I needed something from a doctor to… keep him? It's all a bit fuzzy, to be frank. She handles most of these things. I just… show up and sign things usually. Is that what this is about? A signing thing?
DOCTOR: A letter… regarding a pet?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! A pet. A lovely little thing, really. A chihuahua. Tiny, you know? She's very fond of it. Though, honestly, I don’t see the fuss. It’s a dog. People keep dogs all the time. But apparently, there's some sort of… requirement now? For a letter? From a doctor? It seems a bit much, doesn’t it? Are you sure you’re the right person for this? Maybe it’s a vet I need? I wouldn’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, while I appreciate your…directness, this is unusual. A medical letter for pet ownership… it’s not standard practice. However, I see here – – that this is regarding an Emotional Support Animal registration. Your daughter initiated this process, and it seems they require a statement from a licensed physician confirming a patient’s need for such an animal. It’s… a growing trend. So, while a veterinarian addresses the animal’s health, I am here to assess your health and determine if you have a condition that would warrant this documentation. Now, can you tell me a bit about why your daughter believes you require an Emotional Support Animal?
PATIENT: Oh. Emotional Support Animal. Right. That's what she said. Honestly, I thought it was some nonsense paperwork for a new apartment or something. See, she worries too much. She says I’ve been… “stressed” since the divorce. Which, well, yes, it wasn’t pleasant. But stressed doesn’t mean I need a dog to hold my hand, does it? I mean, I manage. I have my book club, I go to the market… I’m perfectly capable. Is she telling you I’m… unwell? Because that’s a bit rude, frankly. She always exaggerates.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I assure you, I am not taking sides. Your daughter's concern, while perhaps… overly enthusiastic, does not necessarily equate to a claim of illness. However, to properly assess whether documentation is appropriate, I need to understand the impact this divorce has had on your well-being. You mentioned it wasn't pleasant. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Where do I begin? He… wasn't a good man, Doctor. Always wanting things his way. Controlling, really. And then there was… well, never you mind the details. It was a long time ago. But it left me… unsettled. I suppose. I didn't sleep well for a while. And I lost interest in things. But I got over it! Eventually. I threw myself into my hobbies, made new friends… I’m fine now. Truly. I just… don't like dwelling on the past. It’s rather unpleasant, you see. So, honestly, I don’t understand why she’s bringing this up now. It’s all very dramatic.
DOCTOR: "Reports prior sleep disturbance and loss of interest, currently denies ongoing symptoms." So, you say you are currently sleeping well and enjoying your usual activities?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Sleeping perfectly well, thank you very much. And enjoying my book club, and my trips to the market… and I’ve started a new pottery class, which is lovely. Keeps my hands busy. And I’m perfectly capable of managing my own affairs, thank you. I really don't see what any of this has to do with a chihuahua. Honestly, I suspect she just wants an excuse to spoil the poor thing even more. It has a little wardrobe, you know. A wardrobe! It’s ridiculous. So, can we just get this letter signed so I can be on my way? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, simply stating you are "fine" is not a sufficient medical assessment. While I appreciate you sharing your activities, I need to understand if these experiences—the divorce and the period following—caused any lingering effects. Have you experienced any anxiety, depression, or panic attacks?
PATIENT: Anxiety? Panic attacks? Doctor, are you suggesting I'm some sort of… fragile flower? I’ve lived a full life! I've raised a daughter, I’ve managed a household, I’ve navigated… difficult situations. I’ve certainly felt sad at times, naturally. Who wouldn’t after a divorce? But anxiety? Panic attacks? Absolutely not. I’m a perfectly rational, composed woman. I think your daughter is… well, she worries too much. She always has. She reads too many articles online, I suspect. Honestly, I find this entire line of questioning rather… insulting. I came here for a letter, not a psychological evaluation.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration. However, providing documentation for an Emotional Support Animal carries a responsibility. It’s not simply a formality. I need to ascertain if you genuinely have a condition that is alleviated by the presence of an animal. It sounds as though, based on your description, your daughter may be projecting her concerns onto you. Now, let me ask this: have you ever been diagnosed with, or received treatment for, any mental health condition?
PATIENT: Treatment? For a mental health condition? Doctor, that is preposterous! I’ve never needed “treatment” for anything! I’m a Nigerian woman, we are strong! We deal with things. We don't run to doctors for every little… feeling. My mother, she survived a war! A war! A few years of unhappiness after a divorce doesn’t exactly compare, does it? Honestly, this is becoming quite ridiculous. I think I'm going to… I’m not sure I want to continue this line of questioning. Perhaps I should get a second opinion. From someone who doesn't assume I'm some sort of… delicate flower in need of constant coddling.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, please, sit down. I am not attempting to insult you or suggest you are fragile. I am merely fulfilling my professional obligation to conduct a thorough assessment. However, if you are unwilling to provide further information, I cannot, in good conscience, provide the documentation your daughter requests. It would be irresponsible. Now, I see from your EHR that you had a physical exam in 2023 with Dr. Adebayo. Were any mental health concerns discussed during that visit?
