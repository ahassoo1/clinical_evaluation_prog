DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. Been trouble with them, on and off. It’s… difficult to explain. It happens again and again. I don't quite recall when it started, to be honest. It’s just… bothersome. I hope we can get this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Right, your waterworks, you said. On and off trouble. I understand. “Waterworks” can mean a lot of things, so let’s try to be a little more specific. Could you describe what's been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, specific… right. Well, it feels like… needing to go very suddenly. And it… burns, sometimes, when I… go. Not always, mind you. And it feels… incomplete, like I haven't quite finished, even when I have. It’s terribly inconvenient, especially when I'm… travelling. I do a lot of travelling for my work, you see. With the… vehicles. But I'm not sure if that's related. Does that make any sense? I apologize if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, no rambling at all, Claudene. That’s helpful. Sudden urge to urinate, burning sensation sometimes, and a feeling of incompleteness… Yes, I'm starting to get a picture. Does the burning happen during urination, or afterwards?
PATIENT: Oh, during, Doctor. Yes, definitely during. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… stinging. And sometimes there's a little… discomfort afterwards, but mostly it's while it’s happening. I always have to make sure I know where a… facilities are, you understand? It’s really rather… unsettling. I don't remember ever having this bad before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Burning during urination… That's important. And you mentioned this feels different than anything you've experienced before?
PATIENT: Yes, different. Definitely. I’ve… had little twinges now and again, but nothing like this. This is… more constant. Or, not constant, exactly, but… more frequent and… stronger. It’s been happening for… well, I can’t say precisely how long. A few months, maybe? It’s all a bit of a blur, I'm afraid. I’ve been so busy with work… the vehicles, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand things can get blurry with a busy schedule, Claudene. Let’s try to go through some general questions, just to get a fuller picture. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… goodness. No, I don't think so. No, I’m quite sure. I would remember that, wouldn’t I? No blood. But… sometimes the colour is a little… darker, maybe? Not bright red, just… not as pale as usual. It's hard to describe, and I don't pay much attention, if I'm honest. I really hope this isn’t anything serious, Doctor. I have a lot of travelling planned.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker urine sometimes. That's good to know. Now, have you been having any pain in your lower back or sides?
PATIENT: Lower back… well, I do a lot of lifting at work, you see, with the vehicles. So my back is often a little… sore. But not a sharp pain, Doctor. More of a dull ache. It comes and goes. I assumed it was just from the… physical work. Not really related to… this. I take some… pills for it sometimes, but nothing strong. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. And has this back pain been… worse recently, or is it about the same as usual?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. No, I don’t think it's worse. About the same, yes. Just… always there, a little. I’ve had it for years, really. It’s just… part of the job, you see, with the vehicles. Heavy lifting and bending, you understand. I try to be careful, but… sometimes it's unavoidable. I'm not sure if that's relevant to… this trouble, Doctor. I apologize for rambling.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Claudene. It's helpful to have all of this information. Now, one more question for now. Have you been feeling feverish or experiencing chills recently?
PATIENT: Feverish… chills? Oh… goodness, no. I don't think so. No fever, no chills. I'm usually quite… robust, you see. I don't get ill very often. I haven’t felt unwell in any other way, really. Just this… problem with my waterworks, you understand. I really hope it’s nothing serious, Doctor. I have a long journey planned next month. With the vehicles, of course. It's terribly important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Claudene. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to listen to your abdomen and check a few things. It won't take long. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. Yes. I suppose so. Just… be quick, if you don’t mind. I have a lot on my plate, you see. With the vehicles. But yes, alright. Go ahead. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be gentle. I'm just going to feel your abdomen, Claudene. Let me know if anything feels tender. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. There. Just… a little. On the left side. Not sharp, you understand. Just… a little sensitive. And… there, too. A little. On the right. It's hard to describe. Just… a general discomfort. It's probably just… my digestion. I don't have the best diet, you see. Always travelling, you understand. With the vehicles. It’s difficult to eat properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild tenderness on both sides. And I’m just listening to your abdomen now. Your bowel sounds are… normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your back. Just to rule out any kidney issues. Could you lean forward for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Kidney issues? Goodness. Yes, lean forward. Just… be quick, if you don’t mind, Doctor. I have a lot of travelling planned, you see. With the vehicles. It’s a terribly important journey. Are my kidneys alright? I hope so. They've always been… reliable, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your kidneys sound… normal. No abnormal sounds. Alright, Claudene. That’s all for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you might have a urinary tract infection, or UTI. But to be sure, we need to do a urine test. We’ll send a sample to the lab to check for bacteria.
PATIENT: A… a urine test? Oh, goodness. A UTI? Is that… serious? Will I need… pills? I really don't like taking pills, Doctor. And I have a terribly important journey planned, you see. With the vehicles. Will this interfere with my travelling? I really hope not. Perhaps it’s just… a little something I ate? I don't have a very good diet, you understand. Always on the road, with the vehicles.
DOCTOR: A UTI can be uncomfortable, Claudene, but it’s usually treatable with antibiotics – pills, as you mentioned. We need to confirm with the test first, of course. As for interfering with your journey, that depends on the severity and how quickly we can get it under control. We’ll know more once the lab results are back. We can discuss options, including potentially postponing your trip if needed, but let’s not jump to conclusions yet. First, let’s get the urine sample. The nurse will give you a cup and instructions. It’s a simple test. And yes, you are right, sometimes it can just be something you ate, but we need to rule out an infection first. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A urine test. Yes. I suppose so. I don’t have much choice, do I? The nurse will bring a cup? Very well. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a lot on my plate, you see. With the vehicles. I really hope I don’t have an infection. It would be terribly inconvenient. Postponing my trip is… unthinkable. But yes, alright. I'll give a sample. Just… be quick about it, if you don't mind. I have a long journey ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. We’ll get the sample processed as quickly as possible. I'll have the nurse come in with the cup right away. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids – water is best. And if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain in your back or sides, please call the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. Just… this urine test. And… the pills. I really don’t like pills, Doctor. But I suppose I have no choice, if I need them. And… the journey. I really hope this doesn’t interfere with the journey. It's terribly important, you see. With the vehicles. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. Just… please be quick. I have a lot to do. And… thank you, Doctor. For your time. I hope this is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Claudene. We’ll do our best to get you sorted quickly. The nurse will be in shortly. And don't worry too much – we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Thank you for coming in today. .
