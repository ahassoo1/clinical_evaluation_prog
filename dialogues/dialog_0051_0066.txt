DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, for the past…oh, I’d say about three weeks now, I’ve been experiencing this…sensation in my back. It’s hard to describe. It feels like it’s popping or clicking when I move certain ways. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s…noticeable. And a little unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sensation in your back for about three weeks now. Not painful, but unsettling. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about where in your back this is happening?
PATIENT: Certainly. It seems to be primarily in my lower back, Doctor. Right around where my spine curves in, you know? And sometimes I feel it a little higher up, between my shoulder blades, but it’s much less frequent there. It’s definitely most pronounced in the small of my back. I do a lot of bending and twisting at work—I repair electrical systems in trains, so there’s a fair amount of maneuvering in tight spaces. I wonder if that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Lower back, around the spinal curve, with occasional sensation between the shoulder blades. And you mentioned your work—repairing electrical systems in trains involves bending and twisting. That’s helpful information. To get a clearer picture, could you describe exactly what movements trigger this popping or clicking?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. It’s easiest to trigger when I bend forward to pick something up, or when I twist my torso—like when I’m reaching for a tool behind me. Also, if I stand for a long time and then bend over quickly, that usually does it. It’s not constant, mind you. It doesn’t happen every time I do those things, but those are the most common triggers. It’s also a bit worse after I’ve been sitting for a while and then get up. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very clear, Mr. Mastrantonio. Bending forward, twisting, and after prolonged sitting. It sounds like it’s related to movement, which is good to know. Now, have you experienced any pain at all associated with this?
PATIENT: No, not really pain, Doctor. It's more of a…discomfort, maybe? A slight stiffness sometimes. But it’s not sharp, and it doesn't radiate or anything. It's fleeting, really. I wouldn’t even say I need to take anything for it. It’s just… worrying, because I haven’t experienced anything like this before. It just feels…off. And I need to be in good working order for my job, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so discomfort and stiffness, no radiating pain, and it’s not interfering with your daily activities. I understand your concern, especially given the physical demands of your job. We should rule out anything serious. Have you ever had any back injuries, like a sprain or fracture?
PATIENT: No, sir, I haven’t. I’ve been very fortunate, actually. I’ve always been quite careful, and I try to lift things properly. I’ve had the occasional muscle ache, as anyone does, but nothing that required a visit to the doctor. My wife always tells me I’m too cautious, but I prefer to be safe rather than sorry. I’ve always been fairly active, too – I enjoy walking, and I used to play baseball when I was younger. But no injuries, not to my back, at least.
DOCTOR: Good, that's helpful to know. No history of injury. Alright, Mr. Mastrantonio, I’d like to do a quick physical examination of your back, if that’s alright with you. Just to assess your range of motion, posture, and check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It won’t be uncomfortable, just a few simple movements. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please proceed. I trust your judgment, and I want to get to the bottom of this, so any examination you deem necessary, I'm happy to comply. I’ll just… loosen my belt a bit here.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. Alright, if you could lie face down for me, please. I’m going to start by palpating your spine to check for any tenderness. Just relax as much as possible. Okay, tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort as I press here…and here…and along the muscles on either side of your spine. Anything at all?
PATIENT: Alright. No, that’s…not painful, exactly. Just…a little bit of pressure, naturally. But no sharp pain, no shooting sensations. It’s not particularly uncomfortable, Doctor. I feel a little bit of stiffness, but that’s probably just from lying here. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No significant tenderness. Now, I’m going to ask you to gently bend forward, then backward, and then side to side. Just go as far as you comfortably can, and stop if you feel any pain. We’re just assessing your range of motion. Alright, go ahead and bend forward…and backward…and now, let’s try twisting to the right…and to the left.
PATIENT: Alright…bending forward… …and backward. …and twisting to the right. …and to the left. I did feel that little click again when I twisted to the right, Doctor. Just like I sometimes do when I’m at work. It doesn't hurt, but it’s definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Mastrantonio. I noticed a slight limitation in your forward flexion and that audible click upon twisting to the right, which you’ve also experienced independently. Everything else seems within normal limits. Based on what you’ve told me, and my initial examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing some minor facet joint dysfunction. It’s quite common, especially with jobs that involve repetitive bending and twisting. It’s not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable. To confirm this, and rule out any other potential causes, I’d like to order some X-rays of your lower back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays, you say? Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If it will help determine the cause and ensure nothing more serious is going on, then absolutely. I trust your judgment. I’ve always believed in being thorough. When would those be scheduled? And are there any preparations I need to make beforehand?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, I've submitted the order to the radiology department. They should call you within 24-48 hours to schedule an appointment. There are no specific preparations needed—you don’t need to fast or anything like that. Just wear comfortable clothing. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activities that aggravate your symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help manage any discomfort. And gentle stretching can also be beneficial, but avoid any movements that cause pain. We'll review the X-ray results when they're available and discuss a more definitive treatment plan. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. No strenuous activity, over-the-counter pain relief if needed, and gentle stretching. I can certainly manage that. I appreciate you being so thorough, and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing we’re taking the right steps to address this. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mastrantonio. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms—such as severe pain, numbness, or weakness—please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. Otherwise, we’ll see you after the X-rays. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you, Doctor Glazewski. I will certainly follow your instructions and keep you informed. Thank you again for your time and expertise.
