DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 90 years young. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Lessie, you said? That’s a nice name. Hmm… what brings me in… Well, it's this cough. Been nagging at me for a while now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Doesn’t bring anything up, you know? Just… scratchy. Feels older than I am, if that makes sense. I forget how long it’s been exactly… a good while though.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A cough that’s been lingering for a while can certainly be bothersome. And it’s common for things to feel longer when we’re not feeling our best. Just to get a better understanding, Mr. Pavlovic, when you say “a while,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Rough estimate… Let me think. It feels like… after the winter, maybe? Or was it last fall? I used to have a good sense of time, working on the cars and all, keeping things scheduled. But things… blur these days. It's not a bad cough, mind you. Just… constant. Annoying, more than anything. I mostly just try to ignore it. My wife… she would have known exactly when it started. She always remembered everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to keep track of time, especially when dealing with a persistent symptom and other things on your mind. So, let's say, roughly after the winter months?
PATIENT: Yes, after the winter, I think. Or maybe spring? It's all a bit… mixed up. It didn't start suddenly, you see. Just… gradually got more noticeable. I don't get short of breath or anything. No fever. Just… this tickle in my throat that won't go away. I've tried drinking tea, that usually helps a little. But it keeps coming back. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit when I married my wife. A good fifty years ago, at least. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That's good information to know, Mr. Pavlovic, thank you. Yes, a history of smoking is important, even if you quit a long time ago. And it’s helpful to know it didn’t start suddenly. No fever or shortness of breath is good as well. Now, besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… Let me see. I get tired easier than I used to, but that's just getting old, isn't it? My appetite isn’t what it used to be either. Don't eat as much these days. But I don't think that's related to the cough. I have a little bit of trouble sleeping sometimes, but that’s mostly just my mind racing. Thinking about things… old times, mostly. I don’t think… no, I don’t have anything else. Just the cough, and feeling a bit tired. I haven't lost any weight, not that I've noticed. My clothes still fit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, a decreased appetite, and some trouble sleeping, but no weight loss. That's helpful to know. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, before the cough started or even recently?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… Oh dear. Now that you mention it… I think I had something back in… February, maybe? A little sniffle, a sore throat. Nothing too bad. Just stayed home for a few days, drank a lot of tea, and rested. It went away pretty quickly. I don’t remember seeing a doctor for it, just… took care of myself. I haven't been sick since then, not that I recall. It's hard to keep track, you know? Old age… everything just blends together. I'm not one for going to the doctor unless it’s absolutely necessary. My wife used to drag me in.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to not want to bother with the doctor for minor illnesses, and it's perfectly alright if you usually prefer to manage things on your own. Now, Mr. Pavlovic, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or lung disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… Well, let me think. I had high blood pressure for a while, the doctor put me on some pills for it. I don’t take them anymore. He said it was under control. Other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Worked on cars my whole life, kept me active. I never had any trouble with my lungs, not that I know of. I didn't have any serious illnesses or surgeries. I had a bad knee once, but that was just from working on the cars, not a medical condition. I used to go to the doctor regularly, but not so much anymore. My wife handled all that. It’s all… a bit fuzzy now.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. And you mentioned working on cars – is that still something you do now?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. Not anymore. My hands aren’t what they used to be. And my eyes… well, they don't see so good these days. I used to fix everything, you know? Old Fords, Chevrolets, anything. But now… I mostly just sit and remember the good old days. I like to watch TV sometimes, and listen to the radio. I have a neighbor who helps me with things around the house. He's a good kid. I miss working on the cars though. It kept me busy, kept me thinking. It was… a good life. But now… well, now I just take it easy.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve had a very full and active life, Mr. Pavlovic. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, just to complete the picture, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones, and if you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… Let me see. I take a little something for my arthritis sometimes, when my joints are acting up. It’s just an over-the-counter pain reliever, ibuprofen I think. And I take a multivitamin, just to keep my strength up. Other than that… no, nothing else. I don't take anything regularly. As for allergies… I don’t think so. Never had any problems with medications. My wife always made sure I didn't take anything I was allergic to. I can’t recall ever having a reaction to anything. She was very careful, very organized. I miss her so much. It’s hard remembering all this on my own.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to take your time. Now, Mr. Pavlovic, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I don't mind. Just let me know if anything hurts. It’s been a long time since I had a proper check-up. I trust your judgement. My wife always said it was important to listen to the doctor. Go ahead, I’m ready when you are. It’s just… a little strange, having someone poke around. But I understand it’s for the best. I'll try to relax.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Pavlovic. I'll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Your heart sounds are normal, but I do hear a slight murmur, which we’ll keep an eye on. And listening to your lungs, I hear a little bit of wheezing, mostly when you breathe out. It’s mild, but it could be contributing to your cough. Now, let’s take a quick look at your throat. Your throat is a little red, but nothing significant. It doesn’t look like a bacterial infection is causing this.
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Wheezing, you say? Is that bad, Doctor? My wife… she used to get wheezing sometimes. She had… I can't quite remember what she had. Something with her breathing. Is that what I have? The murmur… is that serious? I’m not good with all these medical terms, you see. Just tell me plain and simple, if you don’t mind. I don’t want anything too complicated. I just want to stop this cough. It’s annoying, but I don’t want to cause any trouble. Is it something serious? Do I need to take anything special?
DOCTOR: No trouble at all, Mr. Pavlovic. I understand wanting things explained simply. The wheezing means there's a little bit of narrowing in your airways, which can cause that whistling sound when you breathe. It’s not necessarily serious, but it can make it harder to breathe, and it often causes a cough. It's common in people who’ve had a cough for a while, and it’s possible it's related to what your wife experienced, although we’d need more information to know for sure. The murmur is a slight extra sound your heart makes when it beats. Many people have harmless murmurs, and it doesn't always mean there’s a problem. However, we’ll want to monitor it over time. Right now, I don’t think it’s anything immediately serious, but we need to figure out what's causing the wheezing and cough so we can treat it. I'd like to order a chest x-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and a basic blood test to rule out any infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A chest x-ray… I haven’t had one of those in years. And a blood test… I don’t like needles, Doctor. But if you think it’s necessary… alright. Whatever you think is best. Just… please be quick with the needle. My wife… she always held my hand during blood tests. It made it easier. I don’t have anyone to hold my hand now. But I trust you, Doctor. You seem very competent. So, yes, alright. Do the x-ray and the blood test. Just… tell me what to expect. I get nervous easily. And… what if something is wrong? What if it’s something serious? I just want to stop coughing. It’s ruining my evenings, watching TV and all.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious about tests, especially when you're not sure what to expect. I’ll make sure everything is as comfortable as possible. The chest x-ray is very quick – you’ll just stand in front of a machine and hold your breath for a few seconds. It doesn’t hurt at all. The blood test will just be a small prick in your arm, and it will only take a few minutes. Our nurses are very good at drawing blood, and they’ll be gentle. As for what if something is wrong, let's not jump to conclusions. We're just gathering information right now. If we find anything, we'll discuss it thoroughly and come up with a plan together. It's important to remember that many coughs are caused by simple things, like a lingering cold or mild irritation. And even if it’s something more serious, there are often effective treatments available. We'll start with the x-ray and blood test, and then we'll go from there. I’ll write up the orders now, and the nurses will come in to get you set up. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you try using a humidifier at night, and drinking plenty of fluids. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A humidifier… yes, I think so. My wife used to have one of those. It helped with her breathing sometimes. Drinking fluids… yes, that I can do. Tea, mostly. Earl Grey, with a little bit of honey. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s hard being old, you know. Everything just… aches and creaks. And it’s lonely, without my wife. But you’ve made me feel a little bit better. I trust you to take care of me. Just… let me know if anything comes up during the tests. If it hurts, or if I feel dizzy, or anything. I don't want to be a bother. I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Let’s get this over with. I just want to stop coughing.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Mr. Pavlovic. And I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. I’ll make a note of your preference for Earl Grey tea – a little comfort can make a big difference. I'll have the nurses come in to get you started with the tests. They'll explain everything in detail and answer any questions you have. And please, don’t hesitate to let them know if you’re feeling any discomfort during the procedures. We're here to take care of you every step of the way. I’ll be right back with the orders. In the meantime, just try to relax and take a few deep breaths. I’ll see you shortly.
