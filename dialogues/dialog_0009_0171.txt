DOCTOR: Good morning, Lacreasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Uh, it's my nails. They look...funny. I don't really know why I'm here, to be honest. Just...they changed. Not good changes, I don't think. They always look a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re concerned about changes in your nails. That's a good reason to come in. “Not good changes” is helpful – can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, they’re… bumpy. And kinda thick. And one of them, the big one on my hand, it's...yellowish. It's just not right. I don't paint them or anything, never have. Too much trouble. I just want them to look normal again, I guess. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. Bumpy, thick, and a yellowish discoloration on one nail… that gives me a little more to work with. When did you first notice these changes, Lacreasha?
PATIENT: Hmm... when? Oh, gosh. It feels like… a while. Maybe a few months? I don't really look at my hands, you know? I use them for work, of course, listening and all, but I don’t… admire them. So I couldn’t really say when exactly. Probably after the winter, I guess. It was a cold winter. Maybe it’s that? Is cold weather bad for nails?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, it’s common not to notice small changes immediately. A few months is helpful. Cold weather can sometimes contribute to brittle nails, but it doesn't usually cause the changes you're describing. Let’s try to get a little more detail. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with the nails?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. They don't hurt. They’re just… ugly. A little annoying when I’m typing, maybe, because they’re thick, but not painful. I’ve dropped things a few times, felt clumsy, but that's probably just me. I’m not very graceful, never have been. Is there a reason why they’d get thick, Doctor? It's embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain is good. And it’s alright to feel embarrassed; we're here to figure things out. Thickening of the nails can have a few different causes. It could be something relatively minor, or something we need to investigate further. Before we do a quick exam of your hands, let’s just go through a few general health questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your skin elsewhere on your body?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm… Well, my legs get itchy sometimes, especially in the summer. And I have this little patch on my arm that’s always a bit dry. But I just put lotion on it. It’s probably nothing. I get dry skin, always have. It’s just… old age, I think. Is that what happens when you get old, Doctor? Everything just falls apart? It’s depressing.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “falling apart,” Lacreasha, and 40 isn’t old! Skin changes are common, but we want to make sure everything is okay. The itchiness and dry patch are good things to mention. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me think. I don’t think so. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes in the spring, but everyone does, right? Dust, pollen, that sort of thing. Nothing serious. I can take most medicines, I think. I haven’t taken anything in ages, except for… oh, a pain reliever last year for my back. But that was just a one-time thing. I don't really like taking pills. They make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known significant allergies is good to know. And it’s good you're mindful of medications. Now, just to get a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Not a thing. I don't believe in all that stuff. Vitamins are just expensive pee, my mother always said. And pills… well, I told you, they make me feel funny. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Salads and stuff. Although I had a donut yesterday… it was a bad day. But that’s it, really. No pills, no vitamins. Just… me. Is this taking a long time, Doctor? I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, we're doing just fine. I just want to be thorough. Okay, one last few quick questions, then we’ll take a look at your hands. Do you have any family history of nail problems, skin conditions, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh, family... my mother, she had terrible eczema on her hands. Really bad, always peeling and itchy. She used creams and stuff, but it never really went away. And my aunt, she had something… I think it was psoriasis? On her elbows, red patches. It was… unpleasant. Besides that, nothing I can think of. Everyone just gets old, you know? And falls apart. Are we almost done? My appointment is at two.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very helpful information. Both eczema and psoriasis can sometimes have a genetic component. Okay, let’s take a look at your hands. Could you please extend your hands, palms up?
PATIENT: There they are. Awful, aren't they? You can see the bumps, and the thickness… and that yellow one is really bad. I try to ignore them, but it’s hard. They just… look unhealthy. Is it something serious, Doctor? Please tell me it's not something serious. I don't do well with serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lacreasha. I see what you mean. The thickening is most noticeable on several nails, and that yellowish discoloration on your [right/left - need to clarify which one] nail is definitely something we want to investigate. It could be several things – a fungal infection, psoriasis, or even something called nail trauma. Does that cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little. Not painful, exactly, but… sensitive. It feels… tender. Like it’s bruised, almost. But I haven’t hurt it, I don't think. I just… use my hands a lot for work, listening and things. Maybe I’ve been pressing too hard? Is that possible? They’re just… annoying, Doctor. I wish they would just go back to normal. And please, tell me it's not contagious. I don’t want to give it to anyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness around the base is good to know. It doesn’t sound like classic trauma, but it’s possible. And no, it doesn’t appear to be contagious. I’m also noting some mild redness around the base of some of the nails, and a little dryness on the back of your hands. Given your mother’s history of eczema, that’s something we should consider. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a nail fungal culture and a scraping to look for psoriasis. It's a quick and painless procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A scraping? Oh, lovely. More poking and prodding. Is it going to hurt? I really don’t like anything that involves… things being scraped off of me. But… I guess if you think it’s necessary. My mother always said to listen to the doctor, so… okay. If it’s quick. And you’ll tell me what it is, right? And what to do about it? I just want this to be over with, honestly. And I have that appointment later, so… please don’t take too long.
DOCTOR: It will be very quick, Lacreasha. I promise. It involves gently filing a small amount of nail and then collecting the filings for analysis. It shouldn’t cause any discomfort – just a little pressure. It will take just a few minutes. First, we’ll do the scraping of the yellow nail, and then a small sample from a couple of the others. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Just… will it bleed? I hate blood. And… will it make the nail look worse? It already looks awful, I don’t want it to look even worse. And… what if it is something bad? I don’t want to hear anything scary. Honestly, I think I’m just going to close my eyes. Just… do it quickly, okay? Please? And tell me when it's over. This is all very stressful.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't bleed, Lacreasha. I'll be very careful. And it won't make the nail look significantly worse, I promise. We're just taking a very small sample. Okay. Close your eyes if you'd like. I'll let you know each step as I go, and I'll tell you when we're finished. Alright, we’re almost done. Just collecting a tiny bit from this one now… and that’s it. Okay, we’re all finished. You did great. I’ll send these samples to the lab, and we should have the results in about a week. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your nails trimmed and dry, and avoiding any harsh chemicals or soaps.
PATIENT: Oh. It does look a little… worse. But I guess it had to be done. A week? A whole week of worrying? Wonderful. And what if it’s something really bad? Do I have to take pills? Or get injections? I really don’t like injections. Or pills. Or scrapings. Honestly, this is the worst day ever. Will you at least tell me if it's something I got from someone else? I don't want to be spreading anything around. And… can I get a note for work? I might need to take some time off if it's contagious. This is just… awful.
DOCTOR: It does look a little irritated now, I understand. But that should improve quickly with some gentle care. Let’s not jump to conclusions about it being “something bad” just yet. Most nail conditions are relatively minor and easily treatable. We’ll have a much better idea once we get the lab results. And regarding treatment, we’ll discuss all your options and I would never recommend anything you’re uncomfortable with. There are often topical treatments available, and we can explore those first. As for being contagious, the lab tests will help us determine that as well. If it is contagious, we’ll discuss precautions to take. And yes, absolutely, I can write you a note for work. Just tell me what you’d like it to say. Do you want me to mention the possibility of a contagious condition, or just that you’re being evaluated for a nail issue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. This is complicated. Hmm… Maybe just say I’m being evaluated for a nail issue. I don’t want to cause a panic at work. Everyone would freak out. And… say I might need to take a few days off if I feel unwell. That sounds good. And… could you maybe put something about me being a little stressed? Because this is stressing me out. A lot. It’s just… awful. Honestly, I need a donut. A big one. With sprinkles. Thank you. For the note, and for not making me take any injections. Yet. But what if the results are bad? What then? Do I have to see a specialist? I hate specialists. They always poke and prod and ask a million questions. This is just… the worst.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I can absolutely include something about you being a little stressed. It’s perfectly understandable, given everything. Here you go. “Lacreasha Thut is being evaluated for a nail issue and may require a few days off work if she experiences any discomfort. Currently experiencing some stress.” Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfect. Thank you. “Currently experiencing some stress.” That’s… an understatement. So… a week, you said? A whole week of worrying? I guess I’ll just have to try and distract myself. Maybe watch some television. Or take a nap. Or eat a lot of donuts. But what if it is something serious? And you said a specialist… what kind of specialist? A skin specialist? Or a… a nail specialist? Are there even nail specialists? Honestly, this is just… too much. I need a vacation. A long one. On a beach. With no doctors. And lots of donuts. Thank you again for the note. And for not giving me any injections. Yet. I’ll… see you in a week, I guess. Unless it’s something really bad, and I have to see a specialist. Oh, goodness. This is awful. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lacreasha. It was a pleasure meeting you. If it does turn out to be something that requires a specialist, it would likely be a dermatologist – a skin specialist. And yes, they do have expertise in nail conditions. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, alright?
