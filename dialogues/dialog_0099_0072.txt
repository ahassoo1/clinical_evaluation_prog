DOCTOR: Right. Ebony Heidenthal, 38 years old. Well, please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thanks, Doctor. It's… well, it's my memory. It's been getting worse, I think. Little things, mostly. Forgetting where I put things, names… stuff like that. It's worrying me.
DOCTOR: “Little things,” you say. Hmm. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. That’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months? It started slowly, so I didn’t really notice at first. But it feels like it’s been getting noticeably worse the last couple of months. I’m a dentist, you know, so I should be good with remembering details… it's just… not happening as easily.
DOCTOR: A dentist, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. General dentistry. I have a practice just outside of town. It's… ironic, isn't it? Remembering teeth all day, and I can't remember where I parked my car this morning! It’s a little embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Well, it's certainly… inconvenient. Alright. Let’s try to be specific. Can you give me some examples of these “little things”?
PATIENT: Okay, um… let me think. Last week, I had a patient scheduled, Mrs… oh, it’s right on the tip of my tongue… anyway, I completely blanked on her name when she came in. I just knew her face. And yesterday, I made a grocery list – a really short one, just milk, bread, and eggs – and I left the list at the store! Luckily, someone turned it in, but still. It's things like that. And sometimes I struggle to find the right word when I'm talking, even to patients. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Right. So, primarily recall issues. Names, objects… occasional word-finding difficulties. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate?
PATIENT: Concentrate… hmm. That’s a good question. I think… maybe a little? It’s hard to say for sure. I can still do my job, obviously. But sometimes I find myself re-reading things, or getting distracted more easily. Like, I’ll be examining a patient and my mind will wander, and I’ll have to consciously pull it back. It doesn't happen all the time, but it’s definitely more frequent than it used to be. I used to be able to focus really well.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. No, not really. I sleep okay, I think. I haven’t noticed any dizziness or headaches. No vision problems. I feel… generally healthy, physically. Just… forgetful. It's mostly just the memory stuff, honestly. Although… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit more… anxious lately. Just a general feeling of being… unsettled, I guess. But I figured that was just from worrying about the memory problems.
DOCTOR: Anxiety. Right. And have you noticed any changes in your mood?
PATIENT: Changes in my mood… Not really a big change, no. I mean, I get frustrated when I forget things, obviously. And a little stressed. But I wouldn't say I'm depressed or anything like that. Just… irritated, sometimes. I'm usually pretty upbeat, but this has definitely been bringing me down a bit. It's just… unsettling not to be able to rely on your own brain, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s go through some basics. Any family history of memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had some issues later in life. She was very confused a lot towards the end. I don’t know if it was Alzheimer’s or something else, honestly. Nobody really talked about it much. And my father… he just always had a terrible memory, even when he was young. It was just… him. So, maybe? It’s not like it was a sudden thing, you know?
DOCTOR: And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh. Well, I’m single. Never married. I don’t really have a lot of close family around. I mostly keep to myself, honestly. I work a lot. I don't drink or smoke. I try to eat healthy, although sometimes I grab fast food when I'm busy. I used to go hiking a lot, but I haven’t had much time for that lately. Mostly just work, and then… worry about forgetting things. It's a thrilling life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No, none. I really try to avoid taking medication if I can help it. I don’t even take anything for headaches, usually. I just… rest. Or drink a lot of water. I'm pretty healthy, like I said. No allergies either. Just… a bad memory. It’s the one thing that’s really bothering me, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, before we jump to any conclusions, let's do a quick physical exam. Just to rule out any obvious underlying issues. We’ll start with your vitals and a basic neurological assessment. If you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. I'm a little nervous, honestly, but… I'm ready. Let's get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please, have a seat. We’ll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we’ll do a quick check of your reflexes, coordination, and cognitive function. Nothing to be alarmed about. Just routine. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Normal so far. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please, relax your arms…
PATIENT: Okay, I'm trying to relax. It's just… hard to relax when you're worried about what they're going to find, you know? But… go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Now, let’s check your coordination. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is this okay? I'm trying not to blink too much. It's a little hard to focus, honestly. It’s probably just nerves.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. Just to assess your cognitive function. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… um… It’s… August 2nd. 2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I just… sometimes I get dates mixed up, especially around holidays. But I think that’s right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you spell “world” backwards?
PATIENT: Um… d-l-r-o-w? Is that right? It’s… it’s harder than it sounds. I haven't had to spell anything backwards since… school, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on this preliminary assessment, it's difficult to say definitively what's going on. Your cognitive function appears relatively intact, but your memory issues are certainly concerning. It could be stress-related, or it could be something more. Given your age and symptoms, I think it's prudent to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We'll also need to rule out thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, and early-stage dementia. I'm going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I mean, I want to know what's going on, so whatever it takes. Blood work, neurologist… I'm ready for it. I just… I hope it's not anything serious. It's scary, honestly, not knowing. So, what kind of blood work? And how long will that take? Will I need an appointment with the neurologist right away?
DOCTOR: Alright. The blood work is a standard panel – complete blood count, thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. It'll take a few days to get the results back. As for the neurologist, I'm sending a referral request in now. It may take a week or two to get an appointment, depending on their availability. I'll have my assistant contact you once an appointment is scheduled. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and maintaining a healthy diet. Try to reduce stress as much as possible. And write things down – keep a notepad with you to help with your memory. It’s a simple step, but it can be effective. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. A notepad, right. I can do that. And wait for the assistant to call. Thank you, Doctor. I guess… I guess that's all for now. I'm still a little worried, but I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out. So, I'll just go get the blood work done and wait for the call?
DOCTOR: Precisely. My assistant will contact you. If you experience any sudden changes in your condition – dizziness, headaches, confusion – don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, we'll see you after the results are back. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again. I will. Bye.
