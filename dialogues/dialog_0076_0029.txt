DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Obarr, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Norval Obarr. Though most folks just call me Norval. It’s nice to meet you, Dr… Ruocco, is it?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Ruocco is fine. Look, I’m quite busy today, so if we could just get straight to it… What brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, alright then. It’s… it’s hard to explain exactly. I just… don’t seem to be able to eat much these days. I get full awful quick, even if I haven’t had a proper meal. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It’s just… worrying, you know? I used to have a good appetite.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly a month. Maybe a little longer, hard to say for sure. It didn't come on suddenly, just… gradually got worse. I find myself leaving food on my plate, which never used to happen. My wife, Elsie, she worries too. She says I'm losing weight, though I haven't weighed myself recently.
DOCTOR: And is this…fullness… accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. No pain, no bloating… just… full. Like I’ve had a big meal when I’ve barely touched anything. Sometimes I feel a bit… tired, but I figured that was just getting old, you know? I am 88, after all. Elsie says I’ve been a bit quieter too, but I don’t know if that’s connected.
DOCTOR: Any nausea?
PATIENT: Nausea? No, not really. I haven't been sick at all. Never even felt close to it, thankfully. Just… this feeling of being stuffed after only a few bites. It's a strange thing, honestly. Makes it hard to enjoy my meals, and I do enjoy a good meal. Elsie makes a lovely salmon chowder, but even that I can’t finish these days.
DOCTOR: Right. And any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking… well, everything seems… regular, if you know what I mean. No trouble there, thankfully. No constipation or… the other thing. Sorry to be blunt. Just… normal, as far as I can tell. It’s mostly this fullness that’s bothering me. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Any family history of… anything like this?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a good question. My mother, she had some stomach trouble later in life, but it was mostly heartburn, I think. Nothing like this. My father was pretty healthy, lived to be 92. Elsie’s side… her brother had diabetes, but again, not stomach problems. I don’t really know much beyond that, to be honest. We didn't talk about those things much back then. Mostly just focused on getting through the day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look. Lie back on the examination table. I'll just listen to your abdomen. Don't worry, it won't take long.
PATIENT: Okay, alright. Sounds good. Just let me know if I’m slow getting up here, these old bones aren’t as nimble as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Normal bowel sounds, no distension. Soft to palpation… although, there’s a slight tenderness in the epigastric region. Nothing alarming, but noted. And your weight is… 54 kilograms. That is a bit of a drop from previous records, I see. Elsie is right to be concerned.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that doesn’t sound good, does it? Losing weight… I hadn’t really noticed, to be honest. I’ve been so focused on not being able to eat much. So, what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m not wanting to cause a fuss, but Elsie and I… we just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things. Probably just age-related loss of appetite, frankly. But, given the weight loss and tenderness, we need to rule out anything more significant. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. And, I think we should get an upper endoscopy scheduled, just to take a look at your esophagus and stomach. It's a routine procedure, nothing to worry about too much. But it will give us a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: An endoscopy, huh? That sounds… a bit involved. What exactly does it involve? And is it painful? I’ve never had anything like that before. Elsie will be worried, you know. She gets anxious easily. I just hope it’s not anything too serious. And how long will it take to get the results back?
DOCTOR: It involves a small camera on a tube, inserted down your throat. It's not painless, but we can give you some sedation to make you comfortable. It’s usually done as an outpatient procedure. As for results, a few days. The lab is backed up, you understand. And frankly, worrying won't help anything. Let's just get it done and see what we find. I’ll have the nurse schedule it for you. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A camera… that doesn’t sound very pleasant at all. Well, alright then. If you think it’s necessary. As for allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Elsie says I can eat anything, and I’ve always had a pretty strong stomach, until recently, of course. Nothing’s ever bothered me before. I do get a bit dizzy sometimes, if I stand up too quickly, but that’s just old age, I reckon. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for this… endoscopy? Like, can I eat before it, or…
DOCTOR: You'll need to fast for at least six hours beforehand. No food or drink. The nurse will give you detailed instructions. Look, I have several other patients waiting. Do you have any other questions, or can we move on?
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. Six hours… I can manage that. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. Elsie usually thinks of everything. Just… please tell her not to worry too much. She’ll be a nervous wreck. And thank you, Doctor. For… explaining everything. I guess I'll just wait for the nurse then.
DOCTOR: Right. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: .
