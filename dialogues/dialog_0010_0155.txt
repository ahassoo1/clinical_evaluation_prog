DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. It’s been… well, I don’t rightly know how long. Seems to be getting worse, though. I just want to get it looked at, if you don't mind getting right to it. I don't have a lot of time, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Jezik. We’ll get right to it. A shaking, you said, primarily in your hands, and it seems to be worsening. Can you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Hmm. Describe… it’s like… when you’re cold, and you shiver, but it’s not from the cold. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m trying to do something with my hands, like button a shirt, or… or holding a cup. It’s not constant, mind you. Comes and goes. I don't remember when it started exactly. A while ago, I think. Before… before the divorce. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That does help, thank you. So, it’s a tremor – an involuntary shaking – primarily in your hands, not constant, and seems to be exacerbated by activity, like buttoning a shirt or holding a cup. And you estimate it began before your divorce. Approximately how long ago was that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The divorce… that was… let me think. Ten years? Maybe twelve? Something like that. It feels like a lifetime ago, to be honest. I don’t really keep track of dates much anymore. Before… before the shaking got… noticeable, at least. I was always good with my hands, you know? Carpenter, used to be. Built a whole house, myself.
DOCTOR: I see. A carpenter, building a whole house – that requires a steady hand indeed. So, roughly ten to twelve years ago is when you first started noticing this tremor, though it may have been present subtly before that. Has it been gradually worsening over that time, or has it come on in waves?
PATIENT: Waves, I think. Mostly waves. There'd be periods where I didn't even notice it, or thought it was just… old age creeping in. But then it would get worse, like now. Makes things… difficult. It’s hard to explain. I mostly just try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating to have something come and go like that, and to try and manage it on your own. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… quick, if you could, Doctor. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Could you please extend your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Alright. Just… be gentle, alright? My bones ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Just relax and do your best. Okay, reflexes are a bit diminished, but symmetrical. Coordination is slightly impaired, particularly on the right side. And I do notice a resting tremor in both hands, more pronounced on the right, as you mentioned. I'm also noting some mild rigidity. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the shaking?
PATIENT: Rigidity? What’s that mean? As for other symptoms… hmm. I get tired easier, I suppose. And my… my writing’s gotten smaller. My daughter pointed it out last time she visited. Said it was hard to read my cards. Can’t recall anything else, really. Maybe a little… off balance sometimes, but I just chalked that up to getting old. I don't really pay much attention to things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, smaller handwriting – your daughter noticed difficulty reading your cards – and some occasional imbalance. Rigidity means your muscles feel stiff, making it harder to move smoothly. Those symptoms, combined with the tremor, fatigue, and the smaller handwriting, are… concerning. Now, do you have any history of head trauma, or any exposure to toxins or certain medications?
PATIENT: Head trauma… not that I recall. I did fall off a ladder once, building the roof, but I didn't hit my head that hard. Just a bit bruised. As for toxins… I worked with wood preservatives for years, you know? That stuff smelled awful. And medications… just the usual. Blood pressure pills, mostly. Nothing fancy. Oh, and I took something for my stomach once, a long time ago. Can't remember the name. Doesn't matter, I stopped taking it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of working with wood preservatives, blood pressure medication, and a previous medication for your stomach, the name of which you don’t recall. That's helpful. Given your symptoms, the physical exam findings, and your history, it’s important to consider the possibility of Parkinson’s disease. However, other conditions can cause similar symptoms, so we need to do some further investigation. I’d like to order a blood test to rule out other causes, and I'd like to refer you to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Parkinson's… isn't that… what Michael J. Fox has? Look, Doctor, I'm an old man. I don't need a lot of tests and fancy evaluations. I just want something to stop the shaking. Can you at least give me something for the tremor? Something to make it easier to… to live? I really don't have time for all this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns and your desire for a quick solution. And I respect your time. However, it's important to understand why you’re shaking before we can determine the best course of action. Simply masking the symptoms without knowing the underlying cause could delay proper treatment, or even be harmful. While I can’t definitively diagnose you without further investigation, your symptoms are concerning enough to warrant a thorough evaluation by a specialist. I can prescribe a medication to help manage the tremor in the short term, but it’s important to understand it's not a cure, and it has potential side effects. I also want to emphasize that early diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson’s, if that’s what it is, can significantly improve your quality of life. Would you be willing to consider the referral to a neurologist, and the blood tests?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Do what you have to do. Just… make it quick, alright? The sooner this is over, the better. What kind of blood tests? And… what does a neurologist even do? Look, Doctor, I'm not very good with all this medical stuff. Just tell me what I need to do, and I'll do it. But please… hurry. I really don't have much time left. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. We’ll get this done as efficiently as possible. The blood tests are standard panels to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. It'll just be a routine draw, and we’ll get the results back as quickly as possible. A neurologist is a specialist in the nervous system. They’ll perform a more detailed neurological exam and can order additional tests, like an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I'll have my nurse draw the blood now, and I’ll write you a prescription for a low dose of Propranolol to help manage the tremor in the meantime. It’s a beta-blocker, often used for high blood pressure, but it can also help with essential tremors. I'll also give you a referral form for Dr. Ramirez, a highly-respected neurologist in the area. Her number and address are on the form. Do you have any questions about the medication or the referral?
