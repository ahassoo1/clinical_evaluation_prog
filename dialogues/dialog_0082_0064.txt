DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels like… a tight squeezing. It started maybe a week ago? I think so. It's hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight squeezing in your chest for about a week. That is something we should look into. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s mostly… here, in the middle of my chest. Sometimes it goes up into my shoulder a little, on this side. It doesn't go all the way through to my back though. And it’s not a sharp pain, more like… pressure. Like someone is sitting on my chest.
DOCTOR: Alright, pressure in the middle of your chest, sometimes radiating to your left shoulder. And it’s not sharp, more of a squeezing sensation. Does anything specific bring on the pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, when I’m walking up the hill to get groceries, that usually does it. Or… if I get really excited, talking with my husband, sometimes. It seems to come with… doing things, you know? Not just sitting still. And it goes away when I rest. Pretty quickly, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, exertion seems to be a trigger – walking uphill, getting excited. And it relieves with rest. That's helpful information. Have you noticed anything else associated with it?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh! Yes. Sometimes I get a little short of breath when the pain comes on. Not bad shortness of breath, but I have to take a few deeper breaths. And… I think I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but it’s been so hot lately, maybe that’s just the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, some shortness of breath with the pain, and you've been a little more tired than usual. We’ll keep all of that in mind. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve gone to the doctor pretty regularly, but he never told me I had anything like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. My husband, Carlos, he has a little bit of high blood pressure, but I don't. I had the flu really bad a few years ago, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. So, generally healthy, no known diagnoses. And you said your husband has high blood pressure. Any other significant medical history in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother… she had some problems with her legs when she got older. Like, swelling. The doctor said it was something with the veins. And my father, he… he had a heart attack when he was older, maybe in his 70s. But he smoked a lot, you know? For many, many years. I never smoked.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother with leg swelling, and your father had a heart attack in his 70s, a smoker. That's good information. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not anything. Just a little vitamin D in the winter, sometimes. But that’s it. I don't like taking pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know you aren't on any regular medications. And no allergies to any medications or anything else, right?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of! Never had a reaction to anything. Carlos is allergic to cats, but I'm fine with them. We don't have any cats, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145 over 90. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, but I don’t hear any concerning sounds. Your lungs sound good, and I don’t feel any tenderness in your chest. I'm going to order an EKG and some blood work, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. The blood work will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and other important levels. We'll also check a marker called Troponin to rule out any heart damage. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… That sounds… a little scary, but if you think it’s best, Doctor, then yes. EKG and blood work, okay. What exactly does the… Troponin do? You said it checks for heart damage, but… what does that mean? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you're asking questions, Sherion. It’s completely normal to feel a little anxious when we're talking about the heart. Troponin is a protein released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle is damaged. It's a very specific marker for heart damage. Ordering the test doesn't mean something is wrong, it just allows us to rule out a heart attack or other heart problems. We want to be thorough. It’s a precautionary measure. The EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart and can help us identify any arrhythmias or signs of previous heart attacks. The blood work will help us assess your overall heart health, looking at things like cholesterol levels which can contribute to heart disease. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that helps. So, it’s just… checking everything. To be sure. Not that you think I'm having a heart attack right now. It’s just… making sure. Okay. That makes me feel better. Will the blood work take a lot? And the EKG… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Exactly. That’s right - just checking everything to be sure. The blood work will only take a few minutes, and we'll have the results back relatively quickly, within a few hours. The EKG is completely painless. It involves placing small stickers, called electrodes, on your chest, arms, and legs. Those electrodes are connected to a machine that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t send any electricity into your body, it just reads the signals. It takes about five minutes. While we're waiting for those results, I'm going to recommend that you avoid strenuous activity and try to reduce your stress levels. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No strenuous activity… Okay. Carlos will be happy to hear that, he always tells me to slow down. And… reduce stress. That’s… harder. But I'll try. So, you’ll call me when the results are back? How will I know if something is… wrong?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll call you as soon as the results are available. I will go over everything with you, explain the findings in detail, and discuss the next steps. If something is concerning, I will explain it clearly and we will discuss treatment options. You can also call the office with any questions you might have. If you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. In the meantime, I will also print out some information about heart health and stress reduction techniques for you to take home. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Information to take home, that’s helpful. And I will be careful, and Carlos will take me to the emergency room if anything gets worse. Thank you, Doctor Iuzzolino. You’ve explained everything very well.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. We're going to take this one step at a time, and we will figure out what’s going on. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and do the EKG. If you need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to ask. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. I’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day, Sherion.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Have a good day.
