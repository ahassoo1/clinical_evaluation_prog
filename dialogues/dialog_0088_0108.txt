DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it’s… unpleasant. Been throwin’ up blood, mostly. Not a ton, mind you, but enough to worry a fella. It started a couple days ago. And frankly, I haven’t been feeling right for a while, but this… this is new.
DOCTOR: Okay. Throwing up blood is definitely something we need to investigate. Just to clarify, Mr. Gentz, when you say a couple of days ago, can you tell me approximately how much blood are we talking about?
PATIENT: Approximately? Look, I’m not a measuring man, alright? It's not like fillin’ a glass, more like… streaks. Red streaks in what comes up. And it’s not every time, understand? Just… sometimes. A couple times a day, maybe. And it’s… bright red. Not that old, dark stuff. Does that make sense? I haven’t been eatin’ nothin’ weird, either. Mostly just… regular food.
DOCTOR: Bright red blood is important information. Okay, streaks of bright red blood a couple times a day. And you said this is new, but you mentioned not feeling right for a while. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Just tired, mostly. Real tired. And kinda weak. Everything feels like it takes a lot of effort, you know? Like walkin’ up the stairs, or even just gettin’ out of a chair. And my stomach's been… off. Not necessarily sick, just… unsettled. Like a constant dull ache. It’s been goin’ on for weeks, maybe a month or so. I figured it was just gettin' old. You get to my age, things start to fall apart, right? But then the blood showed up, and… well, here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, weakness, a dull ache in your stomach for about a month, and now the vomiting blood for the last couple of days. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? You want to talk about… that? Look, doc, I’m not one for detailin’ everything. They’ve been… normal enough. Maybe a little darker than usual, now that you mention it. But I figured that was just from… well, you know. From bein’ sick. Nothin’ to write home about. I haven’t noticed any black, tarry stools or anything like that. Just… darker. A little.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker stools but no black, tarry stools. That's good to know. Have you been taking any medications, over-the-counter or prescribed?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. I had some pills for my blood pressure a few years back, but the doc took me off 'em. Said I was fine without 'em. I take a multivitamin now and then, if I remember. That’s about it. And I don’t go for fancy herbal remedies or nothin’ like that. Waste of money, if you ask me. I generally try to avoid puttin’ things in my body that aren't food or water, understand?
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just a multivitamin occasionally. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or insect stings?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never had a problem with nothin’. I used to work with all sorts of chemicals at the crematorium, and never so much as a sniffle. I’m a tough fella, doc. Seriously. My wife… well, she had allergies, but I sure don’t. I can eat anything, touch anything. Nothin’ bothers me. This blood thing is… unusual. Really unusual. I'm tellin' you, somethin' ain’t right.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Gentz. Given what you’ve told me, I’m going to need to do a physical exam. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check for any signs of bleeding. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just get it over with. I’ve got things to do, you know. Cremations don't run themselves. Though I'm not complainin', mind you. Beats sittin' around doin' nothin'. I just... don't like bein' poked and prodded. But do what you gotta do, doc. Just try to be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the upper right quadrant. No masses that I can feel. Do you experience any pain when I press there?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, kinda like I been tellin' you. It's not somethin' I normally pay attention to, honestly. Been a bit achy all over lately, like I said. But that spot... yeah, that's a bit more noticeable when you push on it. Though, honestly, doc, I think I’m just gettin’ old. Everything hurts when you get to be my age, you know? Bones creakin’, muscles achin’. It’s just part of life. Are you findin' somethin' wrong? Don't beat around the bush, doc. Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Well, the tenderness in your upper right quadrant is concerning, especially with the vomiting blood and your fatigue. It could be a number of things, and I don't want to jump to conclusions. However, given your symptoms, I think we need to run some tests. I want to order a complete blood count, a liver panel, and a stool test to check for blood. We’ll also want to get a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function. Do you have any insurance that would cover these tests?
PATIENT: Insurance? You kiddin’ me? Insurance? No, I don’t have insurance. Not since… well, not since my wife passed. It was too expensive, and frankly, I haven’t needed it. Until now, I guess. I can pay out of pocket, I suppose. How much we talkin’? I ain’t made of money, doc. I run a small business, you know. Cremations ain't exactly a lucrative profession. Just tell me the damage, straight up. And if it's too high... well, I guess I'll just have to suffer through it. But I'd rather know what I'm gettin' into before I agree to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, without insurance, the tests will cost around $600 to $800. I understand that’s a significant amount. Given your lack of insurance, and the potential for a serious underlying issue, I strongly recommend that we consider getting you to a hospital with financial assistance programs. They can often provide the necessary testing and care at a reduced cost or even for free. There’s County General Hospital about an hour from here. They have a good reputation and a financial assistance program. Here’s some information about the program. They also have a patient advocate who can help you navigate the process. It might be the best option, given the cost of the tests and the possibility of needing further treatment. I can also write you a referral note, outlining your symptoms and the need for urgent evaluation. What do you think?
PATIENT: A hospital? Doc, I ain’t lookin’ to spend weeks in a hospital. I got a business to run! People gotta be… taken care of, you know? And fillin' out paperwork? Forget about it. It'll take me a year just to get through the red tape. Besides, hospitals… they’re full of germs. I’d rather just pay for the tests, get a diagnosis, and get on with my life. $600 to $800… it’s a lot, but I can manage. Just write me a prescription for whatever tests you need. I'll figure out how to pay for it. No hospitals, doc. Absolutely not. I appreciate your concern, but I'm a practical man. I’ll deal with it. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I respect your decision, but I want to be clear: without a thorough evaluation and potentially further imaging, we won't be able to determine the cause of your symptoms. I'm ordering the complete blood count, liver panel, and stool test. The lab is located in town, and they'll need a sample from you. You’ll need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. Here are the forms. Take these to the lab, and they'll take care of it. The results will take 2-3 business days to come back. I'll call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as increased vomiting, dizziness, or abdominal pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I understand. Fastin’ for 12 hours… blood tests… emergency room… You’ve said it all, doc. Look, I appreciate you runnin’ the tests, but honestly, I’m not holdin’ my breath. I’ve been through doctors before, and they always make a bigger deal outta nothin’. It’s probably just a bad stomach, or somethin’. I’ll deal with it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I got things to do. And I need to go home and… not eat for a day. Thanks for your time, doc. I’ll be in touch if things get worse. Though I doubt they will.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. You take care. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. I'll be sure to follow up with you when the results are back.
