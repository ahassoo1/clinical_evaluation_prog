DOCTOR: "Bula vinaka, Mr. Way. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Well, things have been...painful, lately. That's why I made the appointment. It's mostly in my back, but it shoots down my leg sometimes.
DOCTOR: "Okay, painful back with some pain shooting down your leg. That sounds really uncomfortable. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It is uncomfortable! Especially when I try to bend over. It’s a sharp pain, not really a dull ache. And like I said, it goes down my leg – feels like right along the back of my thigh, sometimes even to my calf. It doesn't happen every time I bend, but most of the time.
DOCTOR: "Right, a sharp pain, mostly with bending, radiating down the back of your leg. Does it feel like it’s just one spot, or does it move around?
PATIENT: It definitely moves around, Doctor. It’s not always in the same place. Sometimes it’s higher up in my back, near my shoulder blade, and other times it's lower, closer to my hips. The pain down my leg…that changes too. Sometimes it’s just the thigh, sometimes it goes all the way to my calf, like you asked. It’s kinda hard to pin down, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "I understand. It sounds like it's not a constant thing, and the location shifts. That gives us some clues. Has anything specific brought on this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. I don't know if anything specific brought it on. It just…started a few weeks ago. I was doing some work in the garden, pulling weeds, but I do that all the time and haven’t had trouble before. I didn’t lift anything heavy, I don’t think. It just gradually got worse over a few days.
DOCTOR: "Okay, so it started gradually a few weeks ago after some gardening, but you don't recall a specific injury or lifting something heavy. Has anything made the pain better?
PATIENT: Well, resting helps, definitely. If I just sit still or lie down for a bit, it calms down. And, uh…warm baths. A nice warm bath seems to take the edge off for a little while. But it always comes back, you know? It doesn’t stay better for long.
DOCTOR: "Rest and warm baths help temporarily, which is good to know. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, if that's alright. Have you had any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s a good question. Yes, sometimes. Not all the time, but… in my left foot, mostly. It feels kinda like pins and needles, you know? And it feels…weak sometimes, like it's hard to lift it up. Not completely weak, but not as strong as my other foot.
DOCTOR: "Okay, so numbness, tingling, and some weakness in your left foot. That’s helpful information. Now, have you had any trouble with your bladder or bowels – any changes in how often you go, or any difficulty controlling them?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that, Doctor. Everything is… regular, I guess you could say. No trouble there at all. That’s a bit of a personal question, isn't it? But I appreciate you asking, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: "It is personal, and I apologize for asking, Mr. Way, but it’s important to rule out anything serious. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis, or any other conditions that cause joint pain?
PATIENT: No, not arthritis. My wife, she has a bit of trouble with her knees, but I haven’t had any problems like that myself. I had…high blood pressure a few years ago, but the doctor got it under control with some pills. I don't take them anymore, though. Other than that, not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Okay, high blood pressure in the past, but currently controlled, and otherwise healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Nope, nothing like that. I've been lucky, I guess. My appendix acted up when I was a kid, but it went away on its own. Otherwise, just the usual colds and flu, nothing major.
DOCTOR: "Good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother, she had trouble with her back when she got older, lots of aches and pains. But I don't know if it was anything serious, just…old age, I think. My father, he was pretty healthy, lived to be 85. No real family history of anything major, as far as I know. My wife's side…her uncle had diabetes, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: "Okay, some back pain in your mother, and diabetes in your wife’s family. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. Just try to eat healthy and get a little exercise when I can. My wife keeps telling me I should take a multivitamin, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
DOCTOR: "Okay, no current medications. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and haven't had any bad reactions to any medicine in the past. I'm pretty lucky that way too, I guess. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: "Alright, thank you for that information, Mr. Way. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. It will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and range of motion, and feeling along your back to see if I can pinpoint where the pain is coming from. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do to figure out what's going on. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: "Excellent. First, let's just have you stand up and walk a few steps for me, so I can see how you move." "Just walk naturally, at your normal pace." "Okay, good. Now, could you bend forward and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Okay... here I go. Oof… that’s a bit difficult. It hurts in my lower back when I do that. There. It’s a sharp pain when I bend, like I said.
DOCTOR: "Alright, I see. And I’m noting that forward bending elicits pain. Now, let's try bending backward gently. Just go as far as you comfortably can.” “Let me know when you feel any discomfort.”
PATIENT: That's… okay. It's not as bad as bending forward, but I can feel a little strain. It's more of a dull ache, not a sharp pain like before. There. I don’t want to push it too much.
DOCTOR: "Okay, good. Not as sharp, but still discomfort. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please sit back down. I'm going to tap on your knee with this little hammer. Just relax your leg." "And now the other side." “Okay, reflexes are present and equal on both sides.” "Now, I'm going to feel along your spine and muscles to check for tenderness." "Does this hurt when I press here?
PATIENT: Okay… Yes, that's… normal, I think. Ouch! Yes, right there… that’s tender. It hurts when you press on that spot. Right about there, on the left side. It’s pretty sore.
DOCTOR: "Alright, tenderness on the left side of your lower back. And now, let’s check your strength. Can you lift your left leg straight up while you’re sitting?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… a little difficult. Not as strong as my other leg. I can't lift it up very far. It feels weak.
DOCTOR: "Okay, I see. And now try to lift your right leg." “Okay, good. Now can you stand up and walk on your heels for a few steps?
PATIENT: Okay… Like this? It's… difficult. It feels unsteady. I have to really concentrate to keep my balance. It's not easy.
DOCTOR: "Alright, that’s helpful. Now, can you stand and walk on your toes for a few steps?
PATIENT: Okay… like this? Oof… this is harder. It hurts in my calf, and I'm afraid I'm going to fall. It's really difficult to keep my balance.
DOCTOR: "Alright, thank you, Mr. Way. That's all the physical exam I need to do for now. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve seen during the exam, it sounds like you may have a lumbar strain with some radiculopathy – meaning some irritation of a nerve in your lower back that's causing the pain to radiate down your leg.” “The tenderness in your lower back, the pain with bending, and the weakness and tingling in your foot all point to that. However, to be sure, I’d like to get an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any other causes, like arthritis or a fracture." "What do you think about that?
PATIENT: Lumbar strain… and radi-what-now? So, it’s not anything serious? And an X-ray… that sounds okay. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, I’m okay with that. I just want to know what’s causing this pain. I don't like feeling like I'm walking on eggshells all the time. So, an X-ray will tell us more?
DOCTOR: "Okay, let's break that down. A lumbar strain is basically a pulled muscle in your lower back. The 'radiculopathy' just means that a nerve is being irritated, causing the pain to travel down your leg. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but we want to make sure. The X-ray will help us rule out things like arthritis or a fracture, which are less common but we need to be sure. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on in your back." "For now, I recommend some conservative treatment – that means things we can do without surgery. We’ll start with over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with the inflammation and pain. I also want you to apply heat or ice to your back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. And most importantly, I want you to avoid any activities that make the pain worse. No heavy lifting, no bending, and no twisting." "We’ll also do the X-ray to confirm everything and then see how you respond to the treatment. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. No heavy lifting… that won’t be a problem. I mostly do gardening, and I can avoid bending and twisting while I’m doing that. Heat or ice… I think I prefer heat. It feels better on my back. And the over-the-counter pain relievers… I have some ibuprofen at home, so I can start taking those tonight. So, X-ray first, then try the heat, ice, and ibuprofen… and avoid making the pain worse? That sounds like a plan. How soon can I get the X-ray done?
DOCTOR: "Excellent. You’ve got it. X-ray first, then the heat, ice, and ibuprofen. And avoiding things that make it worse. The radiology department is just down the hall, room 102. I'll send an order over electronically to them right now, and they can get you in right away. Once they've taken the X-rays, the radiologist will look at them and send the report back to me. Usually, it takes a few hours, but sometimes it can take a day or two. I'll call you as soon as I have the results.” “Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure out what's going on. Just… hoping it's nothing too serious. Thank you again. Where do I go to get the X-ray done? Room 102, you said?
DOCTOR: "You're very welcome, Mr. Way. That’s what I'm here for. And you're right, room 102, just down the hall. Just let the technician know my name, Dr. Kimm, and they'll take care of you. Once they're done, they'll send the images to me. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if your pain gets worse while you're waiting for the results.” “I wish you all the best. Get the X-ray done, take it easy, and we’ll talk soon. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you very much for your help. I’ll go get the X-ray done now. And I'll call if anything changes. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: "You too, Mr. Way. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day.”
PATIENT: .
