DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Uh… well, my wife, she said I need to get some papers. Something about… time off? Or maybe help with things… I don’t quite remember everything. It’s about work, I think. FMLA, she mentioned that name. Does that ring a bell? I work with the church, doing… well, a bit of everything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, FMLA – Family and Medical Leave Act. Your wife is right to mention that, it's often needed when someone is dealing with a health concern that impacts their ability to work. It sounds like you may need some documentation for that. Before we get into the paperwork, though, let's talk about why you might need it. What’s been going on with your health recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… that's a good question. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I’ve been… not feeling quite myself, I suppose. A bit tired, mostly. And a little… unsteady on my feet sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a sudden thing, it's been creeping up on me for a while now. My wife is the one who really notices these things, she says I don't always realize when I’m not at my best. I've been trying to keep up with my duties, but… it’s getting harder, I guess. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. It's perfectly alright to ramble a little – it often takes time to put these things into words. "Not feeling quite yourself" and "unsteady on your feet" are good starting points. When you say "tired," is that a fatigue that gets better with rest, or is it more constant?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. It's… not really fixed by resting, if that makes sense. I can sleep a full night, even eight hours, and still wake up feeling… drained. It's like the energy just isn’t there. And it seems to get worse as the day goes on. I used to be able to work all day and still have energy for things in the evening, but now… I’m usually ready for bed pretty early. My wife makes me tea, bless her heart, but even that doesn’t seem to help much these days. It's just… persistent, I think is the word.
DOCTOR: Persistent fatigue, even with adequate sleep. Okay. And you mentioned feeling unsteady on your feet. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a full fall, thankfully. But… sometimes I feel a little wobbly, like my legs are weak. It happens mostly when I’m walking, or if I stand up too quickly. A couple of times I’ve almost bumped into things. Nothing serious, but it’s enough to make me nervous. My wife worries, she says I shouldn’t be doing so much. She’s probably right. It’s hard to explain… it’s like my balance isn’t what it used to be. And it seems worse when I'm tired, naturally. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Limtiaco. Wobbliness and feeling unsteady, especially with fatigue. Now, to get a better picture, I'm going to ask you a few more general health questions. This is just a routine review, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds fine. Ask away. I'll do my best to answer. My memory isn't always the greatest, but I'll try. Just let me know if I’m rambling again!
DOCTOR: No worries at all. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh, goodness. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long, long time ago. And… I think I had a bout of pneumonia once, but that was years and years ago. Other than that… not really. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. My wife always says I'm stubborn as a mule, and that’s probably why I don’t go to the doctor enough. I try to stay active, but… well, lately it's been harder, as we’ve discussed. I don't recall any major illnesses or anything that required ongoing treatment. Is that… helpful? I’m probably forgetting something.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Appendectomy as a child and a bout of pneumonia. No ongoing medical issues. Good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries other than your appendix removed?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. Just the appendix when I was a boy. My wife would definitely know if I'd had any others, she keeps track of everything. I've been fortunate, thankfully. I haven't needed much medical attention over the years. Mostly just the occasional cold or flu, nothing serious. That’s why this is all a bit… concerning, to be honest. I’m not used to feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. Good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that's been common among your parents, siblings, or other close relatives?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My parents… they both lived to a good age, thankfully. My mother, she had some trouble with her joints when she got older, arthritis I think. My father, he was a strong man, but he had some heart trouble towards the end. Nothing major, but he had to watch his diet. And… I think my aunt on my mother’s side had some kind of cancer, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… I don’t really know much about my family history. We weren’t very close, to be honest. My wife might know more, she’s good at remembering these things. It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and cancer in an aunt. That gives us something to work with. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife wouldn’t allow it! She’s always been very health-conscious. She makes sure I eat my fruits and vegetables and get enough exercise. I used to be very active, walking every day, but… lately, as we've discussed, it’s been harder. She worries about me, she really does. She's a good woman.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Nothing more than that. My wife and I, we enjoy a quiet evening at home sometimes, a little music and a glass of wine. We don’t drink heavily, never have. It’s just a little something to relax us. Nothing excessive, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife always double-checks before I take any new medication, just to be safe. She's very cautious. I’ve never had any trouble with food allergies either. I can eat pretty much anything. I’m lucky in that regard, I suppose. Nothing comes to mind, no. No allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, that gives me a good starting point. Persistent fatigue and unsteadiness, no significant past medical history, some family history of arthritis, heart trouble, and cancer, and no allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a neurological exam to check your balance and reflexes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had a proper check-up in a while, so it’s probably a good idea. I'll do whatever you need me to do. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I'm a bit unsteady on my feet, as we’ve discussed, so please be careful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take it slow and steady. And please let me know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please sit here and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I hope it’s not too high. My wife always says I get stressed at the doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: It's quite common to get a little anxious at the doctor's office, Mr. Limtiaco. We'll try to keep things relaxed. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I always feel a bit silly when I have to breathe deeply like that. It feels like I'm making too much noise.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight crackling in the lower lobes of both lungs. It’s subtle, but worth noting. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your tendons with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Can you please let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A hammer, you say? Oh dear. I hope it doesn't hurt too much. I'm a bit sensitive, you see. Just be gentle, alright? I'll try to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, I'd like you to stand up and try to walk a few steps for me, if you're comfortable. I just want to assess your balance and gait. Are you feeling steady enough to do that?
PATIENT: Hmm… I’m a bit unsteady, as we’ve discussed. But I can try. Just be close by, alright? I don't want to fall. My wife would be very upset. It’s a bit… difficult. I have to concentrate very hard to keep my balance.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see what you mean. Your gait is a little wide-based and unsteady. It looks like you are compensating to maintain your balance. Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, that was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, there are a few things I'm considering. The fatigue, unsteadiness, slightly elevated blood pressure, crackling in your lungs, and diminished reflexes are all things we need to investigate further. I’m thinking we should start with some blood work to check your overall health, rule out any underlying infections or deficiencies, and also get a chest X-ray to take a closer look at your lungs. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Anything that might help figure out what’s going on. Blood work and an X-ray. My wife will be pleased you’re being thorough. She worries so much. Will those tests take long? And will they be… uncomfortable? I’m not a fan of needles, you see.
DOCTOR: The blood work is relatively quick, just a few vials of blood. And yes, it does involve a needle, but I'll be as gentle as possible. It’s usually just a quick pinch. The X-ray is painless, you'll just stand or sit while the machine takes a picture of your chest. It doesn't involve any radiation that's harmful. The results usually take a few days to come back, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest and staying hydrated. And please, if your symptoms worsen at any point, don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Blood work, X-ray, follow-up appointment. And rest. My wife will be happy to hear that! She always tells me to rest more. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Now, about those papers… the FMLA or whatever it was? Is that something we can get to now, so I can take it to work? My boss is starting to ask questions.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. That's what we’re here for. This is the FMLA paperwork. I’ll need to fill out my portion, documenting your current condition and limitations. It looks like you’ll need to complete your portion as well, with some information about your employer and your request for leave. Based on our conversation and the exam today, I’m noting that you are experiencing persistent fatigue and unsteadiness, which are impacting your ability to perform your job duties. I'll also document that we are undergoing further investigation with blood work and a chest X-ray. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect, Doctor. “Persistent fatigue and unsteadiness.” That’s a good way of putting it. And the tests… yes, definitely mention those. My boss can be… particular. Thank you for being so thorough. Here, let me fill out my portion now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Everything looks good here. I've completed my portion as well. You can take this back to your employer. They may have some additional paperwork for you to complete. The lab order for the blood work and the order for the chest X-ray will be sent electronically to the lab and the radiology department. You should receive a call from them within the next day or two to schedule your appointments. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very patient and helpful, Doctor. Thank you again. And thank you for the papers. Hopefully, this will smooth things over with my boss. I'm ready to go now, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions. Get some rest, and we'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Take care.
PATIENT: .
