DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Land sakes, it’s a lovely office you have here. What brought me in… well, it’s a bit hard to say exactly. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. My family… we get those a lot, you see. Not me, not usually, but… my brother, and his mother before him… it’s just been… a thing. I’m a little foggy on the details, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tofani. It’s good of you to come in, and it's perfectly alright if details are a little unclear. We'll sort it all out together. So, this weakness… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… it comes and goes. It’s not… constant. Mostly it feels like… one side of my body just feels… heavy. Like it’s hard to lift my arm, or sometimes my leg feels… clumsy. It doesn’t happen often, thankfully. But it’s enough to worry my daughter, and she’s usually right to worry! It’s usually on my right side, I think… or maybe the left? Oh dear, I’m getting mixed up already. It doesn’t last long, just a little while, then it goes away.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Tofani. These things can be tricky to remember. We’ll take our time. And it's good your daughter is attentive. It’s always helpful to have someone else's perspective. To get a better understanding, could you describe when you’ve noticed this weakness happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… let me think. It’s not after anything specific, not that I can recall. Sometimes it just… happens. I was doing the gardening last month, I think… and it felt a little heavy then. But I do a lot of gardening! And it didn’t happen every time. And… well, sometimes I’m just sitting, watching television, and I notice my hand feels a bit… numb, and dragging a little. It’s hard to say. It doesn’t really seem to have a pattern, if that makes any sense. Not like after exercise, or stress, or anything like that. Just… random. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does help, Ms. Tofani. It’s useful to know there doesn’t seem to be a clear trigger. Random occurrences are important to note. Now, you also mentioned headaches. Can you tell me a little more about those?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches. Yes. Those… well, they’re not terrible headaches, not usually. More like… a dull ache, mostly. Behind my eyes, sometimes. And in my temples. It's not like a throbbing pain, not like poor Mildred down the street gets. She has to lie down in a dark room. Mine are just… annoying. They come and go, like the weakness, really. And… I think they sometimes happen with the weakness? Or maybe after? Oh dear, I'm so confused. My family… we just… get headaches, you see. It’s always been that way. They don't last long, usually just a few hours, and then they’re gone. I take a little something for them, usually. Just an over-the-counter pain reliever, that's all.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been dealing with these symptoms for a while, Ms. Tofani. It's understandable that it’s a bit confusing, and it’s good you're able to manage them for the most part. Just to be thorough, can you tell me what over-the-counter pain reliever you usually take, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it's usually… ibuprofen, I think. Or maybe naproxen? One of those - the ones for aches and pains. My daughter buys them for me. I don't take it every day, goodness no. Just when the headache gets bad. Maybe… two or three times a week, if I’m having a bad spell. Sometimes not at all for weeks. I usually take two pills, that's what the box says. Two pills, and then it usually goes away after a little while. I don’t take anything else, I promise. Just that. And a little cup of chamomile tea, sometimes. That helps too, I think. It’s a nice habit, anyway.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Tofani. And chamomile tea is an excellent habit! Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness and headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… other symptoms. Well… sometimes I feel a little… dizzy. Not spinning, exactly, just a little unsteady on my feet. And… sometimes my vision gets a little blurry. It doesn’t last long, usually just a fleeting thing. I’ve been blaming my glasses, to be honest. They’re getting old, I think. And… oh dear, now what was I saying? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Sometimes I have trouble finding the right words. Just little things, really. Nothing terrible. My daughter says I repeat myself sometimes, but she just teases me about it. I don’t think it’s anything to worry about. Just getting old, I suppose. Is that helpful? Or am I rambling?
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Ms. Tofani. This is all very helpful. It's important to mention everything, even things that seem small. Dizziness, blurry vision, and some memory difficulties are all good to know. Now, to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… that's a bit of a… puzzle, I'm afraid. I’ve been to the doctor, of course, over the years. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia once, a long time ago. And… I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, that's why they ache sometimes. But nothing… serious, really. I don't have any… you know… heart trouble, or diabetes, or anything like that. I had all my shots, whatever they were called, when I was younger. My daughter keeps track of all that now, she’s very good with things like that. She’ll know more than I will, honestly. She says I used to have high blood pressure, but it’s been… managed, she says. That's all I can really think of, to be honest. It's been a long time, you see. And I don't remember a lot of the details. Is that enough? I feel like I’m being a terrible patient!
DOCTOR: You are not being a terrible patient at all, Ms. Tofani! It's perfectly common to not remember every detail, and it sounds like your daughter is a wonderful advocate for you. Let’s focus on the arthritis for a moment. Do you take any medications for that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the arthritis. It’s mostly in my hands, you see. It aches, especially in the cold weather. My daughter takes me to the… the rheumatologist, sometimes. He gives me… a little pill, I think. It’s white, I believe. And I take it every day. It helps a little, makes the pain not so bad. I can’t remember the name of it, honestly. It’s a mouthful, I think. My daughter knows, she’ll tell you. She keeps track of all my pills. And I use a little cream on my hands, sometimes. Just something from the drugstore. It smells nice, lavender, I think. That helps too. Mostly, I just try to keep my hands warm. That’s the best thing, really. Is that helpful? I'm afraid I'm not a very good source of information. It's been a long time, you see, and I just can't remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Tofani. It sounds like you are managing your arthritis well, and it's good to know you have a rheumatologist. We can verify the name of the medication with your daughter if needed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, I mentioned that, didn’t I? And… oh! My gallbladder. I had that taken out a long, long time ago. It was causing me a lot of trouble. It was a very simple operation, I believe. I don’t remember a lot of details. I was in the hospital for a few days. And… I think that’s it. Nothing else. Nothing major, anyway. My daughter will know if I’m forgetting something. She has a very good memory, bless her heart. She keeps all my records. I'm afraid I'm not a very reliable source of information. It's been a long time, you see, and I just don't remember everything. Is that enough? I hope I'm not bothering you.
DOCTOR: You are not bothering me at all, Ms. Tofani. It's perfectly alright if you don’t remember every detail. You’ve told me quite a bit already, and your daughter sounds very helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had a bad heart, I believe. She died when I was young. And my brother… he gets terrible headaches. Migraines, they call them. He has to lie down in a dark room. He’s had them all his life. And… oh! My grandmother, on my father’s side, she had… something with her legs. I can’t remember exactly what it was. Something with her nerves, I think. She had trouble walking. And… my aunt, she had diabetes, I believe. But that’s all I can really think of. My family… we just have a lot of aches and pains, you see. It’s always been that way. My daughter keeps track of all that, she’ll know more than I will, honestly. She’s very good with things like that. She’ll tell you everything. Is that enough? I'm afraid I'm not a very reliable source of information. It's been a long time, you see, and I just don't remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Tofani. A family history of heart problems, headaches, and potential nerve issues and diabetes is good information. We can certainly ask your daughter for more details if needed. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… well, I don't do much these days. I live in a little house with my husband, bless his heart. He's a good man, but he’s getting old too. We mostly stay home. I like to garden, when the weather is nice. And I like to read. I read a lot of mysteries. And I like to watch television. I don’t go out much anymore. I used to go to church every Sunday, but I haven’t been going lately. I eat… well, I eat whatever my husband cooks. He's a good cook, but we mostly eat simple things. Pasta, and vegetables, and chicken. I don’t drink a lot of alcohol. Just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I don’t smoke. I never have. And… oh! I try to get some exercise, but I don’t do much walking anymore. I mostly just potter around the house. Is that enough? I'm afraid I'm not a very exciting person. I live a very quiet life.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very peaceful life, Ms. Tofani. It’s good that you enjoy gardening, reading, and spending time with your husband. One final question for now. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. I don't think so. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I don't have any food allergies. I've never had any trouble with pollen or dust. And… I don't think I'm allergic to any medications. I’ve taken a lot of different pills over the years, and I’ve never had a bad reaction. But… I’m not sure. It’s been a long time, you see, and I just don’t remember. My daughter keeps track of all that, she’ll know if I’m forgetting something. She’s very good with things like that. She’ll tell you everything. Is that enough? I hope I haven’t been bothering you. I'm afraid I'm not a very reliable source of information. It's been a long time, you see, and I just don’t remember everything.
DOCTOR: You haven’t been bothering me at all, Ms. Tofani. I appreciate you sharing all of this information with me. It sounds like you’ve provided me with a very good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. That will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. My husband always says I worry too much. A quick exam is fine. Just don't poke too much! I'm a bit tender these days. And… maybe not the knees? They ache sometimes. But other than that, go ahead. I trust you, Doctor. You seem like a very nice woman.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tofani. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We can definitely skip the knees if they’re tender. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the edge of the bed for a moment?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sitting is fine. My balance isn’t what it used to be, but I can manage. Just be careful, dear. I don't want to fall. And... don't rush me, please. I need a moment to get my bearings. Old age, you know. Everything takes a little longer these days. What are you looking for, exactly? Are you worried about something? My daughter will be so worried if you find something wrong. She always frets over me.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Tofani. We’ll take our time, and I’m right here to support you. I'm just checking your reflexes and coordination. It’s a routine part of the exam, and I’m not necessarily worried about anything. Okay, good reflex on that side. And now, let's try the other side. Good. And now, could you please close your eyes and point to your nose?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Closing my eyes is fine. I’m a little unsteady, but I can manage. This is a bit silly, isn't it? But I trust you, Doctor. You seem to know what you’re doing. Oh dear… that’s a bit wobbly. I think I got it… maybe? It’s a little off, isn't it? My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be. Is that a bad sign, Doctor? My daughter will be so worried if you find something wrong. She always frets over me. I’m afraid I’m not a very good patient. I’m a bit shaky, you see. Old age, you know. Everything is a little more difficult these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Tofani. A little wobble is perfectly normal, especially as we get older. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. And you are a very good patient! You’re doing great. Okay, now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Standing is fine. But be careful, dear. My balance isn’t what it used to be. I don't want to fall. I have a little bit of trouble with my feet, you see. They get tired easily. And… I have to take little steps. Oh dear… that’s a bit wobbly, isn't it? I have to take little steps. And I have to look down. I don't want to fall. Is that a bad sign, Doctor? My daughter will be so worried if you find something wrong. She always frets over me. I’m afraid I’m not a very good patient. I’m a bit shaky, you see. Old age, you know. Everything is a little more difficult these days.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Tofani. You are doing very well. A slightly unsteady gait is common with age, and it doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem. Okay, please sit back down. Alright, Ms. Tofani, I’ve completed the exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, you’re presenting with some symptoms that warrant further investigation. You mentioned weakness on one side, headaches, dizziness, blurry vision, and some difficulty with balance and coordination. The exam findings corroborate some of those symptoms. The wobble in your gait and slightly unsteady balance are of note, as is the slight difficulty touching your nose with your eyes closed. I’d like to order some blood work and a brain scan to get a better understanding of what’s going on. The blood work will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions, and the brain scan will help us visualize your brain and identify any potential structural abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A brain scan? That sounds… serious. Is something wrong, Doctor? Is it something terrible? My daughter will be so worried. She always frets over me. I don’t like the sound of a brain scan. What will it show? Will it hurt? I’m a bit scared, Doctor. I’m not very good with doctors, you see. I always worry about the worst. What are you looking for, exactly? My daughter will be so worried. She always frets over me. Is it something to do with my memory? I’m a bit foggy these days, you see. I forget things easily. I don’t want to be a burden. My daughter has her own life, you see. She doesn’t need to worry about her old mother. Is it something serious, Doctor? Please tell me the truth. I'm a bit scared.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel scared, Ms. Tofani, and it’s okay to be worried. I understand your concerns. Let me assure you, I’m not jumping to any conclusions. A brain scan is simply a tool to help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We’re looking for a range of possibilities, Ms. Tofani. Your symptoms could be caused by a variety of factors, such as a minor stroke, a transient ischemic attack , or even a simple age-related change in brain function. The scan will help us differentiate between these possibilities. The scan itself is painless and non-invasive. You’ll simply lie on a table while a machine takes pictures of your brain. It takes about 30-45 minutes. And yes, the scan can help us assess your memory function, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. We’ll also do a cognitive assessment to get a more comprehensive understanding of your mental abilities. You are not a burden, Ms. Tofani. And your daughter clearly cares about you very much. It's good that you have someone who is supportive. We are simply trying to rule out any potential problems and ensure that you receive the best possible care. I will discuss everything with your daughter and provide her with all the information she needs. I understand this is a lot to take in. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a minor stroke? That sounds… terrible. Is that what you think it is, Doctor? Are you sure? My brother had a stroke once. He couldn’t speak for weeks. I don’t want that to happen to me. And a cognitive assessment? Will that show if I’m losing my mind? My memory is a bit foggy these days, you see. I forget things easily. I don’t want to be a burden on my daughter. She has her own life, you see. She doesn’t need to worry about her old mother. Will the scan show if I need to go into a home? My brother is in a home now. He’s very unhappy. I don’t want that to happen to me. And what if it is something serious, Doctor? What then? Will I need surgery? Will I be in pain? Will I… will I die? My daughter will be so worried. She always frets over me. Please tell me the truth, Doctor. I’m a bit scared. I don’t want to worry my daughter. I just want to be able to live out my days in peace. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, it’s perfectly normal to feel scared, and it’s okay to ask these questions. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that I will be honest with you every step of the way. I am not saying you have had a stroke. I’m simply explaining that it’s one of the possibilities we need to rule out. The symptoms you’re experiencing can be indicative of a stroke, but they can also be caused by many other things. That’s why we need to do the brain scan and cognitive assessment. The cognitive assessment is a simple test that will help us evaluate your memory, thinking, and problem-solving skills. It’s not meant to be scary or intimidating. It’s simply a way for us to get a better understanding of your mental abilities. And it doesn’t mean anything is wrong if you have some difficulty with certain tasks. Everyone’s cognitive abilities decline with age. And I want to assure you that a brain scan or cognitive assessment does not automatically mean you need to go into a home. And the vast majority of people who have brain scans do not need surgery. We will only recommend surgery if it’s absolutely necessary. And I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to ensure your comfort and well-being. We will manage your symptoms, address any underlying medical conditions, and provide you with the best possible care. We will discuss all of your options with you and your daughter, and we will make a decision that’s right for you. Right now, let’s focus on getting the brain scan and cognitive assessment done. We will have more information once we have the results. And I will be right here with you every step of the way. Do you want me to call your daughter now?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Yes, please. Call my daughter. She’ll know what to do. She’s always so good at things like this. She's very organized, you see. And she'll want to know everything. I just want to get this over with. I'm a bit scared, Doctor. And… thank you. Thank you for being so patient with me. And… thank you for being so kind. I just want to be able to live out my days in peace. Is that too much to ask? I just want to see my grandchildren grow up. And I want to be able to spend time with my husband. He's getting old too, you see. And… I don’t want to worry my daughter. She has her own life, you see. She doesn’t need to worry about her old mother. Please call her. And… thank you again. I just want this to be over with.
DOCTOR: Hello?
PATIENT: Hello? Yes, this is… oh, it’s Doctor Vodzak? Is everything alright with my mother? Is she… is something wrong? She sounded a little worried when I spoke to her earlier. Is she going to be alright? Please tell me everything. I’m a bit anxious, Doctor. She's very old, you see. And she's been a bit forgetful lately. I just want to make sure she's okay. Please tell me everything.
DOCTOR: Hello, Ms. Tofani. Yes, I’m calling to update you on your mother’s condition. Your mother and I were just having a conversation, and she has expressed some concerns about certain symptoms she’s been experiencing. Specifically, she’s reported some weakness on one side, headaches, dizziness, and some difficulty with balance and coordination. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’ve recommended some further testing—a brain scan and a cognitive assessment. It’s important to note that these tests are simply a precaution. We need to rule out any potential underlying medical conditions. Your mother is currently doing fine, but I want to be thorough and ensure she receives the best possible care. I understand your concern, and I want to assure you that I will keep you updated every step of the way. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A brain scan and a cognitive assessment… Yes, please. Could you explain the tests in more detail? What exactly will they be looking for? Is it something serious? And what are the risks? My mother has a bit of a heart condition, you see. And she gets very anxious easily. I don’t want to frighten her. And… what are the chances that it’s something serious? Is it a stroke? She’s always worried about having a stroke, you see. Her brother had one a few years ago. And… what if it is a stroke? What are the treatment options? And… what are the long-term effects? I just want to know everything, Doctor. I just want to make sure she’s okay. She’s all I have.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Tofani. It’s natural to be worried when you’re concerned about your loved ones. Let me explain the tests in detail. The brain scan is a non-invasive procedure that uses magnetic waves to create images of your mother’s brain. It’s painless and doesn’t involve any radiation. We’ll be looking for any structural abnormalities, such as tumors, bleeding, or signs of a stroke. The cognitive assessment is a simple test that will evaluate your mother’s memory, thinking, and problem-solving skills. It’s not meant to be scary or intimidating. It’s simply a way for us to get a better understanding of her mental abilities. The risks associated with both tests are minimal. The brain scan is generally very safe, although it may not be suitable for individuals with certain metal implants. The cognitive assessment is non-invasive and carries no risks. Regarding the possibility of a stroke, I want to assure you that I am not saying your mother has had a stroke. I’m simply explaining that it’s one of the possibilities we need to rule out. The symptoms she’s experiencing can be indicative of a stroke, but they can also be caused by many other things. That’s why we need to do the brain scan and cognitive assessment. If it is a stroke, the treatment options will depend on the type of stroke and the severity of the symptoms. Treatment may include medication to dissolve blood clots, surgery to remove blood clots, and rehabilitation therapy to help your mother regain lost function. I understand this is a lot to take in, and I want to assure you that I will be right here with you every step of the way. I will keep you updated on your mother’s condition, and I will answer any questions you may have. And I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to ensure your mother’s comfort and well-being. Would you like me to schedule the tests for your mother right away?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Yes, please. Schedule the tests for her right away. I just want to get this over with. I just want to know what’s going on. And… can you please explain the tests to her in more detail? She gets very anxious easily, you see. And… can you be here when she has the tests? I just want to make sure she’s okay. And… can you please keep me updated on everything? I just want to know what’s going on. I just want to make sure she’s okay. And… thank you. Thank you for being so patient with me. And… thank you for being so kind. I just want to make sure she’s okay. And… could you please tell her that I’m here for her? And… that I love her? She gets very lonely sometimes, you see. And… that I’m here for her?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Tofani. I understand your concerns, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. I will schedule the tests for your mother right away, and I will be here with her when she has them. I will explain the tests to her in detail, and I will address any concerns she may have. I will also keep you updated on everything, and I will answer any questions you may have. And I will certainly tell her that you’re here for her and that you love her. It’s important for her to know that she has your support. I'll call you back shortly with the scheduling details. I also want to let you know I’ve made a note to personally speak with your mother before the tests to explain everything and ease her anxiety. Is there anything else I can do for you right now, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been so kind and patient with me. I really appreciate it. And… thank you for being so understanding. I just want to make sure she’s okay. And… thank you for being so kind. And… thank you for being so understanding. I just want to make sure she’s okay. And… thank you. Thank you so much. You’ve been a lifesaver. And… thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Tofani. It’s my pleasure. I understand your concerns, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. I want to assure you that your mother is in good hands. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’m here for you and your mother. I’ll call you back shortly with the scheduling details. And please, try to relax. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, Ms. Tofani. And I’ll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: .
