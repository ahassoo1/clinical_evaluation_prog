DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. BuoniconTI. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’m hoping to get some paperwork sorted out, regarding… future care, I believe. Something to do with making sure my wishes are known, should I… become unable to communicate them myself. I think it’s called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I was advised to look into it. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, and I don’t recall all the specifics.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable. Advance care planning is very important, and it’s wise to get these things in order. So, you’re looking into an Advance Directive – that covers your overall wishes for medical care, and a POLST form – which is more specific to current medical conditions and what treatments you would or wouldn’t want. Before we dive into the paperwork, let’s just briefly talk about your overall health. Has anything been bothering you recently?
PATIENT: Oh, well… recent is a relative term, isn't it? I don’t believe anything specifically has been bothering me, no. I do… tire easily, but I attribute that to the work. Etching is quite demanding, you see. Requires a steady hand and… a lot of focus. And I’m not as young as I once was, naturally. I suppose I haven’t seen a doctor in… some time. It’s not something I tend to dwell on, if I’m feeling alright. Do you need a list of medications? I… think I have a few for blood pressure, but I wouldn’t swear to it.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's try to get a clearer picture. It says here you have a history of hypertension, diagnosed about five years ago. And you are currently prescribed Lisinopril 20mg daily. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, that sounds right. Lisinopril… daily. You’re very thorough, Doctor. I… I really don’t keep close track. It’s good to know it’s all written down somewhere. Five years… that does seem about right. I take it regularly, I believe. Though, if I miss a dose here or there… I wouldn't be entirely surprised. It doesn’t cause me any particular trouble, thankfully. Do you… need to know why I was prescribed it? I recall something about… numbers being too high. It all feels rather vague, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can go over all of that. High blood pressure, or hypertension, can be managed with medication like Lisinopril. It’s important to take it as prescribed to prevent complications. Now, aside from the blood pressure, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me see. No… nothing that springs immediately to mind. I do sometimes feel a bit… lightheaded, but I’ve always attributed that to working long hours in a poorly ventilated studio. It’s drafty, you see, and the fumes from the etching solutions aren’t exactly… pleasant. And occasionally, my hands tremble, but that could just be… fatigue. Or the cold. I haven’t fallen or anything, or felt any chest pain, if that’s what you’re asking. It’s all rather… minor, really. Nothing that would necessitate a doctor’s visit, at least not in my estimation. Is it… concerning that I can’t recall specifics? I apologize for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. BuoniconTI. We'll get to the bottom of things. Lightheadedness and hand tremors could be related to several things, and it's good you're mentioning them. Just to be thorough, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I appreciate your thoroughness. I confess, I’m not particularly fond of medical examinations, but if it will help clarify things, I’m happy to comply. Please, proceed. I’ll try my best to be still. Just… perhaps warn me before you do anything startling? My nerves aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll explain everything as I go. Blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, breath sounds are normal. Reflexes are a bit diminished, and there's a slight tremor in your hands, as you mentioned. Coordination seems generally intact, but we'll need further testing to be sure. I'd like to order some blood work and an EKG to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Not entirely surprising, I suppose. I do tend to get rather stressed when deadlines approach. It’s a demanding profession, etching. Further testing… yes, that sounds… prudent. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Blood work and an EKG, you say? I confess, I have a rather… complicated relationship with needles, but I’ll endure it if necessary. Will it require a prolonged visit? I have a commission due next week, and… time is of the essence.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The blood work is fairly standard, just a few vials. And the EKG is quick and painless – just some stickers on your chest. It shouldn’t take more than about half an hour in total. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. While we wait for the results, let’s talk about the Advance Directive and POLST form you mentioned. Do you have any existing documents, or are we starting from scratch?
PATIENT: Half an hour… yes, that’s manageable, I think. Thank you. Documents… no, I don’t believe so. I started researching it online, a few months ago, and downloaded some forms, perhaps, but I never actually completed them. It felt… overwhelming, truthfully. And I kept putting it off, hoping to get to it when I had more time. So, yes, we are starting from scratch, I suppose. I’m rather ill-equipped to navigate legal jargon, I’m afraid. Perhaps you have some simplified versions? Or… could explain it to me in plain English? I simply want to ensure my wishes are respected, should the unfortunate happen.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Ms. BuoniconTI. That's what I'm here for. We have some simplified forms we can use, and I’m happy to walk you through everything in plain English. Essentially, an Advance Directive allows you to specify what types of medical care you want or don’t want if you become unable to make decisions for yourself. It covers things like CPR, mechanical ventilation, and feeding tubes. The POLST form, on the other hand, is a more specific document that outlines your wishes for current medical conditions. It's typically used for people with serious illnesses. The first thing we need to think about is your overall goals for care. What’s most important to you?
PATIENT: Overall goals… that's a rather large question, isn’t it? I suppose… quality of life is paramount. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially, if there was no hope of recovery. Prolonging suffering… that would be… unacceptable. I value my independence greatly, and I wouldn’t want to become a burden on anyone. And… I’d like to remain comfortable, as much as possible. Is that… too vague? I’m not accustomed to articulating these sorts of things. It feels… morbid, somehow. I simply want to be treated with dignity, and to have my wishes respected. And I’d like to be allowed to… pass peacefully, should my time come. Is that… permissible?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly clear, Ms. BuoniconTI. And perfectly reasonable. You've articulated your wishes very well. Quality of life, avoiding prolonged suffering, and maintaining dignity are all very important considerations. Now, let's talk about specific treatments. Would you want CPR if your heart stopped?
PATIENT: CPR… oh dear. That sounds… rather unpleasant. I… I don’t believe so. If my heart were to stop, and there was no reasonable chance of recovery… I wouldn’t want to be subjected to that. Breaking ribs and… all of that. It seems rather… undignified. Is that… the correct response? I’m not sure I’m phrasing this properly. I simply don’t want to be kept alive artificially, if there’s no hope of recovery. And I certainly wouldn’t want to be subjected to painful or invasive procedures, for no benefit. Perhaps… a “do not resuscitate” order? Is that what it’s called? I’ve read about it, but I’m not entirely certain.
DOCTOR: You're phrasing it perfectly, Ms. BuoniconTI. A “do not resuscitate” or DNR order is exactly what you’re referring to. It means that if your heart stopped and there was no reasonable chance of recovery, we would focus on keeping you comfortable rather than attempting CPR. That’s a very sensible decision. Now, let’s move on to mechanical ventilation. That's when a machine helps you breathe if you're unable to do so on your own. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Mechanical ventilation… oh. That sounds… frightening. I believe… I would not want that. If I were unable to breathe on my own, and there was no reasonable hope of recovery… I would prefer not to be kept alive artificially. It seems… undignified, and frankly, rather terrifying. I understand it can be life-saving in some situations, but I simply wouldn’t want it for myself. I would prefer to allow nature to take its course. Is that… acceptable? I apologize for my… reluctance to discuss these things. It feels rather morbid, somehow. But I want to be sure my wishes are respected, should the unfortunate happen.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. BuoniconTI. And absolutely acceptable. We’re documenting your wishes, and it’s important to be clear about what you want. We will add a note to your chart stating that you do not want mechanical ventilation if there's no reasonable hope of recovery. Now, let's talk about feeding tubes. That's when a tube is inserted into your stomach to provide nutrition if you're unable to eat on your own. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Feeding tubes… oh dear. That sounds… rather unpleasant as well. I believe… I would not want that either. If I were unable to eat on my own, and there was no reasonable hope of recovery… I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially through a feeding tube. It seems… undignified, and frankly, rather invasive. I understand it can provide nutrition, but I simply wouldn’t want it for myself. I would prefer to allow nature to take its course. Is that… permissible? I apologize for my… reluctance to discuss these things. It feels rather morbid, somehow. But I want to be sure my wishes are respected, should the unfortunate happen. Perhaps I should have started this paperwork sooner. It's a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. BuoniconTI. And we're documenting your wishes accordingly. We will add a note to your chart stating that you do not want a feeding tube if there is no reasonable hope of recovery. We’ve covered a lot today. We’ve documented your wishes regarding CPR, mechanical ventilation, and feeding tubes. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss, or are you comfortable with where we are?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s everything. It feels… a great weight has been lifted, truthfully. Knowing my wishes are documented, and that they will be respected… it’s a tremendous comfort. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… remarkably patient and understanding. I confess, I was dreading this conversation, but you’ve made it… bearable. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Perhaps, once the blood work results are back, we can discuss… a pain management plan? Just in case. I don't want to be in pain, if… the unfortunate happens. But for now… I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. BuoniconTI. It was my pleasure. And yes, absolutely. Once we have the blood work results, we can definitely discuss a pain management plan. We want to ensure you’re as comfortable as possible, no matter what. I’ll have a copy of the completed Advance Directive for you to take home. Please review it carefully, and let me know if you have any questions or changes. Now, let's get those blood work results scheduled and see what they tell us. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll be sure to review the paperwork carefully. And I appreciate your kindness. It’s a relief to have this sorted out. I suppose… I’ll see you tomorrow, then? For the blood work and… further discussion? Thank you again, Doctor Chora.
DOCTOR: Yes, tomorrow morning. And you're very welcome, Ms. BuoniconTI. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good rest of your day.
