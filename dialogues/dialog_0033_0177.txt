DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Genard, please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello doctor. It’s… it’s a problem. Down there. Something’s… leaking. I don’t like it. It’s messy.
DOCTOR: Leaking, you say. Yes, well, that’s… not ideal. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean specific? It comes out. From… you know. Down there. Like a little… drip. It's not blood, thankfully, but it’s… unpleasant. Honestly, it’s just… embarrassing. I haven't had this happen before, not like this. It’s been a few days, maybe? I lose track.
DOCTOR: A few days… right. And is it… constant?
PATIENT: Constant? No, not always. It’s… comes and goes. Mostly when I… well, you know. When I’m resting. Sometimes just… happens. I don’t make it happen, if that makes sense. It’s just… there. And it smells funny. Not like flowers, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any pain, burning, or itching associated with this… leakage?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain. Maybe a little… uncomfortable? It feels… raw, a bit. Like I’ve been… scrubbing too much. I don't understand why this would be happening. I always keep things clean! And… no burning. Not really. Just… icky. And it worries me, you know? It just doesn't feel right.
DOCTOR: It's likely just some minor irritation, Mrs. Genard. A common thing, especially… at your age. Let’s do a quick exam, just to be sure. Have you had any recent changes in your hygiene products?
PATIENT: Hygiene products? What do you mean? I use soap. Like always. The same soap, for years! It's the kind my mother used. What kind of question is that? This is ridiculous. I keep myself clean, I tell you! This must be something… serious. Not just some soap problem.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. Well, it could be a variety of things. We'll get to the bottom of it. Let’s try to be… thorough. Have you experienced any changes in your bladder or bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bladder and… bowels? Now you want to talk about that? Doctor, this is very personal! What does that even have to do with… the leaking? Honestly. I came in about one thing, and now you’re asking me about… everything. I don't appreciate this. Is this how you treat all your older patients?
DOCTOR: It’s called a differential diagnosis, Mrs. Genard. We must consider all possibilities. Are you refusing to answer my questions?
PATIENT: Refusing? No! It's just… inappropriate! I came in about something very specific, and now you want to know about… everything! It’s embarrassing. And frankly, it feels like you don't believe me when I say I keep myself clean. I’m a respectable woman! This isn’t helping me at all! I want to know what’s wrong with me, not answer a quiz! .
DOCTOR: Very well. It sounds like you are distressed and unwilling to cooperate with a proper examination. Perhaps a second opinion would be beneficial. I am unable to provide a diagnosis without more information. I can offer you a referral to another physician. Is that acceptable?
