DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, it’s about this… procedure. My daughter insisted I get a check-up beforehand. Said it was “necessary.” Honestly, I don’t see why. I’ve lived 81 years without needing a doctor for cosmetic things. But here I am. Just want to get this over with, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. It’s always good to be thorough, even for elective procedures. Your daughter sounds like a sensible woman. And you’re right, 81 years is quite a track record! Just to be clear, this procedure is… the mole removal, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, the mole. On my nose. It’s not bothering me, not at all. Been there for… well, decades. My wife never minded it. Said it gave me character. But my daughter, she worries about everything. Says it could be something. Honestly, I think she just doesn’t like the way it looks. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, it’s good your daughter is proactive about your health, even if it feels a bit unnecessary right now. We'll take a look, just to be safe. It’s always best to rule things out. Before we do that, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? What does she want to know? I eat… normally. Fish, mostly. And potatoes. I used to be very active, building things, you know? Terrazzo work is hard on the body. Now, not so much. I get a bit tired. But who doesn’t at my age? I don't go around listing my ailments to everyone, if that’s what you're after. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Just trying to get a picture of things. Fish and potatoes sounds good. And terrazzo work is hard work. So, fatigue... is that new, or has that been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: Ongoing, I suppose. It’s not like I’m bedridden or anything. Just… slower. And I don’t have the energy for the garden like I used to. My wife always had a lovely garden. She’d be… disappointed. Look, are we going to get to the mole, or are we just talking about my life now? I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: We will get to the mole, Mr. Orwin. I promise. Just a few more questions to make sure we're covering everything. It’s important to get a full picture. Have you had any other medical problems – anything like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart trouble?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… maybe, years ago. The doctor gave me some pills. Didn't like taking them, so I stopped. Diabetes? No. Heart trouble… well, my heart’s still beating, isn't it? Look, I’m a simple man. I’ve lived a long life, mostly healthy. This mole isn’t going to kill me. Honestly, this is a bit… demeaning. Are you a specialist in moles, or… something else? I’d prefer to just get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. I'm a family medicine physician, and while I don't specialize in moles, I'm certainly trained to evaluate skin lesions. And it's good you haven't had any major medical problems. Let's just take a quick look at the mole, and then we can discuss our options. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry it up. I haven’t got all day. And please, don't tell me it's something awful. I really don't need that right now. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a look. Hmm… It's about 5 millimeters in diameter, slightly raised, and the color is uneven… mostly dark brown with some lighter areas. Is it itchy, painful, or has it changed in size or shape recently?
PATIENT: Itchy? No. Painful? Definitely not. Changed? Not that I’ve noticed. Looked the same for… decades, probably. I told you, it’s nothing. My wife used to… she'd touch it sometimes. Said it was a lucky mole. Are you done yet? This is… uncomfortable. All this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay. It appears stable, and as you said, hasn't changed recently. However, given the uneven color and the fact that it's raised, I do recommend we send it to pathology for a biopsy, just to be certain. It's a simple procedure, we'll numb the area, remove a small sample, and send it to the lab. It's the safest course of action, Mr. Orwin. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially with anything involving the skin. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Pathology? Biopsy? Now you're just trying to frighten me. Look, I've had moles my whole life. This one is perfectly harmless. I refuse. Absolutely refuse. I’m not letting you cut into my face for nothing. It’ll leave a scar, I know it will. My daughter is going to be furious if I come home looking worse. I’m leaving. This is ridiculous. I wasted my morning on this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, please sit down. I understand your reluctance, and I'm not trying to frighten you. A biopsy is a very standard procedure, and it’s the most responsible way to proceed. The lab will determine if it's benign or not. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. I can explain the procedure in detail, and we can discuss options for minimizing scarring. If it is benign, then we don’t need to do anything further. If it’s not, we can discuss treatment options. But without knowing for sure, we're just guessing. Would you at least consider it?
PATIENT: Consider? No. I've made up my mind. I am not having anything cut off my face. You doctors always want to do something, cut something, prescribe something. I’m perfectly healthy, as far as I’m concerned. And my daughter… she can worry about something else. I’m leaving now. Don’t try to stop me. This is a waste of my time. I want a refund for this… charade. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I strongly advise against leaving without a biopsy. I understand you're frustrated, but this is about your health. Without knowing what this lesion is, we can’t guarantee it won't cause problems in the future. I’m happy to provide you with information about the risks of not having it checked. I am concerned about this mole, and I am ethically obligated to advise you to get it evaluated. I can offer to write a detailed note for your daughter explaining my concerns. However, I cannot ethically allow you to leave without at least acknowledging the potential risks. Perhaps we can compromise?
