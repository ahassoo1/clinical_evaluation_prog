DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Gyamfi. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Ah, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Yes… well, it is… the words. They do not come so easy now. It’s… frustrating, you understand? I forget… what I want to say, even before I say it. It has been… some time now, this problem.
DOCTOR: “Words not coming easy,” you say. And this has been ongoing for “some time.” Could you be more precise, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: Precise… hmm. That is… difficult. Perhaps… six months? Maybe longer. It is… hard to remember exactly. It started… slowly, I think. Just… little pauses here and there. Now… it is more often. I am… a Compensation man, you see. I need the words to do my job.
DOCTOR: “Compensation man”?
PATIENT: Yes. I… work with the money for people, when they are hurt at work, or… retire. Benefits, too. It is… job analysis, also. I figure out what the job needs, you understand? But… it is difficult when the words… escape.
DOCTOR: Right. So, six months of increasing difficulty with word retrieval. And this is impacting your… professional life. Have you noticed any other changes, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. No… not really. I… sleep okay. Eat okay. I walk… I am a tall man, you see. Everything else… feels normal, I suppose. Except for… the words. It makes me… anxious, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Anxiety is a common symptom when one's cognitive function is… less than optimal. Now, let’s move on. Any family history of… similar issues?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That is… a good question. My wife… she passed away five years ago. We did not… talk much about family history. She was a quiet woman. My father… he was a farmer. I do not… recall any problems with his words. Perhaps… my aunt? She was… forgetful, I think. But it was… old age, you see.
DOCTOR: "Forgetful" is rather vague, Mr. Gyamfi. Was this simply age-related memory lapses, or something more… concerning?
PATIENT: Concerning… hmm. I… do not know. She would… repeat herself, sometimes. Ask the same question many times. But she was very old. I was… young then. I did not… pay much attention, I suppose. It was just… old age.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: Medications… No, Doctor. I… I do not take anything. Just… a vitamin, sometimes. For the bones. But that is all. I try to… stay healthy. Medicare covers it, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. We've established no current medications, a family history of… unspecified forgetfulness, and increasing difficulty with word retrieval over the past six months. Now, I'd like to perform a brief cognitive assessment. It will involve some simple questions and tasks. Do you agree?
PATIENT: A… assessment? Yes, Doctor. If you think it will… help. I… I want to understand what is happening. I do not like… the feeling of losing the words. If questions will help, then… yes, please.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three unrelated words. Please pay close attention. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Repeat them back to me immediately after I say them.
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Apple, Table, Penny. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “World” backwards. Take your time.
PATIENT: Backwards… hmm. That is… difficult. Let me think… D… L… R… O… W… Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Gyamfi. It is W-O-R-L-D. Now, I'm going to ask you to subtract seven from one hundred, and then subtract seven from that result, and continue subtracting seven until I tell you to stop. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Subtract… seven? From one hundred? Yes… I think so. One hundred… minus seven is… ninety-three. Ninety-three minus seven is… eighty-six.
DOCTOR: Eighty-six is incorrect, Mr. Gyamfi. It is eighty-two. We will stop there. Based on this brief assessment, your performance is… concerning. It is too early to provide a definitive diagnosis, but these results suggest a possible cognitive impairment. I recommend further investigation. We will schedule an MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities, and I will refer you to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation.
PATIENT: An… MRI? A neurologist? Is it… serious, Doctor? What… what does this mean? I just… want to remember the words.
DOCTOR: It is too early to speculate, Mr. Gyamfi. An MRI will simply provide a clearer picture of your brain structure. The neurologist will conduct more detailed cognitive testing to determine the underlying cause of your difficulties. It could be something relatively benign, but we must rule out more serious possibilities. We will proceed with caution. I will have my nurse schedule these appointments for you immediately. Do you have any further questions… for now?
PATIENT: No… I… I think not. Just… the appointments. Please. And… thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be with you shortly. .
PATIENT: .
