DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Glazewski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s my stool. It’s… dark. Black, mostly. And frankly, I haven’t got all day to sit here describing my… business. I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking ‘em for years. Is that what this is about? It better be, because I’ve got a garden that needs weeding.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Dark, black stool, and you’re concerned it might be related to the pain medication you take for your arthritis. We definitely want to look into that. It could be related to the medication, but there are other possibilities we need to rule out. Just to be clear, has this been happening for a while, or is this a recent change?
PATIENT: Recent. Just the last… oh, I don’t know, maybe a week? It wasn't like this before. And honestly, I don't spend my time analyzing my stool, Doctor. I noticed it, and it worried me, so I finally made an appointment. It's not exactly a pleasant topic, is it? Now, are you going to poke around, or what? Because I really don’t have time for a long examination.
DOCTOR: No, of course not. I understand it’s not pleasant to discuss, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. A week is good to know. Yes, I would like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel around a bit. It won’t be anything invasive, I promise. Then we might want to run a few simple tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But make it quick. And don’t tell me what you're listening for. I don't need a lecture on what could be wrong with me. Just… get on with it. I’ve got tomatoes to stake.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be as efficient as possible. I’m just listening for any unusual sounds, and feeling for any tenderness. Take some nice, deep breaths for me, Dawnetta. Everything seems relatively normal on the surface. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? Honestly, Doctor, I eat what’s in season. Tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers… sometimes a bit of sausage if my husband’s feeling generous. Nothing fancy. I haven't been eating anything different, no. And I certainly haven’t been eating anything that would turn my stool black. Are you suggesting I’m lying? Because I assure you, I know what I've been putting in my mouth. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, not at all! I apologize if I came across that way. I'm not suggesting you’re lying, Dawnetta. I just need to rule out all possibilities. It’s standard procedure. Sometimes even seemingly harmless changes can have an effect. Okay. And have you noticed any blood in your stool, aside from the darkness?
PATIENT: Blood? Good heavens, no. If there was blood, do you think I’d be sitting here calmly chatting with you? I’d be at the hospital! It’s just… dark. Like coffee grounds, almost. And it’s not happening every time, you know. Sometimes it’s normal. It’s very confusing, honestly. I really think it’s those pain pills. They’ve changed the formula three times in the last year. Probably some awful side effect no one bothered to mention. Honestly, doctors these days… Now, are we finished? I’m starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, and it is possible the medication is playing a role. It's good you’ve noticed the formula changes. Just to be thorough, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis, obviously. And I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now. No complications. And… let me think. High blood pressure, but it’s controlled with a little pill. That’s it. Nothing else. I’m not a sickly woman, Doctor. I garden, I cook, I keep a clean house. I certainly don't have time for a long list of ailments. Really, this whole thing is probably just stress. My grandson’s getting married, you know. It’s a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And you mentioned you take a pill for your blood pressure. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, do you expect me to memorize the names of every little pill I take? My husband handles all that. He’s the organized one. It’s a white one, I think. Small. I take it every morning with my coffee. That’s all I know. Really, I’m starting to feel quite foolish sitting here answering these ridiculous questions. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Dawnetta. It’s perfectly alright if you don't remember the name. We can look it up in your records if you’d like. Now, just one more question about your family history. Has anyone in your family had any history of stomach problems, colon cancer, or bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Now you’re asking about my family? My mother had a bit of indigestion, but that’s it. My father smoked too much, but he died of a heart attack. And my brother… well, he just lived a wild life. Nothing relevant here, Doctor. Honestly, I think I’m done. I’m going home to weed my garden. I suggest you check my records and prescribe something for my arthritis. I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. I understand your frustration. I will review your records and consider what we’ve discussed. Given your history of dark stools, even with the possibility of medication side effects, I do want to be cautious. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a stool test to check for blood. It will also analyze the stool for any other abnormalities. While we await the results, if you experience any dizziness, weakness, or feel particularly unwell, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
