DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Don't like it. Hurts to blink sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Uh… a few months, I think. Maybe longer? Time kinda… slips away when you get old, you know? It's not like it was sudden. Just… got worse and worse.
DOCTOR: I certainly understand that, Mr. Pipolo. Time does seem to move differently as we get older. A few months is helpful, though. And would you say it's both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both. Yeah, both of 'em. Not bad all the time, just… when I'm workin', mostly. Or if it's windy. Wind gets 'em real bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse with activity and exposure to wind. That gives us a good starting point. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the dryness?
PATIENT: Like… what kinda symptoms? I just know they feel… scratchy. And sometimes blurry. Not all the time blurry, but when they're real dry. Don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Pipolo. Scratchiness and blurry vision along with dryness are common. Have you noticed any redness, discharge, or crusting around your eyes?
PATIENT: No. No redness. No… crusty stuff. Just… dry. And scratchy. I wipe 'em with my hand sometimes, but that don't help much. Just feels like there's somethin' in 'em, even when there ain't.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently using any eye drops or any other medications for your eyes?
PATIENT: Nope. Never used nothin'. Never really needed to 'til now. Don't like puttin' stuff in my eyes, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Pipolo. Many people feel that way. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothin' really. I get a little ache in my back sometimes, from the cement work, but that's it. Old age, you know? I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. Never been sick much. And no, don't have… diabeetus, or… arthritis. Whatever that is.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Pipolo. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Nope. Never been in the hospital. Not even as a kid. Had my tonsils out when I was little, maybe? But that was a long time ago. Don't remember much about it. No big surgeries, though. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Well, my brother passed a few years back. He had… heart trouble. And my sister lives down in Anchorage, but I don't see her much. She's… okay, I guess. As far as eye trouble… I don't think anyone had nothin' bad. Not that I know of. We don't talk about that kinda stuff much.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Now, just a few more quick questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for ya. Worked around folks who smoked, though. Always smelled awful.
DOCTOR: And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a beer sometimes. With dinner. Not much. Maybe one or two. Not every night, either. Used to have more when I was younger, but… not so much now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a quick examination of your eyes, if that's alright with you. It won't take long, and it will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Just get it over with. I got things to do. Let's just… hurry it up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I'll do my best to be quick. Please look straight ahead. I’m just going to check your visual acuity first. Could you read the letters on this chart for me, starting with the top row?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. Let me get my glasses on. Okay… um… is that an E? Yeah, an E. And… that's an F. I think. Hard to see.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Now, I’m going to shine a light into your eyes. Please keep looking straight ahead, and let me know if it's uncomfortable. Okay, good. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Now, I’m going to gently pull down your lower eyelids and check the surface of your eyes. Hmm… Your conjunctiva appears slightly dry, but no significant redness or discharge. The cornea looks clear. Now, I’m going to check your eye movements. Please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Eye movements are full and smooth. Alright, Mr. Pipolo. Based on the examination, it appears you have dry eye disease, likely exacerbated by your work and environmental factors like wind. It's very common, especially with age. We can manage it.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? And what can we do about it? I don't want nothin' serious. Just want my eyes to stop feelin' scratchy. Don't have time for a long treatment or nothin'.
DOCTOR: It means your eyes aren't producing enough lubrication, or the quality of the tears isn't good enough to keep them comfortable. It's not usually serious, but it can be quite bothersome. And I understand you don’t want anything complicated. The good news is it’s usually manageable with simple treatments. The first thing I recommend is artificial tears. You can find these over-the-counter at any pharmacy. I suggest using them 4-6 times a day, even when your eyes don’t feel dry, to keep them lubricated. There are different brands, some with preservatives and some without. If you're using them frequently, I'd recommend preservative-free drops to avoid irritation. We can also try a simple lifestyle modification: avoid prolonged screen time, and make sure to blink frequently when working. If the artificial tears aren't enough, we can consider a thicker ointment to use at night. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter… okay. I can do that. Pharmacy's not too far. And blinkin'… yeah, I can try to remember to do that. The ointment sounds messy, though. Let's just try the drops first. How long 'til they start workin'? I got work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with the artificial tears. They usually provide relief within a few minutes, but it may take a few days to notice a significant improvement. If you don't see any change after a week, then we can discuss the ointment or other options. I'll write you a note with these recommendations. It includes the frequency of use and what to look for if things get worse, like increased pain or vision changes. If you experience any of those symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately, or go to the emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Nah. I think that's it. Just… thanks. Hope these drops work. Don't have time for this. I'll see ya. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pipolo. You're very welcome. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And I hope they work for you too. Have a good day, and be careful out there. .
