DOCTOR: Hi Sammie, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about this heat. Honestly, I don’t know what’s gotten into the weather these past few years. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, no problem. Now? I get wiped out after just a couple of hours. Feels like I’m gonna melt, and it's not even that hot, you know? Not like Nepal hot, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, you’re noticing you’re getting more easily overheated and fatigued than you used to, even in temperatures that wouldn't have bothered you before. And this has been happening in recent years, not a sudden thing?
PATIENT: Right. Not sudden. Gradual. Started maybe… five, six years ago? It's frustrating. I'm a painter, construction, maintenance work, you know? Gotta be outside. Can’t exactly sit in an air-conditioned room all day. Used to be able to handle it. Now I have to take breaks every hour, find shade… it’s slowing everything down. Makes me feel… useless, almost. Not something I’m used to.
DOCTOR: I hear you, Sammie. It sounds really frustrating to have your ability to work impacted like that, especially when you’re used to being able to handle a lot. We'll figure out what's going on. Besides the fatigue and overheating, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really feeling thirsty, which is odd. I always drank plenty of water when I was working. Now, I don’t… crave it, I guess. And sometimes my head feels a little… fuzzy. Not a full-blown headache, just… not quite right. And my hands swell up a bit at the end of the day, but that could just be from the work, honestly. I’ve always had big hands. Big man’s hands, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased thirst, some fuzziness in your head, and hand swelling at the end of the day. That’s helpful. And the hand swelling is more noticeable recently, or has it always been there?
PATIENT: More noticeable. Always been a little puffy sometimes, but not like this. Now it’s… prominent. You can see the veins disappearing, you know? Like sausages. And it's not just after a really hard day. Even on a lighter workload, it happens now. It's… concerning. Makes me wonder what else is going wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sammie, that's definitely good information. We'll want to look into this further. To get a better picture of what's happening, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, not much to tell. I’ve been pretty healthy my whole life. Never been one for doctors, to be frank. A bit of a waste of time, most of it. Got my Medicare, of course, but I rarely use it. Just the usual check-ups. No major illnesses, no surgeries. Maybe a bad cold here and there. Lived a simple life, you know? Worked hard, ate well… mostly. Oh, and my blood pressure was a bit high last year, but the doctor said it wasn’t anything to worry about. Just watch the salt, he said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, no major illnesses or surgeries, a bit of high blood pressure that's being monitored, and you try to watch your salt intake. That's good to know. Any family history of medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tough one. My family… well, we didn’t really talk about that sort of thing. Back in Nepal, you just… dealt with things. Didn’t dwell on it. My father lived to be a good age, I think, maybe in his eighties. But he worked the land his whole life, hard labor. My mother… she wasn’t so lucky. She had some sort of… weakness, I guess. Never really understood it. She got sick quickly and… well, she passed when I was young. Nothing that I can really pinpoint, honestly. Sorry. Not much help, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sammie, that's understandable. It's common for families not to have detailed medical histories readily available. So, father lived to a good age with a physically demanding job, and your mother had some illness that you weren't able to get much information about. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything regularly, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a couple of things. I take a multivitamin, you know, just to keep things topped up. Old age, you gotta do what you gotta do. And occasionally, if my back’s acting up after a long day of painting, I'll take ibuprofen. The usual stuff. Nothing prescribed, nothing fancy. Just what you can get at the drugstore. I try not to take too much, don't want to rely on pills. Makes you feel weak, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen for back pain. Good to know. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, you know, travelled a bit. Spicy food, weird fruits… never a problem. Never had any trouble with medications either. Lucky, I suppose. I've always been a strong man. My body can handle things. Though, lately…
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Sammie, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to get a better feel for what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just don't take too long, I have things to do. And try not to poke too much. Old man's skin is delicate, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be gentle. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 148 over 92. It was noted as being slightly high last year as well, so we'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Good. Now, I'm going to check your hands. You mentioned some swelling. Your hands do have some significant swelling, and it looks like it's pitting edema - meaning it leaves a dent when I press on it. Also, your skin feels a little thin and dry, and your capillary refill is a bit slow. Now, let’s take a look at your feet and ankles. Similar swelling in your feet and ankles, and some discoloration of the skin on your lower legs. This is quite a bit of swelling overall. I'm also going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal, which is good. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. I'm going to order some blood tests and a urine test to get a better understanding of what might be causing this swelling and fatigue. These tests will check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any other potential causes.
PATIENT: Blood tests, huh? Never been much for blood tests. What exactly are you looking for? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't have time to be sitting around waiting for things to happen. This better not be a wild goose chase. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sammie. You’re right to ask. The blood tests will help us look at several things. We'll check your kidney function, as kidneys play a big role in fluid balance, and that can explain the swelling. We’ll also look at your electrolytes – things like sodium and potassium – because imbalances can cause fatigue and swelling. We’ll also check a complete blood count to see if there’s anything else going on. And finally, a basic metabolic panel to get an overall picture of your health. The urine test will look for protein, which can also be a sign of kidney issues. The lab usually takes a couple of days to process the results, so I’d estimate we’ll have them back by Wednesday. I'll have the nurse call you as soon as they are available. It's not necessarily a wild goose chase, Sammie. The swelling and fatigue, combined with the elevated blood pressure, need to be investigated. It's better to rule things out and get you back to feeling your best. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Wednesday, huh? Fine. I suppose two days isn't the end of the world. But I expect a phone call, not some letter in the mail. And no unnecessary tests, understand? Just the essentials. I don't want to be poked and prodded all over the place. As for questions… what exactly are you hoping to find? Is it something serious? You're not trying to scare an old man, are you? I’ve lived a long life, I don't need any surprises now.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand your concerns, Sammie. I promise, we're only ordering the essentials. The tests I’ve ordered are the most appropriate first step to understanding the cause of your symptoms. I’m not trying to scare you at all. It’s important to be thorough, but there’s no need for alarm. The swelling and fatigue could be caused by a number of things, some more serious than others. One possibility is a kidney issue, which is why we're checking your kidney function. Another possibility is heart failure, although your heart sounds were normal during the exam. It could also be related to a medication side effect, or even something as simple as fluid retention due to your diet. We're just trying to gather information so we can make the right diagnosis and get you the appropriate treatment. I will personally review the results when they come back, and I’ll call you directly to discuss them, regardless of what they show. I will explain everything in plain language, and we will work together to create a plan that's right for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Explain things in plain language, you said? No medical jargon? I hate all that… “proximal convoluted tubule” nonsense. Just tell me what it means. And call me directly. Not some nurse reading from a script. I want to talk to you. What about my work? I can’t just sit around waiting for test results. I have deadlines to meet. Do you have any advice about that? Perhaps I should just slow down? Though, I’ve never been one for slowing down. It's a foolish thought.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sammie. No medical jargon, I promise. I’ll explain everything in plain language – I understand how frustrating it can be when doctors use terms you don’t understand. And I will call you directly when the results are back – you won’t be speaking to a nurse reading from a script. As for your work… that’s a good question. While we’re waiting for the test results, it might be a good idea to take things a little easier, just to avoid putting any unnecessary strain on your body. It doesn't mean you need to stop working altogether, but perhaps you could delegate some tasks, take more frequent breaks, and avoid working in the hottest part of the day. I know it's not easy to slow down when you’re used to being active, but it’s important to listen to your body. We need to figure out what’s causing your symptoms first, and then we can make a plan to get you back to doing what you love. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, and avoid salty foods. I can also write you a note for work, explaining that you’re undergoing some medical testing and may need to adjust your workload temporarily. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: A note for work… hmm. That might be useful. Just something simple, saying I’m seeing a doctor. No need to go into detail. I don't want them worrying. And no, I don’t need any lectures about “listening to my body.” I’ve been listening to my body for sixty-two years. It’s just… telling me different things now. It’s a nuisance, that’s what it is. Alright, write the note. And then… I guess I’ll go home and try not to worry. Easier said than done, of course. Let’s get this over with. The sooner I have the results, the sooner I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sammie. Here you go. Here’s the note for work. I’ve kept it simple, as you requested. I understand this is frustrating, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Remember, stay hydrated, avoid salty foods, and try to get some rest. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before Wednesday. It was good meeting you, Sammie. I'll be in touch.
PATIENT: Fine. Good enough. You too, Doctor. And don't keep me waiting. I have things to do. And try not to scare me when you call, alright?
