DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. I’m here for a tryout. Sports team. Need to get checked out first, I guess. Want to get this over with quickly if we can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark. A sports physical, excellent. Understandable wanting to be efficient. Just to be clear, is this for a specific sport, or a general team tryout?
PATIENT: It's for… uh… basketball. Yeah, basketball. Local team, nothing fancy. Haven't played in a while, though, so I figured a checkup was smart. Don't want to pull anything.
DOCTOR: Smart move, absolutely. It's always best to be cautious. Okay, let's get some background information first. Have you been seen by a doctor recently?
PATIENT: Not really. Last time… hmm… probably a checkup a few years back? Maybe five? Nothing serious, just the usual. Honestly, I mostly just try to avoid needing to see one, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Many people feel that way. Alright. And, just to get a complete picture, do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I'm aware of. I eat pretty much anything. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach. She was probably right. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing at all. Just… coffee. Does that count? I need that to function, but I don't think it's a medicine. I eat okay, sleep okay, drink enough water… pretty basic, really. I’m not one for pills and stuff.
DOCTOR: Coffee doesn't count, Lamark. You're doing well so far. Alright, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. I've had the occasional cold, maybe a sprained ankle when I was younger, but nothing serious. My family, we're all pretty healthy, actually. My dad lived to be 85, and my mother’s still kicking at 78. Good genes, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear about your family, Lamark. Good genes are a blessing. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed ‘em. And, uh… one time I got a bad case of the flu when I was a kid. Had to stay overnight at the hospital, but that was it. Like, a really, really bad flu. But other than that, no hospitals. I avoid 'em whenever possible. Are we almost done? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Almost there, Lamark. Just a few more questions, and then we’ll do a quick physical exam. One last thing regarding your history - can you tell me about any lifestyle habits that might be relevant, like smoking, alcohol consumption, or recreational drug use?
PATIENT: Nope, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. Maybe a beer or two with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested. I’m a pretty straight-laced guy, really. Want to keep my body in good shape for… well, for basketball. Even if I’m getting a little old for it. Can we actually do the exam now? I'm starting to feel a bit impatient.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lamark. You've been very forthcoming, which is appreciated. Let’s get to the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints and reflexes. Then we’ll do a quick neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Just… quick, please? I've got a thing I need to get to later. Let's just get this done.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be as efficient as possible. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit up straight and relax your arm?
PATIENT: Okay. Relax… easier said than done when I’m trying to hurry. Sigh. Here. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. That’s slightly elevated, but not overly concerning on its own. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths.
PATIENT: Deep breaths… inhales deeply, then exhales slowly. Is that good? Heart's probably a bit fast, I was running a little earlier to get here. Don't want to be late, you know? Just checking everything over so I can try out for this team. Is this taking much longer? I’m starting to get a little anxious.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Okay, good. Now, I'm just going to check your joints for range of motion and any signs of inflammation. Let’s start with your shoulders. Can you lift your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Raises arms above head with a slight wince. Yeah, that's… fine. A little creaky, maybe. Haven’t used these arms much lately, mostly just typing. Old age catching up, I guess. Hurry it along, will ya? I've got places to be. My knees aren’t getting any younger either.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little stiffness is normal with age and inactivity. Now, let’s check your knees. Can you bend them as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Bends knees, but stops halfway with a slight grimace. Ooh, there we go. A little pop. Yeah, those are definitely creaky. Played a lot of basketball when I was young, I guess it's catching up with me. Stop poking around so much, Doc, you’re gonna break something. Seriously. Are we almost done yet? My legs are starting to feel like jelly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some mild crepitus in both knees, consistent with age-related wear and tear. No significant swelling or tenderness. Now, just a quick neurological assessment - I’m going to check your reflexes. Please sit back and relax. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems generally alright, Lamark. It appears you’re reasonably fit for your age. However, your slightly elevated blood pressure and some stiffness in your knees are things we should monitor. I’d recommend...
