DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what bring me? My wife… she want… baby. We… old now. She think maybe need help to… make baby happen. I forget what she say exactly. Something about… planning? We want to be sure everything okay first.
DOCTOR: I see. Your wife is hoping to start a family, and you'd like to discuss options and ensure everything is medically safe given your ages. That’s a very thoughtful approach. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about your wife’s overall health?
PATIENT: She… good health, I think. She walk every day. Eat good food. Not much… problem. She go to doctor sometimes, regular check-up. I forget the name of her doctor… very nice lady. She… small, and have… glasses. Maybe 60 years old? She tell me everything okay last time she go. But… maybe things change. I don't know. We both… not so young anymore.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear she's generally healthy and keeps up with regular check-ups. Knowing she sees a doctor regularly is helpful. Do you recall roughly when her last check-up was?
PATIENT: Hmm… last check-up… Oh dear. I really forget. Maybe… six months ago? Or… a year? It was before… the hot weather. Before summer. She tell me she is okay then. I… I am not very good remembering dates, Doctor. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. Dates can be tricky. Approximately six months to a year ago is helpful. And you mentioned she said everything was okay at that time. Has anything changed with her health since then?
PATIENT: Since then… Let me think… She… sometimes tired. More tired than before. And… her back, she complain about her back. Old back. But she always complain about her back. It’s… hard to say if it’s different now. We mostly just… quiet now. Not much… energy for big things. But no… no big problems. No sick. No… hospital. Just… old.
DOCTOR: I understand. Increased fatigue and ongoing back discomfort. It sounds like she’s experiencing some typical changes associated with aging, but it's good we're looking into this carefully. Now, turning to you, Mr. Carlotta, how about your own health?
PATIENT: Me? I… okay. I make things with metal and plastic. Little models. Keep my hands busy. I walk a little, not much. I eat… okay food. My wife cook good food. I go to the doctor… sometimes. When I need to. I have… Medicare. I think everything okay. No big… trouble. But I… not young man either.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re staying active with your hobbies. And it's helpful to know you have Medicare. Do you recall when your last visit to the doctor was, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Hmm… last doctor… Oh, this is hard. Maybe… last year? For check-up. They take… blood. And… look in my ears. Everything okay then. I think. The doctor… he was… tall. And have a beard. Not my regular doctor, just… someone else. I forget the name. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Carlotta. It's common to forget details like that. Approximately a year ago for a check-up with some blood work and an ear examination sounds reasonable. Have you experienced any new or worsening symptoms since that visit?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe… a little stiff in the morning. Old man things. My hands… sometimes hurt when I make little things. But I work through it. I always work through it. Nothing… serious. Just… getting old, I think. And tired, like my wife. We both… just… slow down.
DOCTOR: I understand. Some stiffness and hand discomfort, along with general fatigue. It sounds like you're both experiencing some typical changes associated with aging. Since your wife is hoping to start a family, and given both of your ages, it’s important to consider a thorough evaluation. Are you both aware of the potential risks and challenges associated with pregnancy at this stage in life?
PATIENT: Risks? Challenges? Hmm… I think my wife read something. About… babies being… more sick? And… harder for her to… carry the baby? She worry a little. I try to tell her… we’ll be okay. But… I don't know much about it. We just… want a baby. A little… happiness. But if it's too… dangerous… we don't want that. We just want to be careful.
DOCTOR: It's very thoughtful of you both to consider the potential risks and challenges, and to prioritize safety. You are right to be cautious. There are increased risks of complications such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and chromosomal abnormalities in pregnancies at this stage in life. We would need to perform some tests to assess your wife’s overall health and determine if she is a suitable candidate for pregnancy. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don't think so. My wife is the one with… little problems. She sometimes get… itchy when she eat… shrimp. And… something red. Berries, maybe? But me… no. Never have allergies. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies for you. Your wife has a history of mild allergic reactions to shrimp and potentially berries. That’s good to note. And does your wife currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Let me think… She take something for… her water. Her knees. Arthritis, maybe? Small white pill. And… sometimes something for her… heart. When it… thump fast. But not every day. Just when it… worry her. Small blue pill, I think. She keep them in… the kitchen.
DOCTOR: Okay, she takes medication for her knees and occasionally for a fast heartbeat. Do you happen to know the names of these medications, or perhaps have a list of her medications at home?
PATIENT: Names? No… I don’t think so. My wife is the one who knows. She keep the… papers. In the… blue folder. In the kitchen. I… I am not very good with… names and papers. I just make little things with metal and plastic. She take care of the… important things.
DOCTOR: I see. That's perfectly alright. It's helpful to know she has medications for her knees and heart. To proceed with a proper evaluation for your wife, I’d like to arrange some blood work and an electrocardiogram to assess her overall health and heart function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood work… ECG… Yes. Yes, that’s okay. If it… help. Help us… be sure. My wife… she will be happy. She want to be sure everything okay. When can we… do these things? I worry about… getting the papers. She sometimes… misplace them.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can get the blood work and ECG scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. The lab is just down the hall, and the ECG will be performed in the clinic right here. Don't worry about the medication list for now; we can often get that information directly from the pharmacy if needed. In the meantime, could your wife bring a list of any previous surgeries or hospitalizations she’s had, if she remembers them?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… 9:00 AM. Okay. My wife… she can do that. She remember things better than me. Surgeries… hospitalizations… Hmm… I think she had… something with her… tummy, long time ago. Maybe… when she was young? I forget. She will… try to remember. Thank you, Doctor. You… very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. We’ll do our best to provide the best possible care. So, to summarize, we’ve scheduled blood work and an ECG for your wife tomorrow at 9:00 AM. She’ll try to bring a list of any previous surgeries. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you again, Doctor. For… everything. You make me… feel better. We… we just want a little happiness. And we want to be… careful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. It was a pleasure meeting you. We will do everything we can to help you both achieve that happiness safely. I'll see your wife tomorrow morning. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Have a good day. Thank you again.
