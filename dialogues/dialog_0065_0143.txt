DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about… starting a family. Or, trying to. My… someone I care for, she wants to have a baby. And I thought it was a good idea to… check things first. Make sure I'm… okay, you know? It's a bit confusing, all of it. I'm not so young anymore.
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-conception evaluation. It's… prudent, I suppose, given your age. Although, frankly, at 66, it’s rather… late in the game, isn't it?
PATIENT: Late? Yes, I suppose it is. I… I didn’t really think about that, to be honest. She thinks it's fine, and she's… younger. Much younger. I just want to be sure I can… contribute. And not cause any problems. I forget things easily these days, so I want to make sure everything is… healthy. If that makes sense?
DOCTOR: "Contribute," you say. Very well. Forgetfulness is… concerning, but not necessarily indicative of a systemic issue. We’ll need to be thorough. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Chronic… that means long-lasting, right? I had… a bad cough, years ago. A really bad one. And my back… it aches sometimes. But not always. Doctor… I don’t really go to doctors much. I avoid it if I can. I can't really remember any diagnoses. I think… no, I don’t think so. Is high blood pressure bad?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure is certainly not ideal, Mr. Verrall. It can impact… several systems. The cough, was that treated?
PATIENT: I… think so. It was a long time ago. Maybe… antibiotics? I went to a doctor then, but it was… years ago. I don't remember the name of the doctor or much about it. It just… went away. I stopped coughing. I hope that's alright? I just really don't like going to doctors. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed as best we can. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I… I broke my arm when I was a boy. They put a cast on it, that's all. I don't think that was a surgery, was it? Just… a cast. No, I haven't had any proper surgeries. Never had anything… cut open. I don't like the sound of that.
DOCTOR: Very well. What about family history?
PATIENT: Family… history? You mean… what illnesses my family had? That's… a hard one. My father… he died when I was young. I think it was… his heart? But I don’t really know. And my mother… she lived a long time. She just… got old. I don't remember anyone else having… anything bad. It was a long time ago. We didn’t talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about your social history, Mr. Verrall?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… you mean… what I do? I… I used to work as a Sales Engineer. Retired now, a few years back. I live alone. I… I like to read. And walk. Not much else, really. I don't drink or smoke. Never have. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That's… reasonable. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Mr. Verrall?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I've never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a bit of a sniffle with pollen sometimes, but that's… everyone, isn't it? I’ve never had to take much medication. I try to stay healthy. If that makes sense. I don't like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to a physical exam. It's necessary to assess your current health status, despite… your lack of prior medical care. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Please remove your shirt and shoes.
PATIENT: Oh… remove my shirt? Now? I… I suppose. It's just… a bit sudden. Is it very cold in here? I… I'm not used to doctors poking and prodding. But… if you say it’s necessary… Alright. Just give me a moment. I begin unbuttoning my shirt slowly, looking a bit embarrassed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. We'll start with your blood pressure. As expected. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are irregular, and breath sounds are diminished bilaterally. This requires further investigation.
PATIENT: Further… investigation? What does that mean? Is something wrong? I… I don't like the sound of that. Is it bad? My heart… it feels okay to me. Maybe it always beats like that? I… I'm getting a bit nervous now. Should I sit down? I feel a little lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, I understand your anxiety. "Further investigation" simply means we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of your overall health. These findings are not necessarily cause for alarm, but we cannot proceed with pre-conception planning without a proper assessment. Given your blood pressure and the heart and lung sounds, I recommend an electrocardiogram to evaluate your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to assess your lungs, and a comprehensive blood panel, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. We'll also need a urine analysis. I’m also going to order a semen analysis. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A semen… analysis? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And a chest X-ray? Is that… safe? All these tests… it sounds like a lot. And expensive, probably. I… I don't have insurance, Doctor. I hadn’t really thought about all this… about the costs. It’s just… I wanted to make sure everything was okay. Is it… absolutely necessary? Before we can… try for a baby?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, with all due respect, attempting to conceive a child at your age, with your limited medical history and these initial findings, is a risk. These tests are not optional; they are essential to determine if you are even physically capable of safely embarking on this journey, and to mitigate potential risks to both you and your partner. The semen analysis is critical to assess sperm viability and quality, and the chest X-ray is necessary to rule out any underlying lung conditions that could complicate a pregnancy. As for the costs, I understand your concern. This clinic does have a financial assistance program for uninsured patients, and we can explore that option. However, I must emphasize that we cannot proceed without a comprehensive evaluation. I will have my assistant provide you with information about the costs and the financial assistance program. In the meantime, I strongly recommend you refrain from attempting conception until we have the results of these tests. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I understand. It's just… a lot to take in. And expensive. I… I didn’t realize it would be so complicated. My partner… she's very eager. She thinks it will be fine. I just wanted to be careful. So… no trying until we have the tests? And we have to pay for all of this… even though I don’t have insurance? Alright. Yes, I understand. Please… tell your assistant to give me all the information. And… thank you, Doctor. For being… honest. Even if it’s not what I wanted to hear.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Verrall. My role is to provide you with the best possible medical care and to ensure your safety. My assistant will be in shortly with the necessary paperwork and information about the lab orders and financial assistance program. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything for now. I just need to… process all of this. Thank you… again. I look down at my hands, looking lost and overwhelmed. I suppose I’ll wait for your assistant.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let my assistant know if you have any questions.
