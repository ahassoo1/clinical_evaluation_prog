DOCTOR: Hi Triana, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s been…awful. Just awful. I’ve been to the doctor about this before, and they just…didn't fix it. It's this diarrhea. Won't. Stop. And it’s embarrassing to even talk about, frankly. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s definitely frustrating when something isn’t resolved, and diarrhea can be really disruptive. It's good you're getting it checked out again. "Won't stop" is good information. Can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Ugh, when did it start… honestly, it feels like forever. Maybe… six weeks ago? Something like that. It comes and goes, but it’s always there, simmering under the surface, you know? And then BAM, it’s full-on again. I really don’t keep track of these things. Is that important? I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have a timeframe, even an estimate, so six weeks is good. And no, don’t feel bad about not tracking it meticulously – most people don’t! "Simmering under the surface" – okay, so it's not constant diarrhea, but more intermittent with flare-ups?
PATIENT: Exactly. Intermittent. That's a good word for it. It'll be okay for a day or two, and then… chaos. And it's not just a little… uncomfortable. It’s debilitating. I can’t even leave the house sometimes. And I've tried everything the last doctor suggested. Everything. Bland food, those little… Imodium things… nothing works for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, debilitating is important to note. And you've already tried over-the-counter anti-diarrheals like Imodium without sustained relief. Let’s try to get a bit more detail. When you say "everything," can you tell me specifically what you’ve been eating, and how much water are you drinking each day to stay hydrated?
PATIENT: Look, I eat normal food. I don't live on rabbit food or anything. Toast, rice… you know, the stuff they tell you to eat when your stomach's upset. Sometimes I skip meals altogether because I don't want to risk it. Water? I drink… enough, I guess. A few glasses a day. I’m not one of those people who carries a water bottle around everywhere, if that’s what you’re asking. Honestly, I'm just trying to get through each day without being stuck in the bathroom. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I want to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Knowing what you’ve been eating, even if it’s "normal" food, and a rough estimate of your water intake is helpful. Skipping meals can sometimes worsen things, and dehydration is a real concern with diarrhea. Okay, let’s move on. Have you noticed anything that specifically triggers the flare-ups?
PATIENT: Triggers? Honestly, no. That's the problem! I thought it was something I ate at first, but then it happened even when I was being super careful. Sometimes it happens after I've been stressed, but… well, who isn't stressed these days? It's just… random. Completely random. I’m starting to think it’s something serious, and the last doctor didn’t take me seriously.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear dietary triggers, and possibly a link to stress, but not consistently. It’s good you're advocating for yourself. Randomness is definitely harder to pinpoint. To help rule things out, and since this has been going on for six weeks, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your abdomen, check for any tenderness, that sort of thing. And I’m going to order a stool sample to check for any infections or parasites. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, a stool sample? Seriously? Look, I really don’t have time for this. I have things to do. Can't you just… give me something to stop it? I’m a busy person. Is there anything else you can do before resorting to… that? And honestly, I don't see how poking around in my stomach is going to help. I’m telling you, it’s just… random.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The stool sample is really important to rule out infections or parasites which are common causes of chronic diarrhea. It's a standard test and gives us valuable information. And a brief abdominal exam helps us rule out other causes, like inflammation. It’s quick, and I’ll explain everything as I go. I do want to get you relief as quickly as possible, but I need to gather information first to make sure I'm prescribing the right thing. I’m not going to poke around, it’s just listening with a stethoscope. Would you be willing to let me do a quick listen, and then we can discuss options?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But make it quick. And explain what you're doing, every step of the way. Honestly, this is ridiculous. A grown woman having to come in for a… stool sample. It's just… humiliating. But whatever. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. It's not a pleasant experience, but it's important to rule things out. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with this. I’ll start in the lower quadrants, and then move around. I’m listening for any unusual sounds, like gurgling or rumbling, and checking for any areas of tenderness. You can just lie flat on your back, and I'll gently press on your stomach. It shouldn't be painful, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. I'm hearing some… active bowel sounds, which isn’t surprising with diarrhea, but I don’t detect any significant tenderness. Everything sounds… fairly normal, structurally. I'll just listen one more time… Okay. I'm going to give you instructions on how to collect the stool sample. It's best to collect it first thing in the morning, if possible. I'll have the lab send you a collection kit, and there will be detailed instructions inside. Once collected, just bring it to the lab within 24 hours. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Fine. A kit. Wonderful. More hassle. Look, can we just talk about medication now? I don’t want to spend weeks waiting on… samples. I just want something to stop the… chaos. Is there anything you can prescribe right now, even just to tide me over? I have a trip coming up, and I absolutely cannot be dealing with this. I’m a widow, traveling alone, and this is just… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns, especially with an upcoming trip. It’s completely reasonable to want relief as quickly as possible. I am hesitant to prescribe something long-term without knowing the cause of the diarrhea. Masking the symptoms without knowing the underlying issue could potentially delay a proper diagnosis. However, given your trip and your distress, I can prescribe a short course of loperamide – that’s the generic name for Imodium – to help control the symptoms while we wait for the stool sample results. This should help manage the frequency and urgency. It’s important to remember that this is just a temporary fix. If the diarrhea doesn’t improve after a few days, or if you develop any new symptoms – like fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool – please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Temporary is better than nothing. And a short course… okay. As long as it doesn't take forever to kick in. Honestly, this whole thing has been a waste of my time. But whatever. Just… write the prescription. And can I get a note for work? I've had to miss a lot of hours dealing with this… mess. And don't make it too detailed. I don't want everyone knowing my business. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I've written you a prescription for a short course of loperamide. It should be sent to your pharmacy electronically. You can pick it up whenever it’s convenient. And yes, I can certainly write you a note for work. I’ll keep it brief – just stating that you were seen for a gastrointestinal issue requiring time off. It won’t detail the specifics of your condition. Here you go. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
