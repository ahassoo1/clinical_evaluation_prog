DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, my blood pressure's been a bit high, is what they told me at the pharmacy. Been checkin' it there a few times now. Don't rightly know what all that means, but they said I oughta get it looked at. Just want to get it sorted, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure… yes, we want to look into that. Just to clarify, you said the pharmacy checked it a few times?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few times over the last month or so. Old Man Tiber, he runs the place, said it was a little high each time. He's a good man, Tiber. Knows his stuff, mostly. But he ain't a doctor, you know? That's why I'm here talkin' to you. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, over the last month, consistently elevated readings at the pharmacy. Do you happen to know what those readings were, approximately?
PATIENT: Shoot, no, I don't. Numbers ain't my best friend. They just told me it was high enough to worry about. I remember thinkin' it was somethin' like… 140-over-somethin'? Maybe? Honestly, I just try not to stress about 'em, and let someone else worry about the numbers. It's why I'm here, right? You got somethin' to remember all that for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly 140/90… that is elevated. And you haven’t noticed any symptoms – headaches, dizziness, vision changes – anything at all that’s been different lately?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' really. I feel… old, mostly. But I am ninety, Doctor. So, that's kinda expected, I reckon. A little stiff in the mornin', but that's just the arthritis talkin'. I haven't been seein' spots or feelin' lightheaded or nothin' like that. Just… tired, if anything. But I'm always a little tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. No new symptoms beyond the usual fatigue. Now, have you had a chance to see a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Well, not regularly. Used to go to Doc Hemlock back in… oh, goodness, musta been the eighties. But he retired, and then my husband got sick, and… things just got busy. I haven't had much reason to see anyone since then, 'til Tiber started fussin' over my blood pressure. I try to stay healthy, mostly just makin' sure I get my baking done, keeps my hands busy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, haven’t seen a doctor consistently since the 1980s. Any major illnesses or surgeries you can recall?
PATIENT: Land sakes, let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a little girl, musta been six or seven. And I broke my wrist once, fallin' off a horse. Other than that… nothin' much, really. I've been pretty lucky, I suppose. My husband, Earl, he had a bad heart for years. That was a whole lot of doctor visits, though, not me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendix as a child, broken wrist… and your husband had heart issues. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, far as I can remember. They gave me somethin' for the pain when I broke my wrist, and I don't recall any trouble with that. I don’t take much in the way of medicine, generally. Just a little somethin’ for the arthritis now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And what medications are you taking for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Just a little ibuprofen, when it gets real bad. Sometimes a little bit of aspirin. Nothing fancy. And not every day, mind you. Just when my hands are achin’ so bad I can't get my bread kneaded. Honestly, I try to just push through it most times. Can't let a little pain stop a baker, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen and aspirin as needed. Now, I'm going to do a quick exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure myself. Is that alright?
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I ain't afraid of a little listenin'. Always liked the sound of a good heartbeat, reminds me I'm still kickin'. Just hope you don't find nothin' too worrysome.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 148 over 89. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear, but there’s some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes. Pulse is a little irregular. Okay, Ms. Steines. I'm hearing a murmur, and your pulse isn’t perfectly even. Your blood pressure is elevated, as the pharmacy noted. These findings warrant further investigation. I'm going to order some bloodwork and an EKG to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds… serious. Murmurs and irregular pulses don’t sound good, do they? Bloodwork and an EKG… alright, if that’s what you think’s best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. As long as it gets to the bottom of things. What kinda things are you lookin' for, if you don't mind me askin'? I don't need a whole lot of details, just... a general idea.
DOCTOR: We're looking to rule out any underlying heart condition causing the murmur and irregular pulse. The bloodwork will help assess your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and overall health. The EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart. It's fairly routine, Ms. Steines. We also want to check for anemia, which could contribute to fatigue. It’s important to get a full picture. I'll send you to the lab right after this, and they'll draw the blood samples. The EKG can be done right here in the office. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds… thorough. Anemia, kidneys, cholesterol… you’re thinkin' of everything, it seems. Alright, send me to the lab, then the EKG. Let's get it done. I'm ready to get this sorted, if I can. I got bread to bake, you know. Just… don't keep me all day, if you can help it. I got a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Steines. We'll get you in and out as quickly as possible. The lab technician is expecting you. They’ll take good care of you. Once the EKG is done, just let the nurse know, and she'll let me know when you’re finished. I will review the results as soon as they are available and schedule a follow-up appointment for you. Here's a referral for the lab and instructions for the EKG. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Lab and EKG… I reckon I can manage that. Just… hope it’s nothin’ too serious. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you lookin’ into this. Tell your nurse I'll let her know when I'm finished with the EKG, then. I’ll see you later, then.
