DOCTOR: Hi Alese, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. My goodness, time seems to slip away, doesn’t it? Well, I’ve been having some…trouble, lower down. Quite a bit of pain, really. It comes and goes, but it’s been rather severe lately. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about…lupus? Is that right? It's all a bit foggy, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain “lower down,” you said. And you think your previous doctor mentioned something about lupus?
PATIENT: Yes, lupus. That sounds right. It was some condition that affects…well, I don't recall exactly what it affects, but it was a long name, and involved the immune system, I think? It’s been a while, and I don’t have the best memory these days. The pain…it’s hard to describe. It’s a cramping sort of ache, mostly, but sometimes it feels quite sharp. It’s mostly in my abdomen, lower down, like you said. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Alese. And it's perfectly okay that details are foggy – that's very common. Lupus can cause abdominal pain, and it affects the immune system, so your recollection is a good starting point. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me more about when this pain started?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I'm glad it makes sense. It's good to know I'm not rambling! When did it start…hmm. That is a difficult question. It wasn't sudden, not a specific moment. It’s been…gradual, I think. Perhaps…a few months ago? It started as just a little discomfort, easily dismissed. But it’s gotten progressively worse, as I mentioned. Now it’s…noticeable, and worrying. I do wish I could be more precise. It feels like trying to remember a dream, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we’ll work with what you do remember. So, a few months of gradually worsening abdominal pain. Has anything specific made it worse or better during those months?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… Worse…hmm. Eating, I think. Large meals certainly don’t help. And stress, definitely. When I get anxious, it seems to flare up. Better…well, lying down sometimes eases it a little. And warmth, a warm bath, that's soothing. But nothing truly makes it go away, Doctor. It's more about finding things to make it a little more bearable. Honestly, I’ve just been trying to avoid doing too much, which isn’t much of a life, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound like much of a life at all. Okay, so large meals and stress worsen the pain, and lying down and warmth provide some relief. That’s helpful information. Aside from the abdominal pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it…well, I’ve been rather tired lately. More tired than usual, and it takes a lot to get going in the morning. And my joints ache a bit, you know, my hands and knees. It’s not constant, but it’s there. And…I’ve had a bit of a rash on my face sometimes, a sort of butterfly shape. It comes and goes. Is that…related, do you think? I really am just trying to recall everything I can. It’s a bit of a jumble, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s all very useful information, Alese, don't apologize for it being a “jumble” – you’re doing great. Fatigue, joint pain, and a facial rash – those symptoms, along with the abdominal pain, do raise the possibility of lupus, or other autoimmune conditions. To get a better understanding, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I’m glad it’s helpful. Medical history…let me see. Well, I had pneumonia, quite a bad bout of it, years ago. Perhaps fifteen years ago? I was hospitalized. And…oh, and I had my gallbladder removed, sometime in my thirties, I believe. Other than that…not much, I don’t think. I’ve always been reasonably healthy, up until recently. As I said, I'm not the most reliable source of information these days, so please forgive me if I'm missing something!
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Alese. Pneumonia fifteen years ago and gallbladder removal in your thirties – good to know. And no other major medical issues. Have you ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think very carefully. Surgeries…No, I don't believe so. Not that I recall, anyway. Just the gallbladder. I remember being quite ill afterwards, but it was a long time ago. My memory…it's like a sieve, really. I try to keep track of things, but it's difficult. I do have a niece who is a nurse, perhaps I should ask her? She might recall more details than I do.
DOCTOR: That’s a good idea about your niece, and don't worry, we can always follow up with records if needed. Okay, no other surgeries. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, medications. Let me see… Right now, I’m taking something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. A small dose. And…sometimes, when my joints are particularly achy, I take ibuprofen. Over the counter, nothing prescribed. Other than that…nothing regularly. I used to take something for allergies, but I stopped a few years ago. I try to avoid medication if I can, honestly. It never feels quite right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for joint pain. Good to know. And no other regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. No, I don't believe so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I used to be quite careful about what I ate, but I’ve relaxed a little as I’ve gotten older. I suppose I should be more cautious. It’s just…everything feels a bit overwhelming sometimes, you know? Remembering all of this…it’s quite a task.
DOCTOR: I understand, it is a lot to keep track of. No known allergies. Now, before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. That’s a good question. My mother…she had arthritis, quite badly, in her later years. And my father…he had heart problems, I think. He passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t remember much about his illness. As for siblings…I have a sister, but we haven’t spoken in many years. She lives very far away. I don’t know anything about her health, I’m afraid. It’s not a particularly close family, you see. Is that helpful, Doctor? I do apologize if I’m rambling again.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Alese. Arthritis in your mother and heart problems in your father. That gives us something to work with. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. I always considered it…unhealthy, naturally. And frankly, the thought of it never appealed to me. I prefer a nice cup of tea, myself. Does that answer your question, Doctor? I'm trying my best to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Yes, that answers perfectly. No smoking, excellent. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Oh, occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, once or twice a week. Nothing more than that, I assure you. I don’t really have much of a sweet tooth, and wine feels…gentle, I suppose. I don’t drink to excess, never have. It’s more of a social thing, really, when I’m with friends. But I haven't been out much lately, what with feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your work or daily activities?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I used to be a ship engineer. Quite a demanding job, really, lots of travel. I retired a few years ago, thankfully. Now I mostly…keep house, tend my garden when I can. I used to volunteer at the local library, but I haven’t been able to go since…well, since I started feeling unwell. It's a quiet life, generally. Not much excitement, which suits me just fine these days. I mostly enjoy reading and spending time with my cat, Clementine. Is that helpful, Doctor? I'm not sure what information is relevant.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Alese. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It paints a good picture. Okay, looking at your chart, I see you've had some bloodwork done in the past, but it's been a while. Given your symptoms – the abdominal pain, fatigue, joint pain, and the facial rash – and your family history, I think it's important to investigate the possibility of an autoimmune condition, like lupus. We need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely. Anything that might help, I'm quite willing to try. Lupus, you say? I recall my previous physician mentioning it, but it was so long ago…I'm a bit foggy on the details. Tests, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, honestly. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. No specific preparation needed for most of these tests. I’m going to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , an antinuclear antibody test, and a few other specific antibody tests to help us narrow things down. We'll also want to check your C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate - those are markers of inflammation. And to get a better look at your kidneys - which can be affected by lupus - we'll order a urinalysis. The lab will call you to schedule an appointment for a blood draw and to collect a urine sample. It’ll probably take a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, is there anything else you’re experiencing that we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness, that’s quite a list of tests! Well…let me think. No, I believe we’ve covered everything. Perhaps…sometimes I feel a little…short of breath. Just a slight feeling, really, nothing major. And my hands can get a bit numb sometimes, especially in the cold. But I just assumed it was the circulation. It's probably nothing, Doctor. I don't want to overwhelm you with trivial details. I’m just glad we’re getting to the bottom of things. And thank you for taking the time to listen, honestly. It’s been quite reassuring.
DOCTOR: No, that's not trivial at all, Alese. Shortness of breath and numbness in your hands are important things to mention. We’ll definitely keep those in mind as we interpret the test results. It’s good you told me. Okay, I’ve ordered the tests. The lab will be in touch. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me right now before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and you’ve answered all of my questions, even the ones I hadn’t thought to ask. I appreciate your kindness and patience. Honestly, just knowing that we’re taking steps to find out what’s wrong is a relief. Thank you again. And…thank you for listening. It’s…easier to cope when someone takes you seriously, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alese. I’m glad I could help. And you are absolutely right – being listened to is a big part of feeling better. I take your concerns very seriously. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. The lab will contact you to schedule the tests. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – especially fever, severe chest pain, or difficulty breathing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Here’s my card. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re here to help. Have a good day, Alese.
