DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband suggested I come. He’s been rather insistent about “planning ahead,” as he puts it. I believe he wants some… form, a document, in case of… unforeseen circumstances. Something about making sure my wishes are known. I confess, I don’t entirely understand it myself. He mentioned something about an "advance directive" or a "POLST" form. Perhaps you can explain it to me?
DOCTOR: Yes, your husband is quite correct. It’s prudent to consider these matters. An advance directive – sometimes called a living will – outlines your preferences for medical care should you become unable to communicate them yourself. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a bit more specific; it’s a medical order that translates your wishes into actionable instructions for healthcare providers. It sounds as though he's thinking ahead, which is good. Before we get into forms, though, I need to understand your overall health. Let’s start with a brief history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? That’s a rather broad term, Doctor. I’ve generally been… quite healthy, thank you. Perhaps a few colds, the occasional upset stomach. Nothing that required anything more than a good rest and some mint tea. My husband worries excessively, you see. He always has. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose, measles, mumps… but that was a very long time ago. And truthfully, I don't recall the specifics. Is a detailed recitation of my youth truly necessary?
DOCTOR: While a comprehensive recitation isn’t strictly necessary, Ms. Chilla, it does help me establish a baseline. Even seemingly minor past illnesses can be relevant. For example, did you ever have a serious case of the measles, with any complications?
PATIENT: Complications? No, no complications. I distinctly remember my mother fussing over me, making me drink something awful-tasting to “build my strength.” That was the extent of it. Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather… intrusive. I came here for a specific form, not a childhood medical examination. Are we getting anywhere closer to discussing that, or shall I simply wait while you peruse my entire life history? It feels a bit… unnecessary, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I assure you, this isn’t about perusing your life history. It's about ensuring I have a complete picture of your health before discussing end-of-life planning. These documents have serious implications, and I have a professional responsibility to understand your medical background. However, if you are truly averse to discussing your past medical history, we can proceed without it. But please understand that it may limit my ability to provide the most informed guidance. Before we move on, could you at least tell me if you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Very well. Current conditions… let me see. My knees ache, particularly when the weather is damp. And I have occasional palpitations – a fluttering in my chest – but my husband says that’s just my nerves. He’s convinced I drink too much coffee. I also have… a slight sensitivity to bright light. Nothing debilitating, you understand. Just… bothersome. I’ve never bothered seeing a doctor about any of it. They seem… trivial. Is that sufficient for your… professional responsibility?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Chilla. That’s helpful. The knee pain, palpitations, and light sensitivity are all worth noting. While you may consider them trivial, they could be indicative of underlying issues. Now, let's discuss medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, none. I prefer to avoid such things if possible. My mother always said natural remedies are best. A bit of honey for a sore throat, chamomile tea for sleeplessness… That sort of thing. I am a firm believer in moderation and a healthy lifestyle. Though, as I mentioned, my husband insists my coffee consumption is… excessive. But that’s hardly a medication, is it? It’s a beverage. A perfectly acceptable beverage, I might add.
DOCTOR: Indeed, coffee is not a medication, Ms. Chilla. And I commend your preference for natural remedies. However, even herbal supplements can interact with other treatments, so it’s important to be thorough. Now, regarding allergies… Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. Not food, not plants, not insects… nothing. My husband tries to convince me I’m allergic to dust, because I sometimes sneeze when cleaning, but I simply attribute that to the dust itself. It’s quite irritating, you know. A perfectly logical explanation, I think. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather tedious. Are we finally going to discuss the forms, or are you intent on dissecting my entire life? I have a luncheon appointment this afternoon, and I’m beginning to fear I shall be late.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I apologize if this feels tedious. I assure you, I am attempting to gather the information necessary to provide appropriate guidance. However, if you are truly unwilling to provide a more comprehensive medical history, we can proceed with discussing the advance directive and POLST forms. However, please understand that without a full understanding of your health, I can only offer limited advice. Before we begin, I need to document your height and weight. Could you please step on the scale?
PATIENT: Oh, really? Now you want to weigh me? After all this… interrogation? Honestly, Doctor, it feels rather… demeaning. Very well. But I must warn you, I've been rather particular about my diet lately, and I suspect the scale is not entirely accurate. It tends to add a few pounds, I’ve noticed. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Chilla. Your BMI is 34.5, which places you in the obese category. Now, before we discuss the forms themselves, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or engage in regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Obese? Obese? I beg your pardon? I am a perfectly healthy weight! I have a robust figure, perhaps, but certainly not obese. My husband would never allow it. He's very particular about my health, you see. As for your questions… I do not smoke. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner – a dry red, preferably – but only on special occasions. And I walk… I walk quite a bit. To the market, to the library… everyday errands. It’s certainly physical activity. Though I wouldn’t characterize it as… regular. Now, can we finally get to the forms? This is quite enough personal questioning for one afternoon, wouldn’t you agree? I have a luncheon to attend, and frankly, I'm losing my patience.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. We can discuss the forms. An advance directive, as I mentioned, outlines your wishes for medical care should you become unable to communicate them. A POLST form is a more specific medical order. Do you have any specific concerns or preferences regarding life-sustaining treatments, such as mechanical ventilation, CPR, or artificial nutrition?
PATIENT: Life-sustaining treatments… Honestly, Doctor, I haven't given it a moment's thought. My husband has… vaguely mentioned something about not wanting to be kept alive artificially, but I haven’t really considered my own preferences. I suppose… I wouldn’t want to be a burden. And I certainly wouldn’t want to be… propped up by machines, unable to enjoy a good conversation or a cup of tea. But beyond that… I haven’t the faintest idea. Is there a… standard form of wording? Perhaps something I can simply sign? I really haven't the time or inclination to delve into the intricacies of medical procedures. This is all so… depressing.
DOCTOR: There are standard forms, Ms. Chilla, but they require careful consideration. A POLST form, in particular, is a legally binding medical order. It's not something to be entered into lightly. It seems you're not prepared to make those decisions at this time, and that is perfectly acceptable. However, I strongly advise you to consider discussing these matters with your husband and, perhaps, a trusted family member. Given your reluctance, I recommend we postpone completing the forms today. I can provide you with some informational brochures and resources to review at your leisure. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be… acceptable. Brochures and resources. That sounds much more sensible. I can peruse them at my leisure, as you say. Though I make no promises about completing any forms. My husband will likely be disappointed, but… frankly, I find this entire topic rather morbid. I believe my luncheon appointment is rapidly approaching. Shall we conclude this consultation, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. Here are some materials outlining advance directives and POLST forms. They explain the options and the implications in more detail. I’ll also document our conversation in your chart. If you change your mind or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, thank you. That will be all. I appreciate your… patience. Though I suspect this has been far more stressful for you than for me. Good day, Doctor. And please, don’t expect a call from my husband anytime soon regarding these… forms. I shall handle it. Or rather, avoid handling it. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. Have a pleasant afternoon. .
