DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jimmi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh… afternoon to you too, Doctor. It’s… something with down there. It’s… leaking. Not good leaking. I don’t know what it is, but it’s been happening for a little while now. Not a lot, just… a little. Makes me feel… icky.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. I understand. “Leaking” is a bit vague, but we can definitely figure out what’s going on to make you feel less “icky.” Can you tell me a little more about this leakage?
PATIENT: Eh, more vague? What more you want to know? It comes out of… you know. Where a man… does his business. It’s… yellowish. Sometimes clear. It don’t hurt, not really. Just… wet. And smells kinda funny. Not like flowers, that’s for sure. I try to keep it clean, but it keeps… happening. I haven’t… been with anyone for a long, long time, so it ain't from that. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Jimmi. Thank you for being so open. It sounds like you're experiencing some vaginal discharge. We need to figure out why you’re experiencing it. Now, to help me understand better, has this discharge been happening constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Eh, come and go. Mostly go, for a long time. Then it come back. Not every day. Sometimes a few days, nothing. Then… there it is. It’s been worse lately though. That’s why I finally come here. I try to ignore it, you know? Old lady problems. But it’s… embarrassing. And I don’t want nothing… bad happening. You know, like getting… sicker.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jimmi. It's good you came in to get it checked out, and you're right to want to rule out anything serious. "Old lady problems" are often very real problems that do need attention, and we'll take it very seriously. Has the amount of discharge changed recently?
PATIENT: Eh, yes. Like I said, worse lately. It's… more wet. And the smell… stronger. Before, I barely noticed it. Now… I can smell it. Even after I… clean up. It used to be just a little spot, you know? Now… I gotta change my underwear sometimes. It’s not a flood, mind you! But… more than it used to be. It worries me. Makes me nervous. I don’t want no… infections. My cousin had one once, bad business, she said.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. Thank you for sharing all of that. It sounds like there has been a noticeable change, and that's definitely a reason to investigate. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions, then I'll need to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Eh, a… physical exam? You gotta look at it? Oh, dear. I’m an old woman, Doctor. It ain’t pretty down there. But… alright. If you gotta look, you gotta look. Just… be quick, okay? And gentle. I don’t want no poking and prodding. Just… see what’s going on and tell me what it is. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. I understand your hesitation, and I promise to be as gentle and efficient as possible. We'll take things slowly and only do what's necessary. My goal is to figure out what’s going on and help you feel better, and I will explain everything as we go. Before we do that, let's quickly go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Eh, medical conditions? Let me think… Old age, mostly! No, nothing serious. I had a little trouble with my heart a long time ago, but that was years and years ago. They gave me some pills, I took ‘em for a while. Don’t take ‘em anymore. Doctor said it fixed itself. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and rice. Not much sugar. I'm a simple woman, Doctor. No fancy problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. That's good to know. So, no current medical conditions, and a past history of a heart issue that resolved. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Eh… surgeries? Let me think… Oh! I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A long, long time ago. And… I had a little thing on my leg, a growth, but they just cut it off. Nothing big. That was a long time ago too. No other surgeries. Just the tonsils and the little growth. Mostly just aches and pains from getting old. That’s all. Nothing important, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, tonsils and a growth removed previously. And no allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Eh… allergies? Not really. I get a little sniffly sometimes with the flowers, but that’s just the smell. Not a real allergy. And… sometimes my skin gets itchy with the sun, but I just stay in the shade. Nothing serious. I don’t take no pills for allergies. I’m a Chamorro woman, Doctor. We’re tough! We don’t need pills for every little thing. Mostly just aches and pains, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, no known allergies. That’s very helpful. And you mentioned you don't take any medications currently, correct?
PATIENT: Eh, that's right. No pills. Not anymore. I used to take something for my heart, a long time ago, but the doctor said I didn't need it anymore. Just… fish oil sometimes, for my joints. But that's not a real medicine, is it? Just… old lady stuff. I like to stay natural, if I can. No fancy chemicals in my body. Just fish and rice and sunshine.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, so no regular medications besides occasional fish oil. Now, one last question before we move on to the exam. Are there any family members who have had similar problems with vaginal discharge or any other gynecological issues?
PATIENT: Eh… family? Let me think… My mother… she didn’t talk about such things. We didn’t talk about… down there. My sisters… same thing. We were raised to be… modest. Nobody talked about… leaking or smells or anything. So… I don’t know. Maybe? But I don’t remember hearing about it. It was a long time ago. We just… kept to ourselves. So, no. I don’t think so. But I can’t be sure. It’s a shameful thing, you know? Nobody talks about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. I understand. It’s not uncommon for those topics to be avoided. Alright, well, with that information, I think we can proceed with a quick physical exam. I'm going to have you lie on the examination table. We'll just take a look to see what's going on. I'll explain each step as I go, and you can tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Eh… lie down? On that… table? Oh, dear. It’s cold, isn’t it? And… exposed. I’m an old woman, Doctor. My skin is… delicate. But… alright. If you gotta look, you gotta look. Just… be quick, okay? And gentle. And tell me what you’re doing. Don’t just… poke and prod without warning. And… cover me up afterwards, okay? I get shy easily. Just… be respectful. That’s all I ask. And… hurry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. I completely understand. We'll take things very slowly and I’ll explain everything as we go. I'll make sure you're covered as much as possible and keep you comfortable. I’ll also hurry as much as I can while still being thorough. First, I'm going to just have you lie back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the table. Then, I'll gently lift your knees and place them in stirrups. We’ll use a sheet to keep you covered as much as possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Eh… stirrups? Like a horse? Oh, dear. This is… embarrassing. But… alright. If you gotta do it, you gotta do it. Just… tell me when you’re going to lift my legs, okay? Don’t just… grab them. And… make sure I’m covered up. I don’t want everyone looking at my… old lady parts. Just… be quick, okay? And gentle. Like you promised. And… I’m shy, remember? Just… hurry. It’s cold in here too, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. I understand your concerns, and I’ll be very careful. I'll tell you exactly when I’m going to move your legs, and I'll make sure you're covered as much as possible throughout the entire exam. We'll keep the room as private as possible. I’m also going to ask the nurse to bring you an extra blanket. Now, when I’m ready to lift your legs, I’ll just gently ask you to bend your knees and I’ll slowly support them as we place them in the stirrups. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Eh… okay. Gently, you said? And slowly? And you’ll tell me first? Good. That’s good. And the blanket… that would be nice. It’s cold, you know. Like a winter night. And… you won't just… poke and prod without warning, right? You promised. Just… be gentle. Like you said. And… hurry. I don’t like being exposed. It makes me nervous. Just… get it over with. And… tell me what you’re looking for, okay? I want to know what’s going on. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. I promise to be gentle and explain everything as we go. I’ll tell you exactly what I'm doing and what I'm looking for. I will not poke or prod without warning. Okay, when you’re ready, I’m going to gently ask you to bend your knees. Then, I'll slowly support your legs as we place them in the stirrups. We’ll do it at your pace. Are you ready to start?
PATIENT: Eh… alright. Just… get it over with. I'm an old woman, Doctor. I haven't got all day. And… be careful. My bones are… brittle. Just… hurry. And… tell me what you're looking for, okay? I want to know what's going on. Just… get it over with. Slowly, you said? Alright. Just… do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. Just take a deep breath. I’m going to gently ask you to bend your knees now. Then I’ll slowly support your legs as we lift them into the stirrups. I’ll tell you each step as I go. Okay, slowly bend your knees now… that's good… good… slowly… and I’m going to gently lift your legs now… just a little bit… and there we go. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Eh… oh… that’s… awkward. Like a little bird with a broken wing. And… cold. It’s cold up here. And… exposed. Very exposed. Don't pull too hard, Doctor. My bones… they creak. And… hurry. Just… get it over with. What are you looking for, exactly? Is it… bad? Tell me. Don’t just… poke and prod without warning. Tell me what’s going on. And… hurry. It's cold. Like a winter night.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. I understand it’s uncomfortable, and I’m being as gentle as possible. I’m just going to take a quick look at the external area first. I’m looking for any redness, swelling, or any unusual discharge. I see some mild redness, but no visible swelling. And there is a small amount of yellowish discharge, as you described. I’m going to use a speculum now to gently open the vaginal canal so I can take a closer look at the cervix. It might feel a little bit of pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Eh… a speculum? What’s a speculum? Sounds… scary. Like a torture device. You’re going to… open me up? Oh, dear. I don’t like the sound of that. Will it hurt? I have… delicate parts. And… what if it breaks something? I’m an old woman, you know. My bones are brittle. And… what are you looking for? What if it’s something… bad? Just… tell me. Don’t just… poke and prod without warning. And… hurry. I don’t like this. It makes me nervous. Is it… bad? Tell me the truth. And… hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. I understand your fear, and I’ll explain everything carefully. A speculum is a small instrument that gently opens the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix – that’s the opening to the uterus. It’s similar to what happens during a Pap smear. It doesn’t stretch or force anything open. I use lubricant to make it comfortable. It shouldn’t be painful, although you might feel some pressure. If you feel any discomfort at all, please tell me immediately, and I’ll stop. I’m looking for any signs of infection, inflammation, or any other abnormalities. It’s a routine procedure, and it will help me determine the cause of your discharge. I promise to be as gentle as possible and move slowly. Is that alright if we proceed?
PATIENT: Eh… alright. Slowly, you said? And gentle? You promise? And you’ll tell me if it hurts? And… you’ll stop if I tell you? Good. Those are… important. I’m an old woman, you know. I don’t want anything… broken. And… what if it is bad? What if it’s… something serious? Tell me the truth. Don’t just… lie to me. And… hurry. I don’t like being exposed. It makes me nervous. Just… get it over with. But… slowly. And gentle. You promise? And… tell me if it hurts.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. I promise to be as gentle as possible, and I will tell you exactly what I’m doing every step of the way. I will stop immediately if you feel any discomfort or pain. I will not proceed if you’re not comfortable. I'm going to warm the speculum with a little bit of lubricant first. You might feel a slight coolness or pressure when I insert it. Just breathe deeply and try to relax your muscles. Okay, I'm going to gently insert the speculum now… just a little bit… you might feel some pressure… breathe deeply… and there we go. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Eh… oh… that’s… cold. And… uncomfortable. Like a little fish poking me. And… exposed. Very exposed. My muscles… they’re old and stiff. Don’t push too hard, Doctor. My bones… they creak. And… what are you looking for? Is it… bad? Tell me. Don’t just… poke and prod without warning. And… hurry. It makes me nervous. Just… get it over with. But… be gentle. Like you promised. How much longer? Is it… bad? Tell me the truth. And… hurry. It’s cold. Like a winter night.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. I’m being very careful, and I’m only inserting the speculum as far as needed to visualize the cervix. I see some mild redness around the opening of the cervix, and the discharge is yellowish, as you described. It doesn’t appear to be any major inflammation at this point. I’m going to take a small sample of the discharge now, using a swab. It might feel a little bit of pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Eh… a swab? Like a little brush? You’re going to… poke around in there? Oh, dear. I don’t like the sound of that. Will it hurt? My parts are… delicate. And… what are you looking for? Is it… bad? Tell me. Don’t just… poke and prod without warning. And… hurry. It makes me nervous. Just… get it over with. But… be gentle. Like you promised. And… tell me if it’s bad. Is it… serious? Tell me the truth. And… hurry. It’s cold. Like a winter night. I want to go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. I understand your fear, and I’ll explain everything carefully. The swab is a small, thin cotton stick that I’ll use to collect a small sample of the discharge. It’s similar to what happens during a Pap smear. It won’t cause any pain, although you might feel a slight pressure or discomfort. I’m looking for any bacteria or other organisms that might be causing the discharge. It’s a routine test, and it will help me determine the best course of treatment. I’m just going to gently collect a small sample now… just a little bit… you might feel some slight pressure… and there we go. That's all done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Eh… oh… that’s… uncomfortable. Like a little tickle. But… exposed. Very exposed. And… what if it is bad? What if it’s… something serious? Tell me the truth. Don’t just… lie to me. And… hurry. I want to go home. I’m cold. Like a winter night. Is it… bad? Tell me. And… hurry. Just… get it over with. But… be gentle. Like you promised. How long until I know? Is it… serious? Tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. That’s all done. I’m going to remove the speculum now… just a little bit… and there we go. That’s all done. Now, I'm sending the sample to the lab for analysis. It will take a few days to get the results. Based on my initial examination, it doesn’t appear to be anything serious, but we need the lab results to confirm the diagnosis. I’m going to offer you a warm blanket to help you feel more comfortable. And I’ll explain the next steps. The most likely cause of your discharge is an infection, such as bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection. These are very common and easily treatable with antibiotics or antifungal medication. We will know for sure once we get the lab results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Eh… antibiotics? Like pills? I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel sick. And… antifungal? What’s that? Sounds… scary. And… what if it’s not just an infection? What if it’s something… serious? Tell me the truth. Don’t just… lie to me. And… will it hurt? Will I have to come back? I don’t want to come back. I just want to go home. And… hurry. I’m cold. Like a winter night. Just… tell me the truth. Is it… bad? And… hurry. I want to go home. Is it… serious? Tell me the truth. And… hurry. I want to go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. I understand your concerns. Let’s address them one by one. Antibiotics are pills or sometimes a cream that help fight bacterial infections. If the lab results show a bacterial infection, we might need to use antibiotics. If you’re concerned about side effects, we can discuss different options and find one that’s right for you. Antifungal medication treats yeast infections. It’s also available as pills or a cream. It’s a very common and safe treatment. Now, let’s talk about the possibility of it being something more serious. While it’s possible, it’s less likely based on my initial examination. However, we need the lab results to be sure. If it’s something more serious, we’ll discuss all the treatment options and make a plan together. I understand you want to go home, and I want you to feel comfortable. I’ll write you a prescription for a general antibiotic cream, just in case it’s a simple infection. If the lab results show something else, we’ll adjust the treatment accordingly. We will need to schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results and make sure you're feeling better. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Eh… a prescription? More pills? Oh, dear. But… okay. If it’s just a simple infection… okay. And… a follow-up? In a week? Oh, dear. But… okay. If it’s just to check… okay. And… will it hurt? Will I have to come back again? Oh, dear. But… okay. If it’s just to check… okay. And… hurry. I want to go home. I’m cold. Like a winter night. Just… get it over with. And… will it hurt? Will I have to come back again? Oh, dear. But… okay. If it’s just to check… okay. Just… get it over with. I want to go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi. I understand. I’ll write the prescription for the antibiotic cream now. It shouldn’t hurt, and it’s just a precaution. And yes, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to check your progress and make sure you’re feeling better. If you’re not feeling any improvement, or if you experience any new symptoms, please call the clinic immediately. Here’s the prescription. And I’ll have the nurse schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Is there anything else I can do for you before you go?
PATIENT: Eh… no. That’s… enough. Just… let me go home. I’m cold. Like a winter night. And… hurry. Just… let me go home. And… thank you. I think. Just… let me go home. Now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. I completely understand. I'll have the nurse escort you out. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Jimmi. And please, try to stay warm.
