DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away. It’s been… oh, goodness, I’d say close to a month now. It’s mostly at night, keeps me up. And I get so winded just walking to the kitchen. My heart… it feels funny sometimes with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough for about a month, worse at night, and some shortness of breath… and you've noticed a feeling in your heart with it. Hmm. Alright. Just to clarify, when you say “funny,” can you describe that feeling in your heart?
PATIENT: Oh, it's hard to explain. Not exactly pain, you understand? More like… a fluttering. And sometimes, like it’s skipping a beat. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds, then it’s alright for a while. But with the cough, it feels… worse. I do have a weak heart, you know. The doctor told me years ago. They gave me some pills for it. I take them every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fluttering or skipping sensation in your chest that comes and goes, and seems to be worse with the cough. And you do have a history of heart issues and take medication for it. Do you remember what medication you're taking for your heart?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I do. Let me think… it’s a little white pill… Digoxin, that’s it! Digoxin. And a water pill too, Furosemide, I think that’s how you say it. Keeps the swelling down in my feet. I take one of each every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, Digoxin and Furosemide, both taken daily. Good. Now, let’s talk about this cough a little more. Is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Oh, it brings something up, yes. It's… well, it’s mostly clear, but sometimes it’s a little bit yellow. Not much, though. Mostly just a tickle in my throat that makes me cough, then a little bit of that comes up. And it’s worse when I lie down, definitely. I have to prop myself up with pillows to sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you're bringing up some clear or slightly yellow mucus with the cough, worse when lying down, and you need pillows to sleep comfortably. Let's listen to your lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and another one… Okay. I'm hearing some… crackles, especially in the lower part of your lungs. Not a lot, but they’re there.
PATIENT: Crackles? Oh dear. Is that bad, Doctor? My husband… he had crackles once, and… well, it didn’t end well. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be talking about that. But what does it mean? Is it the heart? Or my lungs? I get so confused with all these things.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Nadene, it’s okay to be concerned. Crackles can mean a few different things, and it doesn’t automatically mean anything serious. It could be related to your heart, as fluid can sometimes build up in the lungs with heart issues. But it also could be a lung infection, or even something less serious. We need to do a little more to figure it out. Do you have any fever or chills with this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, Doctor. I’ve been checking myself every day. And no body aches, either. Just tired, mostly. Very, very tired. And the cough, of course. It’s just… wearing me down. I haven’t been eating much either, because I get so winded trying to chew.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or body aches, just fatigue and loss of appetite, made worse by the effort of chewing. Alright, Nadene. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. And I'm going to listen to your heart again, and we'll do an EKG to check the electrical activity. It's just a quick, painless test. That will help us determine what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. This tiredness… it’s just no way to live. An X-ray and a… EKG, you said? Is that difficult? I don’t want to be a bother. I get nervous with all these tests.
DOCTOR: No bother at all, Nadene, that's what we're here for. The EKG is very simple. We just put some sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs, and it records your heart's rhythm. It doesn't hurt at all. And the X-ray is quick too. We'll have the results back relatively quickly. Let me have the nurse come in and get you set up for those tests, and we’ll get them done as soon as possible. In the meantime, try to rest as much as you can. Do you have any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of, anyway. I’ve never had any problems with medicine before. Oh, but… I’m a little sensitive to cold air. Makes me cough even more. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… a bit sensitive. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's a comfort just knowing someone is trying to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just sensitivity to cold air. Excellent. I’ll have the nurse come in now to get things started. We’ll get these tests done and see what’s going on. I’ll be back to discuss the results with you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you feel any worsening of your shortness of breath or chest pain, please let the nurse know immediately. I'll be right back.
