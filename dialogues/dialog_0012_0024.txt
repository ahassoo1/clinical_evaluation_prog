DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Yoshino, nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Confirming I’m able to fly. It's for… travel insurance, mostly. They need it before they'll cover the ticket. It's a bit of a hassle, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A fitness-to-fly letter. No problem, we can definitely look into that for you. To do that properly, though, I’ll need to get a little more information. Just to be sure it’s safe for you to travel. First, where are you planning to go?
PATIENT: Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. To visit family. It’s… a long flight. That's why they're being so picky with the insurance, I think. It's about a fourteen-hour flight, with a layover. Why do you need to know where exactly? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important! The length of the flight, altitude, and availability of medical care at your destination all factor into whether it's safe for you to fly. Especially with a longer flight like that one, we need to consider things like deep vein thrombosis risk and whether any pre-existing conditions might be affected by the travel. Okay, Ulaanbaatar. Good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your health. Do you have any current medical problems or conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… my husband passed away about six months ago. It was… sudden. Heart attack. I'm still getting used to things. Physically, I’m… okay, I guess. No major issues. I have a bit of trouble sleeping sometimes, but I think that’s… understandable. Other than that… not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. Does grief count as a medical problem? I feel… tired a lot.
DOCTOR: Kiante, I'm so very sorry for your loss. That must be incredibly difficult, and it absolutely impacts your health, both physically and emotionally. Grief is something we need to consider. It can absolutely manifest as physical symptoms like fatigue, and it’s important to address. Okay, fatigue… we’ll definitely keep that in mind. And thank you for sharing that with me. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: It’s just… constant, really. I wake up tired, and I stay tired all day. Even after a full night’s sleep – well, as full as it gets these days – I feel like I haven’t rested at all. I try to keep busy, you know? See friends, do some gardening… but it takes a lot of effort. And sometimes I just… have to lie down. It's not like a physical exhaustion, exactly. More… mental, I think. Like I’m drained. It’s been getting a little better lately, but it still flares up. And I worry about being on a long flight, trapped in a seat. That sounds… awful.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly draining, and it’s completely understandable that you’re worried about a long flight. It’s good that it’s improving, even if slowly. It’s also helpful to know it feels more mental than physical. Okay, just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my appetite isn’t great. I don’t really feel hungry. And I’ve been a little… forgetful, I suppose. Not like… major memory loss, but I misplace things more often. Keys, my phone… things like that. And… sometimes I feel a bit anxious. Just a general feeling of unease. It's probably all connected to… everything. It's hard to separate it all out, to be honest. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, so I don't even know if these are new symptoms.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Kiante. It’s very common for things to blend together, especially when you’re dealing with a lot. It's good you're telling me all of this. We can sort through it. Reduced appetite, forgetfulness, and anxiety… those can certainly be related to grief and stress. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a little more broadly. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy, honestly. Just the usual childhood things – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. My husband… he had high blood pressure, but it wasn't diagnosed until later in life. I helped him manage it for a while, but… that’s beside the point. I’ve never had any serious illnesses, never been hospitalized except for… when I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. That was a long time ago. I don’t even remember much about it. Is this important? Are you looking for something specific?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Kiante. No major medical history is helpful. And yes, I am looking for anything that might impact your ability to fly safely. We’re just being thorough. Have you ever had any surgeries other than your appendix removed?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, I don’t think so. Not that I can remember, anyway. I had my wisdom teeth out when I was younger, but that wasn’t a full surgery, was it? Just… local anesthetic. And I’ve had a few minor procedures, like vaccinations, but nothing major. I’m pretty sure that’s it. No, definitely no other surgeries. I'm not a surgical person, I've always said that. Do you need to know about medications? I don't take anything regularly.
DOCTOR: Good. No surgeries, that’s helpful. And no regular medications?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I might take something for a headache occasionally, like ibuprofen, but that’s it. And I rarely even get headaches. Honestly, I'm pretty healthy, despite everything. It's just… the fatigue. And the anxiety. It's more mental than physical, I keep saying that. I just want to be able to visit my family. They’re worried about me, and I’m worried about them. I haven't seen them since… well, before everything happened.
DOCTOR: I understand, Kiante. And it's good that you're generally healthy. No regular medications is helpful. Before we move on, let’s talk a little about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don’t have any known allergies. I can eat pretty much anything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the winter, but that’s just dry skin. And I’m not allergic to any medications, as far as I know. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Do you need to know about insect bites? I live in a rural area, so I get bitten by mosquitoes sometimes, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: No allergies, that's good. Mosquito bites don’t concern us. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had heart disease. He died when he was in his seventies. He smoked for a long time, so it wasn’t a surprise, really. And my mother had high blood pressure, like my husband. She lived to be eighty-five, though, so it didn’t kill her. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. He lives in the city, so I don’t see him very often. And my sister… she has asthma, but it’s well-controlled. Nothing else, I don’t think. Just the usual old age stuff. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Kiante. Family history of heart disease and high blood pressure is important to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine at Christmas, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I’ve always lived a very healthy lifestyle. I eat a balanced diet, I exercise regularly, and I try to get enough sleep. As I said, I take care of myself. It’s just… this fatigue. I’m starting to feel like you don’t believe me. I just want a letter so I can visit my family. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Kiante, I absolutely believe you. I apologize if my questions came across as accusatory. I’m not questioning anything. I’m simply gathering information to ensure your safety. It's my job to be thorough. And wanting to visit your family is absolutely not too much to ask. Let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just do a general assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. That’s… reasonable. I suppose you need to do that. I just… I just want to get this sorted out. Whatever you need to do, just let me know.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning given your recent stress. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. No acute findings that would preclude travel. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure and ongoing fatigue do warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Unremarkable… that’s good, isn’t it? So, can you write the letter? I mean, if everything’s okay, can I finally get the letter? What does “further investigation” mean? Do I need more tests? I don’t really have time for a lot of tests. I just want to see my family. I've been putting it off for too long already.
DOCTOR: Yes, “unremarkable” is good! It means there’s nothing immediately concerning that would prevent you from traveling. And yes, I can write the letter. However, given your fatigue and slightly elevated blood pressure, I would recommend a few simple blood tests – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid test – just to rule out any underlying causes. It's a precaution, and it will give us a more complete picture. It’s a fairly standard workup for fatigue, and it should only take a few minutes. It’s not something you need to do to get the letter, but it would give me more confidence in saying you’re fit to fly, and it would rule out any potential issues that could be exacerbated by the long flight. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Blood tests. Just… just get it over with. I suppose you're right. It's better to be safe than sorry. And I do want to be confident that I'm okay. I just... I wish it wasn't so complicated. Where do I go? Do I need an appointment? I have a lot to do before I leave.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m ordering the tests now. You can go to the lab right across the street – they take walk-ins, so no appointment is necessary. I'll print out a requisition form for you. It shouldn’t take long at all. Once the results are back – usually within a day or two – we can review them and I can finalize the letter. Here you go. The lab is right across the parking lot. And while we're waiting for the results, I'll also give you a handout on managing fatigue during travel – things like staying hydrated, stretching during the flight, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. Thank you. A handout… okay. I just… I just want to get this done. Is there anything else? Anything at all? I need to know now so I can plan everything.
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so. Just the blood tests and then a follow-up appointment once the results are back. We’ll discuss them and finalize the fitness-to-fly letter. It should be fairly quick. I’m also happy to provide a note for your employer, if you need one, explaining your recent medical appointments. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Kiante?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. A note for my employer… no, thank you. I've already arranged for someone to cover my shifts while I'm gone. Just… the blood tests, and then the letter. Thank you, Dr. Yoshino. I appreciate your help. I really do. I just want to see my family.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. I completely understand. I hope you have a wonderful trip and a safe journey. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care.
PATIENT: .
