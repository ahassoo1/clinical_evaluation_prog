DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin! It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, let’s get this over with. It’s about this… procedure. My daughter booked it, honestly. She thinks I need it. Says I look “tired.” I just want the doctor to say I’m healthy enough to do it, so I can get back to my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your daughter is concerned and wants to make sure you're in good shape before you proceed with something. Could you tell me a little more about this procedure she booked for you?
PATIENT: Honestly, I barely listened to the details. Something about… tightening things up? Face lift, maybe? She handled all the arrangements with the… specialist. I just want a quick check-up to prove I’m not falling apart. It’s a waste of my time, frankly. I've lived a long life, you know. I’m a terrazzo worker, been doing it since I was a boy. That’s real work, not… this.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re a bit skeptical, and that you’re feeling pressured into doing something you’re not entirely comfortable with. That's perfectly alright. We can absolutely do a check-up to make sure you're healthy enough for a procedure, and we can also talk about whether it's even necessary. Just to be clear, do you know the name of the specialist your daughter booked the appointment with?
PATIENT: No, I really don’t. She just… gave me a date and time. Said everything was arranged. Young people these days, always rushing around, never explaining things properly. I suppose it doesn't matter, does it? As long as they say I’m fit enough, I’ll go along with it. I haven’t got all day to spend discussing appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can work with that. Let’s focus on getting a good sense of your overall health then. I have your chart here – Werner Orwin, 81 years old, height 166cm, weight 125lbs. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. Took a few knocks working with the terrazzo, but nothing a bit of whiskey couldn't fix. Honestly, this whole thing is a bit ridiculous. I’ve lived a good life, I don’t need poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It’s good to hear you've been generally healthy. Let's just quickly go through some of your medical history to be thorough. Have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe, years ago. The doctor put me on something… a small pill. I took it for a bit, then stopped. Didn’t see the point. Felt fine without it. Everything else… no, never been sick a day in my life, practically. As I said, terrazzo worker. Builds a man up, that does. Not like sitting around all day. Are we nearly done here? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were previously treated for high blood pressure, but you’re currently not taking any medication for it. That's good to know. And you stopped taking it because you felt well. We can discuss that a little later, if you’d like. To finish up with your history, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. Broke my arm once when I was a young lad, falling off a roof, but they just put it in a cast. That was it. Never needed a hospital stay, never wanted one. I heal quickly. Terrazzo, remember? It's a demanding job. Builds resilience. Honestly, I don't see why I'm filling out all these questions. I feel perfectly fine. Can we just get a quick check and be done with it? I really do need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations aside from the broken arm as a child. That's good to know. Alright, Mr. Orwin, let's do a quick physical exam then. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then we can discuss whether this procedure is something you're a good candidate for, or if we need to investigate anything further. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. The quicker this is done, the better. And don’t expect me to be overly chatty. I don't have time for small talk. Terrazzo waits for no one.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 148/92. Now, let’s take a look at your ears… Everything appears normal here. And your throat… slightly dry, but no obvious signs of infection. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Mr. Orwin, and I did detect a slight heart murmur. This doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it does warrant further investigation before proceeding with any elective procedure. I also noticed your throat is a bit dry. Do you experience any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No. Never. I eat a hearty breakfast every morning. Steak and eggs, usually. It’s just… dry air, probably. I’ve been working outside, you know. Terrazzo. Always out in the sun. And a little elevated blood pressure? So what? I’ve lived eighty-one years without worrying about blood pressure. Look, are you going to tell me I'm too old for this surgery, or what? Because frankly, I'd rather just get it over with than spend weeks going back and forth with doctors. My daughter will be furious, but… I just want to get on with my life.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It’s not about being “too old,” it's about making sure you’re safe and healthy enough for this procedure. Elevated blood pressure and a heart murmur could indicate underlying issues that need to be addressed first. Before we make any decisions, I'd like to order a few tests. An EKG to check your heart rhythm, a basic blood panel to assess your overall health, and possibly an echocardiogram to get a closer look at your heart structure. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Fine. Whatever it takes to get this over with. But if it's going to take weeks, forget it. I haven't got weeks to waste. My daughter... well, she'll insist, I suppose. Just… get it done quickly, alright? And don't tell me anything I don’t need to know. I don't want a lecture on my health. Terrazzo. That's all that matters. Can we just schedule them? I have a lunch appointment, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I'll get the orders sent to the lab immediately. They should be able to schedule you for an EKG and blood draw within the next couple of days. The echocardiogram might take a bit longer, depending on availability, but I’ll do my best to expedite it. I will have the results sent to me and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I would recommend staying hydrated and avoiding strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get the tests done. And please, make it quick. I appreciate… well, I appreciate you trying to be thorough, I suppose. But frankly, I’ve lived a long life, and I'm not one for fuss. Just schedule the tests and let me know when. I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I've sent the orders to the lab and they'll be in touch to schedule the appointments. You’ll receive a call within 24 hours. Here's a summary of the tests ordered for your records. Thank you for your patience. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Have a good lunch.
