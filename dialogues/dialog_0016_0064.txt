DOCTOR: Hi Sherion, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too! Um… my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? Like a… a heavy feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy feeling in your chest. I understand why that would be worrying. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… someone is sitting on my chest. And sometimes, when I walk, it feels a little… tight. It started, oh… maybe a week ago? I don’t remember exactly. My husband, he says I’ve been a little quiet too.
DOCTOR: A week ago, and it feels like pressure, more than pain, and you’ve noticed some tightness with walking. And your husband has noticed you being a bit quieter. That’s helpful to know. Does anything specifically bring on the pressure or tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think… when I’m doing dishes, sometimes. Bending over, you know? And… when I climb the stairs to my bedroom. It's not every time, but more often when I’m hurrying. Also, if I get… excited, like talking with my grandkids on the phone, it can happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bending, stairs – especially when you're rushing – and even getting emotionally excited seem to bring it on. That's good information. Do you feel any pain in your arms, jaw, neck, or back along with the chest discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no pain anywhere else. Just… the chest. Sometimes a little… breathless, maybe? But not always. I don't feel dizzy or anything like that. Just… tired, you know? And worried, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain radiating to your arms, jaw or neck, just the chest discomfort and occasional breathlessness, and some fatigue. I understand your worry. Have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I’ve had… little aches and pains, like everyone does, but nothing in my chest. My mother, she had… problems with her heart, but that was a long time ago. I don’t remember exactly what. She lived in Colombia, you know? It was… different there.
DOCTOR: I see. Your mother had heart problems, but you’re not sure of the specifics. That’s alright. Do you know if she was ever diagnosed with anything specific, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or angina?
PATIENT: Oh… I don’t think so. She never went to the doctor much. It was… expensive, and she didn’t like it. She used to drink a lot of tea, with… herbs, for everything. She believed in natural remedies, you know? I think her legs, they got swollen sometimes, but that’s all I remember. She passed away when I was young.
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited information about her heart health, primarily leg swelling. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s talk a little about you. Do you have any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… The doctor here, he told me I have… the pressure, a little. High blood pressure, he said. He gives me a little pill for it, every day. And I think… my sugar was a little high once, but it went down. The doctor said I just need to watch what I eat. I have Medicare, so I see him regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous elevated blood sugar that has since improved with diet. That's good to know. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I take a little vitamin D, the doctor said I was low. And sometimes, for my knees, when they bother me, I take… ibuprofen. Not every day, just when I need it. And… that's it, I think. My husband helps me keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so vitamin D and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I’ve eaten everything, you know? I like to cook, and I try new recipes all the time. My husband, he's the picky eater! He doesn't like spicy food, but I love it.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, just to get a full picture, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. A long time ago, I had my gallbladder out. It was… very painful. And… when I first came to this country, I had a baby, and of course, that was in the hospital. That was… many years ago. But other than that… no. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and the birth of your baby, otherwise no significant surgical history. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My mother didn’t smoke, and I didn’t want to either. It’s bad for you, you know? My husband, he used to smoke, but he quit a long time ago. He says it was the best thing he ever did.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. Not every night, maybe once or twice a week. I like red wine, it’s good for your heart, no? My husband, he likes beer, but not too much. We don't drink much anymore, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, tell me a little about your activity level. What does a typical day look like for you?
PATIENT: Well… I like to garden. I grow tomatoes and peppers and herbs. I cook a lot, of course. I clean the house, but not all at once, little by little. I walk to the store sometimes, if the weather is nice. I try to stay busy, you know? I help my grandkids with their homework when they come over. I try to be active, but… I get tired easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening, cooking, housework, walking, and helping your grandkids – a busy life! And you do experience some fatigue. That gives me a good understanding of your daily routine. Alright, Sherion, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/92. Your heart sounds… I’m hearing a slight murmur, which we’ll want to monitor. Your lungs sound clear. Your pulse is regular, but a bit fast at 88 beats per minute. I'm also going to feel your legs to check for any swelling. Do you notice any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yes. Not a lot, but… in the evenings, sometimes my ankles feel a little puffy. I usually put my feet up, and it goes away. Like I said, my mother… her legs used to swell a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, some evening ankle swelling, relieved by elevation – that’s helpful to know. Given your history of high blood pressure, the murmur I heard, the chest discomfort, and the family history, I think it would be wise to order a few tests. I want to do an EKG to look at your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to see your lungs and heart size, and some blood work to check your cholesterol, sugar, and kidney function. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what’s going on, you know? I don't want to worry anymore. Will the tests… will they be painful?
DOCTOR: No, none of them will be painful. The EKG involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. The blood work is just a quick needle prick in your arm, and the X-ray is completely painless. The lab is just down the hall, and I'll have the order ready for you. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think… no. That all sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on. Can I get a little water? All this talking makes my mouth dry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll have the nurse bring you some water right away. And you’re very welcome, Sherion. That's what I'm here for. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will also go over the lab instructions with you. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are back. In the meantime, try to take it easy and avoid strenuous activity. Do you have someone who can drive you home?
PATIENT: Yes, my husband is waiting. He always drives. He worries about me too, you know? He’s a good man. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear he's there for you. Alright, Sherion, I’ll have the nurse come in shortly with the water and lab order. It was nice meeting you. If anything changes before your follow-up appointment, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. .
PATIENT: .
