DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s been my stomach, mostly. It feels sick a lot, even when I haven't eaten anything bad. And I get full so quickly now. Just a few bites and I feel like I couldn’t possibly eat another thing. It’s been going on for a little while, I reckon. Hard to say exactly how long, time slips away these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Sick” – can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s not like a sharp pain, not at all. More… queasy. Like when you're on a boat, but not as bad. And sometimes I feel like I’m going to… well, you know. But I haven’t actually… thrown up, thankfully. It just feels like it’s building up. It’s mostly just… uncomfortable. It’s hard to explain. It happens pretty often, though. Most days, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, “queasy” most days. And this fullness… is it right after you start eating, or does it take a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s pretty quick, Doctor. Almost right away. I could take two or three bites and then… that’s it. No room for anything else. It’s strange, because I do get hungry. But then… not anymore. It’s like a little switch flips. I used to love a good meal, you know? But now… it’s just not the same. It makes me worried, because I enjoy cooking, but what’s the point if I can't eat it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Oh, not really. I try to eat pretty much the same things I always have. Lots of vegetables, some chicken… things my husband used to like. He… he passed a few years back, so I still make some of his favorites, even if I don’t eat much of them myself. I haven't been trying any new recipes or anything. Just the usual, mostly. Though, I haven’t had much of an appetite, so I haven’t been cooking as much, come to think of it. Just simpler things, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you having any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I've been feeling a bit tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. It's hard to tell, though, because I’m an old woman! But I do find myself napping more in the afternoon. And… now that you mention it, I haven't been sleeping through the night as well. Just little things, you know? Nothing major, I don’t think. Oh! And my stomach feels… bloated sometimes, after I eat even a little bit. Like it’s full of air. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Bloating is good to know. Alright, Ms. Kelder, I'm going to ask you a few more general health questions now, just to get a better picture. Do you have any trouble with heartburn or acid reflux?
PATIENT: Oh, heartburn… sometimes. Not often, though. It happens every now and then, especially if I eat something spicy. But I usually just take a little something over the counter for it, and it goes away. It’s not a regular thing, not like this stomach trouble. My husband used to get it real bad, but I haven’t had it nearly as much. Mostly just when I slip up and eat something I shouldn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a personal question, isn’t it? Well, they've been… different. Not regular, exactly. Sometimes I have trouble going, sometimes it’s… looser than usual. It’s just been all over the place, I suppose. I haven’t really paid much attention to it, to be honest. Old age, I figure. Things just… slow down, don't they? It hasn't been painful or anything, just… irregular. I'm sorry, I don't know if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Kelder. Thank you. Now, have you had any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. But… looking back, I think I might have lost a little weight. My clothes feel a bit looser than they used to, and I haven’t been eating much, like I said. It’s not a lot of weight, but… enough to notice, maybe. I haven't been trying to lose any weight, that’s for sure. It worries me a little, because I don’t want to get too weak. I still like to tend my garden, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. I think it would be a good idea to do a physical exam, and I'd like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If you think it’s best. I trust your judgment. I don't mind a little poking and prodding if it’ll help figure things out. And the blood work, that’s alright too. I’ve had those before, haven’t I? It's just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. I’m not as strong as I used to be, you know? But if it needs doing, it needs doing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with the exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just lie back on the exam table, and try to relax. I’ll also gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. It may be a little uncomfortable, but please let me know if you feel any sharp pain. Now, take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’ll try to relax. It’s just… sometimes my stomach feels a bit sensitive. I'll tell you if anything hurts. Deep breaths… like I used to do in yoga. It’s been a long time since I did yoga, though. Oh… is this cold? The paper on the table is a bit chilly. But I'll try my best to lie still. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, just let me listen for a moment... Sounds are present, but a little diminished. Now, I'm going to press gently here... and here... Any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… a little bit. Just a dull ache, really. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Right about… there. And a little bit here too. It’s hard to say exactly where it hurts, it’s just… all over, sort of. It's not a bad pain, like a twisting or stabbing. Just… achy. And… is this going to take long? I get cold easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. A little tenderness here and here, yes. No masses that I can feel at this time. I'm not going to press any further if it's causing you discomfort. Now, let's listen to your lungs and heart, just to get a complete picture. Deep breath in… and out…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That’s alright. I'm glad you didn’t press too hard. It's good to know there's no… masses. Deep breaths… in… and out… It’s funny, my husband used to say I had the lungs of a mule. He was a farmer, you see, and he appreciated strong lungs. I don't feel quite as strong these days, though. It feels a bit drafty in here, too. But I’m trying my best. Just let me know when you’re finished.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. Everything sounds clear in your lungs and heart. Based on the exam, and what you’ve told me, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool test to rule out any infection. We’ll also check your thyroid function, as that can sometimes cause similar symptoms. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not really. My husband was the one with allergies. He was allergic to… bee stings and… ragweed, I think. But me? Not really. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, and I’ve always been alright. I don't think so. I’m pretty good, as far as allergies go. But if I do suddenly start itching or something, you'll be the first to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I take a little something for my blood pressure, a tiny pill every morning. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Just when it’s really bad, though. And… oh! I take a multivitamin every day. Just a little one, to keep me going. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. Just those few things. I don't like to take a lot of pills, if I can help it. It makes me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a multivitamin. Now, I’m going to write up an order for those blood tests and the stool test. The lab is right down the hall, and they should be able to get you in right away. I also recommend a bland diet for a few days - things like toast, rice, bananas – just to see if that eases your symptoms. We'll review the results when they come back, and then we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. A bland diet… I can do that. Toast and rice… my husband used to like plain rice pudding. Maybe I'll make some. Yes, that sounds alright. And the lab down the hall… good. I’m glad it's close. I don't want to have to walk too far. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough. I feel a little better just knowing we’re doing something about it. When will the results be back? I get anxious, you see.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. The results should be back in about 3-5 business days. The lab will let you know when they’re ready, and then you can call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment with me. My nurse will also call you if anything urgent comes up. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – like if you develop severe pain, fever, or are unable to keep any fluids down – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, 3-5 days… alright. I’ll keep an eye out. And I will call when they’re ready. Thank you for reminding me. Severe pain… yes, I understand. I'll be careful. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I feel a bit more at ease now. Maybe I’ll go home and make some rice pudding. That sounds nice. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day.
