DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Though, frankly, I’d rather not be here. It’s… a rather long story, and I doubt you’ll find it particularly interesting. Workplace… difficulties, shall we say? It’s the students, mostly. No respect these days. Honestly, the whole system is going downhill. I suppose that's what you want to know, isn't it? Just… a lot of stress. I’m a teacher, you see. Library Science. Though, I suspect you already have that information.
DOCTOR: Indeed, I do. And I assure you, Mr. Schlatterer, while I appreciate a good story, I do find your well-being quite interesting. Stress can certainly manifest in many ways, and it’s important to understand how it’s affecting you. So, to clarify, these workplace difficulties – the stress from the students – is this a recent development, or has it been ongoing for some time?
PATIENT: Recent? Hmm. Well, it’s not as if it suddenly appeared, you understand. It’s been… building. Years, really. Though, lately it’s… more pronounced. The new generation… they simply don’t value knowledge. Always staring at those… glowing rectangles. No discipline. Honestly, it’s quite appalling. I can’t say exactly when it became this bad. Time… it all blurs together, you know? I used to have a lovely system for cataloging things… but that was years ago. Before… well, never mind. It's been a while. A long while.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds as though this has been a gradually increasing source of frustration for quite some time. And it’s perfectly normal for time to seem to blur as we get older. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe how this stress is affecting you physically?
PATIENT: Physically? Oh, don’t bother me with medical details. I’m not some… invalid. A bit tired, perhaps. And my digestion isn’t what it used to be. Everything seems to… upset my stomach these days. But that’s probably just the food. They don’t make things like they used to, you know? No quality. And my sleep…well, it’s fragmented. I wake up often. Thinking about… things. About the state of things. It’s not physical, Doctor, it’s… existential. Though, I suppose a bad stomach can be quite debilitating. Is that what you want to know? The specifics of my… bodily functions? Really, it’s rather vulgar.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my line of questioning felt intrusive, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s not my intention to focus on anything vulgar, but rather to understand how this stress is impacting your overall health. Fragmented sleep and digestive issues can be very common responses to stress, and are important to address. You mentioned waking up often thinking about “the state of things.” Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Honestly. It's… everything! The lack of respect, the decline in literacy, the… the noise. It’s constant. And these students… they expect everything handed to them. No effort. No discipline. They think a Google search is equivalent to actual knowledge. It’s… disheartening. And the administration… they don’t understand. They just want numbers, statistics. They don’t care about the value of learning. It keeps me up at night, thinking about the future. The complete and utter… decline. It’s a tragedy, really. A slow, agonizing tragedy. I used to be optimistic, you know? I truly believed in the power of education. But now… now I just see chaos. Is that what you wanted to hear? A gloomy prognosis? Frankly, it's exhausting, even thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds as though you are carrying a great deal of worry and frustration. It's completely understandable that this would be impacting your sleep and overall well-being. Before we delve further into the emotional aspects, I'd like to ask a few more general health questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm. It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes I have no appetite at all. Other times… well, I eat a bit. Mostly out of habit, I suppose. Not much enjoyment in it anymore, though. Everything tastes… bland. Like cardboard. And my wife… well, my ex-wife, used to make lovely meals. But that was a long time ago. Before… everything. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to food these days. It’s just… fuel, you know? I used to enjoy a good steak, a nice glass of wine… but now… what’s the point? Is this important, Doctor? It seems rather trivial, considering the state of the world. I just… eat when I remember to. And mostly things that are easy. Soup, usually. It requires minimal effort.
DOCTOR: It’s not trivial at all, Mr. Schlatterer. Changes in appetite can be an important indicator of overall health. And it sounds like you’ve experienced a number of changes in your life recently, which can certainly impact your eating habits. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss in the past few months?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Honestly, Doctor, I haven't been paying attention to such things. I don’t weigh myself. It’s… undignified. Though my clothes… perhaps they are a bit looser. But that could be the tailor, you know? They don’t make things like they used to. Everything shrinks after a wash. And I’m not as… robust as I once was, naturally. Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart. But I wouldn’t say I’ve lost weight intentionally. I just… don’t have much of an appetite. Is that what you want to know? The specifics of my… physique? Really, Doctor, I’m a teacher, not a prize-winning athlete. It’s all rather… unnecessary. Can we move on? I'm starting to feel quite fatigued.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. We can move on. It’s simply that weight loss can be another sign of underlying issues, and I want to be thorough. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. The doctor gave me something for my… indigestion, a few years ago. But I stopped taking it. It didn’t do much good, and it gave me… unpleasant side effects. Something for my blood pressure, perhaps? I honestly can’t remember. My ex-wife used to handle all of that. She was very organized. Now… I take a multivitamin, occasionally. When I remember. And a bit of fish oil, for my… joints. But that’s about it. Honestly, Doctor, I prefer natural remedies. A good night’s sleep, a bit of fresh air… But those are hard to come by these days. Is this important? It seems like a lot of unnecessary questioning. I'm starting to feel quite… agitated. Perhaps we should wrap this up?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. It's common to have trouble remembering details, especially when dealing with a lot on your mind. And it’s good that you prioritize natural remedies. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have, to medications, foods, or anything else.
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t had an allergy in… decades. Perhaps I was allergic to something as a child, but I can’t recall. Dust, perhaps? A bit of pollen? Nothing serious. I’ve always been a fairly robust individual. No sensitivities, no reactions. I can eat anything, drink anything… well, almost anything. Though I’ve stopped drinking wine, as I mentioned. It doesn’t… agree with me anymore. Is this really necessary? It feels like an interrogation. I simply came here because… well, I suppose I felt obligated. My daughter insisted. She worries too much. Honestly, I’m perfectly fine. Just a bit… tired. Can we please wrap this up? I have a book to finish. It’s a first edition, you know. Very delicate. Requires my full attention.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. It sounds as though you’ve been dealing with a great deal of stress and change, and you’re understandably feeling fatigued. Based on what you’ve told me, you’re experiencing stress related to your workplace, which has led to changes in your appetite, fragmented sleep, and a possible unintentional weight loss. It’s also important to note your difficulty recalling medications and your current feeling of agitation. I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly, Doctor. At my age? What good would that do? I’m a teacher, not a laboratory specimen. I assure you, I’m perfectly fine. Just a bit… weary. And frankly, I’m wasting my time here. I have a book to catalog, a first edition, you know? Very delicate. Requires my full attention. I think I’ve answered enough questions. I appreciate your… concern, but I’m perfectly capable of managing my own affairs. I’d like to leave now, if you don’t mind. I’m starting to feel quite… uncomfortable. Thank you for your time. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, please. While I respect your wishes, I am concerned about your well-being. A brief exam—checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs—would simply provide a baseline and help me rule out any underlying medical issues contributing to your fatigue and stress. It won’t take long, and it could give us both peace of mind. If you’re uncomfortable with a full exam, perhaps we can start with just your blood pressure?
