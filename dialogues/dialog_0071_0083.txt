DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Or… Early, right?
PATIENT: Yes, Early. Early Kammer. Good morning to you too, Doctor… Galena, is it? I don’t see much of anyone important out here in the country, you know. Just wanted to ask a small favor, really.
DOCTOR: Galena is correct, yes. And please, call me Matthias. A small favor?
PATIENT: Well, my…ex-wife, she’s not been feeling very…supportive, lately. And I thought…a card, from a doctor…you know, someone with authority…it might get her to see things my way. A “Get Well” card, maybe? Or something encouraging? Something to show I care, even if she doesn't appreciate it. Is that…possible?
DOCTOR: I…see. Mr. Kammer, while I appreciate you thinking of me, and I certainly want to be helpful…a card from a doctor isn’t really within the scope of medical practice. It…could be a bit of a conflict of interest, you understand. My role is to provide medical care, not…relationship advice or documentation for personal matters. Are you experiencing any medical concerns that brought you in today?
PATIENT: Conflict of interest? Doctor, with all due respect, what kind of conflict is a simple card? She thinks I’m exaggerating my…general discomfort. A little encouragement from a professional…it’s just common sense! Look, I’m not asking for a diagnosis, just a little…validation. It would mean a lot. And honestly, I haven’t been sleeping well, thinking about it. Is that medical enough for you?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kammer. Let’s take a step back. Difficulty sleeping is a medical concern, absolutely. And you mentioned “general discomfort.” Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…everywhere, really. A little ache here, a little pain there. Nothing specific, you understand. Just…old age, I suppose. And the stress. She’s constantly…questioning everything. Makes it hard to relax, which doesn’t help the sleeping, naturally. I used to be a strong man, working with the boilers…but now… it just feels like everything is a little…off. Does that make sense? It’s not like a broken bone or anything. Just…tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Generalized discomfort” and difficulty sleeping. That does warrant investigation. Let’s start with a basic review of your systems. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I’m hungry, don’t eat when I’m not. Nothing fancy. Used to enjoy a good Puerto Rican meal, but… haven’t been feeling much appetite for anything lately, if you want to get technical. Not that she’d notice. She’s too busy complaining about the price of groceries. It's always something with her. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite. And how about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Now you’re asking me personal questions, Doctor. Really! I didn't come here for a…a thorough examination of my…digestive system. I just wanted a card! Is that too much to ask? I mean, I’m a grown man, I know when I’m…regular. Let's just say it's been…unpredictable lately. Is that good enough? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I apologize if I’m making you uncomfortable. I'm asking these questions because changes in bowel habits can be significant. It's part of a standard medical assessment to rule out any underlying issues. But, we can certainly skip that for now if you prefer. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I’ve lived a long life. Had the usual…colds, flu, a broken wrist when I was younger…nothing serious. No fancy diseases, no high blood pressure, no heart problems. I used to be as strong as an ox! Worked hard, ate good food…kept myself in shape. That was before…well, before everything. My ex-wife’s complaining has probably given me more stress than any medical condition. Are we getting anywhere with this card, or are we just going to talk about my…bodily functions all day? I'm starting to feel a bit…lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Lightheaded?
PATIENT: Just a little. Probably the stress, like I said. Look, about the card... if you really can't do it, that's fine. But honestly, Doctor, a little kindness goes a long way. And if it helps me get some peace of mind…isn’t that what a doctor is supposed to do? I'm not asking for a miracle, just a simple card. Before I go, could you at least tell me if you think I’m…exaggerating my discomfort? Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration and your need for reassurance. And you're right, a doctor should provide reassurance when appropriate. However, I still feel strongly that writing a card for this purpose is not within the ethical boundaries of medical practice. I can, however, thoroughly evaluate your symptoms, and document my findings. We can discuss any potential causes for your discomfort and come up with a plan to address them. I will also be more than happy to discuss your stress levels with you and explore resources that may be helpful. Before we proceed, though, let's check your blood pressure quickly. Given you mentioned feeling lightheaded, I want to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
