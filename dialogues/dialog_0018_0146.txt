DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Stilaire. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… well, my muscles just feel weak. It's been going on for a little while now, and it's getting harder to do things. I work as an insurance appraiser – you know, looking at car damage – and even that’s becoming a struggle sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness can be very concerning, and it's good you're addressing it. When you say “a little while,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started maybe… six months ago? It was just little things at first, like trouble opening jars. Now, I find myself using both hands to lift things I used to do with one, and I get tired really quickly. It's not like a sudden thing, it's been slowly getting worse. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A gradual onset is helpful information. And you've noticed this impacting your ability to perform tasks at work, specifically lifting and general endurance. Now, could you describe the weakness more specifically?
PATIENT: It’s… everywhere, honestly. Arms, legs, even my hands sometimes feel like they don’t have the strength they used to. It's not painful, not usually. Just… heavy. Like trying to move through water, maybe? And it’s worse after I've been doing something for a while. Like, after a long day of inspecting cars, I can barely hold a fork. It's pretty frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. A generalized weakness, not accompanied by pain, worsening with exertion. That's important. And you said it affects your arms, legs, and hands. Are you noticing any tingling or numbness accompanying the weakness?
PATIENT: No, not really. No tingling or numbness. Just… the lack of strength. It feels like my muscles are just… giving out faster than they should. Sometimes my grip feels a little shaky, but that's about it. I haven't noticed anything else, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. That helps to narrow things down. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently, either loss or gain?
PATIENT: Oh, actually… yes. I’ve lost a little weight. Not a lot, maybe five or ten pounds, over the last few months. I haven’t been eating much less, if that makes sense. Just… not as hungry, I guess. And I haven’t been going to the gym like I used to, because, you know, with the weakness. But I definitely haven't been trying to lose weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintended weight loss over the past few months alongside the weakness… that’s something we’ll need to investigate further. Now, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing diagnosed, anyway. I’ve had the usual colds and flus, nothing serious. High blood pressure, maybe? My dad had it, so the doctor mentioned I should keep an eye on it, but I haven't really been to a doctor regularly. That's why I’m here now, I suppose. I don’t take any regular medications, if that matters.
DOCTOR: It matters very much. A family history of high blood pressure is important to note. And no prior medical diagnoses or medications… alright. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. I’ve been pretty lucky with my health, up until now, it seems. Broken a bone or two as a kid, but nothing major. Just the usual scrapes and bruises. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good to know. Now, regarding your family… are there any other medical conditions that run in your family, besides your father’s high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me think. My mom had some problems with her joints when she got older. Arthritis, I think. And my aunt, on my mom’s side, had diabetes. That's about all I can think of, really. Everyone else seemed pretty healthy, to be honest. Oh, and my grandfather… he had something with his heart, but I don't remember the specifics. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, diabetes, and a heart condition in the grandfather… we’ll note all of that. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. I drink occasionally, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but not every day, not even close. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been into any of that. I try to stay pretty healthy, to be honest. Or at least, did try, before all this weakness started.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No known allergies. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to a medication, as far as I know. I’ve never had to worry about checking labels or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon, thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination to further assess your condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get back to normal, if that's possible. Let’s get this examination done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat here, we’ll begin. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then we’ll do some basic neurological tests – check your reflexes, strength, coordination, and balance. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Just tell me what I need to do. I'll cooperate however I can. Thanks, Doctor. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 138/82 on the right arm and 140/84 on the left. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale. Again… deep breath… and exhale. Sounds clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Knee reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Ankle reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Now, let’s assess your muscle strength. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it used to be, I’ll admit. It feels like I’m really straining to get a good grip.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. Your grip strength appears diminished bilaterally, approximately 4/5 on both sides. That means you have good strength, but with some effort. Now, I’d like you to push against my hands with your arms and legs. Push against my hands like you’re trying to lift something heavy… Good. And now with the other arm… and now push against my hands with your legs, like you're trying to sit up… Strength in your arms and legs is also approximately 4/5 bilaterally, with some noted fatigue. Now, let's check your coordination. Can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Okay… here goes. It's… not as smooth as it used to be, Doctor. I’m a little shaky. I’m trying, but it feels… off.
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed that. There's some slight ataxia noted in both upper extremities. That means a lack of coordination. Finally, I’d like you to stand up and walk a few steps for me, please. I will observe your gait.
PATIENT: Okay… here I go. It's… harder than it looks, Doctor. I feel a little wobbly. I don’t usually walk like this.
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed a slightly wide-based gait, and some mild instability. Alright, Mr. McKinnon, thank you for your cooperation. That concludes the physical examination. Based on the history and physical exam, you are experiencing generalized weakness, accompanied by fatigue, diminished grip strength, mild ataxia, and gait instability. Now, to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms, I would like to order some laboratory tests. These include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, vitamin D level, and creatine kinase level. We should also order a sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to look for inflammation. Would you like me to explain why I'm ordering each of these?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds like a lot of tests. It would be helpful to know why you want to check all of those things. I trust your judgment, Doctor, but I like to understand what's going on, if that's alright. Just… explain it to me like you’d explain it to someone who doesn’t know a lot about medicine.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand completely. We're going to run these tests to get a clearer picture of what might be causing your symptoms. The complete blood count checks for things like anemia—low red blood cell count—which can cause weakness and fatigue. It also looks at your white blood cell count to see if there’s any sign of infection or inflammation. The comprehensive metabolic panel tells us about your kidney and liver function, and your electrolyte levels. Problems with these can also cause weakness. Thyroid stimulating hormone checks your thyroid function. An underactive thyroid can cause fatigue, weakness, and muscle aches. Vitamin D level is important because vitamin D deficiency is common and can cause muscle weakness and fatigue. Creatine kinase is an enzyme released when muscle damage occurs. Elevated levels can indicate muscle inflammation or breakdown. Finally, the sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are markers of inflammation in the body. Elevated levels can suggest an underlying inflammatory condition. These tests will help us rule out several possibilities and guide us towards the correct diagnosis. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes a lot of sense, actually. You explained it really well. So, it’s about checking everything that could be causing it, to see what’s going on. And then you can figure out what the problem is, and how to fix it? It sounds… thorough, which is good. When can I get these tests done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Exactly. That’s precisely the plan. We're going to cast a wide net, then narrow things down based on the results. We can get these tests done today. I’ll write you a lab requisition form, and you can go to the lab across the street. They accept most insurance plans, but since you mentioned being uninsured, we can discuss options for financial assistance if needed. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I want you to avoid strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. Also, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or significant fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything really clearly. I just… I really appreciate you taking the time to listen, and not brushing me off. It’s been worrying me for a while now, and it’s good to finally be getting it checked out. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll go to the lab across the street right now. And I’ll call if I have any problems, or if anything gets worse.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you. And remember, early detection is key. We'll get to the bottom of this. I wish you the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
