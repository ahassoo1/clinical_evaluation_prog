DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Octavis, you say? Well, it’s… something down there. Not good, no. It’s… leaking. That’s what my neighbor told me to come about. She said I should get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, “something down there” that’s leaking. I understand. To help me figure out what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… well, it’s wet. Not all the time, but… sometimes. Especially after… you know. When a lady goes to the bathroom. It’s not… blood, I don't think. Just… stuff. It smells funny too. Like… old fish, maybe? I don’t know. It’s embarrassing to talk about, really.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s embarrassing, Ms. Genard, and you’re doing the right thing by getting it checked out. “Stuff” leaking, especially with a funny smell, is definitely something we need to investigate. Just to be clear, is this leakage happening from your urethra – that's the opening where you urinate – or from another area?
PATIENT: Ure… what-now? You talkin’ about… where the pee comes out? Yes, that one. It’s definitely comin’ from there. Not anywhere else. I know where my parts are, thank you very much. It’s just… it’s not normal, is it? It never did this before.
DOCTOR: No, it’s definitely not normal if it’s a new symptom, and you're right to be concerned. Okay, leakage from the urethra. Has this been happening constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when… well, after. After I go potty. Sometimes not at all. Other times… a little dribble. Not a whole lot. Enough to… bother me, you know? It makes things feel… unclean. And the smell! That's the worst part, really. It's not a nice smell. I try to keep things clean, but it just… keeps comin' back. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Genard. “A little dribble” after urinating, especially with the odor you describe, points us in a few possible directions. To help me narrow things down, can you tell me if you feel any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not exactly. Maybe a little… uncomfortable sometimes. Like… like when you gotta go really bad, but it doesn’t burn. Just… a feeling. And it’s not all the time. Mostly when… when I don’t go right away. If I wait too long, it’s a little harder to get it all out, and then… the leaking starts. Does that make sense? I'm not good at explainin' these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Genard. “A little uncomfortable” and leakage when delaying urination are important clues. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… oh dear. Let me think. I had… the usual old lady stuff, I guess. Arthritis, in my knees. That's why I walk with a cane sometimes. And… high blood pressure, maybe? The doctor always told me to watch my salt. But nothing serious. I don’t take a lot of pills, if that’s what you’re asking. Mostly just for the pain. And… I don’t have insurance, so I don’t go to the doctor much anymore. Too expensive.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your knees and a history of high blood pressure. That’s good to know. And I understand your concern about the cost of healthcare. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. Oh! Yes. Years ago. A long time ago. When I was younger. I had… my appendix out. And… and something with my gallbladder, I think. It was a long time ago. It was a whole ordeal. Lots of pain. But I recovered. That was… oh, must be forty years ago now? Everything gets blurry after a while. I don't remember much else, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and gallbladder surgery, both a long time ago. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, here. I take this for my knees, when they're acting up. The doctor gave it to me a long time ago. It’s… Ibuprofen, I think? And… I use this cream for the pain too. It smells funny. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little something… just one. But not every night. It’s just… to help me rest. That’s all. Is that enough? I don’t take a lot, I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen as needed for knee pain and a cream for pain relief, and an occasional sleep aid. That's good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with anything. I eat everything. I used to eat shellfish all the time when I was younger. Never had a reaction. Not to any medicine either. The doctors always asked, and I always told them no. I'm a pretty strong person, you know. I don't get sick easily. Mostly just… old lady aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, Ms. Genard, to get a clearer picture of what might be causing your leakage, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. This will involve checking your abdomen and a quick pelvic exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a what exam? A pelvic exam? Oh dear. Now hold on a minute, Doctor. What exactly does that involve? I’m not so sure… I don't like the sound of that at all. I'm an old woman. I've been through enough. Do you have to?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Genard, and I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. A pelvic exam is a way for me to gently examine your bladder and surrounding areas to help determine the cause of the leakage. It helps me rule out any infections or other issues. We don’t have to do it if you’re not comfortable, but it would provide valuable information. It's a quick exam, and I will explain everything as I go and stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. We can discuss alternative options, but without a physical exam, it’s difficult to give you an accurate diagnosis. Would you like me to explain the exam in more detail, or perhaps we can start with just an abdominal exam first?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just… just tell me what the abdominal exam is. No… no poking around down there yet. Not until you explain everything. But be gentle, Doctor. My stomach's been… tender lately. And I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Genard. The abdominal exam is very straightforward. I'll gently press on different areas of your abdomen to feel for any tenderness, swelling, or unusual masses. It helps me assess your bladder and other organs. I'll start by having you lie on your back with your knees bent, and then I'll listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope. It shouldn’t be painful, but please let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort at any point. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright… fine. But… be careful, Doctor. I bruise easily, you know. And… and don't rush. Just… let me know what you're doing before you touch me. I don't like surprises. Get it over with quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen, starting here on your lower right side. I'm just feeling for any tenderness or swelling. This will take just a few moments. Okay, a little bit of tenderness on the left side, but nothing significant. I’m listening to your abdomen now with the stethoscope. Your bowel sounds are normal, and I don’t hear any unusual noises. Overall, your abdomen feels relatively soft, with some mild tenderness on the left side. Now, just to confirm, can you tell me if you've had any recent changes in your bowel habits, like constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little sore. Just a little. And… bowel habits? Well, not really. I go when I need to go. Sometimes a little… stuck, if I wait too long. But that’s nothing new. Happens all the time. I don’t pay much attention to it, to be honest. It’s just… old lady stuff. Everything’s a little slow these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a little slow” and some mild tenderness on the left side. Ms. Genard, based on what you’ve told me and the quick abdominal exam, it’s possible this leakage is due to a mild bladder irritation or possibly some constipation contributing to the problem. However, to rule out other possibilities, and to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I still recommend a brief pelvic exam. It will allow me to assess your pelvic floor muscles and check for any signs of infection. We can also do a simple urine test right here in the office to check for bacteria. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: A urine test… that I can handle, I guess. But… the pelvic exam… Oh, alright, Doctor. But be quick, and be gentle! And explain everything before you do it. I don't want any surprises. And… and I need a moment to… prepare myself. Just… tell me what’s going to happen, step by step.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Genard. I understand your concerns, and I will explain everything carefully. First, you’ll lie on your back with your knees bent, like you did for the abdominal exam. I'll gently drape a sheet over you to maintain your privacy. I’ll use a light, sterile speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix – that's the opening to the uterus. It may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. I’ll be looking for any signs of infection or irritation. Then, I’ll do a gentle internal exam with one finger to assess the strength of your pelvic floor muscles and check for any tenderness. Again, it may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. The entire exam will take just a few minutes, and I’ll explain everything as I go. You can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I think I understand. A speculum… and you’ll be… looking at things. And feeling things. Just… be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle. And tell me what you’re doing before you do it. I don’t want any surprises. And… and if it hurts, I want you to stop immediately. Alright… let’s get it over with. But… slowly, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. We’ll take it very slowly, and you’re in control. You can stop me at any time. First, I’m going to gently clean the external area with a sterile wipe. This may feel a little cool. Now, I’m going to gently insert the speculum. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Take a deep breath and relax your muscles. Okay, just a little more… and there. Do you feel any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… not comfortable. A little cold… and a little… strange. Just… be quick, Doctor. And don't push it too far. It feels… intrusive. Just… get it over with. But… be careful. Very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Genard, I hear you. We can slow down even more, or stop completely if you prefer. You are in control. I'm just going to take a quick look, and I'll explain everything as I go. Okay, the cervix looks healthy, with no signs of infection or irritation. Now, I'm just going to do a gentle internal exam with one finger to assess your pelvic floor muscles. This will just take a moment. Okay, your pelvic floor muscles feel a little relaxed, but there's no significant tenderness. That's all. Okay, we’re all done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… that was… not pleasant. It felt… strange. And a little… violating. But… you said everything looked healthy? No infection? That’s good, I guess. And the muscles were just… relaxed? What does that mean? What do I need to do now? Do I need pills? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Yes, everything looked healthy, and there were no signs of infection. That’s very good news. As for your pelvic floor muscles being a little relaxed, that's common as we age. It means they're not as strong as they once were, which can sometimes contribute to leakage. It's not a serious problem, but it's something we can address. In your case, I don't think you need pills. The best thing you can do is strengthen those pelvic floor muscles with Kegel exercises. It's simple and you can do it at home. I can show you how to do them, or I can give you a handout with instructions. I also recommend staying well-hydrated and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Kegel exercises? You mean… squeezing? Is that it? I don’t know if I can do that. It sounds… silly. And what about the caffeine? I like my coffee in the morning! Oh dear. This is going to be difficult. Will it really help? I don’t want to spend my time squeezing all day and giving up my coffee for nothing. And what if it doesn't work? What then?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Genard. It does sound a little silly, but Kegel exercises are very effective for strengthening those pelvic floor muscles. You don’t have to spend all day squeezing, just a few minutes a few times a day. Think of it like exercising any other muscle. It takes time and consistency, but it can make a big difference. As for the caffeine, you don’t have to give it up completely, just try to reduce your intake. It’s about finding a balance. And if it doesn’t work, we can explore other options. There are other treatments available, such as bladder training or medication. But let's start with the simplest approach first and see how it goes. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about the exercises or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Okay… squeeze… and hold… and relax. It sounds… complicated. And how will I know if I’m doing it right? Oh dear. This is a lot to remember. And what if it makes things worse? What if I squeeze too much? And… can I get a ride home? I don’t think I’m up to driving right now. I'm a little shaken up.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Genard. It's not complicated, but it does take practice. You’ll know you’re doing it right if you feel a gentle squeeze in your pelvic floor muscles. You shouldn’t feel any pain or discomfort. And it’s unlikely you’ll squeeze too much. It’s more important to focus on doing the exercises correctly than squeezing as hard as you can. Here, I’ve written down some tips and instructions for you. And if you’re still unsure, you can always call the office and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to review the exercises with you. As for a ride home, unfortunately, we don’t provide transportation. But I can call the front desk and see if they can help you arrange a taxi or ride-sharing service. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Okay… tips and instructions. Fine. But… I don’t have a lot of energy these days. And… I don’t trust those ride-sharing things. Too much trouble. Oh dear. This is all very complicated. Maybe… maybe I should just forget about it. It’s probably not worth all the trouble. I just want to go home and take a nap. It’s all very stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Genard. It can be overwhelming. You don’t have to do anything you’re not comfortable with. If you decide to try the exercises later, that's great. And if not, that's perfectly fine too. The most important thing is that you're taking care of yourself. I've documented everything we discussed today, and I'm here to support you if you have any questions in the future. Please don't hesitate to call the office. Let me call the front desk to see if they can assist you with a taxi.
