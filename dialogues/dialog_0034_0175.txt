DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this pain… it's been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain can be quite disruptive. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It's mostly in my lower back. It's not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come, it really gets to me. It’s a dull ache usually, but sometimes it shoots down my leg. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it's an intermittent lower back pain, sometimes radiating down your leg, and you describe it as a dull ache that can occasionally be more sharp. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started, I'd say, maybe three months ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little stiffness after I’d been sitting for a long time. But it’s definitely gotten worse over the last month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago with mild stiffness, progressing over the last month. And is there anything specific that seems to trigger the pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. Bending over is a killer. And… lifting anything, even groceries, is tough. Sitting for too long doesn’t help either, like on long drives. Standing for a long time isn't great either, actually. Seems like a lot of things set it off, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It does sound like quite a few things aggravate it. That’s helpful information, thank you. And when you’re experiencing this pain, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give it?
PATIENT: Oh, that scale… Okay, when it’s just the dull ache, maybe a 3 or 4. But when it shoots down my leg, it gets up to… maybe a 7 or 8. It really takes my breath away sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a 3 to 4 with the ache and up to a 7 or 8 with the radiating pain. That’s important to know. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: You know, now that you mention it… yeah, a little bit. Mostly in my right foot. It’s not constant, comes and goes, like the pain. It's kind of a… pins and needles feeling. Not too bad, but it's there sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent pins and needles sensation in your right foot. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any previous injuries to your back, or any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I pulled a muscle in my back years ago, maybe twenty years ago, lifting something heavy. I went to a chiropractor for a while, and it cleared up. Other than that… nothing major. I have high blood pressure, but I take medication for it. And my wife says I snore, but I don’t think that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: While snoring isn’t directly related, it's good to have a complete picture. Thank you for sharing that. So, a muscle pull twenty years ago treated with chiropractic care, and currently managed high blood pressure. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one for the blood pressure. A small blue pill, I think. Can’t remember the name off the top of my head. I take it every morning with breakfast. And… I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, but not regularly. Mostly in the winter.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small blue pill for blood pressure daily and occasional vitamin D. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any reactions to anything. My wife always tells me to be careful, but I’ve never had a problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife wouldn't allow it! And I don't drink much either, just a glass of wine with dinner occasionally.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And do you do any regular exercise?
PATIENT: Well, I try to. I used to walk a lot more, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. Now I mostly do some light gardening. It’s not much, but it keeps me moving a little bit. And I walk around the house, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, light gardening and general movement. That’s helpful. Now, Mr. Way, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels… particularly bad.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start with your back. I’m going to gently palpate, or feel, your back to check for tenderness or muscle spasms. Please let me know if anything is painful. …Okay, a little tenderness there, on the right side. And can you please bend forward for me, as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that’s a little sore. And… …That’s not too comfortable, Doctor. It feels tight. Not sharp, just… restricted.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the right side and restricted range of motion with forward bending. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Please lie down on your back for me. …Alright, I’m going to tap on your knee with this little hammer. This is to check your reflexes. Relax your leg, please. …And now your left knee. And finally, I’d like you to try and lift your right leg straight up, keeping it as straight as possible.
PATIENT: Okay… felt that. Both felt about the same, I think. And… Ooh… that’s harder than it looks, Doctor. It’s… weak. Not completely weak, but definitely not as strong as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are normal bilaterally, but you're experiencing some weakness with right leg lifting. Now, I'm going to perform a straight leg raise test. This can help us determine if there’s any nerve compression. …Do you feel any pain radiating down your leg when I lift your leg like this?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes! Right down my leg, Doctor! That’s the same pain I’ve been feeling. Definitely. Stop, please. That's the one.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Alright, Mr. Way, based on your history and the physical exam findings, it appears you likely have lumbar radiculopathy, which means there’s irritation or compression of a nerve in your lower back. The straight leg raise test was positive, which supports this. The weakness in your right leg lifting and the radiating pain are also consistent with this diagnosis. We'll need to confirm this with imaging. I'm going to order an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any fractures or other structural issues. And I may also recommend an MRI if the X-ray doesn’t provide enough information. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay… lumbar radiculopathy. Sounds… serious. But thank you for explaining it, Doctor. X-ray and maybe an MRI… yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best to figure out what's going on. I just want to get this pain under control.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Way. While “radiculopathy” sounds intimidating, it’s often manageable with conservative treatment. We’ll start with the imaging to get a clearer picture, and then we’ll discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that aggravate your pain, like heavy lifting or prolonged sitting. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to help reduce inflammation and pain. And applying ice or heat to your lower back can also provide some relief. I’m going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, to help ease the muscle spasms. I'll also give you a referral to physical therapy, as they can teach you exercises to strengthen your back and core muscles, and improve your flexibility. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. No heavy lifting, ice or heat, over-the-counter pain relievers… and a muscle relaxant. And physical therapy. Yes, all of that sounds good, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll try to follow your instructions as best I can. I'm just a little worried about the muscle relaxant… will it make me sleepy?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Way. Yes, cyclobenzaprine can cause drowsiness, especially when you first start taking it. It’s best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how it affects you. I’ll start you on a low dose, and you can gradually increase it if needed. If the drowsiness is bothersome, we can discuss reducing the dose or switching to a different medication. I’m also going to give you a handout with information about lumbar radiculopathy and some exercises you can do at home. And I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the imaging results and see how you’re responding to treatment. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Low dose to start, and we'll see how it goes. And a handout and a follow-up appointment in two weeks. Thank you so much for taking the time to explain everything and for being so thorough. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on and having a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here are your prescriptions and the handout. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment and go over some instructions with you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention. I really appreciate it. I’ll see you in two weeks.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you then. Have a good day.
