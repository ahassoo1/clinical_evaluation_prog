DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. Welcome. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Hmm... what brought me in? Let me think... It's my waterworks, I think. Not working so good, you see. Hard to... to go, when I need to. It's been happening for a little while now, I reckon. Not sure how long exactly. Old age, probably!
DOCTOR: Right, your waterworks, or your bladder control. And you said this has been going on for a little while… can you tell me a bit more about how it’s not working so good?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the bladder… that's what my husband calls it. Well, it's like... it feels like I have to push to get it going. And sometimes, I start, and then it just… stops. Then I have to try again. It's not painful, just… frustrating. And a little bit embarrassing, if you know what I mean. It happens mostly when I’m trying to go, but sometimes I feel like I don't empty it completely, either. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty starting and maintaining your urine stream, and possibly not fully emptying your bladder. We call that urinary hesitancy and incomplete emptying. Now, has this been getting progressively worse, or has it been fairly consistent?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, those are fancy words! Hesitancy… yes, that’s it! It feels hesitant, alright. And… um… consistent… well, I think it’s been getting a little worse. Not much at a time, but… harder, you know? Like needing to push a little more each time. It’s hard to say for sure, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It just feels… older. If that makes sense. Old feelings!
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other changes, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me see… I don’t think so. No pain, like I said. And… no fever or anything. I have been getting up a little more at night to go, maybe? But I always liked a little drink before bed, so that could be it. My husband says I drink too much tea! He worries about everything, that man. I don't know… is something supposed to be different? I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you go to the bathroom during the day, are you having any trouble getting there in time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, now you’re asking things I don’t know! Getting there in time… Well, I don’t rush much these days, dear. I take my time. But… sometimes, I do feel a little… urgent. Like I need to go right now. Not every time, but… a few times a week, maybe? And then I have to hurry a little. Not a full-on accident, mind you, just a little bit of a… panic. Is that what you mean? It's a bit embarrassing to talk about.
DOCTOR: Right. So, some urgency and hesitancy. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. You're asking a lot of personal questions, dear! Color… well, it looks like pee, usually. Sometimes it's lighter, sometimes it's a bit darker, depending on how much tea I've had. And the smell… I don't pay much attention to the smell. Old lady smells, probably! I haven’t noticed anything bad, if that makes sense. Nothing that stood out. I really don't sniff my pee, dear. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: It is perfectly normal not to sniff your pee, Ms. Stoffregen. I just need to rule out a possible infection. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health problems that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Health problems… Well, I'm old! That's a health problem in itself, I reckon. My husband says I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it doesn't bother me too much. And… oh, I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. A long time ago. Other than that… not much, I don't think. I go to the doctor regularly, but he just tells me I'm getting old and to take it easy. He's a nice man, but he doesn't remember much either, I suspect. Do you need to know about my blood pressure? He checks that all the time.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. What does your doctor usually tell you your blood pressure is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers! My brain isn’t so good with numbers anymore. He says something like… one-something over another-something. I think the top number is usually around… 140? Maybe? And the bottom number is… 80? No, maybe 90? He always makes it sound so complicated. He says it’s a little high, but not too bad for my age. He wants me to watch my salt intake, but I like my food! He always says I need to be better about my diet. Is that helpful? I don't remember the exact numbers, dear. I just know it's not perfect.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... Well, I take a little pill for my arthritis, a white one. And sometimes, when my husband thinks I'm getting a cold, he gives me something for that. A yellow one, I think. And… oh, yes! I take something for my heart, a tiny blue pill. Just a little one. And sometimes, a laxative, if I’m feeling… backed up. But that’s not every day, just when I need it. He keeps them in a big jar in the kitchen. It’s all a bit of a blur, dear. My husband manages most of it, to be honest. I just swallow the pills he gives me. Do you need to know what they’re called? I wouldn’t have a clue.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. That’s alright, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That’s perfectly alright. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding. I’ve had a few in my time! Just be gentle, alright? My bones are a bit creaky these days. And please don't mind if I talk a little bit, I sometimes get nervous. Just take your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit distant. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness, but some mild distention. Reflexes are a little diminished, but strength is intact. Finally, I’ll do a quick external genital exam. No visible lesions or abnormalities. Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Everything seems normal externally. Now, to get a better understanding of your bladder function, I’d like to order a urine test, to check for infection, and a post-void residual volume, which tells me how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that was a lot! You poked and prodded and listened… it all sounds very thorough, dear. And you found everything normal, which is good. I'm glad you checked. A urine test and… what was the other thing? Something about the bladder… sounds a bit scary. Is it going to hurt? I don't like needles much. And is it something serious? My husband gets worried about everything, you see. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again, dear. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Ms. Stoffregen. And the tests aren’t scary, I promise. The urine test is just a simple sample, and the post-void residual volume is a painless ultrasound of your bladder after you urinate. It tells us how well you’re emptying. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you may have urinary retention, meaning your bladder isn’t emptying completely. This can be caused by a number of things, including an enlarged prostate in men, but in women, it can often be related to weakened bladder muscles or nerve problems. It's not necessarily serious, but we need to rule out any underlying causes. I'm going to order those tests now, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend you try to drink plenty of fluids, and avoid caffeine and alcohol. If you start experiencing any pain or fever, please call the office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So many fancy words again! Weakened muscles… nerve problems… that doesn’t sound good. And I do like my tea, you see. But I’ll try to drink more water, dear. And avoid the caffeine. For the sake of my bladder. A follow-up appointment… yes, that sounds alright. I just want to get this sorted out, so I can get back to normal. And… what if it is serious? My husband will have a fit! He worries about everything, you know. But thank you, dear. For listening. And for not laughing at my old lady problems. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. We’ll take things one step at a time. Most likely, it’s nothing serious. But it’s important to rule out any potential problems. The nurse will come in shortly to collect the urine sample and give you instructions for the ultrasound. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don’t think so, dear. Not right now. I’m a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. All those words and tests… it’s a lot for an old lady to take in. I guess I’ll just wait for the nurse. And try not to worry too much. Thank you again, dear. You’ve been very patient with me. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need a little lie down.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. Get some rest, Ms. Stoffregen.
