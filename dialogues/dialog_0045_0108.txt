DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it’s my stomach. Been… bleedin’. Not a pretty sight, I can tell you that. Happened a couple times now, and it ain’t gettin’ better. More like…worse.
DOCTOR: Bleeding, you say. Okay. And how long has this been going on for, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Let me think… it started, maybe… three weeks ago? Hard to say exactly. Things kinda blur together when you’re dealin’ with…well, you know. Things. It wasn’t much at first, just a little somethin’ when I… used the restroom. But the last couple of days, it’s been… significant. Enough to worry a man, that's for sure. Not like a cut, mind you. Different color. Darker. Like…coffee grounds, almost. You know what I mean?
DOCTOR: Coffee grounds, alright. That’s… helpful. And is it constant bleeding, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant? No, thank goodness. It’s not like a faucet just left runnin’. Comes and goes, yeah. Usually after I eat, or…well, sometimes just randomly. No rhyme or reason, really. It’s just… unpredictable, which is the worst part. Makes a fella not want to leave the house, you know? I’ve been tryin’ to eat bland stuff, but even toast seems to set it off sometimes. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Bland diet, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, doc. Bland. Like hospital food. You think I want to eat that stuff? I’m tryin’ here. Tryin’ to figure out what’s goin’ on. It ain't exactly pleasant, lettin' things… slip out like that. And frankly, I’m not gettin’ any younger. Gotta figure this out before… well, before things get really bad, you know? What kind of doctor even deals with this anyway? It's not like a broken arm.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Gentz, that's what I'm here for. Family medicine covers a lot. But given the coffee grounds description, and the bleeding, we need to rule out a few things. Have you ever had any issues with ulcers, or taken a lot of pain medication?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Nah, never. Not that I know of, anyway. My wife… she handled all the doctor stuff. Always kept me outta those things. As for pain meds… not really. Just the occasional aspirin for a headache, but that’s it. I try to avoid ‘em, if I can. Mess with your stomach, those things do. And I certainly don't need more stomach trouble, if you catch my drift. She always said I was too… sensitive. Maybe she was right. This whole thing is just… a mess. Honestly, I don’t know what I’d do if somethin’ happened to me. No family left, see. Just me. It’s kinda lonely, dealin’ with all this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any family history of stomach issues, or bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That's a tough one. My father… he wasn’t one for talkin’ about ailments. Always thought showin’ weakness was a sin. My mother… she died young, somethin' with her heart, I think. Didn’t pay much attention back then, to be honest. We weren’t close. As for bleedin’… I don’t recall anyone sufferin’ from that. But then again, they didn't really tell me much. We weren’t a close-knit family, see? More like a bunch of strangers livin’ under the same roof. So, honestly, doc, I couldn't tell you. Not a clue, really. It's probably just somethin' I ate, right? Gotta be. It couldn't be… anythin’ serious, could it?
DOCTOR: Well, we can’t rule anything out without a proper examination. Let's start with a physical assessment. I need to check your abdomen, listen to your bowel sounds, and get a better idea of what we’re dealing with. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Lie down? Now? Look, doc, I appreciate you tryin’, but… I’m not really one for bein’ poked and prodded. Seems… unnecessary, doesn’t it? I mean, I told you what’s goin’ on. Bleedin’, dark color, comes and goes. What more do you need to know? Can't you just prescribe somethin’ to stop it? Some kind of… pill? I’ve got things to do, you know. And frankly, this whole process is makin’ me nervous. I’m not a fan of hospitals or doctors, never have been. My wife always handled this stuff. She knew what to do. This is just… stressful. Surely you can understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with all due respect, I am a medical professional. I need to perform an examination to determine the cause of your bleeding. “Just prescribing something” is irresponsible and potentially dangerous. A proper diagnosis is crucial. Are you refusing a physical examination?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I didn’t come here to be lectured. I came here for help, not a guilt trip. And frankly, I don’t appreciate your tone. I’m a grown man, and I can make my own decisions about my body. If I say I don’t want to be poked and prodded, then that’s my prerogative. You want me to leave? Fine. I can go somewhere else. Somewhere where the doctor understands that a patient’s comfort is just as important as… whatever it is you think is important. Honestly, I’ve dealt with enough stress lately without… this. So yes. I’m refusing. Now, can we talk about somethin' that doesn’t involve layin’ down on a cold table? Is there a pill you can prescribe? Something for the bleedin’? That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I understand your reluctance. However, I strongly advise against self-treating without a diagnosis. Given your refusal of a physical exam, and without further investigation, I am limited in what I can do. I can offer a referral to a gastroenterologist. They can perform an endoscopy to determine the cause of the bleeding. But I need to be clear: without a proper assessment, we can’t rule out serious conditions. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An… endoscopy? What's that, some kind of fancy camera they stick down your throat? Look, doc, that sounds… unpleasant. And expensive. Frankly, I’m not exactly flush with cash. My wife… well, she handled all the insurance stuff too. I’m not even sure I have insurance anymore. This is just gettin’ worse and worse. A referral... so you're basically sayin’ you can’t help me? That I gotta go somewhere else and pay a fortune to have a camera stuck down my throat? That’s just… wonderful. Honestly, doc, this is why I avoid doctors. It’s always somethin’. Always a cost, always a procedure, always somethin’ complicated. Fine. A referral. What’s the name of this… gastroenterologist? But don't expect me to thank you. This whole thing is just… a mess. A complete and utter mess.
DOCTOR: Dr. Evelyn Reed. Her office is located in the city. The cost will depend on your insurance coverage, or lack thereof. They do offer a payment plan. Here’s her contact information. I’m documenting your refusal of a physical exam, and my recommendation for an endoscopy. I strongly urge you to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Continued bleeding can lead to anemia and other complications. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. Just… a waste of time, really. Another doctor, another bill, another procedure. Honestly, doc, I’m not optimistic. But… thank you. I guess. Though I’m not sure what I’m thanking you for. For telling me I need to go see another doctor and pay a fortune? Never mind. It's fine. I'll… I'll figure somethin’ out. Just… don't expect a thank you card. And… goodbye.
