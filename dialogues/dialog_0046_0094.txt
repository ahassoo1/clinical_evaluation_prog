DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Good morning. I… think I need to learn some things. My husband, he says so. About… stuff. I work with metal. Lots of noise, you know? It’s… important work.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're coming in to discuss some potential health concerns related to your work environment. That's very proactive of you and your husband. “Learning some things” is a great way to put it. To help me understand, could you tell me a bit more about the type of metal you work with and what your typical workday looks like?
PATIENT: Metal… it’s… shiny. Steel, mostly. And… aluminum, sometimes. Work? Loud. Very loud. Cutting, bending… lots of sparks. I wear… ear things. But they don’t… stop it all, I think. Long days. Very long. My hands… they hurt sometimes too. But work is work. It pays the bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so steel and aluminum, primarily, with cutting, bending, and sparks. You mentioned ear protection, but it doesn’t completely block the noise, and you work long days. And you've been experiencing some hand pain. To get a clearer picture, let’s start with the noise. When did you first notice it becoming a concern?
PATIENT: Concern? Hmm. I don’t know. It’s always been loud. Maybe… longer ago than I remember. My husband says I don’t listen to him when he talks. He says it’s because of the noise. Maybe… a few years? I don’t keep track of things like that. It just… is.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It's easy to become accustomed to constant noise. So, a few years of exposure, and your husband has noticed some difficulty with your hearing at home. That’s a good observation on his part. To clarify, are you noticing any changes in your ability to hear, besides what your husband has said?
PATIENT: Changes…? I… sometimes ask him to repeat things. But I always have. I think. It’s… hard to say. Everything sounds… muffled, maybe? Like there's cotton in my ears. But that could just be… the ear things. They aren’t very comfortable. I don’t like wearing them, but work says I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some difficulty hearing, and a sensation of muffled sound, possibly related to the ear protection. It’s good you’re identifying those things. Let’s talk about your hands for a moment. You mentioned they hurt sometimes. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… achy. Like after a long day of gardening, you know? But I don't have a garden. It’s in my wrists mostly. And my fingers. Sometimes they… tingle. Like little pins and needles. It’s worse when it’s cold. And after work, always. Makes it hard to… hold things.
DOCTOR: Okay, achy pain in your wrists and fingers, tingling sensations, worse in the cold and after work, making it difficult to hold things. That sounds concerning. To get a better understanding, have you noticed any swelling, redness, or stiffness in your hands or wrists?
PATIENT: Swelling…? I don't think so. They feel bigger sometimes, maybe. But I don't know if that's just… tired. Redness? No. And stiff… not really. Just… sore. Very sore. Like someone hit them with a hammer. But a little hammer. Not a big one. I can still work, you know. I have to work.
DOCTOR: I understand that work is a priority. It's good you're able to continue working, but it’s important to address this pain now to prevent it from getting worse. Okay, so no redness or stiffness, just soreness and a feeling of being bigger after work. To get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history…? Oh dear. I… don’t really go to the doctor. Not much. Husband makes me, sometimes. I think I had… the flu, once? A long time ago. And… a broken arm when I was little. Fell out of a tree. That’s all I can remember. I don’t think I have anything… serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known significant medical history besides the flu and a broken arm as a child. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? I don’t think so. I eat everything. My husband always complains I eat too much. He says I shouldn’t eat so much spicy food, but… I like spicy food. I haven’t ever had a… reaction to anything. Not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're not currently taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: Medications…? No. Nothing. I take… tea. Sometimes. For my stomach. But that’s not a medication, is it? It’s just… tea. Husband says I shouldn’t drink so much tea, but… it helps.
DOCTOR: Tea doesn’t count as a medication. No prescribed or over-the-counter medications. That’s good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your ears, hands, and wrists, and listen to your lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Huh. Exam…? Oh. Okay. Whatever you need to do. My ears? They probably aren’t very good. And my hands… they’re just work hands. You’ll probably think they’re awful. But… go ahead. Do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I won't judge. This is simply to help me understand what's going on. First, let’s check your ears. Okay, I see some mild redness in both ear canals. Your eardrums look intact, but there's some wax buildup. This could contribute to the muffled sound you’re experiencing. Now, let's take a look at your hands. I notice some tenderness in both wrists, particularly on the palm side. There's no visible swelling or redness, but you do have some calluses consistent with manual labor. Range of motion is slightly limited in both wrists. Lastly, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound clear. Okay, that completes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Okay… sounds… not good? My ears are red? And my wrists… tender? I told you I work hard. It’s supposed to be tender. So… what does that mean? Am I… sick?
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean you're "sick," Airam. The redness in your ears is likely from irritation, possibly from the ear protection or from working in a noisy environment. The tenderness in your wrists is consistent with repetitive strain from your work. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, I suspect you may be experiencing a combination of noise-induced hearing loss and carpal tunnel syndrome, or at least symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. However, to confirm this, I'd like to order a few tests. I want to get a baseline hearing test to assess the extent of any hearing loss. And I'd also like to order nerve conduction studies for your wrists, which can help determine if there's compression of the nerves in your carpal tunnel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests…? Oh dear. More things. I don't like tests. Hearing test… I knew my ears weren't good. And… nerve things? What does that even mean? Compression…? Like… squeezing? I don’t want my wrists squeezed. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Airam. I understand your anxiety. Let me explain. The hearing test is very simple. You'll just wear headphones and listen for sounds at different volumes. It doesn’t hurt at all. It just helps us measure how well you’re hearing. The nerve conduction study… it's a little more involved, but it’s still not usually painful. It involves placing small electrodes on your skin to measure the electrical activity in your nerves. You might feel a slight tingling sensation, like a mild static shock, but it’s very brief and shouldn’t be uncomfortable. “Compression” means the nerve in your wrist is being squeezed, which can cause the pain and tingling you're experiencing. The test will help us determine if that's happening. We need to get these tests done to understand exactly what’s going on and what the best course of treatment is. Would you be comfortable with scheduling those?
PATIENT: Oh. Sounds… scary. Electrodes? Squeezing? But… if you think it's important. Husband always says I should listen to the doctor. He’s probably right. I don’t want my wrists getting worse. Okay. Fine. Schedule the tests. But… will it take a long time? I have work, you know. And… who will pay for it? I don’t have much money.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you, Airam. We'll take things one step at a time. The tests shouldn't take too long. The hearing test will take about 30-45 minutes, and the nerve conduction study will take about an hour. I'll write you a referral to a clinic nearby that specializes in these tests. They'll work with you to schedule an appointment that fits your work schedule. As for the cost… I understand your concern. I’m going to have my assistant reach out to you after this appointment to discuss financial assistance options. There are programs available that can help cover the cost of these tests for patients who are uninsured. We’ll do everything we can to make it affordable. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend avoiding activities that aggravate your wrist pain as much as possible. And I’d also like you to consider wearing wrist braces while you work to provide support and reduce compression. Would you like me to write you a prescription for those?
PATIENT: Braces…? Wrist braces? Okay. That sounds… good. If it helps. Maybe it will stop the tingling. Financial assistance… that would be good. Very good. Husband will be happy. He worries about money. And… is there anything else? Anything I should be doing? Besides not hitting things and wearing… braces?
DOCTOR: Yes, there are a few other things. While we wait for the test results, I recommend trying some gentle hand exercises to maintain your range of motion. I can give you a handout with some simple exercises to do at home. Also, if possible, try to take frequent breaks during your workday to stretch your hands and wrists. And avoid gripping or lifting heavy objects as much as possible. Finally, and this is very important, if you're exposed to loud noises at work, continue to wear ear protection. It's crucial to protect your hearing from further damage. I’m also going to write you a referral to an occupational therapist. They can teach you proper techniques for lifting and gripping to minimize strain on your wrists. They're very helpful in managing conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Occupational… what? Sounds like… more appointments. But… okay. If it helps. I guess. Will the tingling… go away? That’s what I really want to know. Will it stop? I don't want my hands… getting worse.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Airam. Whether the tingling will go away depends on the severity of the nerve compression and how quickly we address it. With proper treatment, which may include wrist braces, occupational therapy, and avoiding activities that aggravate your symptoms, many patients experience significant improvement in their tingling. In some cases, the tingling may even disappear completely. However, if the nerve compression is severe or left untreated for too long, it may become more difficult to reverse the damage. That's why it's so important to get these tests done and start treatment as soon as possible. I understand your concern about your hands getting worse, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to help you manage your symptoms and prevent further damage. We'll work together to find the best course of treatment for you. To recap, I'm writing you referrals for a hearing test, nerve conduction studies, and occupational therapy. My assistant will contact you to discuss financial assistance options and schedule the appointments. And I'm writing you a prescription for wrist braces. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. So many appointments. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I guess. Hopefully… it will help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Airam. It was nice meeting you. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. My assistant will be in touch shortly to help you with scheduling and financial assistance. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss your test results. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. Bye.
