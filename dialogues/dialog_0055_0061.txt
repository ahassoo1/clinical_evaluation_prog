DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, my… my son, he signed me up. Said I gotta get checked out. Something about… a tryout? For… sports? I don't really remember all the details. Old age, you know? He said it was important.
DOCTOR: A tryout, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. A tryout. For… a team? He said something about… being an athlete. Me, an athlete! Haven’t been one of those in… a long, long time. My knees ain't what they used to be, that’s for sure. What kinda checkup is this, exactly? I'm a little lost.
DOCTOR: It appears your son has scheduled a comprehensive physical examination, likely to assess your overall health and suitability for… physical activity. We’ll go through a standard review of your medical history, current symptoms, and a physical exam. It’s quite routine, Mr. Murph. Let’s begin with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. That's a lot of words. Let me think… I think… I think the doctor, back home, said something about my blood pressure being a little high once. But it was a long time ago. And… and I got a bad back, always have. Old work injury. But nothing serious, you know? Just… aches. Arthritis… maybe? My wife says I got it, but I don't really pay attention to those things. It just hurts sometimes. Does that make sense? I forget things easy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that provides some information. “A little high” blood pressure is concerning, even if it was some time ago. We will need to verify that. And the back pain… for how long have you been experiencing that, Mr. Murph?
PATIENT: Oh, the back… forever, I think. Since I was a young man, working on the docks. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s bad, sometimes it’s just… there. Not a sharp pain, mostly a dull ache. I take some pills for it now and then, but they don't always help. Is that bad? Should I not be doing this tryout thing?
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say definitively without a proper assessment, Mr. Murph. Chronic back pain certainly warrants further investigation. We'll need to determine the nature and severity of your condition. Now, let’s move on to your medications. You mentioned taking pills for your back. Can you tell me the name of those medications, and how often you take them?
PATIENT: Oh, the pills… Let me see… My wife handles all that. She’s got a little box, with all my stuff. I just take what she gives me. They're little white ones, and some yellow ones, too. I think… two white in the morning, and one yellow at night? But sometimes she changes it up. I really don't pay attention to the names, Doctor. Sorry. She’s very organized, my wife, but I'm… well, you see. Old age.
DOCTOR: I see. This is… less than ideal, Mr. Murph. It’s crucial to know exactly what medications you’re taking, to avoid potentially harmful interactions or adverse effects. We will need to obtain a complete medication list from your wife, if possible. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that happens with the sun, mostly. My wife says I'm sensitive to… shellfish, maybe? I don't eat much of that anyway. I don’t remember ever having a bad reaction to anything, if that helps. Just a little itchy sometimes. I don't really pay attention to those things. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Murph. Allergic reactions can range from mild discomfort to life-threatening emergencies. Knowing your allergies is vital for your safety. Alright. Let's shift focus. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing baseball. They put a cast on it, I remember that. And… and I had my tonsils out when I was young. That was a long time ago. I think… I think I was in the hospital once when my wife had our son. But that was just for a few days. Does that count? I get my dates mixed up sometimes. It's all a blur, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. A history of surgery, even if in the distant past, is important information. Now, tell me about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father, he had a bad heart. I think he died of a heart attack when I was still young. And my mother… she had a little trouble with her sugar, I think. Maybe diabetes? My wife tells me all this stuff, but I forget it quick. And my sister, she had… cancer, I think. A long time ago. But that was on her… her lungs, I think. Lots of bad things in my family, it seems. Is this gonna be bad? I don't want to worry my wife.
DOCTOR: A family history of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer is certainly something we need to consider, Mr. Murph. It doesn't necessarily mean you will develop these conditions, but it increases your risk. We'll discuss preventative measures. Now, before we proceed to a physical examination, let me ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife wouldn't allow it! And I… I like a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just one, maybe two. Nothing crazy. And… no, no drugs! I’m an old man, Doctor. I just like to watch my shows and spend time with my wife. That's all. Am I doing okay so far? You're not mad at me for forgetting things, are you?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Murph, I am not “mad” at you. However, it is important to be thorough, regardless of memory lapses. Alright. Let us proceed with a brief physical examination. I will listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and assess your reflexes. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. It's been a long time since I’ve been on one of these things. Careful now, my back isn't what it used to be. Just let me know if it's gonna hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Just relax. I am listening to your heart now. Hmm. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I detect a slight murmur. This requires further investigation. Now, I will listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Your breathing sounds a little wheezy. Do you experience any shortness of breath or coughing?
PATIENT: A little wheezy, you say? I do get a little cough sometimes, especially in the mornings. And… and when I walk up the stairs, I get a little short of breath. But I thought that was just… old age! Is that bad? Is something wrong with my lungs? My wife always tells me to stay inside when it’s cold, says I catch a cold easy. It feels a little tight sometimes, like someone’s sitting on my chest.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated – 150/90. As I mentioned previously, a history of even slightly elevated blood pressure warrants concern. Your reflexes are a little diminished. That could be due to a number of factors. Mr. Murph, based on my brief examination, your heart and lungs require further evaluation. I recommend a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram – EKG – to assess your cardiac function. Additionally, we need to get a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to evaluate your overall health. We'll need to schedule those tests as soon as possible. And it’s imperative that you inform your wife of these findings. I also strongly advise against participating in any strenuous physical activity – this “tryout” – until we have a clearer understanding of your condition. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? An… electrocardiogram? All that sounds… scary, Doctor. And no tryout? My son will be so disappointed. He said it was a big opportunity. But… if it’s bad, I don't want to do anything that's gonna hurt me. Okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. We’ll… we’ll tell my wife. She’s very good at making appointments. I guess… I guess I’m not an athlete anymore.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Murph. I will have my nurse schedule those tests for you immediately. She will also provide you with a list of instructions regarding preparation for the tests. I will review the results with you as soon as they are available. Until then, please rest and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any further questions?
