DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Bonck. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 21 years of age. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor... Paraskevopoulos, right? Um... well, I just moved here. I got married and moved with my husband. It's, like, a new start, you know? This place... the clinic... it's for, like, checking up on things? I have Medicare, so I figured I should come in and see what I need to do. I don’t really remember what they told me to do when I signed up.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Bonck, that is correct. This is for checking up on things. A comprehensive wellness exam is always a good starting point, especially with a change in location and insurance. It's prudent to establish a baseline. But before we delve into that, is there anything specific that prompted you to schedule this appointment today?
PATIENT: Specific…? Hmm. Not really? I feel okay, I guess. A little tired sometimes, but… that's just life, right? I don't hurt anywhere. My husband said I should just get checked out, make sure everything's good. He worries a lot. I don't think there's anything wrong wrong, if that makes sense. I just… wanted to get it over with, you know? Get it on the books and be done.
DOCTOR: “Just tired” can be remarkably vague, Ms. Bonck. While I appreciate your husband’s concern—responsible partners are to be commended—it’s my professional obligation to ascertain the source of that fatigue. It could be a multitude of factors, some quite trivial, others… less so. To properly assess this, let’s begin with a review of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I don't really remember much about that stuff. I was pretty young, I think. When I was little, I was sick a lot, but it was just… normal kid things? Like colds and stuff. Nothing big. I broke my arm once, climbing a tree, but that was a long time ago. They fixed it, though. I don't think I've been to the hospital since… maybe? It’s all kind of blurry. I don’t really have a doctor back where I used to live, not one I saw regularly.
DOCTOR: I see. A rather incomplete history, unfortunately. It’s not uncommon, but it does complicate matters. Very well. Did you undergo any surgical procedures besides the fracture repair?
PATIENT: Surgical…? Hmm… I… I don’t think so? Like, not that I remember. Maybe they did something when I broke my arm, but I was really little, so I don’t know. They put a cast on it, I remember that. It was bright blue! But… no other surgeries, I don't think. I haven’t had anything… taken out or put in, or anything like that. I think. It's hard to keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Let's move on to your family history, then. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Um… my mom… she passed away a few years ago. And my dad… he lives pretty far away. I haven't seen him in a while. He's okay, I think. He’s… old. But he’s pretty healthy for his age, I guess. He always said he had a strong constitution. I don’t really know much about his health problems, though. We didn't talk about stuff like that much. He was more of a… quiet type.
DOCTOR: I understand. And did your mother suffer from any significant medical conditions – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh… um… She… she had problems with her breathing. Like, she would get really tired and cough a lot. She went to the doctor a lot for it. I think it was her lungs, or something? She used to smoke, a long time ago. She quit, but… I think it messed things up anyway. I don't really know the name of what she had, though. It was just… she had trouble breathing, and she got tired a lot. It's sad thinking about it. She was always really warm and nice.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Bonck, let's discuss your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Not me. I don't smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. And no drugs, definitely not. I don’t like that stuff. My husband doesn’t either. We’re pretty healthy, I think. We eat okay, mostly. And we try to walk when we can. It's just... sometimes I'm really tired, you know? Even when I've slept a good night.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Um… just a multivitamin sometimes. You know, one of those everyday ones. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, if I get one. But that's it. Nothing else. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. My husband takes some stuff for his blood pressure, but that’s his thing. I don't really worry about stuff like that, I just... try to feel okay. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Bonck, I’d like to proceed with a physical examination. This will allow me to assess your overall health and identify any potential areas of concern. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, okay. Sure. That sounds… good. Whatever you need to do. I guess. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do later. But, yeah. Go ahead. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the examination table. We will begin with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and temperature. Then, I will listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and perform a neurological assessment. Please undress down to your undergarments, and I will provide a gown for modesty.
PATIENT: Okay… um… undress… down to my undergarments…? Oh. Right. Okay. I'll… be right back. I guess.
DOCTOR: Please lie back, Ms. Bonck. We will begin with auscultation of your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is slightly elevated at 88 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though there is mild diminished breath sound at the bases. No wheezes or crackles noted. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and cranial nerves are grossly intact. No focal neurological deficits noted. Your blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, and your temperature is 98.6°F orally. Overall, your physical examination is unremarkable, aside from the mild diminished breath sound at the bases and slightly elevated heart rate. Given your reported fatigue and history of a mother with respiratory issues, I recommend a chest X-ray to evaluate for any underlying pulmonary pathology and a complete blood count to assess for anemia or other hematological abnormalities. Would you be amenable to those tests?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds like a lot of tests. A chest X-ray…? Is something wrong? I just… feel tired, like I said. I don’t know… Is it serious? My husband’s gonna worry. I guess… if you think it’s important. But… what are we looking for, exactly? And will it take long? I have… appointments. And things to do. I just want to be okay, you know? Is it expensive? I don't want to rack up a huge bill.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, it’s understandable to be concerned about additional testing. However, these tests are a prudent step in evaluating the cause of your fatigue and ruling out any potential underlying medical conditions. A chest X-ray is a non-invasive imaging study that allows us to visualize your lungs and heart, detecting any abnormalities such as pneumonia, bronchitis, or other respiratory issues. Given your mother’s history, it is particularly important to assess your pulmonary function. The complete blood count is a simple blood test that measures the different components of your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can help identify anemia, infection, or other hematological disorders. These tests are relatively quick and inexpensive, covered by Medicare with a standard co-pay. I assure you, we are not embarking on a complex investigation, merely gathering baseline data to ensure your well-being. Would you like me to order these tests for you now?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah. Okay. Fine. Order them. Just… please tell me if anything’s wrong. I don't want any surprises. And… how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. I really need to know if I’m okay. And… where do I go to get them done? And will I need an appointment? I hate making appointments. It's so… stressful. And what if they find something bad? Will you be here to explain it to me? My husband is working a lot right now, so I'm kinda on my own for this.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Bonck. I will order the chest X-ray and complete blood count now. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to return. The radiology department is located within the same building, on the third floor, room 312. You will need to schedule an appointment, which can be done by calling 555-1234. They do require an appointment to ensure efficient workflow. Regarding your concerns about potential findings, rest assured that I will be here to thoroughly explain any results to you. If any abnormalities are detected, we will discuss them in detail and formulate a plan of action. If necessary, I will refer you to a specialist for further evaluation. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, getting adequate sleep, and avoiding strenuous activity. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that’s all. Just… please call me if anything’s wrong. Don’t just… send me a letter. I want to talk to you. And… thank you. For explaining everything. It’s just… a lot to take in. I guess I'll go make that appointment now. 555-1234, right? I hope they don't make me wait too long. I have… things to do. And… if I feel really bad before the appointment, what should I do? Should I go to the emergency room? My husband says I overreact sometimes. I don’t want to bother anyone if it's nothing. .
DOCTOR: Yes, 555-1234. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – fever, significant shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness – please do not hesitate to contact the clinic immediately, or proceed to the nearest emergency room. It is always better to err on the side of caution. I will personally review your results as soon as they are available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Please do not hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Bonck.
