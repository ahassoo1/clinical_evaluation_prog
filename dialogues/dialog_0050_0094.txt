DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 33 years of age. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Thirty-three. I… work with metal. Sheets of it. My husband said I should come. He thinks… I need to know things. About… being healthy, I guess. I don't really remember why exactly. Just… metal work. It’s hard on the body, maybe?
DOCTOR: “Metal work,” you say. And your husband is concerned about the impact on your health. That’s… thoughtful of him. Could you elaborate on what sort of metal work you do, and for how long have you been doing it?
PATIENT: Ugh. He worries too much. It’s just… cutting and bending. And sometimes… lifting. Big sheets. I don't know… ten years? More? It’s… always been a job. Not a fancy job. Just… metal. I don't know what you want me to say? It’s metal work.
DOCTOR: I understand it's a straightforward occupation, Ms. Fontanazza. However, repetitive motions, heavy lifting, and exposure to metal particles can lead to a number of health concerns. To properly assess your situation, I need a more detailed history. Let's start with any pain you might be experiencing. Do you have any discomfort anywhere—your back, shoulders, wrists, hands, elbows?
PATIENT: Pain? Well… sometimes my back aches. After a long day. And… my hands. They get… stiff. Not all the time. It’s just… work. Everyone gets stiff hands. It’s not… important pain. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: “Not important pain,” as you put it, is still worth investigating, Ms. Fontanazza. Ignoring discomfort can lead to more significant issues down the line. Now, regarding your back – is this a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. It's… a dull ache. Mostly in my lower back. Like… something is tired. And sometimes… it feels like it’s hard to… stand up straight. But I just… push through it. I have to. It's metal, you know? You wouldn’t understand.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Fontanazza, I understand the demands of physical labor. It’s quite common for individuals in your line of work to experience lower back pain. Now, let's move on to your hands. You mentioned stiffness. Is this stiffness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Worse when it’s cold. Or after I’ve been… cutting a lot. Like… when I have to force the scissors through thick metal. Then they really hurt. And… sometimes they tingle. A little. Not all the time, though. Honestly, I just… wrap them in tape. It helps a little.
DOCTOR: “Wrap them in tape.” Right. Well, that is… resourceful. The tingling is of particular interest. Could you describe the tingling more specifically?
PATIENT: Ugh. It’s just… like pins and needles. In my fingers. Not… all of them. Just… sometimes the little finger. And the ring finger. It doesn’t last long. Just a few seconds. Then it goes away. I don’t know why you need to know so much about my fingers. It’s just… tingling. Is this going to be a long visit? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: The tingling, Ms. Fontanazza, could indicate nerve compression, which is not uncommon with repetitive hand motions. To rule out anything serious, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I will need to check your range of motion, strength, and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just… don’t make me do anything… silly. I have work to do. Metal doesn't bend itself, you know? Hurry it up.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. We will begin with your back. I’d like you to lie flat on your stomach, if you don’t mind. I’ll be palpating your spine and assessing your range of motion.
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But if it hurts, I'm stopping. Metal doesn't wait for anyone, you know? And my husband will be mad if I'm out too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. Just relax as best you can. I’m simply feeling for any areas of tenderness or muscle spasm. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ugh. Yes! That's… a little tender. Right there. Not bad bad, but… yeah. It feels… stiff. Like a knot. See? I told you it hurt. Metal work is hard on the body, you know? You wouldn't understand.
DOCTOR: I see. And is there any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No. No pain in my legs. Just… my back. Like a knot. A tired knot. Are you almost done? I feel… silly lying here. Metal doesn’t bend itself, you know? And I'm wasting time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, please turn over and extend your arms. I’m going to assess the range of motion in your wrists and hands. Any pain or discomfort with these movements?
PATIENT: Ugh. Yes! A little. When you bend it that way. Like… when I'm cutting. It’s… sharp. Not bad sharp, but… yeah. And… tingling. It starts tingling when you do that. See? Metal work. It’s hard on your hands. You wouldn't understand.
DOCTOR: I see. And could you open and close your hands for me, as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Ugh. Like this? It’s… hard. Like… stiff. And the tingling is getting worse. Can I stop now? Metal doesn’t bend itself, you know? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. That will be sufficient for now. Based on your description and the brief examination, it appears you are experiencing symptoms consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, possibly exacerbated by the repetitive motions of your occupation. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I recommend a nerve conduction study. Have you ever had one before?
PATIENT: A nerve… what? No. Never. What is a nerve… conduction… thing? Sounds… scary. And expensive. Is it important? Metal doesn't wait for anyone, you know?
DOCTOR: A nerve conduction study is a non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity of your nerves. It will help determine if there is compression on the median nerve in your wrist, which is the likely cause of your symptoms. It's not particularly painful—you may feel a slight tingling sensation—and it's the most accurate way to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome. As for the cost… unfortunately, it is not inexpensive. However, I can provide you with a referral to a specialist who can discuss payment options. I understand your concerns about time and finances. However, if left untreated, carpal tunnel syndrome can worsen, leading to permanent nerve damage and loss of hand function. It is, in my professional opinion, important. Would you like me to provide you with that referral?
PATIENT: Ugh. Permanent… nerve damage? My husband… he does a lot of the heavy lifting. But I do the… precision work. I need my hands. Okay. Fine. A referral. But… is it going to take long? And can I still work while… getting this thing done? Metal doesn’t bend itself, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will provide you with a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a specialist in hand and wrist disorders. Her office is located in the neighboring town, and she is well-regarded. As for your work, Dr. Vance will be able to advise you on whether you can continue your current occupation during the evaluation and treatment process. It's possible she may recommend temporary modifications to your work activities, such as wearing wrist splints or taking frequent breaks. Here is the referral information. I also suggest discussing this with your husband, as he may need to assist with some of the heavier tasks if you are advised to modify your work activities. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Ugh. Wrist… splints? Okay. Fine. I'll… talk to my husband. But if it means I can’t work… No. No more questions. I just want to go home. And back to work. Metal doesn’t bend itself, you know? Thank you, I guess. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fontanazza. I trust you will consult with Dr. Vance promptly. Should your symptoms worsen, do not hesitate to seek medical attention. Good day. .
