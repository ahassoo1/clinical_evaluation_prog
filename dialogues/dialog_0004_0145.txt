DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lonell Bahta, as you know. I am here, if I understand correctly, to discuss…home care? My daughter scheduled this appointment. She believes I may be eligible for assistance. I am not entirely sure what that entails, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Home care. Yes, your daughter indicated some concern. Well, let’s clarify. To determine if you are eligible, and what kind of assistance might be beneficial, I’ll need to understand your current situation a bit better. You said you’re not sure what it entails… alright. Let's start with this: are you having any difficulties with daily activities?
PATIENT: Difficulties…yes. A few. It is becoming…challenging to manage everything myself. Especially the cooking, and keeping the house tidy. I live alone, you see. My wife…she passed some years ago, and my daughter lives some distance away. I try to maintain my independence, but it is…wearing. Though, I assure you, my mind is still quite sharp. I remember everything perfectly.
DOCTOR: It’s admirable that you’re striving to maintain your independence, Mr. Bahta. And it’s perfectly normal to need a little assistance as we get older – or after a loss, like you’ve experienced. It takes courage to acknowledge that. You mentioned cooking and housekeeping… are there any other activities you’re finding difficult?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The gardening, definitely. It used to be a great pleasure, but bending and kneeling…it is painful now. And the stairs. My house has two flights, and I find myself…hesitant to use them. I manage, of course, but it is slow. And I worry about falling. I have not fallen yet, but the thought is…unsettling. Also, I confess, keeping track of my medications is becoming a small ordeal.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gardening, stairs, medication management… This is helpful. Now, let’s go through a bit more detail. When did you start noticing these difficulties with the stairs and gardening specifically?
PATIENT: That is a good question. It was…gradual. Perhaps six months ago, I began noticing the stairs were more tiresome. I would get winded quite easily. The gardening… around the same time, I believe. The knees began to ache. At first, I attributed it to simply being out of shape, but it did not improve with exercise. It has been…a slow decline, if you will. I have not spoken to another doctor about this specifically, if that is relevant.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Mr. Bahta, thank you for clarifying. A gradual onset is important information. And no, you haven’t discussed this with another physician, understood. Now, regarding the medication—can you tell me which medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… I have a list here, thankfully. There is… Lisinopril, for my blood pressure. And Atorvastatin, for cholesterol. Also, Metformin, for a touch of… sugar imbalance, my daughter says. And lastly, a small dose of Vitamin D, as the doctor prescribed after a blood test last year. I take them all orally, each morning with breakfast. I believe those are all of them. I am quite diligent about taking them, but remembering which ones, and ensuring I have enough…that is the challenge.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril, Atorvastatin, Metformin, Vitamin D. That’s a fairly standard regimen. And I see a recent Vitamin D level checked – good. Now, let's move on to a quick review of your overall health. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me recall. I had my appendix removed as a young man, many years ago. And I broke my wrist once, playing football, but it healed completely. Otherwise… nothing significant. I have always been quite healthy, actually. A touch of the flu occasionally, but nothing that required hospitalization. I do have a… sensitivity to shellfish, if that is of note. My daughter is very careful about that when she cooks for me.
DOCTOR: Appendix removed, broken wrist, shellfish allergy – noted. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That is a good question. My mother…she suffered from arthritis in her later years. Quite severely, actually. And my father had…heart trouble, I believe. He passed away at a relatively young age, from a heart attack. My sister… she is still alive, thankfully, but she has been diagnosed with diabetes. It seems to run in the family, unfortunately. And my wife…she had high blood pressure, similar to myself. I believe those are the most significant instances.
DOCTOR: Alright. Arthritis, heart trouble, diabetes, hypertension in the family. Thank you. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I have never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that is all. And recreational drugs…that is entirely out of the question. I always prided myself on a clean and healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. It is important to maintain one’s well-being, you see. Even at my age.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Bahta. Very good. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Just a quick check of your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a brief assessment of your strength and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That is perfectly acceptable. I understand the necessity of a physical examination. Please, proceed when you are ready. I will cooperate fully. I trust your professional judgment, naturally. I do hope it will not be too… cumbersome.
DOCTOR: It won’t be at all. Just a standard assessment. Please have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Reflexes are a bit diminished in your knees and ankles, but still present. Now, if you don’t mind, could you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Here we are. . As you see, I am able to walk without assistance. Though, admittedly, it is not as brisk as it once was. I am rather careful about maintaining my balance, naturally. I do not wish to… stumble. It is a bit unnerving, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are walking steadily, but I notice a slight hesitancy, and a wider base of support than I would expect. Now, if you don't mind, could you try standing on one leg for about ten seconds?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Ah. There we are. It is… challenging. I am not as steady as I once was, admittedly. My balance is not what it used to be. It is rather… disconcerting. I believe I will sit down now, if you do not mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, I observed that. Your balance is slightly impaired. And you appear to have some mild weakness in your lower extremities. Now, based on your history and this brief physical examination, I suspect you may be experiencing a combination of factors contributing to your difficulties. It’s likely a combination of age-related changes, some mild muscle weakness, and possibly some early signs of neuropathy – nerve damage, which can affect balance and sensation. The slight hesitancy in your gait and the diminished reflexes support this. However, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests and potentially a vitamin B12 level. I’d also recommend a referral to a physical therapist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your strength, balance, and gait, and to develop a personalized exercise program. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds entirely reasonable. Blood tests and a physical therapist… I concur. A more thorough evaluation is undoubtedly necessary. I am quite relieved that you are taking this seriously. I have been concerned about this decline for some time, and it is reassuring to have a professional opinion. To be frank, I was rather afraid it was something more… serious. So, please, proceed with the tests and the referral. I will cooperate fully. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your… understanding. It is a comfort to know that I am in capable hands.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I’m glad I could reassure you. I’m not dismissing the possibility of something more serious, but these initial tests will help us rule out any immediate concerns. Alright, I’ve ordered the blood work. You can get that done at the lab across the street. They should be able to fit you in today. I’ll also have my nurse prepare a referral for physical therapy. She’ll give you a list of therapists in the area who accept your insurance. I want you to schedule that appointment as soon as possible. In the meantime, be careful with your movements, avoid any strenuous activity, and if you experience any sudden weakness, numbness, or difficulty walking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have covered everything quite thoroughly. Blood tests and physical therapy…emergency room if necessary. I understand. Thank you again for your time and your… patience. You have been most helpful. I shall proceed with the blood tests as soon as possible and schedule the physical therapy appointment. I do not anticipate any… emergencies, but it is reassuring to know what to do should one arise. I appreciate your… foresight. Perhaps one final question, if I may. Approximately how long will it take to receive the results of the blood tests?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about 24 to 48 hours to return results. My nurse will contact you directly to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. We’ll discuss the findings then and tailor a plan based on the results. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is perfectly acceptable. 24 to 48 hours… I will await my nurse’s call. You have answered all of my questions and addressed my concerns. I am quite grateful for your time and attention. Thank you again, Doctor Deschane. I wish you a pleasant day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bahta. Take care, and don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
