DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Croonquist. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. Medicare sent something about needing it done. Honestly, I don't really remember what for. It’s all a bit of a blur these days. Can we just… get it over with? No offense.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Mr. Croonquist. It's perfectly alright if things are a little fuzzy. Medicare does send out a lot of reminders. Let me pull up your information here… Ah, yes. It looks like you're due for your annual wellness check, including some routine blood work. It helps us keep an eye on things – cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, that sort of thing. Do you have any specific concerns today that made you want to come in?
PATIENT: Concerns? Not really. I feel… okay, I guess. Old, mostly. Everything aches a bit, but that's just… being my age, right? I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Honestly, I just want to make sure I’m still… functional. Is that weird? Just… not falling apart.
DOCTOR: Not weird at all, Mr. Croonquist. Perfectly understandable. "Functional" is a great goal! And aches and pains are common with age, but we still want to make sure there isn't anything more going on. It’s good you came in. Before we do the blood work, let me just ask a few quick questions – just to get a better picture of things. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Major… illnesses? Hmm. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. A long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, falling off a… something. A roof, maybe? It was in… Afghanistan, I think. Before… before everything. Honestly, it's all very hazy. I don’t really recall much detail.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils and a broken arm…that’s helpful. And you mentioned Afghanistan. Was that where you grew up?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Kabul. A long time ago. A very different place then. I… I don't like to talk about it much. It’s… complicated. Can we just skip that part? I really just want to get the blood work done. Are we almost there?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. We can absolutely skip that part. I apologize for bringing it up; I didn’t mean to cause any discomfort. Just a few more quick questions, and then we’ll get right to the blood work. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… allergies? I don't think so. I don't take much these days. Maybe… penicillin? I had a bad reaction to something when I was young, but I can't remember exactly what it was. My mother always handled the pills, and I just… took them.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible penicillin allergy… we’ll definitely make a note of that. And do you currently take any medications at all, even over-the-counter things like aspirin or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my knees sometimes. When they really bother me. It’s… Ibuprofen, I think? The blue pills. I buy them at the drugstore. Nothing else. Honestly, I try to avoid pills as much as possible. They never really seem to do much anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Good to know. Alright, Mr. Croonquist, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at those knees you mentioned. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be quick about it, please? I have… things to do. It’s just… I don't have a lot of energy these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. I'll be as quick and efficient as possible. Okay. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90, but not drastically so. Heart and lungs sound clear. Your knees…there's a bit of swelling and some crepitus when you bend them, which is common with age and wear and tear. Any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: A little. It's a dull ache, mostly. Worse when it's cold or when I’ve been standing for too long. It’s just… annoying. I try to ignore it. Honestly, I'm more concerned about… well, never mind. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like osteoarthritis, which is very common, as I mentioned. We can discuss some ways to manage that pain, if you’d like. Now, just a couple of final questions. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she hated it. Always said it was… foolish.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little wine, sometimes. With dinner. Just a glass. Red wine. It’s… relaxing. Not every night, mind you. Just… when I'm feeling stressed. Which is… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, one glass of red wine occasionally. That’s good information. Okay, Mr. Croonquist, I think that gives me a good overall picture. Now, let's go ahead and get that blood work done. It'll help us rule out anything else that might be going on, and give us a baseline to track your health. The phlebotomist, Sarah, is just down the hall. I’ll review the results when they come back, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Honestly, I'm tired of answering questions. Can we please just go get the blood drawn?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. Absolutely. Let me just print out the lab requisition for you. Sarah is expecting you. She’ll take good care of you. And after that, you’re free to go. If you feel any dizziness or weakness after the blood draw, please let her know right away. I’ll be in touch when the results are back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… tell her I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: I will, absolutely. I’ll let her know. And thank you for coming in today, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll get this all sorted out. Sarah's station is just through that door, on the left. .
