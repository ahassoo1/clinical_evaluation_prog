DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I am Dr. Eaddy. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor. Eaddy, you say? Hmm. Well, I just… moved here. New place, you know? Gotta get the… the healthcare thing sorted. Medicare, they told me to come here. Something about a check-up, I think. Old bones, you know how it is. Not really sick, just… new.
DOCTOR: Yes, quite right. A general check-up is sensible when establishing care, particularly with a change of location. And it's good you're proactive. "Old bones," as you say. We’ll certainly take a look. To begin, could you elaborate on any specific concerns you have?
PATIENT: Concerns? Not really. Everything… works. Mostly. Sometimes my back… aches. But I used to lift a lot of things, heavy things! For… for the shows. Makeup, and lights, and… the ladies. It’s just… old age, I guess. Nothing a little rub can’t fix. Don't bother you with little things, though. You got other patients, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: "Shows," you say?
PATIENT: Ah, yes! The theatre. I was a makeup artist. For very important ladies. Very famous. Not anymore, of course. Too much… standing. And the glitter. Gets everywhere, you know? A terrible mess. But beautiful. Very beautiful. Used to travel all over… hmm, where did I travel? Never mind. Old brain, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, regardless of your previous profession, it’s important to note any pain, even if you attribute it to age or past activities. This back pain—when does it occur?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Mostly when I bend over. Or… after I sit for too long. Like now, maybe. But it's not… bad bad. Just… a reminder. A little creak. You know? Like an old door. It doesn’t stop me from doing things. I still… well, I put on my own face, every day. Gotta look presentable, even if I’m just going to the store.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this back pain been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time. Years, I think. Maybe… since the divorce? Everything started to ache a bit then, to be honest. Back, knees, the head sometimes. It’s hard to say when exactly. Things just… build up, you know? It's not like it happened suddenly. Just… got worse over time. Don't bother with dates, though. I'm terrible with dates.
DOCTOR: Very well. We can proceed without precise dates, though it is helpful for tracking progression. Besides the back and knees, you mentioned occasional headaches. Can you describe these headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches. They’re… annoying. Mostly on the side. And… throbbing. Not like a bad headache, you understand. More like… pressure. From thinking too much, I think. Or… from the weather. This place is very humid, you know? Not like back home. Everything's just… different. It comes and goes. I take a little pill, usually. Aspirin, I think. The white one. Does that make sense? I don't really pay attention.
DOCTOR: “White pill, possibly aspirin, for headaches.” Alright. And do these headaches interfere with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Interfere? No, no. I’m a professional. Always have been. A little headache doesn't stop me. I just… maybe sit down for a bit. Or… drink a cup of tea. But I still get things done. I have to. What else would I do? Don't need to make a big fuss about a little headache. Other people have real problems, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. Now, let's move on to a more comprehensive review. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or sense of taste recently?
PATIENT: Oh, everything's a little… faded, I suppose. The lights are very bright in here. And… things are a little blurry, maybe? I’ve always needed glasses, though. A long time ago. Never bothered getting them fixed. What’s the point? I can still see well enough. As for hearing… well, I’m an old man. Everything sounds a little muffled sometimes. It’s normal. Don’t need to worry about little things, doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any unintentional weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, no. I eat well. Always have. Good food, you know? Especially pastries. Though… maybe I don’t move around as much anymore. It’s… comfortable. A little extra padding. Helps keep you warm. No, no weight loss. Perhaps… a little gain, maybe? But nothing to worry about. Just… living.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements, besides the white pill you mentioned?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Oh, the doctor back home gave me something for… for my water. Said I was a little… swollen. But I stopped taking it. Made me feel… strange. And… sometimes I take a little something for my stomach. It’s… pink. And fizzy. But only when it’s really bothering me. I forget the name. Lots of little pills, you know? Don't really keep track. It's not like I'm sick. Mostly just… old. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Pink, fizzy pill for stomach issues, discontinued medication for 'water' issues - details unclear." Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no. I’m a strong man. Always have been. Never had allergies. Maybe… a little itchy sometimes, when I wear certain fabrics. But that's just the wool. Nothing serious. Don't bother me with little things, doctor. I'm sure you have other patients waiting. I just came for the check-up, remember? New area, Medicare, all that. Not looking for trouble.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Szmyd. I think I have enough information for now. Perhaps a brief physical examination would be prudent, just to get a baseline assessment. We can listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your reflexes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you have to. But don't expect much. Old bones, you know? Everything creaks and groans. And… don't poke and prod too much. I don't like being touched. Just… get it over with quickly, if you don’t mind. I have things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please remove your shoes and socks. I'll start with listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Honestly. All this fuss. Old man's feet, you know. Don’t judge. Get on with it, doctor. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a bit irregular. Some slight murmuring present. I’ll need to document this. Breathing is a little… diminished on the left side. Any history of pneumonia or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Pneumonia? Bronchitis? What do you think I am, a child? No, no. Never had any of that. I was always a strong man. Maybe a little cough sometimes, in the winter. But nothing serious. Always cleared up on its own. It's just… old age, you know? Everything gets a little… worn. You doctors always want to find something wrong. It’s just old bones.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is a little… tender in the upper right quadrant. Any recent pain or discomfort there?
PATIENT: Tender? Maybe a little. It aches sometimes, after I eat. Especially… fatty things. Pastries, you know? Can't resist a good pastry. Probably just indigestion. I get it all the time. It comes and goes. It's not… bad pain, you understand. Just… uncomfortable. A little bloating. You doctors always making mountains out of molehills. It’s just old age, and a fondness for good food.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished in both legs. That's not entirely unexpected at your age, but it is worth noting. Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Based on this preliminary examination, I recommend a few blood tests to assess your kidney and liver function, as well as a chest X-ray to investigate the diminished breathing on your left side. Also, given your reported abdominal discomfort, we might want to consider an ultrasound of your liver and gallbladder. I'm also concerned about your irregular heart rate and diminished breathing; we need to rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood tests? X-rays? Ultrasounds? Absolutely not. I told you, I'm fine. Just old age. This is what happens when you get old, you know? Things wear out. You doctors always want to poke and prod and find something wrong. It's a waste of time and money. I came for a simple check-up, not a full-body investigation. I don’t need any of that. Just… give me a clean bill of health and let me go. I have important things to do. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I understand your reluctance, but I have a professional obligation to investigate these findings. Dismissing them without proper evaluation could be detrimental to your health. An irregular heart rate and diminished breathing are not normal, even with age. I strongly advise you to reconsider. If you refuse these tests, I cannot, in good conscience, provide you with a "clean bill of health." However, I will document your refusal. We can at least schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss this further.
