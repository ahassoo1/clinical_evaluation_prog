DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor. Pfennig, was it? Yes. Well, it’s… it’s my water. My… going to the bathroom. It keeps bothering me. It’s happened a few times now. I don’t… I don’t quite remember when it started, exactly. It just… does.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you’re experiencing some bothersome changes with your urination. You said it’s happened a few times now, and you're having trouble pinpointing exactly when it began. Could you tell me more about how it's bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, “bothering” is a good word. It… it burns, mostly. When I go. And I feel like I have to go all the time, even when I just have. It’s… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I don’t… I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s just… a nagging feeling.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Burning with urination and a frequent urge to go, even when you've just emptied your bladder… that definitely gives us some clues. Has there been any blood in your urine, Claudene?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… goodness. I… I don’t think so. I haven’t looked, not really. I try not to. It’s… unpleasant. I just know it hurts, and I have to keep going. I… is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, you don’t need to feel bad about not looking. It's not something everyone is comfortable with. The burning and frequency you’re describing could be caused by several things, and it's good we're trying to figure it out. We'll need to do a bit more investigation. Before we get to a physical exam, could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, I've been a bit tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And… my back has been aching. Just a dull ache, not a sharp pain. Is that… related? I don't… I don't know what’s related to what anymore, honestly. It all feels muddled.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and a dull ache in your back. Those could potentially be related, or they could be something separate. We'll explore all possibilities. Do you have any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… Oh, I don’t think so. I haven't felt hot, and I haven’t been shivering. Although… I do get cold easily these days. But that’s just because I’m… older, I suppose. I don’t know if that counts as a chill. It’s hard to remember what feels normal anymore.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. Let's focus on what you're experiencing right now. You’re not running a fever or experiencing chills. Now, I’d like to ask a bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history… That was a long time ago. Let me see… My first husband… he was the one who remembered all those things. I… I think I had something with my… pressure, once? The doctor put me on a little pill. But I stopped taking it. It made me feel funny. And… I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But that’s all I can really recall. I’m sorry. It’s… a bit foggy.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Claudene. It's very common to have trouble remembering details from the past. You mentioned high blood pressure and a broken wrist. That’s helpful. Did you have any surgeries besides the treatment for your broken wrist?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. No, I don’t think so. Just the wrist. They set it, put a cast on it. It was a nuisance, but… that was it. No cutting, no… big operations. I’m quite sure of that. I would remember something like that, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You would, absolutely. Now, thinking about your family... do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – has had any medical conditions, like kidney disease, diabetes, or frequent urinary problems?
PATIENT: Oh… family. My mother… she had a weak bladder, I think. Always complaining about having to go. And my brother… he had something with his kidneys, I believe. But that was a long time ago, when he was a young man. He… he’s not with us anymore. It’s… all a bit sad to think about. I don't recall the details.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright if you don’t recall the details. Knowing about a family history of bladder issues and kidney problems is helpful, though. Now, just a few more questions, and then we'll do a quick physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take a little pill for my… aches and pains. I buy it at the drugstore. Just when they bother me. And… sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. That’s all, I think. Just those two.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pain reliever you get over-the-counter and a Vitamin D supplement. That’s good to know. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat most things, and I’ve never had a rash or trouble breathing. I… I don’t think I’m allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s very helpful. Thank you for answering all those questions, Claudene. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'll also do a simple urine test to check for infection. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? And a… urine test? Yes, alright. If you think it's necessary. I suppose I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just… please be quick, if you could. I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be as quick as possible. Could you please collect a urine sample for me?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A urine sample. Where… where do I do that? Is there a… bathroom? I hope it’s private. And… what exactly do I do? I haven't done this in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. There’s a private bathroom just down the hall, and I'll explain everything. Just go in there, and try to collect a midstream sample. That means you start urinating, and then collect a small amount in the cup about halfway through. There are instructions on the counter inside. If you have any trouble at all, just let me know, and I’ll be happy to help. I'll wait here. Take your time.
PATIENT: Oh… a midstream sample. That sounds… complicated. Very well. I’ll… I’ll try my best. Thank you, Doctor. It’s… kind of you to be patient.
DOCTOR: Take your time. I’ll be right here when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Here… here it is. It wasn’t easy, I must say. My hands are a bit shaky. I hope I did it right.
DOCTOR: Thank you. You did just fine, Claudene. No need to worry. I’ll send this off to the lab right away. It should only take a few minutes to get the initial results. The lab called with the preliminary results. It does show some bacteria in your urine, which indicates a urinary tract infection – a UTI. That explains the burning and frequent urination. It also explains the tiredness; infections can make you feel run down. The results are still pending for the specific type of bacteria, so we can determine the best antibiotic to use. But for now, we can begin with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which should cover most common infections. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… an infection. That’s what it was? I… I suspected something like that. And… antibiotics? Is that those pills? Will they… help? I don’t want to feel bad anymore. I just want to be normal again. And… broad-spectrum? What does that mean, exactly? I’m sorry, Doctor, I'm a bit confused.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be confused, Claudene. That’s what I’m here for. An antibiotic is a medication that kills the bacteria causing the infection. Yes, they’re pills you’ll take for a week or so. They should start to make you feel better within a day or two. “Broad-spectrum” means the antibiotic works against a wide variety of bacteria. We don’t know exactly which bacteria is causing your infection yet, so we’re starting with one that covers most possibilities. Once the lab results come back, we can switch to a more targeted antibiotic if needed. Does that clarify things a bit?
PATIENT: Oh… I think so. So, the pills will kill the… bacteria. And broad-spectrum means they work on most kinds. Yes. That makes a little more sense. And how… how do I take them? With food? How many? I don't want to get it wrong.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad that clarifies things. I’m going to prescribe you Amoxicillin 500mg. You’ll take two pills by mouth three times a day for seven days. It’s best to take them with food to help prevent any stomach upset. It’s very important to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better before the seven days are up. Stopping early can allow some bacteria to survive and cause the infection to come back. I'll also send the prescription to your pharmacy. Do you have a pharmacy you usually use?
PATIENT: Oh… Amoxicillin. Two pills, three times a day, with food. For seven days. Finish the whole thing, even if I feel better. Yes, I think I can remember that. And… yes. I use the pharmacy on Elm Street. The one near the bakery. They're very nice there. Will they… will they know what to do with the prescription?
DOCTOR: Yes, they will. I'll send the prescription electronically to Elm Street Pharmacy right now. They should be able to fill it for you within the hour. Now, besides the antibiotics, it's important to drink plenty of fluids – at least eight glasses of water a day – to help flush out the infection. Also, avoid caffeine, alcohol, and sugary drinks, as these can irritate your bladder. Do you have any other medical conditions or take any other medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… eight glasses of water. No caffeine, alcohol, sugar. Yes, I can try. Although I do enjoy a little sherry with my dinner sometimes… but I suppose I can skip it for a few days. And… no, I don't think so. Just the aches and pains pill, and the vitamin D. And… I had a bad fall a few years back, but that's all. I don't think I have anything else. I'm quite a simple person, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Claudene. Just avoiding the sherry for a week will be helpful while your body recovers. Here's a printed summary of everything we discussed: the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection, the antibiotic prescription, the instructions on how to take it, and the advice to drink plenty of fluids and avoid irritants. Do you have any questions for me at all before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh… a summary. That’s very thoughtful of you, Doctor. Yes, that’s good. Hmm… let me see. Will I… will I be contagious? Can I give this to anyone? I have a friend coming to visit next week, and I wouldn’t want to… to make her sick.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Claudene. UTIs aren’t typically contagious like a cold or the flu. You can't “catch” it from someone. However, the bacteria can be spread through close contact with urine, so it's a good idea to practice good hygiene – washing your hands thoroughly after using the bathroom – to prevent spreading the bacteria to yourself or other surfaces. As long as you're practicing good hygiene, you shouldn't worry about your friend getting sick. It’s more important to focus on getting better and enjoying your visit. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Oh… good. Not contagious. That’s a relief. And washing my hands. Yes, I can do that. I always wash my hands, actually. My mother taught me to. Hmm… I think that’s all. You’ve been very patient with me, Doctor. I do tend to forget things. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I suppose that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Claudene. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. And if your symptoms don't improve within a couple of days, or if they get worse, please schedule a follow-up appointment right away. Get some rest, drink plenty of fluids, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, Claudene.
PATIENT: Oh… yes, thank you again, Doctor. I will remember to call if I need to. And… I will try to rest. You too, Doctor. A very good day to you as well.
