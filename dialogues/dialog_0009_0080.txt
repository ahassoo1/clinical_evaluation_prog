DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. Why don't we start by you telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Well, it's not really bringing me in, you know? Just need some forms filled out for Medicare. Seems like they change somethin' every year, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does, Ms. Fabing. Medicare paperwork can be… a bit of a moving target. I'm happy to help get those forms completed for you. It’s important to make sure everything is accurate and up-to-date. Before we dive into the forms, though, would you mind if I just ask a few quick questions?
PATIENT: Oh, no problem at all, Doctor. Ask away. I don’t mind a bit. Just let me know if you need me to repeat somethin', sometimes my brain gets a little foggy.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Fabing, please don’t hesitate to ask me to repeat anything at all. We'll take things at your pace. First, can you confirm your date of birth for me?
PATIENT: Sure thing. It's January 14th, 1990. Though sometimes I feel a whole lot older than that!
DOCTOR: January 14th, 1990. Perfect. That makes you 35 years old. And just to confirm, your name is Thyra Fabing, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that's me. Thyra Fabing. My husband just calls me Ty, usually. But Fabing is fine for official things, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fabing – or Ty, if you prefer. I'll make a note of that. Now, I see here you're insured through Medicare. Have you had any changes to your health lately that might affect your coverage or the information on your forms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything's been pretty steady, thankfully. No big changes. I had a little bit of a cold a few months back, but that cleared up on its own. Just the usual sniffles, you know? Nothin' serious enough to go to the doctor over.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And just to get a complete picture, have you been seen by any other doctors recently, or are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Nope, no other doctors. And I don’t take any regular meds, thankfully. I take some ibuprofen sometimes for my back, when it acts up, but that’s about it. Just the store-bought kind, nothin’ special. I try to stay away from pills if I can, ya know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand wanting to avoid medications when possible. Ibuprofen is fine, no need to list that on the forms unless you’re taking it very frequently. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… No, nothin' major. When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out. But that was a long time ago. Other than that, just the usual childhood stuff – broken bones, bad colds… Nothin' that required a long hospital stay or surgery as an adult.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well, my grandma on my mom's side had diabetes. And I think my grandpa had some heart trouble when he got older. But other than that, not really. Everyone else seemed pretty healthy, for the most part. It's hard to keep track, ya know? Lots of family, spread all over.
DOCTOR: It absolutely is difficult to keep track with a large family. Diabetes and heart trouble in the family are good to note, thank you. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle... Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Nope, never touched a cigarette in my life. My mom smoked when I was a kid, and I hated it. So I stayed far away from 'em.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I'll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, ya know? Just a little somethin' to relax. Nothing crazy. I don't drink to excess or anything like that. Maybe once or twice a week, tops.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. Just a social drink now and then. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and never had a reaction. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Fabing. It sounds like you're in very good health. Just to be thorough, and since we’re here, would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, that's fine. Sounds good. I don’t mind at all. Always good to make sure everything’s tickin' along alright, ya know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll get that done quickly. Your blood pressure is 126 over 82, which is within the normal range. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good! Now, let's get these Medicare forms filled out for you. Do you have them with you, or should I print out the necessary ones?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear! I knew I was feelin' alright. And no, I don't have 'em with me. I figured you'd have 'em here. If you could print 'em out, that would be wonderful! I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just give me one moment... Here we are. These are the forms we need for Medicare. I'll also provide a pen. We can go through them together, and if you have any questions, just let me know. Don't worry, we'll take our time. We'll start with your personal information here. Just verify your name, address, and date of birth.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. “Thyra Fabing… Yep, that’s me. January 14th, 1990… still feels weird sayin’ that, even after all these years. Address is correct… 123 Main Street, Blackfeet Reservation…” Hmm, looks good so far. I guess I haven't moved much in my life!
DOCTOR: That’s good. It’s nice to have roots. Let’s move on to the next section, which asks about your Medicare card number and coverage. Do you have your card with you?
PATIENT: Oh, shoot. I knew I forgot somethin'! No, I left my Medicare card at home. I was just thinkin’ about fillin’ out these forms, and didn’t grab it. I’m so sorry. Will that be a problem? I can always run home and get it, if you need me to. It's not too far.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Ms. Fabing. Don’t worry about it. We can often find your information in the system with your name and date of birth. Let me just pull up your records… Okay, here we are. It looks like we have your Medicare number and coverage information here. Let’s just double-check that everything is accurate. Does this look right to you?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful! You're a lifesaver, Doctor. Hmm… Yep, that's my number alright. And the plan… that's the one I’ve always had. Yep, everything looks correct on this screen. You’re right, you are a lifesaver! I always get so nervous with these forms.
DOCTOR: I’m glad we could find everything quickly. Now, the rest of the form is just confirming your contact information and asking about any changes to your healthcare providers. It's fairly straightforward. Do you want to go through it section by section, and I can assist if you have any questions?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be wonderful. Section by section sounds perfect. I don't think I’ve changed any doctors recently, but it's always good to double-check. Let's start with the next part, then. You're doin' a good job keepin’ me calm, Doctor. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fabing. That’s my goal! This section asks about your primary care physician. Do you recall who is listed as your primary doctor?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I see Dr. Harrison most of the time, down at the reservation clinic. He's been takin' care of me for years now. Is that who you're lookin' for? He’s a good doctor, really listens to what I have to say.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Harrison! It looks like he is listed as your primary care physician here. Wonderful. Do you have any other doctors you’ve seen recently, such as specialists?
PATIENT: Nope, not recently. I had a podiatrist look at my bunions a few years back, but that was just a one-time thing. Other than Dr. Harrison, I don't see any other doctors regularly. My bunions aren't botherin' me too bad right now, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent specialist visits. That simplifies things nicely. The next section asks about any advanced directives, like a living will or durable power of attorney for healthcare. Do you have any of those documents in place?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don't have any of those. I’ve never really thought about it, to be honest. It sounds like somethin' I should look into, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet. My husband usually makes the decisions for me if I can't, and he knows what I want. Is it somethin' I really need to worry about right now?
DOCTOR: It’s not something you need to worry about right now, Ms. Fabing, but it's a good idea to consider it. It simply ensures your wishes are known, even if you're unable to communicate them yourself. We have resources here at the clinic if you’d like more information. But it’s entirely your decision. Let’s move on to the final section, which requires your signature and date. Once we have that, we’ll be all set.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I think I can handle a signature. There you go. All done! I appreciate you walkin' me through all of this, Doctor. You made it a whole lot less stressful than I thought it would be.
DOCTOR: Perfect! Thank you, Ms. Fabing. I’m glad I could help. We'll make a copy for your records and submit the originals to Medicare. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Nope, I think that's everything. I really appreciate your help with these forms, Doctor. You're a lifesaver! I guess I can head home now and relax for a bit. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fabing. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions in the future. And enjoy your relaxation! Have a wonderful day!
