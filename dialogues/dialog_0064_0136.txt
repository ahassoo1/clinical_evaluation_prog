DOCTOR: Good morning, Lucia. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, I keep… belching. It’s silly, I know. But it happens a lot, and it's getting… annoying.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Lucia. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Anything bothering you is worth discussing. So, these belches… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, maybe… a month now? I don’t know exactly. It started slow, just after eating sometimes. But now… it feels like all the time. Even when I haven't eaten much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month now. And it’s become more frequent, even when you haven’t eaten a lot. Can you describe the belches themselves?
PATIENT: Well… they’re just normal belches, I guess? Like… air coming up. Not painful, not… loud, usually. Sometimes they’re bigger than others, but… mostly just regular. It’s just… the amount of them is what's weird.
DOCTOR: Alright, so not painful, generally quiet, but happening quite a bit. And you said it started after eating, has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I eat… the same things, mostly. Rice and beans, chicken… sometimes fish. I haven’t tried anything new, I don’t think. Oh! Wait… maybe more soda. My friend brought some… a new kind, with lots of bubbles. I drink maybe two a day now, instead of one. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Lucia, thank you. Two sodas a day instead of one… the bubbles definitely could be contributing. It’s a common cause of excess gas. But let's explore a little further, just to be sure. Do you experience any bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits along with the belching?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes my stomach feels… puffy. Not always, but yeah, sometimes. Like, after I eat, it feels full even if I didn’t eat much. No pain, really. And… no, my… going to the bathroom is normal. No changes there. No nausea either. Just the puffy feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating after eating, but no pain, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits. That's helpful. Now, just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history? Um… I don’t really have much of one. I don’t go to the doctor often. I had… the flu, maybe five years ago? And… I broke my arm when I was little. But nothing serious, really. I don’t take any medicine, and… I don’t have any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lucia. No medical history is still a history. And it’s good you’ve been generally healthy. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mama… she had some problems with her stomach, I think. Always complaining of gas. And my abuela… she had… something with her digestion? I don't remember exactly what. It was a long time ago. But nobody really went to the doctor much, so… I don’t know much about it. Just that they had stomach problems sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some family history of stomach issues, which is good to know. And finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… I work in a factory, checking the machines. It’s… not too stressful, but I’m on my feet all day. I live alone. I don't smoke. And I… I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean, Lucia. That gives me a good overall picture. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, just to see if everything sounds normal. It's a simple check, nothing to worry about. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s okay. That sounds… fine. I don’t mind. Just… let me know if it will be… cold?
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be cold, Lucia. Just a little gel. I'm going to ask you to lie down on the examination table if you don't mind. If you could lie on your back, that would be perfect. I'll start by listening to your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, your abdomen sounds… a little bit hyperactive, meaning there's a bit more activity than usual. Not alarming, but something to note. I'm going to gently press on your abdomen now, just to check for any tenderness. Let me know if anything feels painful. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain. It’s… a little bit sensitive, maybe? But not really pain. Just… feels like… pressure? Here… maybe? It feels a bit… full. But not painful. Like a… bubble.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little bit of fullness and sensitivity in that area. Thank you. Alright, I think that's enough for the physical exam for now. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing excessive gas, possibly related to the increased soda consumption and a sensitive digestive system. It’s not uncommon, and we can try a few things to manage it. However, to rule out anything more serious, I would like to order a simple blood test to check your complete blood count and basic metabolic panel. This will help us to make sure there are no underlying issues contributing to your symptoms. Are you able to do that?
PATIENT: A blood test? Um… I don't have insurance, Doctor. Is it… expensive? I don't want to get a big bill.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Lucia. I understand. The cost can vary, and I don't want to put you in a difficult situation. Let me check with the lab to get you a price estimate. We can also discuss options for payment plans or potentially find a community clinic that offers lower-cost testing. In the meantime, we can start with some simple lifestyle modifications and see if that helps. Reducing your soda intake is the first step. Also, eating smaller, more frequent meals, chewing your food thoroughly, and avoiding carbonated beverages can help. Would you like to try that approach first and then consider the blood test if your symptoms don't improve?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds good. Try the… smaller meals and less soda. That I can do. I don't want a blood test if I don't need it. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel much better. Maybe it's just the soda, like you said.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Lucia. That’s a very sensible approach. We’ll start there. If your symptoms persist or worsen after a week or two of these changes, please don't hesitate to come back in, and we can reconsider the blood test. To summarize, we're focusing on dietary modifications: smaller meals, thorough chewing, and reducing your soda intake. I'm going to give you a handout with some additional tips for managing gas and bloating. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel much better knowing it’s probably just the soda. I’ll definitely try to cut back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lucia. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I'm here if you have any concerns or if your symptoms don't improve. Don't hesitate to reach out. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Okay, you too, Doctor! Bye bye!
