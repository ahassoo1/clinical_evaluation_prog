DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. It’s… it’s my stomach, mostly. I just get full so quick now. Even with a little bit of food. It's been happening for a few months, I'd say. Not sure exactly when it started, just kinda… gradually.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A few months, gradually getting worse. And it’s just the feeling of fullness, or are you experiencing any other symptoms with that?
PATIENT: Just the fullness, really. I don't have any pain, or… well, not stomach pain, anyway. My back aches a bit, but that's just old age, I figure. And I get tired easy, but who doesn't at my age? It's mostly just… I can’t enjoy my food anymore. Used to love a good plate of salmon, but now even a small piece fills me right up. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Right. No pain, just early satiety – getting full quickly. And the fatigue… is that new, or has that been ongoing?
PATIENT: Oh, the tiredness has been around a bit, yeah. It’s gotten a little worse lately, maybe. Hard to say. Like I said, I’m 88 years old! Things just… slow down, you know? But this fullness thing is new. It's really what's bothering me. I don't feel sick, just… not hungry. And when I do eat, it doesn’t take much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh… well. They're… regular enough, I suppose. Maybe a little less… firm than they used to be. But honestly, Doctor, at my age you don’t think about those things too much, if you catch my drift. It hasn't been a big change, not something I’d go to the doctor about on its own. Just… older. Is that what you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s what I was asking. It’s good you mentioned it. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Hmm. That’s a good question. My wife does most of the weighing, and she hasn’t said anything. I feel about the same, maybe a bit lighter, but I figured that was just… normal. I haven't been actively trying to lose weight, that's for sure. Honestly, I’m just trying to keep on weight, not lose it! Is that helpful? I don’t really keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no intentional weight loss. Let's talk about your diet for a moment. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, breakfast is usually oatmeal. Nothing fancy. Sometimes with a bit of fruit, if my wife has it. Lunch is usually a sandwich, maybe some soup. And dinner… well, it varies. Fish if we’re lucky, sometimes just leftovers. I used to enjoy a good roast chicken, but… like I said, I don't eat much of anything these days. It's mostly just smaller portions of what everyone else is having. I try to eat healthy, you know? But it's hard when you don’t have much appetite. My wife makes sure I get enough, bless her heart. She worries.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, thankfully. Never been much for pills. And no allergies, not that I know of. I get a bit sniffly in the spring, but that's just the pollen, I think. Nothing serious. I'm a pretty simple case, Doctor, I hope. Just an old man who doesn't eat much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better feel for things. It won’t be anything extensive. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Just relax.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if anything feels… strange. Though, honestly, at my age, everything feels a bit strange.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Again… Good. Lungs sound clear. Heart rate is a little slow, but not concerning for your age. Now, I'm just going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything is tender. …No obvious masses or tenderness here. Abdomen is soft, but… slightly distended. Not significantly, but I’m noting it.
PATIENT: Distended? Is that bad, Doctor? I don't feel anything, just… full, like I said. I get a bit of gas sometimes, but that’s just old age, right? My wife says I eat too slow. Maybe that’s it? I try to chew my food properly, but it takes a while these days. Is it something serious? I don't want to worry my wife.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively, Mr. Obarr. The distension is mild, and could be related to diet, as you mentioned. But given your early satiety, unintentional weight loss – or potential for it – and the distension, I’d like to order some blood work. Just a routine check to rule things out. And I think a stool test would be prudent as well. It’s standard procedure with these symptoms. We'll check for any signs of inflammation, vitamin deficiencies, and rule out anything more serious. It’s likely nothing, but it’s best to be thorough.
PATIENT: Blood work and a… stool test? Well, alright, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. I just hope it doesn't take too long. And I hope it’s not… anything bad. My wife will be worried sick. Can you tell me… is there anything specific you’re looking for? Just so I have an idea, you know? I don't like being in the dark.
DOCTOR: We’ll be checking your complete blood count to look for anemia or any signs of infection. We'll also assess your liver and kidney function. The stool test will check for any signs of bleeding, inflammation, or infection in your digestive tract. We're ruling out things like vitamin deficiencies, malabsorption, and… less common possibilities. It's a process of elimination, Mr. Obarr. It’s probably just a touch of indigestion, but we need to be certain. The lab results will give us a clearer picture. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and give you instructions for the stool sample. It's a standard procedure. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I… I think I understand. Blood work and a stool sample. Just… it’s a bit much, isn’t it? For a little bit of fullness? But alright. If that’s what you think is necessary. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results. I don't want to keep my wife worried any longer than I have to. And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Change my diet? Eat differently? Or should I just carry on as usual?
DOCTOR: Continue eating as you normally do for now, Mr. Obarr. Don’t make any drastic changes to your diet until we have the lab results. And try not to worry too much. It’s likely nothing serious. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are back, usually within a week. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – particularly severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so, Doctor. Just… the blood work and the stool sample. And a follow-up appointment. Alright. Thank you for your time. I appreciate you looking into it. I'll see the nurse, then? For the tests? .
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will take care of that for you. She's right outside. You can follow her. .
