DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Is nice to meet you as well. Well, is like this... I been feeling very thirsty lately. More thirsty than usual. And hungry too, all the time hungry. Even after I eat a good plate of food, is like I didn’t eat nothing at all. Is worrying me a bit, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your concern, Ms. Zicarelli. Increased thirst and hunger can certainly be worrisome. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... is start maybe... two, three months now? Is hard to say exactly. Is not like it happen one day suddenly. Is just… get worse and worse over the time. I thought maybe is the heat, you know, is very hot these days, but is still happening even when is cooler. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Zicarelli. A gradual onset is important information. So, over the past two to three months, you’ve noticed a progressive increase in both your thirst and your hunger, even with adequate food intake and despite changes in the weather. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Well... now that you ask... yes, I have. I does have to go to the bathroom more often. Especially at night. Is waking me up sometimes, and that is not good, you know? I have to get up two, three times sometimes. And I feel a little… tired all the time. Not sick tired, just… sluggish, like I don't have the energy I used to. Does that sound like anything, Doctor? I does try to drink less water before bed, but is not helping much.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Zicarelli, that is certainly helpful information. Increased frequency of urination, particularly at night – what we call nocturia – and the fatigue you're describing are important details. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your vision, any unexplained weight loss, or increased susceptibility to infections—like frequent colds or skin infections?
PATIENT: Vision is okay, I think. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I always wear glasses, so is hard to say if is worse. Weight… hmm. I not sure about weight. I not weighing myself, you know? I feel maybe a little thinner, but I not sure. And no, no colds or skin problems or anything like that. I always been a strong woman, Doctor, I don't get sick easy. But this thirst and tiredness… is different. Is worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Zicarelli, and it's good you're paying attention to these changes. It's certainly wise to investigate. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I never been diagnosed with anything. High blood pressure, diabetes… no. My mother, she had some problems with her joints when she get old, but I never had any trouble like that. I always been healthy, until this start happening. I does try to eat healthy, mostly rice and beans and fish. Is what we eat in my family. Nothing fancy, you know? I don't take any pills or anything like that, either.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Zicarelli. No prior medical diagnoses and no current medications. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgery. And never been in the hospital, thank God. I always been lucky, I guess. I had my babies at home, with the midwife. Everything was fine, thank God for that too. I try to stay away from doctors as much as I can, to be honest. But this... this is different. This is worrying me a lot, and I thought I should come and see what you think. Is been going on too long now.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Zicarelli, and I understand your preference. It's always best to address concerns when they arise, and I'm glad you came in today. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history... Let me think. My mother’s side, they had some heart problems. She had a weak heart, my mother. And my father's side... I don't know so much. He didn't talk much about his family. He come from so far away, you know? He had many brothers and sisters, but I never met them. And as far as I know, nobody in my family ever had... sugar sickness, like my neighbor lady have. Is that what you mean, Doctor? Diabetes?
DOCTOR: Yes, diabetes is what I meant. That’s useful information about the heart problems on your mother's side. And it's good to know there's no known history of diabetes in your family, as far as you're aware. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I never smoke. Never even tried. My husband, he used to smoke a little when he was younger, but he stop a long time ago. Is bad for you, you know? Always coughing and wheezing. No, I never like smoking. And I don’t drink much alcohol either. Maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. But mostly, I drink water. Always water. Especially now, with this thirst.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Zicarelli. No smoking and minimal alcohol consumption. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't have any allergies. Never been allergic to anything. I can eat anything, I can touch anything. Never had a problem. Is a blessing, I guess. I'm a strong woman, like I said before. But this thirst... this thirst is worrying me. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is something serious? Is it my kidneys?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that information, Ms. Zicarelli. It's very helpful. You've given me a good overview of your health history. Based on what you've described – the gradual onset of increased thirst and hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, and the absence of any significant medical history – my primary concern is to rule out diabetes. To do that, I'd like to perform a simple blood test to check your blood sugar levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. If you think it could be that sugar sickness, then I want to know. I want to find out what is happening. Is better to know, you know? Blood test is alright. Whatever you think is best. Just tell me what I need to do. I’m ready. Do I need to fast before the test? Does I need to stop drinking water? Tell me everything, Doctor. I want to understand.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Zicarelli. I'm glad you're proactive about your health. Yes, for the most accurate results, we will need to draw a fasting blood sugar level. That means you shouldn’t eat or drink anything – except water – for at least eight hours before the test. So, if we schedule the test for tomorrow morning, you’d need to avoid food and beverages after bedtime tonight. I'll have my nurse draw the blood here in the office. It’s a quick procedure. While we wait for the results, I'm also going to perform a brief physical examination to assess your overall health. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds alright. No food after I go to bed tonight. I can do that. And the examination is fine too. Check me over, please. I trust your judgment. Is been a long time since I see a doctor, so maybe you will find something I don't know about. Is good to be sure, you know? So, fasting after bedtime… eight hours, you say? And then the examination? Okay, Doctor. Let’s get it done. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Zicarelli. I appreciate your cooperation. Let's start with the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. I’ll also check your feet for any signs of neuropathy, and do a brief neurological assessment. It won't take long. If you could please have a seat on the table, we'll begin. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will sit. Blood pressure first, you say? Is okay. Is been a long time since anyone check my blood pressure. I hope is not too high! I does get a little worried sometimes. I try to stay calm, but… sometimes it gets away from me. Just let me know if anything is wrong, Doctor. Is alright?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not dramatically so. It can fluctuate depending on many factors, like stress or caffeine intake. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Deep breaths. Is alright. Heart and lungs, you say? I hope everything is okay. I does worry sometimes… especially about my heart. My mother, she had trouble with her heart when she get old. Is just something I worry about, you know? Is okay if you take your time, Doctor. I’m not in a hurry. Just let me know if you see anything you don’t like.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, meaning I don’t hear any wheezing, crackles, or other abnormal sounds. That’s good. Now, I'm going to take a look at your throat. Please open your mouth and say "Ahhh."
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Ahhh… Is my throat alright? I don’t have a sore throat or anything like that. Just a little dry sometimes, especially in the morning. Is just old age, I think. But you check anyway, please. You are the doctor, you know best. Ahhh… Is it alright? Everything look okay?
DOCTOR: Your throat appears normal. No redness, swelling, or any signs of infection. Your tonsils are not enlarged. The dryness is likely due to dehydration, which could be related to your increased thirst. Now, let's check your feet. I'm going to test your sensation to make sure there's no nerve damage. Please let me know if you feel anything at all when I touch your feet with this.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is alright. I feel… a little tickle, maybe? Is hard to say. My feet does feel a little numb sometimes, especially in the morning. Is just old age, I think. Is alright if you take your time. Just let me know if you see anything you don’t like. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Is this what you need to do? Testing my feet?
DOCTOR: Your sensation is slightly diminished in your toes and the outer edges of your feet. It's not dramatically reduced, but it's something we should monitor. It could be related to early peripheral neuropathy, which can occur in people with diabetes. The skin on your feet appears healthy, no sores or blisters. Finally, I'm going to do a quick neurological assessment. I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and follow my finger with your eyes. Now, follow my finger with your eyes, but don’t move your head.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is alright. Following your finger… is good. I can see your finger… is alright. I does trust your judgment, Doctor. Just tell me if I do something wrong. Following your finger… is alright. Is good… I can see… is alright.
DOCTOR: Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. No nystagmus or other abnormal movements detected. Alright, Ms. Zicarelli. That completes the physical exam. Based on your symptoms and the findings of the exam, I strongly suspect diabetes mellitus. The increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, slightly diminished sensation in your feet, and elevated blood pressure are all consistent with this diagnosis. However, we need to confirm it with a blood test. The fasting blood sugar level we discussed earlier will give us a definitive answer. Do you have any questions about anything I've said so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Diabetes? Is that… serious, Doctor? My neighbor lady, she have that… is she very sick? I always thought I was a healthy woman… rice and beans and fish, you know? Is that what caused it? The rice and beans? What does that mean for me, Doctor? What will I have to do if I have that… diabetes? Will I have to take pills? Will I have to stop eating my rice and beans? Is a very worrying thing, Doctor. Is very worrying indeed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Zicarelli. It’s natural to be worried when you hear about a diagnosis like diabetes. It is a serious condition, but it’s also very manageable with proper treatment and lifestyle modifications. Your neighbor's experience may be different than yours. The severity of diabetes varies greatly from person to person. And no, rice and beans are not the cause of diabetes. It’s more related to how your body processes sugar, and sometimes genetics play a role. If the blood test confirms a diagnosis of diabetes, we’ll develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. This may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, and possibly medication. We’ll work together to keep your blood sugar levels under control, prevent complications, and help you live a long and healthy life. The first step is to get the blood test. After we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. We'll focus on education, support, and empowering you to manage your health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds… a little better, knowing you will help me. Is good to know you will work with me. And not just give me pills and send me home. Education… is good. I always like to understand things. So, the blood test… Is it a painful test? Will it take long? And when will I get the results? I does worry about waiting… Is a very worrying thing, waiting. And what if… what if it is bad? What if I have to stop eating my rice and beans? Is my favorite food, you know?
DOCTOR: The blood test is very simple and not painful at all. It just involves a small prick of a needle to draw a little bit of blood. It will only take a few minutes. We should have the results back within 24 to 48 hours. I will call you as soon as they are available, so you won't have to worry about waiting too long. As for your rice and beans, we don't necessarily have to eliminate them completely. We may need to modify your diet to include smaller portions and choose healthier carbohydrate sources. A registered dietitian can help you create a meal plan that you enjoy and that keeps your blood sugar levels under control. We’ll take things one step at a time and work together to find a solution that’s right for you. Right now, let’s focus on getting the blood test done. My nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood. After that, you can relax and we’ll discuss the results as soon as they are available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… a little better. Nurse will draw the blood… alright. And you will call me when the results is ready. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Is a worrying thing, but I feel a little better now, knowing you will help me. And maybe… maybe I can still eat my rice and beans, just a little bit. Alright. Let the nurse come. I’m ready. Is alright. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Zicarelli. I'm glad I could ease your worries a little. I will have my nurse come in now to draw the blood. Remember, we'll work through this together. Nurse Johnson, could you please come in here when you have a moment?
