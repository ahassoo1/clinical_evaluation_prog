DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarrotta. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Just trying to get this card so I can keep driving, you know? For the…ride-sharing. It’s a bit of a hassle, but necessary. I hope this doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It's good you're being proactive about this. We need to ensure you meet the medical requirements for continued safe driving. It shouldn’t take too long, we’ll just go through a standard check-up. To start, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well…let’s see. I’m 70, as you know. Divorced, a long time ago. I mostly keep to myself these days, doing a bit of logging work when I can. Nothing too strenuous. I have Medicare, which is…fine. I don't really have any big health problems, honestly. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was no big deal. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Sciarrotta. Thank you. So, no major health concerns currently, and you had your gallbladder removed some time ago. Do you recall approximately when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…it was…1988, I believe. Yes, 1988. I was living in…Oregon then. It was a pretty standard surgery, nothing fancy. Recovered quickly, thankfully. I remember it was a Tuesday. Funny the things you remember, eh?
DOCTOR: Indeed, it is. 1988, gallbladder removal, recovered well. That’s helpful information. Now, thinking about your family, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – perhaps heart disease, diabetes, or anything else that your relatives have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. My mother…she had high blood pressure, I think. And she had some trouble with her knees when she got older. My father…he was a smoker, and he had…emphysema, I believe that’s what they called it. He didn’t take care of himself. My brother…he’s fine, as far as I know. We don't talk much anymore. Nothing major on either side, really. Just the usual stuff, I suppose. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Sciarrotta. High blood pressure in your mother, emphysema related to smoking in your father. And your brother is currently healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis. It's called… Celebrex, I think. And I take a multivitamin every day. That’s it. Nothing else. I try to eat pretty healthy, so I don’t need much. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Celebrex for arthritis and a daily multivitamin. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. I remember being a little kid and my mother would try all sorts of things, and I was never allergic to anything. I’ve never even had poison ivy, which is strange. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your current health. You mentioned some arthritis. Could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my hands and knees. It flares up sometimes, especially when it’s cold or damp. I don’t want to complain, it's just…stiffness, you know? Makes it a little hard to grip things sometimes. And walking can be a bit of a pain. I just try to stay active and take the Celebrex when it gets bad. It doesn’t completely go away, but it’s manageable. It hasn’t gotten any worse recently, thankfully. It’s just…old age.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stiffness in your hands and knees, especially with cold weather, managed with Celebrex. And it hasn’t worsened recently. That's good to hear. To get a better picture of things, would you mind if I performed a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Get on with it, please. I’d like to get this over with and be on my way. I have some things I need to do. Just…try to be quick, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sciarrotta. I’ll do my best to be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is 138/72, pulse is 76 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6, which are all within normal limits. Your heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. I'm noticing some mild tenderness and slight limitation in the range of motion of your finger joints. There's also a little bit of swelling. Your knees have a bit of crepitus with movement, and there's some mild discomfort with full flexion. Your reflexes are normal and neurological function appears intact. Does that all sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Sounds about right, I suppose. That’s been the case for a while now. The crepitus...that’s just the old bones, I imagine. And the tenderness…well, that’s the arthritis. Nothing new. I’m not surprised. Honestly, I just want to know if I can still drive. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily, Ms. Sciarrotta. Your exam findings are consistent with osteoarthritis, as you’ve described. The mild limitations and tenderness don’t immediately preclude you from driving safely. However, to be thorough, and given the requirements for continued safe driving, I would like to order some simple blood work. This will help rule out any other underlying conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms, such as rheumatoid arthritis or vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work…oh, alright. Fine. Just get it over with. I don’t want to have to come back here again if I don’t have to. Can I still drive while I’m waiting for the results? That’s the important part.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You can continue to drive while we’re waiting for the results. The blood work is just a precaution. It’s a standard panel, and we should have the results back within a few days. I’ll have the lab technician draw a small sample of blood right here in the office. While we’re waiting for the results, I would also recommend a follow-up appointment in about a month, just to reassess your condition and ensure there haven’t been any significant changes. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: A month…fine. I guess. As long as it doesn’t take too long. Just…get this over with. I have things to do, you know? Logging doesn’t wait for anyone. So, blood work now, then a check-up in a month. Is that correct? .
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct, Ms. Sciarrotta. Blood work today and a follow-up appointment in about a month. I’ll have the technician come in momentarily to draw your blood. After that, you’re free to go. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me before we proceed?
