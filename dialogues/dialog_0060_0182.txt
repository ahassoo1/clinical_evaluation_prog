DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about this… procedure. My daughter, bless her heart, she thinks I need it. Says I look “tired.” Honestly. At my age, what does it matter? But she insisted I get a check-up before… before they start cutting. Something about making sure my heart can handle it. She’s a worrier, that one.
DOCTOR: Right. A procedure… and your daughter is concerned about your cardiac health beforehand. Understandable, I suppose. Let's get some details. What procedure are we talking about, exactly?
PATIENT: It's a face lift. A full one. Though I don’t see what’s so wrong with my face. It’s seen things, you know? Character. But, she says it’s “sagging.” Women. Honestly. I just want to get this over with. Is that alright? Can we just… do the tests and be done with it?
DOCTOR: A facelift. Hmm. Alright. Well, “just doing tests” isn’t quite how it works, Mr. Orwin. We need to ensure you are a suitable candidate for elective surgery, and that’s not just a matter of your willingness. Sagging is a common concern, but we need to rule out any underlying medical issues that might affect your healing or anesthetic tolerance. Now, let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any significant health problems – heart conditions, high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. I’m eighty-one years old! What don’t I have? Let me see… I had a bit of a cough last winter, but that cleared up. And my arthritis flares up in the cold. Other than that… nothing major. I was a working man my whole life, terrazzo floors, you know. Hard work. Built me strong. Never been one for doctors, frankly. Always seemed like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Right. A cough and arthritis. And “built strong.” That’s… helpful. We’ll still need specifics, Mr. Orwin. Did you ever receive a diagnosis for the cough?
PATIENT: No, no diagnosis. Just a cough. Old man’s cough, the doctor said. Told me to drink some tea and stay warm. Which I did. Look, I don’t remember the specifics. It was years ago. Are you going to do the tests or not? My daughter made me cancel my fishing trip for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. A self-resolved cough, then. And no formal diagnosis. We'll note that. Now, regarding your arthritis...where does it affect you, and are you currently taking any medications for it?
PATIENT: My knees, mostly. And my hands. Makes it hard to… well, it makes things hard. I take… Ibuprofen, sometimes. When it’s really bad. The blue ones. I don’t keep track of the names. It's all the same to me. Honestly, doctor, is this really necessary? I just want a little nip and tuck.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, elective surgery carries risks, and ibuprofen can interact with anesthesia. It is absolutely necessary to understand your complete medical history. Do you know the dosage of the ibuprofen you take, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, for crying out loud. Two pills. Maybe three. When it hurts. I don’t measure them out with a ruler, do I? It's over-the-counter! I buy the orange bottle at the drugstore. Is that good enough for you? I swear, this is more trouble than it’s worth.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, “two or three pills” isn’t sufficient information. Over-the-counter doesn’t mean harmless. We need to know exactly what you're taking to ensure your safety during and after surgery. I’m going to need you to either recall the exact dosage, bring in the medication bottle, or I will have to advise against proceeding with the facelift. Frankly, I'm starting to question your suitability for this procedure if you can't provide a basic medical history. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no! I’m a Norwegian! We’re made of tougher stuff than that! We eat fish and brave the cold. Never had an allergy in my life. This is ridiculous! I came here for a simple cosmetic procedure, not a full interrogation! My daughter… she needs to hear this. She’s making me jump through hoops for nothing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, but your “tough Norwegian” heritage does not preclude you from having allergies or underlying medical conditions. Dismissing potential risks is incredibly irresponsible, and frankly, dangerous. I'm documenting your refusal to provide a complete medical history, and strongly advise against proceeding with the facelift at this time. I will not put your health at risk. Perhaps a consultation with your primary care physician to establish a baseline medical profile would be beneficial before considering elective surgery. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! You win. I… I think I have the bottle at home. My daughter keeps track of these things, probably. But this is a complete waste of my time! And I’m still cancelling my fishing trip. Absolutely ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please bring the medication bottle to your next appointment, and we can reassess. .
