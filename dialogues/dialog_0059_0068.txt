DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… swelling. It’s in my leg, you see? After the… the cancer stuff. It’s just… puffy. It’s been getting a little bigger, and it feels… funny.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Queener. It sounds concerning, and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention. When you say “after the cancer stuff,” could you tell me a little more about what treatment you received?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It was… a long time ago now. They gave me… pills. And then… radiation. Yes, radiation. Lots of it. It was for… breast cancer. I had surgery too, of course. But that was a while back. It’s the leg now, like I said. It’s mostly just… puffy. And sometimes it feels heavy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Queener. That gives me a better understanding. And it’s good you remember those details, even if it was some time ago. You mentioned the swelling started after your cancer treatment. Roughly when did you first notice the puffiness in your leg?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I notice? Hmm… it’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months ago? No, longer. Maybe a year? It started small, I think. I didn’t think much of it at first. Just thought it was from… sitting too much. Old age, you know? But now it’s… more noticeable.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint the exact timing, Ms. Queener. A year ago, you say, and it’s gradually become more noticeable. And you’ve noticed it's associated with sitting for extended periods?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. When I sit for a long time, it gets worse. And… sometimes it feels a little achy. Not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Like a heavy weight. Is that… normal? I don’t want to bother you if it's nothing.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re describing the sensations so clearly, Ms. Queener – “heavy” and “uncomfortable” are helpful. And you're not bothering me at all; that’s what I’m here for. Given your history of breast cancer treatment and the gradual swelling in your leg, we definitely want to investigate this further. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if the swelling is in one leg or both?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just the one leg, Doctor. My left leg. The right one is fine. I always use my left more, maybe that has something to do with it? I don’t know. It's definitely just the left one that's puffy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Queener. Just the left leg, and you suspect it might be related to more frequent use. That’s a reasonable thought. Now, have you noticed any changes in the skin on your left leg?
PATIENT: Changes in the skin? Let me see… Hmm… It looks… normal, I think. Maybe a little red sometimes? But I get redness easily. I have… sensitive skin. No sores or anything like that. Just… a bit red sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of redness at times, but no sores. That’s good to know. And have you experienced any pain in your calf, or noticed any warmth or tenderness to the touch in that leg?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. And it doesn’t feel warm. I mean, it feels like a normal leg, just… bigger. And like I said, a little heavy. Sometimes it feels… tight, like my sock is too tight, but it's not. It’s just… strange.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Queener. "Tight" is a helpful description. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical examination of your legs to get a better sense of the swelling and assess your circulation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just… don’t poke too hard, please? It’s a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Queener. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright. I do notice some swelling in your left leg, as you described, particularly around your ankle and calf. Your pulses are present in both feet, but slightly diminished on the left side compared to the right. The skin doesn’t appear discolored, and I don’t feel any signs of acute inflammation. I'm going to measure the circumference of both of your legs now, just to document the difference in size. Your left leg is about 2 centimeters larger in circumference than your right leg at this point. This, combined with your history of breast cancer treatment and diminished pulse, raises my suspicion for lymphedema. Do you know what that is?
PATIENT: Lymp-e-what-ma? No, I don’t think so. Is that… bad? Is it from the… cancer stuff? Oh dear, I’m getting worried now.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be worried, Ms. Queener. Lymphedema is a condition that can sometimes develop after cancer treatment, particularly after radiation or surgery that involves lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are part of your body’s immune system, and they help drain fluid from your tissues. When those nodes are affected, it can lead to a buildup of fluid in your limbs, causing swelling. It’s not always serious, but it's important to manage it properly to prevent complications. To get a definitive diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a Duplex ultrasound of your left leg. This is a non-invasive test that will allow us to assess the blood flow and the structure of the veins and lymph vessels. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a scan. Alright, if you think it’s necessary. I don’t like scans, but… if it will tell us what’s going on, then yes. Is it… painful? And will it take long? I have a… bingo game tonight.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable; many people feel apprehensive about scans. The Duplex ultrasound is not painful at all. It uses sound waves, so it's completely harmless. A technician will apply a gel to your leg and move a handheld device over the skin. It takes about 30-45 minutes, so it shouldn't interfere with your bingo game, though you may want to arrive a little later to allow for travel and settling in. I’ll write the order for the ultrasound now. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning. While we wait for the results, I recommend elevating your left leg whenever possible, and wearing loose-fitting clothing. Would you like me to provide you with a compression stocking to wear in the meantime?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… okay. Not too long, that’s good. And a stocking? Would that help? If it won't make it worse, then yes, please. I trust you, Doctor. I just want this… puffiness to go away.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Queener. We’ll do everything we can to help. A compression stocking can help to reduce the swelling by promoting fluid drainage. I’ll have the nurse measure your leg and fit you with an appropriate size. I’m also going to prescribe a mild diuretic, which will help your body get rid of excess fluid. It’s a low dose, and we’ll monitor your kidney function to ensure it’s safe for you. Does that all sound alright, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: A… what-er-etic? Oh dear. Pills again? Is it… safe? I don’t want any side effects. I get… a little nervous with pills. But if it helps the puffiness… and the stocking… alright. Yes, alright. Just… please make sure it’s safe. And not too many pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Queener. It’s perfectly reasonable to be cautious about medication. A diuretic, also known as a water pill, helps your kidneys remove excess fluid from your body, which can reduce the swelling in your leg. The dose I’m prescribing is very low, and it’s generally well-tolerated. The most common side effect is increased urination, so you may need to go to the bathroom more frequently. I’ll make sure to document your concerns in your chart, and we’ll closely monitor your kidney function and electrolytes. If you experience any unusual symptoms – like dizziness, weakness, or muscle cramps – please contact the clinic immediately. Now, to summarise, we’ve ordered a Duplex ultrasound for tomorrow, I’m prescribing a low-dose diuretic, and the nurse will fit you with a compression stocking. Does that sound correct?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds right. Ultrasound, pill, and stocking. Oh dear. Well, if it helps… Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… explaining everything. And being patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. It’s my pleasure. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns at all, before or after your ultrasound. We’re here to help you every step of the way. The nurse will be in shortly to fit you with the stocking and explain the diuretic. In the meantime, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just… the stocking and the pill. And the scan tomorrow. I suppose that's enough for today. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind. I'm going to go… sit down now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Queener. Please do sit down and relax. The nurse will be with you shortly. And again, don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. Have a good day, and I hope you enjoy your bingo game tonight.
