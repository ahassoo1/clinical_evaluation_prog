DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Right, right… something about a check-up? For… work. I do ushering, mostly. Ticket taking, you know. Lobby stuff. It’s… a requirement, I think. Honestly, it all feels a bit hazy. They just said I needed to get cleared. Is that right?
DOCTOR: A work check-up, yes. And it is a requirement for continued employment, according to the note here. Hazy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, very hazy. My memory isn't what it used to be, Doctor. It’s… frustrating. I remember doing the work, standing, smiling… but the details? Dates, specifics… they slip away. I’m sorry. It’s not that I’m trying to be difficult. It just… is. Is this a long process? I have… things to get back to.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Krahn. Many things can cause memory issues as we get older. We'll try to keep things as efficient as possible. I’ll need to ask you some questions to get a better understanding of your overall health. It’s standard procedure. First, can you tell me about any current symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think. Well, my knees ache a bit, especially after a long shift. And sometimes I feel… a little breathless just walking up the stairs. Nothing major, I don’t think. Just… old age, probably. Is that what you mean by symptoms? I don't really feel sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Knee pain and shortness of breath. Alright. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. The knees… for a while now. Years, I suppose. The breathlessness is more recent. Maybe… the last six months? It comes and goes, you know? It’s not constant. Some days I barely notice it. Other days… well, other days I take things a little slower. Is that helpful? I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Six months of intermittent shortness of breath. And does anything specific seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger it…? Well, definitely stairs. And… if I’m rushing. If I try to hurry anywhere, it gets worse. Also… dust. If there’s a lot of dust in the air, it feels harder to breathe. The theatre isn’t always the cleanest place, you understand. Old building and all. Does that make sense? It’s just a feeling, though. Not… a bad shortness of breath, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. Not really. They feel a little tired sometimes, after standing all day, but not… swollen. I haven’t noticed any puffiness or anything like that. I’m pretty sure I would have noticed that, wouldn’t I? I mean, I check my shoes before putting them on in the mornings… just a habit. No, no swelling. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as heart disease, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a lot to remember. Let me think. No… I don’t think so. The doctor always said I was healthy, just… a bit thin. I’ve never been a big eater. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. I think. It was a long time ago. I did have… a bad cold a few years back, but that didn’t last long. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve mostly just been… well, mostly just been fine. Is it important that I can't remember everything precisely? I’m starting to feel like I'm wasting your time.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful if you could recall specifics, but we’ll proceed as best we can. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, that much I remember. And… oh, I broke my arm once, falling off a bicycle. But that was a long, long time ago. No… I don’t think I’ve been hospitalized since then. Not for anything serious, anyway. I had a… a minor procedure once, to remove a skin tag, but that wasn’t a hospital stay. Just a quick visit to the doctor’s office. Is that enough? Are we getting anywhere? I really do apologize for being so… vague.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, broken arm, skin tag removal. Alright. Now, family history. Are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s a… difficult question. My parents… both passed away a long time ago. My mother… she died when I was quite young. And my father… he died many years later. I had a sister, but… we lost touch a long time ago. We didn't… we didn't get along very well. I haven't spoken to her in decades. I don’t really know anything about their medical history, to be honest. We weren’t close. I’m sorry. Is this information necessary? It’s… painful to think about.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Krahn, but we can move on if it's too distressing. Social history then. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… well, I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. Very occasionally. And recreational drugs… absolutely not! I’m a very… a very respectable man, Doctor. Always have been. I spend my evenings reading, mostly. Or watching old movies. I’m not much of a… a wild one, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. The doctor gave me some antibiotics once, for a sore throat, and that was fine. I think. I’m pretty sure I would have remembered if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I? It's rather difficult to forget something like that. No allergies, to my knowledge. Are we almost done? I have a performance to get back to later. A small role, but… still.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Let’s do a quick physical exam. It will help me get a better sense of what's going on. Please, have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate.
PATIENT: Oh. An exam…? I… I wasn’t expecting that. Is it… necessary? I thought this was just a formality, to clear me for work. I’m not feeling particularly unwell. But… alright. Please be gentle. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Krahn. And I will be as gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. 140 over 90. A little elevated. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear, but breathing is somewhat shallow. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Another one.
PATIENT: Shallow breathing… is that bad? I do get a little breathless sometimes, as I mentioned. Especially when I’m rushing. Is it something serious? I… I just want to be able to continue working. It’s not a glamorous job, but it keeps me busy. And… it's all I have, really. Is this something that requires… medication? Or… a hospital stay? I get very anxious about hospitals.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say, Mr. Krahn. Your blood pressure is a little high, and your breathing is somewhat shallow, but that doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem. We need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. These tests will help us rule out any underlying conditions. I’ll also need a detailed list of any over-the-counter medications you're taking, even vitamins. Don’t worry, a hospital stay is unlikely at this point. But we need to be thorough.
PATIENT: Tests… of course. More waiting, more uncertainty. I… I don’t do well with uncertainty, Doctor. It makes my anxiety worse. A detailed list of medications… I mostly just take a multivitamin, occasionally. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they’re really bothering me. Is that detailed enough? And the ibuprofen is just over-the-counter, you understand. I don’t have any prescriptions. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I be able to work while I’m waiting? That’s very important to me. I really do need to keep busy.
DOCTOR: The results should be back in about a week. And yes, you can continue working while we wait, but I advise you to take it easy and avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, stop working immediately and go to the emergency room. The ibuprofen is fine, but I wouldn't recommend taking it regularly. It can have side effects. I’m also going to refer you to a cardiologist for a full evaluation. It’s best to rule out any potential heart problems, given your elevated blood pressure and somewhat rapid heart rate. Here's the order for your tests and the referral to the cardiologist. The lab is located down the hall, and the cardiologist’s office is on Elm Street. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… It sounds… serious, doesn’t it? I… I don’t want to be a bother. I just wanted to get cleared for work, not… not end up with a whole list of problems. A week… That’s a long time to wait when you’re worried. And… what if the tests show something bad? What if… what if I can’t work anymore? I… I don’t have anyone to help me. What do I do if… if that happens? I… I don’t know what I’d do. Do you have any advice? Any resources I can look into?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, let’s not jump to conclusions. We haven’t even done the tests yet. Worrying yourself sick won’t help anything. As for resources… there are social workers at the hospital who can assist with financial concerns and support services. I'll have the receptionist provide you with their contact information. Right now, focus on getting the tests done and following up with the cardiologist. We’ll address any concerns after we have the results. I have other patients to see. Here's the receptionist's number if you need anything. And try to stay calm. Stop worrying and get the tests done. .
