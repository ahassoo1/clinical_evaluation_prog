DOCTOR: Right. Mystery Kobler, age 25. And what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Press, is it? Yes. Well, it’s… it’s been getting harder to breathe, lately. Not like, a big struggle all the time, but… I get winded easier. And my mouth feels so dry, and my eyes too. It's… quite uncomfortable. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly. Just… gradually.
DOCTOR: Gradually, you say. Right. So, shortness of breath and dry mouth and eyes. Can you describe the shortness of breath a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific… that’s… difficult. It’s not like after running, you understand. It’s… like when I talk for a bit, or walk up a small hill. Just… a little breathless. Not… scary, exactly. More… annoying. And it happens more often now, I think. I… do apologize, I’m not very good at explaining. It feels like I'm forgetting things, too, but I don't know if that's related.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it's exertional – brought on by talking or mild activity. And you've noticed it's increasing. Forgetfulness... and when did you first notice that symptom?
PATIENT: Oh… exertional, yes, that sounds right. And increasing… maybe a few months ago? It’s hard to say. Everything feels… a bit hazy. The forgetfulness… probably around the same time, I suppose. Little things, mostly. Where I put my keys, what I was saying mid-sentence… things like that. It’s… not alarming, just… inconvenient. I’ve been trying to write, you see, and it makes it difficult to focus when I can't remember what I meant to say.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… not that I’ve noticed, really. No cough, no fever… My throat feels a little scratchy sometimes, but I thought that was just from the dry air. And… I've been feeling rather tired lately, but I assumed that was just from not sleeping well. I… do apologize, I'm not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: Scratchy throat and fatigue. Alright. Now, let's go through some medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh. Medical history… I… I was divorced last year, if that counts. As for illnesses… I had the flu, I think, a couple of years ago. And… I broke my arm when I was a child, but that’s hardly relevant, is it? I… don't believe I have any serious conditions. I haven’t seen a doctor in quite some time, actually. Mostly I just… try to rest when I’m not feeling well. I'm… honestly not sure what else to say.
DOCTOR: Right. No significant medical history. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. I… I don't like hospitals. And… I haven’t really needed surgery, thankfully. Just the broken arm, and they just put it in a cast. It healed perfectly well. I… I hope that’s not a problem. I always get a little anxious talking about these things.
DOCTOR: No, no problem. Family history, then. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings – have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. That’s… difficult. My mother… she passed away a few years ago. I… I wasn’t very close to her, and I don’t really know much about her medical history. My father… he lives in Alaska, and we don’t speak often. He seemed healthy enough the last time I saw him, but… again, I don’t really know. He’s… Aleut, you see, and they don’t always go to the doctor. It's… a different way of life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… hmm. Well, as I mentioned, I was recently divorced. I… don't have many close friends, to be honest. I spend most of my time writing, or… trying to write. I don’t really go out much. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink. And… I don’t use any recreational drugs. Is that… what you meant?
DOCTOR: And finally, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I haven’t taken much medication in my life, thankfully. A little penicillin when I was a child, I think, but I didn’t have any reaction. And… no food allergies, no environmental allergies. I… I’m very careful about what I eat, and I try to avoid things that might bother me. I’m… rather sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your symptoms – shortness of breath, dry mouth and eyes, fatigue, forgetfulness – and the lack of significant medical history, we'll need to do a quick physical exam. It's probably nothing, but it's best to rule things out. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical exam sounds… sensible. Yes, I can stand. I… I hope I’m not taking up too much of your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Not at all. Please, have a seat on the table. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and then I'll check your throat and eyes. First, take a deep breath for me… and exhale.
PATIENT: Certainly. Is that alright? I… I sometimes feel a little self-conscious during these things.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. A little diminished breath sound on the bases, but that's not unusual. Heart sounds are regular. Now, open your mouth for me. Throat is slightly dry, a little of redness, but no significant inflammation or exudate. Eyes look clear, though slightly dry. No visible abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. A little dry… yes, that’s what I’ve been noticing. It’s… uncomfortable. Is it anything serious, Doctor? I… I do apologize for being such a bother.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be serious, but these symptoms do warrant further investigation. Given your fatigue, forgetfulness, and dry mouth and eyes, I suspect we should run some blood work to rule out some common deficiencies or underlying inflammatory conditions. We'll check your thyroid, vitamin levels, and basic metabolic panel. It's just to be thorough. Do you have any objections to a blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work… No, no objections. As long as it will help determine what's going on, I… I’m willing to do whatever is necessary. I… I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I’d like to feel better, you see. And… knowing what's happening would be a relief.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write the order for the blood draw. The lab is just down the hall. They'll call you with the results in a few days. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and get as much rest as possible. If your symptoms worsen – if you experience chest pain, difficulty breathing at rest, or severe dizziness – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Hydrate, rest, and… emergency room if things worsen. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate your time and attention. I hope the blood work will provide some answers.
DOCTOR: We’ll see. The lab will contact you. The nurse will give you the paperwork for the blood draw. And if you don’t hear anything within a week, give the office a call. That will be all.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You too.
