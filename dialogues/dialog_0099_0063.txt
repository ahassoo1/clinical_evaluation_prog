DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you. It’s my back. It’s been really bad lately. Worse than usual, even. I have… the cancer, you know? And it hurts there. It feels like something is… stuck. Or broken, maybe? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Right. Your chart indicates a history of… metastatic cancer, yes. And you're experiencing new or worsening pain in your lower back. “Something stuck or broken,” you say. Okay. And when did you first notice this increase in pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe two weeks ago? At first it was just a little ache, you know? Like after I’d been working too hard at the factory. But then it got bigger, and now it’s… well, now it’s this. I didn’t think much of it at first, because sometimes it just hurts. But this is different. It doesn’t go away when I rest.
DOCTOR: Two weeks, progressively worsening. Not relieved by rest. And you work at the factory… doing what specifically?
PATIENT: I… I put the caps on the bottles. The small ones, for the medicine. It’s not heavy work, but I stand all day. And… I have to bend over a lot to pick up the bottles when they fall. Happens a lot, you know? My hands aren’t what they used to be. I try to be careful, but… still. And I sort of twist when I put the caps on, to make it faster.
DOCTOR: Repetitive bending and twisting at work. Alright. And aside from the pain in your lower back, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been… more tired than usual, maybe? And… I’ve been having trouble sleeping. Not because of the pain, exactly. Just… restless. And… I think my legs feel a little… numb sometimes. Not all the time, just… when I’m standing for a long time. Is that… important? I don't know if that’s from the cancer, or just from being old.
DOCTOR: “Old,” you say. Well, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and intermittent numbness in your legs… those could be related to a number of things. It’s important to document everything. Now, regarding your cancer treatment… what is your current regimen?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Sorry. I just… try not to think about it too much. I’m getting the pills… the white ones. Twice a day. And… sometimes, I get the shots. Not every time, just when the doctor says. I think it’s every six weeks, but I forget. My niece usually takes me, and she handles all the… details. I don’t always listen very well. It's a lot to remember, you know? And it doesn't always do much.
DOCTOR: Right. White pills twice daily, intermittent injections every six weeks, managed primarily by your niece. And you feel the treatment isn’t particularly effective?
PATIENT: Well… it helps sometimes. A little. Like, the tiredness isn’t as bad on some days. But the pain… it still comes back. And I’m worried it’s getting worse, even with the pills. It used to be just a dull ache, but now… it’s sharp sometimes. And it goes down my leg. Not all the way, but… a little bit. And it makes me scared. I don’t want to end up in a wheelchair.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sharp pain radiating down your leg… that’s something we need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table for me. We’ll start with a neurological assessment to check your reflexes and sensation, and then I’ll palpate your spine and surrounding muscles. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yes, I can do that. No, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Maybe… maybe a little itchy sometimes when I use the bandages, but nothing bad. Just… a little bit. I’m a little scared, you know? What if it’s… bad news? My niece always says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie down on your back, please. We'll take it one step at a time. Now, can you tell me where exactly is the pain at this moment?
PATIENT: Okay. Right here. It's mostly in my back, but it goes around to my side… and down my left leg, like I said. Not all the way to my foot, just… to my knee, mostly. It feels… tight. And sore. Like someone is… squeezing it. Oh. That hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are… diminished on your left side. Sensation appears slightly reduced as well. And there is some tenderness to palpation along your lumbar spine, particularly at L4 and L5. Does this pain radiate down your leg when I apply pressure here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes! That… that hurts. Yes, it goes down my leg. Not all the way to my foot, but… to my calf. It feels like… like a shock. A little bit. That’s… not good, is it? My niece always tells me I have a low pain tolerance. But this… this is bad.
DOCTOR: Right. Limited range of motion, and pain with flexion. These findings are… concerning. Given your history of metastatic cancer, your recent increase in pain, and these physical exam results, it's possible the cancer has progressed and is impinging on a nerve root. However, we need to rule out other potential causes as well. I'm going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to get a better visualization of the area. And I'm also going to order some blood work to check for inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. MRI… blood work… Is it… is it bad? Is it getting worse? I don’t want to end up in a wheelchair. My niece… she said sometimes they can do something with… with radiation? Is that right? Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. Just… please help me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. We’re going to investigate this thoroughly. The MRI will give us a clearer picture. Radiation is an option, depending on the findings. But we need to determine the exact cause of your pain before we can discuss treatment options. For now, I’m going to prescribe you a stronger pain medication to help manage your discomfort. It’s a non-opioid, but it’s more potent than what you’re currently taking. I'll also give you a referral to a specialist, an oncologist, for a second opinion. It’s important to get this addressed quickly, yes. Now, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. A specialist… that’s good. I… I don’t know. How long will it take to get the MRI? And… will it hurt? My niece says sometimes they have to… inject something. And… what if it’s really bad? What if there’s nothing they can do? I just… I don’t want to be in pain anymore.
DOCTOR: The MRI should be scheduled within the next few days. Yes, you will receive an intravenous contrast agent, which may cause a slight warming sensation. As for whether there’s “nothing they can do”… we don’t know that yet. We need to see the results first. We will explore all available options. Now, I understand you're anxious, but dwelling on worst-case scenarios isn't helpful. Here are the prescriptions and the referral information. The specialist's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Please call them as soon as possible. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. No. I… I think that’s all. Thank you. I… I just hope it doesn’t hurt too much. I’ll call the specialist. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get it scheduled. And try to rest. .
