DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Reisig. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, pleasure's all yours, I guess. Look, I'm here 'cause... the army. Need a check-up for it. Recruitment exam and all that. Don't really see the point, but they said I needed it.
DOCTOR: I understand. A recruitment physical is quite thorough, and they have specific requirements. That’s perfectly alright – we're happy to help ensure you meet those standards. To get started, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? What kinda questions we talkin'? I mean, I work with engines all day. It's physical, right? Get greasy, lift things... I ain't sittin' around eatin' chips all day, if that's what you're gettin' at. I feel… fine. Never really been sick much. You know, the usual colds, maybe. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Hartness. And yes, engine work is certainly physical! I just want to gather a comprehensive history to ensure we cover everything. When you say “fine,” are you experiencing any current symptoms – any aches, pains, fatigue, changes in your bowel habits, or anything else that feels off, even slightly?
PATIENT: Off? Look, I’m 51. Things ache. What do you expect? Knees are a bit creaky, back's sometimes stiff after a long day bendin' over engines. That's just… livin', yeah? Bowel habits are fine. Normal. Never had problems with that. Fatigue… well, I get tired after work, but who doesn’t? It’s a hard job. You askin' if I'm dyin' or somethin'? 'Cause I ain't. Just need a stamp to say I'm fit enough for the army. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Hartness. You’re not dying, and a recruitment physical is perfectly reasonable. I simply need to gather enough information to ensure I’m able to accurately complete the necessary paperwork and, most importantly, to rule out anything that would be a safety concern for you. The knee and back discomfort you described – has that been a recent change, or has it been ongoing?
PATIENT: Ongoing. Years, really. Since… well, since I started workin' with engines. Heavy lifting, awkward positions, that kinda thing. Gets worse when it's cold, gets a little better when I move around. I just… ignore it. Rub some cream on it now and then. Not a big deal. I ain't made of porcelain, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for physically demanding work to cause aches and pains. And you’re right, we’re not made of porcelain! To get a better picture, could you tell me a bit about any past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… hmm. Let me think. When I was a kid, I broke my arm fallin’ out of a tree. Had the cast and everything. Tonsils out when I was… maybe eight? Other than that… nothin' major. No serious illnesses, never been to the hospital for anything important. I had the flu once, but who hasn't? Regular check-ups? Not really. Never saw the point. If somethin' hurts, I deal with it. Seems like doctors just want to give you pills for everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Hartness. It's good to know you haven't had any significant medical issues. And you’re right, preventative care isn't for everyone. Now, regarding past surgical history – aside from the tonsils, have you had any other operations or procedures?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the tonsils, like I said. Never needed anything else. I'm pretty good at avoiding accidents, usually. Well, apart from the occasional scraped knuckle, but that's just part of the job. Look, are we gettin' anywhere with this? Feels like a lot of questions for a simple check-up. I got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Hartness. It’s important to gather a thorough history to ensure accuracy. And I apologize if it feels like a lot of questions, but it’s necessary for the recruitment physical. Now, let's talk about family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he had a bad heart. Died when he was 68. Massive heart attack. Mother, she was fine, lived 'til she was 85, but she always complained about her arthritis. My sister’s healthy as a horse, works in an office, doesn’t do a thing all day. No cancer, as far as I know. That's about it, really. Pretty average, I guess.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hartness. That’s helpful to know. So, a history of heart disease on your father's side and arthritis in your mother. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched 'em. My father smoked, and look how that turned out. Drink? Maybe a beer now and then with dinner. Nothing serious. A couple, maybe. Recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I got no time for that nonsense. Waste of time and money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so candid, Mr. Hartness. That's good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never had any. I can eat anything, take anything. Bit of a dust allergy sometimes, but that’s it. Gets a bit stuffy when I’m cleaning the engine, but nothing a bit of water can't fix.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness, that completes the history portion of the exam. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. This will include checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – as well as listening to your heart and lungs, examining your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with then. I ain't got all day. Just… be gentle with the back, alright? Gets a bit sore easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. I will be as gentle as possible. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, meaning I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical, which is normal. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand and bend forward, backward, and twist side to side. I'll be watching your range of motion and looking for any discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here we go. Ouch. Yeah, that's not good. Back's complainin' already. Bit better this way, but still not comfortable. Nope. Definitely not good. See? Told you it was sore. Can we just skip the rest of this torture?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness, we can definitely stop there. I can see you're experiencing discomfort, and I don’t want to exacerbate it. Based on what you’ve told me and the limited physical exam I was able to perform, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you have a history of chronic back pain. You also mentioned a family history of heart disease. To get a more complete picture, I would recommend a few tests. Specifically, an EKG to assess your heart function, a blood test to check your cholesterol levels and rule out any other underlying conditions, and potentially an X-ray of your lower back to evaluate the source of your pain. Would you be open to those?
PATIENT: Tests? More money, more hassle… Look, I just need a form signed so I can join the army! Is that too much to ask? I'm a strong, healthy guy, even if my back complains a bit. I've been lifting engines for years. I'm fit enough for it. I don't see the point of all these tests. It's just… wasting time and money. Can't you just… sign the form? Please? I really need this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your desire to expedite this process. However, my primary responsibility is to ensure your health and safety. Signing a recruitment form without a proper evaluation would be irresponsible and potentially put you at risk. The army has specific physical requirements, and it's crucial to determine if you meet them safely. While you may feel strong and healthy, the elevated blood pressure and chronic back pain require further investigation. I cannot, in good conscience, sign the form without knowing the underlying cause. I understand financial concerns may be a barrier. Let's explore options. We can discuss potential financial assistance programs for the tests, or perhaps a more limited set of tests to start. However, some evaluation is necessary. Would you be open to discussing those options with me?
PATIENT: Financial assistance? You think I got money to throw around? This is why I don’t go to doctors. Always more money, more tests… Look, alright. A limited set of tests. Just… the back. An X-ray. That's it. No blood tests, no fancy heart machines. Just see if the back is gonna fall apart. And then can you sign the form? Is that possible? If the back is just… old, can we move on?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Hartness, that is a reasonable compromise. We can start with an X-ray of your lower back to evaluate the source of your pain. If the results are consistent with age-related wear and tear, and there are no red flags, I would be comfortable completing the necessary paperwork with that information. However, I do need to emphasize that even with normal X-ray results, the elevated blood pressure remains a concern. It would be wise to monitor it regularly and potentially discuss lifestyle modifications or medication with your primary care physician. I will write an order for the X-ray now. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once you have the results, please bring them back to me, and we can proceed. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… acceptable. Finally. Just get the order written. I got things to do. And can you tell me where the nearest radiology department is? And… how long does this usually take? I need this done quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. Here’s the order. The closest radiology department is at County General Hospital, located at 123 Main Street. Their phone number is 555-1234. They typically can schedule appointments within 2-3 business days. I’ve noted on the order that you’re being evaluated for recruitment purposes, so they may prioritize your appointment. Once you receive the results, please call my office to schedule a follow-up appointment. I wish you the best of luck with your recruitment process, and please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. .
