DOCTOR: Hi Clarke, it's good to meet you. I’m Chriselda Morenomartinez, and I’m one of the family medicine doctors here. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Chriselda, nice to meet you too. Well, my legs… they’ve been botherin’ me. Little red bumps, mostly on my shins. They hurt, you know? Not all the time, but when I rub against things, or even just when I’m restin’ sometimes. It’s been goin’ on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month of red, bumpy, painful shins… that gives us a starting point. When you say “rub against things,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I work, you know, movin’ stuff around. Boxes, bags of feed… sometimes I brush against the metal parts of the truck, or the sides of the buildings. And even my pants, kinda. They’re not too tight, but… I dunno. It feels like somethin’ is irritatin’ them. It's hard to explain. It's not a rash, really. More like… hard little bumps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like friction is definitely a trigger. And you said "hard little bumps"—are they raised?
PATIENT: Yeah, they are raised. Not huge, but you can feel ‘em, definitely. They’re kinda… round, I guess? And red, like I said. Sometimes they get a little white head on ‘em, but not always. It’s not like a big blister, just… little bumps. They’re right here, mostly on the front of my legs.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms – any itching, swelling beyond just the bumps themselves, or fever?
PATIENT: No, no itchiness. That’s good, I think. And no swelling, not really. Just the bumps are there and they hurt when I bother ‘em. No fever, no nothin’ else. I feel okay, other than that. Old age is catchin’ up to me, but that’s normal, right?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, no other symptoms. And yes, a little wear and tear with age is perfectly normal. Okay Clarke, I'm just pulling up your chart now. I see you’ve been a patient here for a while. Have you had anything similar happen before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve had skin problems before, but nothin’ like this, I don’t think. Little rashes when I was a kid, but the doctor always just gave me some cream for ‘em. But these… these are different. Harder, and they hurt. I don’t remember ever havin’ bumps like this that hurt. My wife might remember, she’s got a better memory than me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, new symptoms, which is good to know. I’m going to take a look at your legs, if that’s alright with you. It will just be a quick exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. We’ll check the bumps, look at the surrounding skin, and I'll feel for any swelling or warmth. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I’m used to doctors lookin’ at me, old man like I am. Be gentle now, they’re sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There are multiple, raised, red papules primarily on the anterior shins. They are approximately 2-5 millimeters in diameter. There’s some mild tenderness to palpation, but no warmth or significant swelling. Skin appears otherwise normal, no signs of infection. I don't see any open sores or drainage. It does look like something irritative. Have you started using any new soaps, lotions, or detergents recently?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ new. Same old stuff I’ve been usin’ for years. I don’t use fancy soaps or nothin’. Just the regular bar soap from the store. And my wife does the laundry, so I don’t really know what she’s puttin’ in the wash. But she hasn’t changed nothin’ lately, I don’t think. She's pretty consistent with her routine.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given the location, the description of the bumps, and the lack of other symptoms, it’s likely these are stasis dermatitis or, possibly, some form of contact irritant dermatitis. However, given your age and medical history, we should rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count just to be on the safe side, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function. I also want to take a closer look at your circulation. Would you mind if I checked the pulses in your feet and ankles?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. My circulation… I dunno, never had any problems with it. But I ain't as young as I used to be. Go ahead and check it. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, your pulses are a little diminished, but present bilaterally. That's not uncommon at your age, but it's good to be aware of. We'll want to keep an eye on it. For now, I'm going to recommend a topical corticosteroid cream to reduce inflammation and relieve the discomfort. I’ll write you a prescription for triamcinolone 0.1% cream – apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice a day for two weeks. Also, try to avoid rubbing or scratching your shins. I'll also recommend keeping your legs elevated whenever possible, and wearing loose-fitting clothing. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure pills. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Been takin’ ‘em for years now. And the occasional pain reliever for my arthritis, but nothin’ regular. Just when it flares up real bad. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional pain relief for arthritis. Good to know. I'll make note of that. Given the CBC and BMP results, we’ll have a better idea if anything else is going on. I want to see you back in two weeks to check your progress. If the cream doesn't improve your symptoms, or if they worsen, please call us sooner. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Two weeks, right? And call if it gets worse. Sounds good. Thank you, Chriselda. I appreciate you lookin' at it. You're a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Clarke. I’m glad I could help. We'll get this figured out. I'll have the nurse print out the prescription and schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. She'll also give you some information about elevating your legs and recognizing signs of infection. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: .
