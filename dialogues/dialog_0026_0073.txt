DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the nurse. Severe diarrhea. It hasn't stopped for...well, it's been too long. I’ve tried everything the drugstore sells, and nothing works. Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for this.
DOCTOR: Yes, I saw the note. Severe diarrhea…and it’s been ongoing for a bit. You're right, we should get to the bottom of this. When you say "too long," could you give me a rough estimate of how many days it's been going on?
PATIENT: Honestly? I lost track after…maybe a week? It’s been awful. I’m a painter, you know? I can’t exactly…work when I’m running to the bathroom every fifteen minutes. It's interfering with my livelihood. And it's embarrassing, frankly.
DOCTOR: A week…that is quite a while. And I completely understand how disruptive that can be, especially with your work. It sounds incredibly frustrating. Besides the frequency, would you describe the diarrhea as watery, bloody, or something else?
PATIENT: Watery. Definitely watery. And…look, I don't need to go into detail with you, okay? It’s… unpleasant. It’s just…constant. I’ve barely eaten anything solid in days. I’m starting to feel weak.
DOCTOR: Of course, you don’t need to go into detail. I just ask to help understand what's happening. Watery is helpful to know. And you’re feeling weak, that’s concerning. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or abdominal pain along with this?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? Are you kidding? I have constant cramping. What do you think this is, some kind of leisurely stroll? And yes, I've been feverish. A low-grade one, but still. It comes and goes. Look, I'm not a doctor, I just know I feel terrible and nothing is helping. Can we just…get to the point? What are you going to do about it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if my questions feel slow. It’s important to gather as much information as possible to determine the best course of action. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’ll also check your hydration levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…hurry it up, please. I have things to do. And don't go poking around too much, alright? I'm not in the mood for unnecessary prodding.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I just need to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll quickly check your blood pressure and pulse. Okay. Your abdomen sounds…hyperactive, which isn’t surprising with the diarrhea. Your blood pressure is a little on the low side – 108/72 – and your pulse is 90, which is slightly elevated. It sounds like you might be a little dehydrated. Now, let me quickly check your skin turgor. Your skin turgor is also a bit diminished, which supports the possibility of dehydration.
PATIENT: Hey! Watch it! I told you to be gentle. Look, I get it, I'm a little dehydrated, but you didn't need to yank on my skin. What does this even mean? Are you going to give me an IV or what? Because frankly, I'm starting to feel worse just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Oh, I am so sorry. I didn’t mean to cause any discomfort. I was only trying to assess your hydration, and I clearly didn’t do it gently enough. My apologies. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it does sound like you’re dehydrated. The diarrhea and cramping, along with the low-grade fever, suggest a possible viral or bacterial gastroenteritis—an infection of the stomach and intestines. However, to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a stool sample to check for bacteria, parasites, and blood. Would you be able to collect a sample for me?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Are you serious? You want me to…go to the bathroom and then bring you the result? That's disgusting! Look, I already told you, I'm a painter, not a lab technician. And honestly, after all this, I’m starting to think I should just go to another doctor. This is ridiculous. Just give me something to stop the diarrhea, and I’ll be on my way. I don’t have time for…tests. .
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for any discomfort this process is causing. However, it's important to determine the cause of the diarrhea to ensure you receive the most effective treatment. Simply stopping the diarrhea without knowing the cause could mask a more serious underlying issue. Given your strong objections, I respect your decision. However, I must advise you that without further investigation, I cannot definitively diagnose the cause of your illness, and I can only offer symptomatic treatment. This means I can prescribe something to help control the diarrhea and rehydrate you, but I won’t be able to address the root cause if there is one. Would you like me to proceed with a prescription for an anti-diarrheal medication and a recommendation for oral rehydration solution?
