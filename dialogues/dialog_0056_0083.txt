DOCTOR: Hi Early, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s… Early Kammer, if you please. I need a little… something from you. A card, you understand? A “get well” card. Or maybe one with some… encouragement. My niece, she thinks I need one. She says it’ll… lift my spirits. I don't see why, but… she’s a good girl.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re looking for a card… from me, to help lift your spirits?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. From you, Doctor. With your… official stamp, you know? It’s important it comes from the doctor. Makes it… more real. My niece, she's very particular. She said a doctor’s words… they carry weight. I don’t make much of it myself, but… a man wants to please his niece, yes?
DOCTOR: Right. I see. So, just to clarify, you're not experiencing any specific health concerns you'd like me to address today?
PATIENT: Health concerns? No, no. Nothing like that. I feel… fine. Regular aches and pains for a man my age, you understand? Nothing a little liniment and a good nap can't fix. It’s not about being sick, Doctor. It’s about… morale. My niece thinks I’m feeling… down. And a card from a doctor… well, it’s supposed to help. She’s a smart girl, my niece. Very smart.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, I appreciate your niece looking out for you. While I typically provide medical care, and don't usually write motivational cards... I can certainly see how that might be helpful. Before I do anything, though, could you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Hmm. Like… like a retired man, I suppose. I keep busy. Little projects around the house. I used to work with boilers, you know? Big, powerful things. Stationary engineer, that was me. Now… I mostly watch the news. And try to keep the squirrels out of the bird feeder. It’s… a quiet life. Not unhappy, just… quiet. Is that what you mean, “generally”? I eat okay, I sleep okay. No complaints, really. Except for the squirrels. They’re a menace.
DOCTOR: That sounds… peaceful, Early. And it’s good that you’re keeping busy. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Not particularly. Some days I feel a little… slower, maybe. But that's just getting older, isn’t it? Like a machine that needs a bit of oil. I used to be able to climb all over those boilers, no problem. Now… I take the stairs a little slower. And I don't feel like doing as much gardening. But I still can do it. It takes a bit longer, that’s all. It’s not like I’m… bedridden or anything. My niece… she worries too much. She always has.
DOCTOR: I understand your niece is concerned. Sometimes, changes in energy levels or motivation can be linked to other things, even if they seem small. Have you been feeling sad or hopeless lately?
PATIENT: Hopeless? No, Doctor, not hopeless. Just… resigned, maybe. A man gets older, things change. You lose friends, you lose… opportunities. It’s life. It’s not something you get over, you just… accept it. Sad? Sometimes. Remembering old times, you know? But I wouldn’t say I’m sad. Just… thoughtful. And a little tired. All this thinking… it’s tiring work. Honestly, I just want my niece to stop fussing. That's why I thought a card from you would do the trick. She respects doctors. More than she respects me, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Early, it sounds like you’re going through a lot, even if you’re accepting of it. It's perfectly normal to feel these things when life changes. Have you ever spoken to anyone about how you’re feeling - a friend, family member, or perhaps a therapist?
PATIENT: Therapist? Goodness no. A man doesn't need a therapist. We used to fix boilers, you know? We fixed things with wrenches and gauges, not… talking. My wife… she tried to get me to see someone after her sister passed. Said I was… bottling things up. I just told her I was fine. A strong man handles his own problems. Besides, what would I even say to a therapist? "The squirrels are bothering me and my niece thinks I’m sad?" It sounds ridiculous. Honestly, I just want the card, Doctor. A little something to shut my niece up. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Early. I can certainly write a card for your niece. However, based on what you've told me, I also think it would be beneficial for you to talk to someone about how you’re feeling. And I say that not because you need to, but because it can be helpful. Would you be open to me providing you with some resources, like local support groups or mental health professionals, just in case?
PATIENT: Resources? Support groups? Doctor, with all due respect, I appreciate the thought, but I’m a practical man. I need a card, not a… a circle of people complaining about their problems. Look, I ran those boilers for thirty years. I dealt with pressure, with heat, with everything you can imagine. I can handle a few squirrels and a worried niece. I just want the card. A nice card, with your signature. That's all I’m asking. Please, Doctor. It’ll make my niece happy, and then she’ll leave me alone. It's a small thing. A very small thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Early. I understand. I will write a card for your niece. I’m going to quickly document our conversation. Then, I’ll write the card and you can take it with you. But, just as a precaution, I'm also going to provide you with a pamphlet containing information about local resources. No obligation to use them, of course, just in case you ever feel like talking to someone. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A pamphlet… well, alright. A pamphlet won’t hurt anyone. As long as it doesn’t involve… group therapy or anything like that. And thank you, Doctor. Thank you for understanding. It means a lot. A nice card, that’s all I ask. And a quick visit. I don’t want to take up your valuable time. You’ve got other patients, I’m sure. Very important patients. A nice card. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Early. I wrote, "Wishing Early all the best, and sending positive thoughts." I hope this makes your niece happy. And here's the pamphlet, just for information's sake. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: “Positive thoughts”… that’s… good. Very good. It sounds official. My niece will be pleased. Yes, very pleased. And thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind. No, no other questions. I believe that’s everything. I’ll be going now. And thank you… for not suggesting any… circles.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Early. It was nice meeting you. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day.
