DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s…rather embarrassing. I don’t usually talk about these things, you understand. But it’s been…a problem. A rather unpleasant problem. And frankly, I expect a bit of discretion. It’s…discharge. From…well, you can guess. It’s not my discharge, of course. It’s…someone else's.
DOCTOR: I see. Ms. Wartick, perhaps you could clarify?
PATIENT: Oh, don't look at me like that. It's my…companion. He’s…not feeling himself, shall we say? And I’m the one who has to…manage things. It’s just…appearing. And it's not a good color, Doctor. Not good at all. I’m quite certain it's something serious. He doesn’t want to come in himself, you see. Too proud, that one. But I think we need a professional opinion.
DOCTOR: I understand you're concerned about a discharge affecting your companion. To be clear, is this a human companion, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Human? Well, of course he is! What ever did you think? Honestly, Doctor, that's a rather…forward question. It’s Reginald. He's a lovely man, though a bit…delicate. And now this…this situation is just dreadful. I've tried everything - warm cloths, you know, the usual things. But nothing seems to help. It's becoming quite…distressing.
DOCTOR: Very well. To understand the situation better, Ms. Wartick, could you describe this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s…unpleasant, Doctor. Really quite unpleasant. It’s…yellowish, and…thick. And there's an odor. A rather…pungent odor. Not like anything one expects, certainly. And it’s staining his undergarments, which is simply mortifying. He’s terribly embarrassed, you see. And frankly, so am I. It’s not a gentlemanly thing to have, is it? I've never encountered anything like it before.
DOCTOR: And when did you first notice this discharge, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it must have been… about a week ago. Perhaps a little longer. It started very subtly, just a bit of dampness, really. I thought it was just…sweat, at first. But then it became…more pronounced. And the color… well, that’s when I knew something was terribly wrong. He hasn’t been himself since, you see. Moping about, refusing his sherry… it’s quite upsetting.
DOCTOR: Has Reginald experienced any other symptoms alongside this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, you ask the most personal questions! Well, yes, actually. He’s been…rather frequent in the lavatory, if you understand. And…a bit of a burning sensation, he says. Though he’s a stoic, you know. Doesn’t like to complain. And…he’s a bit tired, I suppose. But he’s always a bit tired. Honestly, I don't know what's normal with him anymore. It's probably just old age, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, while I appreciate your candor, it is important to gather as much information as possible. Has Reginald experienced any fever, chills, or pain in his lower back or abdomen?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, honestly. Fever? Chills? He's a gentleman, not a…a wild animal! He might complain of a slight…discomfort, perhaps. But nothing serious. And pain? Absolutely not. He's far too proud to admit to pain. Besides, if it were that bad, he'd tell me, wouldn't he? He’s very communicative, when he wants to be. I just think it’s…a little something. A minor irritation. You doctors always make such a fuss over everything. It’s probably just a touch of the…the dampness, you know? We’ve had a lot of rain lately.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, with all due respect, dismissing potential symptoms is not in Reginald’s best interest. Now, has he had any changes in his urinary habits - difficulty urinating, increased frequency, or urgency?
PATIENT: Urinary habits?! Doctor, really! Must we delve into every detail? Honestly! Well…yes, now that you mention it, he has been going to the lavatory rather more frequently. And…it takes him a bit longer, I suppose. He sort of…strains. But that’s just…old age, isn’t it? Men get like that, you know. Weak bladders and all that. I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. Just a little…inconvenience. You’re not suggesting…something serious, are you? Because Reginald is a very proud man.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I assure you, I’m simply trying to gather enough information to determine the cause of Reginald’s discomfort. Has he experienced any blood in his urine or stool?
PATIENT: Blood?! Oh, goodness gracious! No, Doctor, absolutely not! If there were blood, I would have noticed immediately! That would be…unacceptable! Honestly, you’re frightening me now. Reginald is a perfectly healthy man, mostly. He enjoys his sherry, you know, and a good biscuit. He wouldn’t have blood in his…anywhere! That's…that's just…ghastly! Are you suggesting he’s…dying? Because I won’t have that! He needs to see his garden bloom this year. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your concern. However, without a proper examination, I cannot determine the cause of Reginald’s symptoms. I recommend a urinalysis and a physical examination. Would you be willing to allow me to examine Reginald?
