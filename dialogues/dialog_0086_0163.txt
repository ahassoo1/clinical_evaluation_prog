DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Vantine. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, thank you, Doctor. It’s good of you to see me. Well, to be perfectly frank, it’s about a diet I’ve been… experimenting with. A rather foolish one, I suspect, now that I think about it. It’s all the rage with some of the younger artists, you see, and I thought, well, perhaps I could benefit. It involves… well, it’s rather restrictive, and I’m beginning to feel rather weak.
DOCTOR: Restrictive, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. Extremely so. It’s called the… oh, let me see… the “Lunar Cycle Diet”, I believe. It’s based on… well, the phases of the moon, and what one is allowed to eat during each phase. Quite preposterous, really, when one considers it logically, but the testimonials were… persuasive. I’ve been on it for three weeks now, and frankly, my energy levels are quite depleted. I used to be able to work a full twelve-hour day in the studio, now… well, now I need a nap halfway through even thinking about a project.
DOCTOR: The Lunar Cycle Diet... I haven't encountered that one before. And three weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, three weeks precisely. Starting on the new moon, as one must, naturally. It involved a great deal of grapefruit for the first phase, if you can imagine. And then… well, then it was mostly air, I believe. Or felt like it, at least. I'm terribly sorry to take up your time with this nonsense, Doctor. I feel rather silly admitting I fell for such a thing. But some of the younger animators swear by it for… “detoxing,” I believe they call it. Though I’ve never quite understood what needs detoxing in a perfectly healthy system.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, please don't apologize. It's my job to understand what's going on with your health, regardless of how it started. “Detoxing” is a rather… loosely defined term. Let’s focus on how you’re feeling. Aside from the weakness, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Well… let me see. My digestion has been… irregular, to put it mildly. And I’ve found myself quite irritable, I'm afraid. Snapping at poor Elsie, my housekeeper, which is most unlike me. And my hands… they’ve been trembling slightly when I’m trying to do delicate work. It’s making animation rather difficult, naturally. I do a great deal of stop-motion, you see, and a steady hand is absolutely crucial. It’s rather alarming, actually, when one thinks about it. I’ve always prided myself on my control and precision.
DOCTOR: Irregular digestion, irritability, hand tremors… alright. And have you noticed any changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Yes, a rather significant one, actually. I’ve lost… well, Elsie weighed me this morning, and I was down nearly ten pounds since starting this diet. Which, on the surface, might seem positive, but I wasn’t trying to lose weight. I’m already quite lean, you see. I maintain a rather active lifestyle, even at my age, with all the work in the studio. It's a rather unsettling weight loss, if I’m honest. It feels… unhealthy, somehow. I'm typically around 150 pounds, Elsie says I’m now 140. A rather worrying drop, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Yes, a ten-pound weight loss unintentionally over three weeks is concerning, particularly with the other symptoms you’re describing. Alright, Mr. Vantine, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological check. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Quite sensible, actually. I haven’t had a thorough examination in… oh, goodness, I can’t even recall when. Elsie usually insists on a yearly check-up, but I always manage to put it off. Rather foolish of me, I suppose. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment implicitly. I'm quite certain it's all rather simple, but it’s best to be certain, isn't it? Lead the way, and I shall endeavor to cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just step onto the scale for me, please. And then we’ll move on to blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Certainly. There we are. Though Elsie’s scale is usually more accurate, I suspect. She has a rather modern digital one. Still, yours will do nicely for comparison. I do hope I’m not being too much of a bother, Doctor. I simply wanted to… nip this foolishness in the bud before it became a genuine problem.
DOCTOR: 138 pounds. That confirms what Elsie said. Blood pressure is 118 over 72, pulse is 68. Both within normal limits for your age. Now, if you’ll just sit here, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s rather cool in here, isn’t it? Not unpleasant, mind you, but I do tend to feel the chill more readily these days. I used to be able to work in rather drafty studios without a second thought. Deep breath… yes, perfectly happy to cooperate. I’ve always found the human body to be a rather remarkable machine, even with all its… eccentricities.
DOCTOR: Lungs sound clear, heart sounds regular. No murmurs or abnormal sounds. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes and balance. If you could sit in this chair and extend your arms, please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I trust my reflexes haven’t completely deserted me yet. I still manage a rather brisk game of croquet, you see, and that requires a certain degree of… responsiveness. Though my opponent, young Timothy, is remarkably agile. He insists on running around the wickets like a madman. Proceed at your leisure, and I shall endeavor to remain still. A rather foolish pastime, croquet, perhaps, but it keeps the mind active, I find.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within an acceptable range for your age. Now, just follow my finger with your eyes, please. Don't strain.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… rather hypnotic, isn’t it? Following a moving object like this. I used to be rather adept at stop-motion animation, and that required an intense focus on minute details. Though I suspect my eyes aren’t quite as sharp as they once were. They tire rather easily these days, particularly after prolonged work. Is everything satisfactory? Do you require me to focus on any particular point?
DOCTOR: Eye movements are normal, no nystagmus or other abnormalities. Alright, Mr. Vantine, that concludes the physical exam. Everything appears… relatively normal, but given your weight loss, irritability, and hand tremors, coupled with the restrictive diet, I suspect we’re dealing with a case of malnutrition and dehydration. Do you have any known allergies, or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No known allergies, Doctor. None whatsoever. And I’m not currently taking any medications. I pride myself on maintaining a rather… natural lifestyle, you see. I’ve always been rather skeptical of pharmaceuticals, preferring to rely on good food and plenty of rest. Though, admittedly, I haven't been getting much of either lately, thanks to this… Lunar Cycle Diet. It was Elsie who insisted on a check-up, fearing I was becoming… unhinged. She has a remarkably practical mind, that woman. Is malnutrition and dehydration a serious concern, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It is a concern, Mr. Vantine, yes. Especially at your age. While it's not immediately life-threatening, prolonged malnutrition can lead to muscle weakness, fatigue, a weakened immune system, and even heart problems. The irritability and tremors are likely symptoms of electrolyte imbalances caused by the dehydration and poor diet. We’ll need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture of your electrolyte levels and overall health, but I’m fairly confident that’s what we’re dealing with. The first step is to immediately stop this diet. It’s clearly doing more harm than good.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I suspected as much. Elsie was quite adamant, you see. "Foolishness," she called it. And I suppose she was right. To think I, Jarvis Vantine, a man of science and artistry, falling for such… nonsense. Very well, Doctor. I shall cease this… Lunar Cycle experiment immediately. What do you recommend? Should I simply return to a normal diet? And are there any particular foods you suggest I focus on to… restore my electrolytes and rebuild my strength? Elsie is an excellent cook, you know, but she tends to favor rather… hearty fare. I wouldn't want to shock her system as well.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s the most important thing. For now, focus on reintroducing a balanced diet with plenty of fluids. Electrolytes are key. Things like bananas, oranges, and potatoes are good sources of potassium. You’ll want to ensure you’re getting enough sodium as well – a little salt in your diet is okay, especially given the dehydration. Avoid sugary drinks and processed foods, as those can actually worsen dehydration. We'll get the lab results back within a few hours. Depending on those, we may need to consider an electrolyte replacement drink, but let's wait and see. For now, focus on eating regular, nutritious meals, and drink plenty of water. And please, avoid any further restrictive diets. Elsie sounds like a wonderful cook. Perhaps she can prepare some potassium-rich smoothies?
PATIENT: Smoothies! Elsie would never dream of it, Doctor. She's a firm believer in proper, substantial meals. But I shall endeavor to persuade her. Perhaps a potassium-rich shepherd's pie? It’s a long shot, admittedly. The shepherd's pie is probably not the ideal solution. But I shall certainly encourage a more… balanced approach to her cooking. And I shall drink plenty of water, as you advise. It's remarkably simple, really, isn't it? Proper food, and plenty of fluids. To think I nearly ruined my health chasing after the phases of the moon. Very well, Doctor. I shall follow your instructions to the letter. And I thank you for your… gentle rebuke. Elsie will be pleased, I assure you. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any warning signs I should look out for? Or perhaps a pamphlet on electrolyte replacement? Just in case Elsie refuses to consider the smoothie option.
DOCTOR: No, a pamphlet isn't necessary just yet. Just listen to your body. If you experience any muscle cramping, weakness, dizziness, or confusion, contact me immediately. And if your heart rate becomes irregular or you feel any chest pain, go to the emergency room. As for Elsie, it sounds like she has good intentions. Perhaps you can gently encourage her to incorporate some fruits and vegetables into her cooking alongside her hearty meals. It doesn't need to be a drastic change. Otherwise, just focus on getting enough rest and rebuilding your strength. And please, no more lunar cycles. We'll get you back to your stop-motion animation in no time. We'll review the lab results as soon as they're available. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You've been most… thorough and reassuring. And I shall endeavor to heed your advice, particularly regarding the lunar cycles. Elsie will be relieved to hear that. She has a rather pragmatic view of the cosmos. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I shall leave you to your important work. And I shall inform Elsie that smoothies may, just may, be on the menu. Oh, and Doctor? Perhaps you could recommend a good book on the history of animation? Something to occupy my mind while I recover? It's a small request, but I find a little intellectual stimulation rather… restorative.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Vantine. I’ll see if I can find something suitable for you. Rest well, and please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns. .
