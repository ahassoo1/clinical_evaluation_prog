DOCTOR: Bonjour, Elijiah. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hey, Dr. Panjoj, nice to meet you too. It’s… well, it’s kinda embarrassing, actually. I’m havin’ a real hard time gettin’ out of chairs these days. Like, I sit down, no problem, but then… stuck. It’s been goin’ on for a couple weeks now, and it’s makin’ things tough at work.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not embarrassing at all to seek help, Elijiah. Many people experience difficulty with movement. A couple weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, about two weeks. Started kinda slow, just felt a little stiff, you know? Thought I just slept wrong. But it’s gotten worse. Now it’s… a real struggle. Especially after a long shift. I work out in the oil fields, so I’m sittin’ in trucks a lot, then tryin’ to get up after… well, you get it. It’s not a good combo.
DOCTOR: The oil fields, right. That does sound like it could contribute. And you’re experiencing this specifically with rising from a chair, after prolonged sitting?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. Like, walkin' around all day isn't too bad, and gettin' into a chair is fine. It’s that first push-up kinda move when I gotta stand. It feels like… somethin’s locked up, and I gotta really work at it. Sometimes I even gotta ask someone to give me a hand, which… I don't like doin’. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. And is this accompanied by any pain, Elijiah?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really pain, exactly. More like… a really bad stiffness. And a kinda weak feelin’ in my legs when I try to push off. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain, or anything. Just… resistence. Like somethin’ is holdin’ me back. It’s mostly in my thighs, I think. Maybe my knees a little too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just so I can get a better idea of what’s going on. We’ll check your range of motion, muscle strength, and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need. I just wanna figure out what’s goin’ on, so I can get back to work. I got bills to pay, you know? So, yeah, let’s do it. Just tell me what I gotta do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, could you please stand and try to rise from this chair, as you normally would?
PATIENT: Okay. There. That’s… pretty much how it happens. Slow, and kinda shaky. Gotta really push. It feels like it's comin' from my legs, mostly.
DOCTOR: I see. And I’m feeling some slight resistance here on both thighs, but no acute tenderness. Now, could you please sit back down?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s easier goin’ down, like I said. But gettin’ back up… that’s the problem. It’s just… not smooth. Feels like somethin’ is tight. Like a rubber band pullin’ on my legs.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes appear normal. Now, I’m going to have you do a few simple squats, if you're comfortable with that. Just as low as you can comfortably go, and we’ll see how that feels. Stop if you experience any pain.
PATIENT: That's… about as low as I can comfortably go right now. Feels like I’m gonna fall over if I go any lower. And it's definitely makin’ it harder to get back up. Like… I can feel it strainin' somethin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Now, can you please straighten your legs out in front of you while lying flat on the examination table?
PATIENT: Like this? It's a little uncomfortable, but I can do it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your range of motion seems generally good, but there is some tightness in the hamstrings. Now, I'm going to palpate your lower back. Just let me know if anything feels particularly sensitive.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. It’s kinda hard to relax when I’m thinkin’ about gettin’ stuck in a chair, but I’ll try. Just let me know if you feel anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. There's some mild muscle tightness in your lower back, but no acute tenderness. Based on what I’m seeing and hearing, it sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of hamstring tightness, quadriceps weakness, and potentially some lower back muscle strain. It’s likely contributing to your difficulty rising from a chair. This is fairly common, especially with physically demanding work. Would you say that you have been stretching regularly?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, I warm up a little before work, but it ain’t a full stretch routine, if that’s what you mean. Mostly just kinda bendin’ and twistin’ to loosen up. I usually just jump right into it, to be honest. Time is money, you know? I figure I’m young enough that I can push through it. Didn’t really think stretchin' would make that much of a difference. Sounds like I was wrong.
DOCTOR: It's a common misconception. Stretching and strengthening exercises can make a significant difference in preventing and managing these types of issues. It sounds like you've likely developed some muscle imbalances over time. I recommend a course of physical therapy to address these imbalances, learn proper stretching techniques, and strengthen your core and leg muscles. I can provide a referral. It is also important to improve your posture and make sure you are lifting objects correctly at work. Would you be open to a physical therapy referral?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. I mean, I don’t wanna be stuck like this forever. If stretchin’ and some exercises can help, I’m all for it. A referral sounds great. I just… how long is that gonna take? I gotta get back to work, you know? I can’t be off for weeks. I got bills to pay. Is it gonna put me out of commission for a long time?
DOCTOR: It's hard to say exactly, Elijiah, as it depends on your individual progress and the severity of your condition. However, most people experience noticeable improvement within a few weeks. The initial sessions will focus on pain management and restoring range of motion. We can tailor the program to minimize disruption to your work schedule. Many therapists offer early morning or evening appointments to accommodate busy schedules. I can also provide you with some simple exercises you can do at home to supplement your therapy sessions. I'll write a note for your employer explaining the situation and the limitations, if necessary. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that would be great. A note for my employer would be really helpful. I don’t wanna lose my job over this. And yeah, any exercises I can do at home, I’m all for it. I just… I need to get back to work. So, the quicker the better, you know? What kinda exercises are we talkin’ about?
DOCTOR: These are some basic exercises you can start with. Remember to listen to your body and stop if you experience any pain. Focus on proper form rather than pushing yourself too hard. We’ll go over them again during your first physical therapy session. The handout also includes instructions on proper lifting techniques. I am also prescribing a course of over-the-counter ibuprofen, 600mg three times a day as needed for discomfort. Do you have any allergies to NSAIDs?
PATIENT: Nah, no allergies. I can handle ibuprofen. I take it sometimes for my back when I really mess it up. These exercises… they don’t look too bad. I can probably fit these into my schedule. I gotta be careful liftin' stuff at work, that's for sure. I usually rush through it, try to get it done as fast as possible. But I guess I gotta slow down a little. Alright. So, referral to physical therapy, ibuprofen, and these exercises. Anything else I need to know? What's the next step?
DOCTOR: The physical therapy clinic will contact you to schedule an appointment. They will assess your condition and develop a personalized treatment plan. I've included a note for your employer explaining the situation and outlining any work restrictions. It’s important to follow the instructions from your physical therapist and take the ibuprofen as directed. If you experience any worsening symptoms or develop new concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that covers everything. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything, Dr. Panjoj. Hopefully, this physical therapy stuff works. I just wanna get back to normal. Thanks again. I’ll go give ‘em a call and see about gettin’ an appointment. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Elijiah. I’m confident you’ll see improvement with physical therapy. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
