DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… my sinuses, I think. They been… bothering me. It’s hard to say exactly what is bothering me, though. It’s been a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay. "A little while" – can you tell me roughly how long we're talking?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a good question. Maybe… two, three weeks? It feels longer, but my husband, he keeps track of things better than me. I just know it’s not a new thing. It’s not like it just started yesterday.
DOCTOR: Alright, two or three weeks. And what does “bothering” feel like?
PATIENT: Um… like pressure. A lot of pressure, right here. <points to her forehead and cheeks> And sometimes… a little bit of a headache. Not a bad headache, but… annoying. And maybe a little stuffy? It’s hard to explain. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure in your forehead and cheeks, some stuffiness, and a mild headache. Do you have any drainage from your nose – is it clear, cloudy, or any color?
PATIENT: Drainage… hmm. Sometimes, yes. When I blow my nose… it’s… clear, I think. Maybe a little bit white? It's not much, Doctor. Not like a bad cold. It’s just… there. I don’t really pay attention to it, if that makes sense. It doesn’t hurt or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly clear, maybe a little white drainage. Have you had a fever, or felt generally unwell at all – tired, achy, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. I feel… normal, mostly. A little tired, maybe, but I always feel a little tired. I work long hours, you know? And it’s been hot. I don’t think that helps. Not achy, no. Just… this pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you had sinus problems before, or any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. I… I don't really remember. I’ve been sick, of course, everyone gets sick. But… sinus problems? Maybe. I think so? It was a long time ago. My husband would know better. I don’t really go to the doctor much. <shrugs slightly> I try to avoid it, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, we can work with that. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never been told I have allergies. Sometimes, when the flowers bloom, I sneeze a little bit, but everyone sneezes when the flowers bloom, right? I don't get really sick from it, just a few sneezes. Nothing like… stopping me from working.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any medications you're currently taking, even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Sometimes, if my head really hurts, I take… Tylenol, I think? The regular kind. But not often. And sometimes a vitamin, a multi-vitamin, but I forget to take it most days. It's been a busy summer. I don't take anything regularly, Doctor. Nothing for my sinuses, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick exam. I'm just going to listen to your lungs, feel around your face to check your sinuses, and look inside your nose. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. <nods slightly> Just tell me if it will be… uncomfortable. I’m not good with surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Your lungs sound clear. Now, pressing here… any tenderness?
PATIENT: Yes… a little bit. Right here. <points to her right cheekbone> It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And maybe a little bit on this side too. <points to her left cheekbone, but more tentatively> It’s hard to say, Doctor. It’s just a general pressure. It feels better when I don't touch it though.
DOCTOR: Okay, and let me just take a look inside your nose… hmm. There's some mild swelling of the nasal passages, and some clear mucus. No signs of infection at this point. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve seen, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis, possibly a viral infection causing some inflammation. It's not severe, and doesn't seem to be a bacterial infection at this time. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Sinus…itis? Yes… I think so. So… not too bad? Is that what you’re saying? <looks hopeful> Not something I need… shots or anything? I’m really not good with needles, Doctor. It just… sounds complicated. A virus… I understand that, I think. My husband got a virus last winter. Is it like that?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It’s not severe, and no, you definitely don’t need shots or anything like that. It sounds similar to a common cold virus, just localized in your sinuses. We'll treat it symptomatically. I recommend over-the-counter saline nasal sprays to keep your nasal passages moist and help clear the mucus. You can also continue taking Tylenol as needed for the headache and pressure. And drink plenty of fluids. I also want you to monitor your symptoms. If you develop a fever, severe facial pain, or the drainage becomes thick and colored – yellow or green – then come back and see me right away, as that could indicate a bacterial infection that needs antibiotics. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. Saline spray… I think I’ve seen that at the store. And drink water, yes. I can do that. <nods firmly> And if I get a fever… or the stuff gets colorful, I’ll come back. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel… much better. Is there anything else I need to do? Should I stay home from work? I don't want to get anyone else sick.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. As long as you're feeling up to it, you don't necessarily need to stay home, but try to practice good hygiene – wash your hands frequently, and avoid close contact with others as much as possible. Since you're not experiencing a fever, it's less likely to be contagious. But it’s a good idea to be mindful. I will write you a note for work explaining you have an upper respiratory infection and recommending you practice good hygiene. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, a note for work? That is very kind of you, Doctor. That will be very helpful. <smiles gratefully> No, I think that is everything. Thank you so much for your time. You have been very patient with me, and I feel much better knowing what is going on. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad I could help. Get some rest, stay hydrated, and don’t hesitate to come back if your symptoms worsen. Have a good day. .
