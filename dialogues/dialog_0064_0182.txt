DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, you know. It’s about this… procedure. My daughter insisted I get a check-up before I go through with it. Says the surgeon needs it. Terrazzo work, it’s hard on the body. Not like sitting behind a desk all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to rush. A check-up before a procedure is always a good idea – your daughter sounds very sensible. Terrazzo work, you say?
PATIENT: Sensible enough to nag, anyway. Yes, terrazzo. Fifty years I’ve been doing it. Fifty years of kneeling, grinding, polishing… it takes a toll. And now this… sagging skin. It’s unsightly, that’s what it is. I just want it fixed and to be done with it. Are we getting anywhere here, or are you just going to type on that machine all morning?
DOCTOR: I am getting somewhere, Mr. Orwin. I was just pulling up your chart to see what information we have already. It seems we don’t have much documented… which is perfectly alright. We’ll just have to get a good history from you. Fifty years is a long time, and it’s understandable your body is feeling it. So, this “sagging skin”… where exactly are you noticing this?
PATIENT: It’s… everywhere, really. But mostly around the neck. And the stomach. It wasn’t always like this, you know. Used to be quite trim. Now it just… hangs. I don’t want a full overhaul, just… tightened up. Is that too much to ask? And please, don’t start asking about my diet. I eat perfectly well. For a man my age.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're concerned about skin laxity in your neck and abdominal areas. And you're right to want to address it. We can certainly discuss options for tightening things up. And no, I won’t pry into your diet, sir. Let’s focus on what’s bothering you. Now, has this skin laxity changed recently, or has it been a gradual process over time?
PATIENT: Gradual, of course gradual. Do you think I woke up one morning looking like… well, never mind. It’s been getting worse for the last few years, I suppose. Since I slowed down on the work. Not as much lifting, you see. Everything starts to… droop when you don't use it. Like an old flag. Are we getting close to figuring out if I can actually have this done? Because I haven't got time for a lot of back and forth.
DOCTOR: Alright, gradual onset… that's helpful. And you’re right, inactivity can contribute to skin laxity. We'll need to assess the extent of it to see what options are appropriate. To get a better understanding, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Honestly? Yes. A little. Maybe ten pounds in the last year. Not from overeating, mind you. Just… less activity. And the metabolism slows down when you get to be my age. It’s simple biology. I don’t appreciate you dwelling on this, though. It’s not like I’m morbidly obese or something. Just a bit of extra padding. Can we get on with it, please? The examination, or whatever you need to do?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. No need to get frustrated. Ten pounds is good to know, and you're right, metabolism does slow down with age. I just want to get a complete picture. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Hmph. Finally. Get it over with. And try not to poke too much. My skin is sensitive, you know. Fifty years of dust and grit… it takes a toll. Let’s just get this done.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to take a look at your neck and abdomen. Please lie back on the exam table. I'll gently palpate those areas. Skin is indeed somewhat loose in the neck and abdominal regions, as you described. I also notice some mild wrinkling. No tenderness to palpation. And your abdominal wall feels…soft. Not significantly distended. Okay, that gives me a good initial assessment.
PATIENT: Soft? What does "soft" even mean? Are you implying something? Look, I may be a bit… rounder these days, but I’m perfectly healthy. I still work, you know. Not as much as I used to, but I’m not bedridden. And stop poking! It's undignified. So, what does all this "assessment" mean? Can I actually have this procedure or not? This is ridiculous. I’ve wasted enough of my time here already.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my phrasing was unclear, Mr. Orwin. When I say "soft," I simply mean there isn’t significant muscle rigidity or hardness. It’s a normal finding, and doesn't indicate anything negative. Based on my examination, you are a candidate for skin tightening procedures, but there are a few things we need to consider. Given your age and history, a full surgical lift might not be the best option. We could discuss non-surgical options like radiofrequency or ultrasound treatments, or perhaps a mini-lift. However, I’d like to get a baseline EKG just to ensure there are no underlying cardiac issues before proceeding with any procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: EKG? What’s that even for? More poking and prodding? Listen, I’m not keen on all this… machinery. I just want a little tightening, not a full medical workup. My daughter will have a fit if I start getting hooked up to wires. Is an EKG absolutely necessary? Can’t we just… try one of these “radiofrequency” things? I want the quickest, easiest option. Honestly, this is more trouble than it’s worth.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Orwin. An EKG is a very quick and painless test – just a few sensors placed on your chest to check your heart rhythm. It’s a standard precaution for any procedure, even minimally invasive ones, and it helps us ensure your safety. It’s simply a responsible step to take given your age and to rule out any underlying cardiac issues that might impact the procedure or recovery. Radiofrequency can be a good option, but we need that EKG first. It's a very small precaution. I can explain the procedure in more detail while we wait for the results. It doesn't take long at all, and it could save us a lot of trouble down the line. Would you be willing to proceed with the EKG?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Do it. Get it over with. But if it takes all day, I’m leaving. And don't expect me to be cheerful about it. Honestly, the hassle… it’s just not worth it. Just get it done quickly, and then tell me if I can get this sagging skin fixed or not. And try not to make a fuss. I have better things to do. This is ridiculous. Truly ridiculous. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I'll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. It will just take a few minutes. Please lie back on the table, and I’ll attach these sensors to your chest and limbs. Just relax, and breathe normally. Now, let’s just get this started...
