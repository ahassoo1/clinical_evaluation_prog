DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won't stop. It's been over two days now, and it's starting to get really annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups that have been going on for two days. That is quite persistent. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. They started…Tuesday afternoon, I think. I was having lunch with a friend, and I laughed pretty hard at a story she told. And then…hic…they just started. At first, it was just a few, spaced out. But now, hic…they're almost constant. It doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing. I tried drinking water really fast, like people say, and holding my breath, but nothing’s working.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they started Tuesday after a good laugh, and haven’t really subsided despite trying some common remedies. And you're saying they are pretty much constant now, regardless of activity?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Constant. I was hoping they'd just go away on their own, you know? But hic…no such luck. It's exhausting, honestly. I haven't slept well since it started. It interrupts everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can certainly be disruptive to your sleep and daily life. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Besides interrupting your sleep, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. Hic… just the hiccups. No pain, no heartburn, no…nothing else. I feel fine otherwise, just tired from hic…well, you know. And maybe a little frustrated. I’m a bit worried it’s something serious, if that makes sense. It feels…unusual to have hiccups for this long.
DOCTOR: That's a reasonable concern, and it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. We’ll definitely explore potential causes. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of, like problems with your heart, lungs, or stomach?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. Hic…just for check-ups, years ago. My divorce was…difficult, and things sort of fell by the wayside. I don't smoke, and I only drink socially. I try to eat healthy, mostly. I used to walk a lot more, but…well, things have changed. Hic.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant medical history, you don't smoke, and only social alcohol use. And it sounds like your activity level has decreased recently. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not even vitamins. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Hic… I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it, and it’s not regular. Maybe once or twice a month, if that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, including over-the-counter. And infrequent ibuprofen use. Okay. Now, I'm going to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Hic… Just get rid of these things, please. I feel a bit silly, but it’s really getting to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft. I don't feel any tenderness or abnormalities. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. Everything seems within normal limits on initial examination. It doesn’t seem like anything obvious is going on. Given the duration and lack of other symptoms, and the normal physical exam, we should consider some possible underlying causes. Prolonged hiccups can sometimes be related to nerve irritation, acid reflux, or even certain medications, although you’ve said you aren’t taking any. It's also possible it's just a persistent, benign case. To rule out some of the more common possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. Also, I'd like to get an EKG, just to check your heart rhythm, as a precaution. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds…thorough. If it’ll help figure out what’s going on, then yes, please. I'd rather know what's causing this than just hic…keep hiccuping forever. Blood tests and…an EKG? Is that a long process? I don’t like hospitals, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about hospitals – many people feel the same way. The EKG is very quick and painless. It involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. It takes about five minutes. The blood tests will also be relatively quick, and we can do both right here in the clinic. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to suggest a few things you can try at home. Try sipping small amounts of water frequently throughout the day, and avoid carbonated beverages. Also, try holding your breath for about 10-15 seconds several times a day. While these haven’t worked so far, sometimes they can provide some relief. If the hiccups continue despite these measures, and the blood tests are normal, we may consider a referral to a gastroenterologist, to rule out any digestive issues. But let's start with the tests and see what they reveal. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Small sips of water, hold my breath… I've already tried holding my breath, hic… but I'll keep trying. And the tests… okay. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. I just want this to stop. Hic. Where do we start with the tests?
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood for the CBC and metabolic panel. Then, she'll set you up for the EKG, which will be done right here in the examination room. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we'll discuss them and the next steps. It usually takes about an hour for the results to come back. In the meantime, please let me know if you experience any new symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or difficulty swallowing. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just…hic…get this over with, please. I appreciate you listening to me, Doctor. And thank you for not thinking I’m crazy for being so bothered by hiccups. Hic. It’s just… exhausting.
DOCTOR: You’re not crazy at all, Ivette. Persistent hiccups are exhausting and frustrating, and you're right to want to get to the bottom of it. I’m happy to help in any way I can. The nurse will be with you shortly. I'll be right next door if you need anything. Just press the call button.
