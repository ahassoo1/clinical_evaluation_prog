DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Coby's the name. Look, it’s the heat, alright? This summer’s been… something else. I can’t even stand being outside for five minutes without feeling like I’m gonna melt. Never used to be like this, you know? I’ve built houses in the sun my whole life. Now? Forget it. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I see. So you're experiencing increased sensitivity to the heat, and it’s impacting your ability to work. That’s certainly concerning, especially given your history of working outdoors. When did you first notice this change, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez, let me think… It started last year, maybe? Spring, I reckon. Didn't think much of it at first. Just figured it was a particularly warm spell. But it’s gotten worse every month since. This year is… well, it’s bad. I tried to do some roofing last week, and I had to stop after barely an hour. Felt like my brain was frying. Honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing. A man shouldn't be beat by the sun.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're paying attention to these changes, Mr. Coby, and seeking medical attention. It’s not embarrassing to acknowledge your limits, especially when it involves your health. Can you describe what you feel when you’re exposed to the heat?
PATIENT: Well, it's not just… hot, you know? It’s like… a heavy feeling. Head gets all foggy. And I get dizzy. Real dizzy. Sweating, of course, buckets of it. But even with the sweat, I feel… parched. Like I haven’t had water in days. And my heart starts thumpin’ like a drum. It’s just… unpleasant. Makes me feel weak, like I’m gonna collapse. It’s not like a sunburn or somethin’. It’s… inside hot. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Coby. It sounds quite concerning. The dizziness, heavy feeling, and rapid heartbeat, along with the intense thirst despite sweating… those are important symptoms. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with these episodes?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like vomitin'. Though sometimes my stomach feels… unsettled, you know? Like when you're on a boat and get a bit seasick, but nothin’ actually happens. Just a queasy feelin'. And my appetite's been off, to be honest. Haven't been eatin' much lately. Just don’t feel hungry, even when I know I should. It’s probably the heat, though. Who wants a big meal when it's 90 degrees out?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, but it's good to note the decreased appetite, especially alongside the other symptoms. Mr. Coby, I see here you have a history of hypertension, diagnosed about ten years ago. Is that currently well-controlled with medication?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, the blood pressure. Doc put me on somethin’ for that years ago. Lisinopril, I think it is. And yeah, it's usually alright. I take it every morning, like I'm supposed to. I get it checked twice a year at the clinic, and they always say it's good. Haven't had any trouble with it, usually. But I wonder… could that be somethin’ to do with this heat thing? Seems kinda coincidental, now that you mention it.
DOCTOR: It’s certainly possible, Mr. Coby. Lisinopril, and other blood pressure medications, can sometimes affect your body's ability to regulate temperature and fluid balance. It's also possible the heat is exacerbating your hypertension, leading to these symptoms. Do you recall if these symptoms started after you began taking the Lisinopril, or were they present beforehand?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. Let me think… I started the Lisinopril, oh, must be twelve, thirteen years ago? And honestly, I don’t recall feelin’ this bad back then. I was still workin’ hard, plenty of sun. The heat stuff… like I said, it started last year. So, I guess it wasn't right after startin’ the pills. But I was younger then, you know? Maybe my body was tougher. And maybe the pills are workin’ differently now? I don’t know. This is makin’ my head spin. I just want to be able to work again.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Coby. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly what's going on, and it's good you’re trying to recall as much detail as possible. Let's move on to some other questions, then. Have you noticed any changes in your urine output?
PATIENT: Urine output? You mean, pee? Well… now that you mention it… I’ve been goin’ to the bathroom a lot more often, I suppose. Always feel like I gotta go. And it seems… lighter in color, you know? Not dark and strong like it usually is. Just kinda pale. Didn’t think much of it, figured I was drinkin’ more water to try and beat the heat. But maybe that's somethin’? Honestly, Doc, I ain’t one for payin’ attention to… bodily functions, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Coby. It’s perfectly normal not to be meticulously aware of those details. However, increased urination and lighter-colored urine can be significant, especially with the other symptoms you’re experiencing. It could indicate your kidneys are working harder to regulate fluid balance, or it could point to other underlying issues. Now, do you have any history of kidney problems in your family?
PATIENT: Kidney problems… let me see. My mother, she had… some kinda trouble with her legs swellin' up when she got older. Doc always said it was her heart, but I always wondered if it wasn't her kidneys. And my uncle, on my father's side, he was always kinda sickly. Didn't live a long life. But I don't know if that was kidneys, or somethin’ else. They didn't have much in the way of proper doctors back then. Everything was just… a general sickness, if you know what I mean. Not like now with all the fancy tests and whatnot.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s often difficult to get a clear picture of family history with limited information. Now, I’d like to ask about any other medications or supplements you are taking, including over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ like recreational drugs. Never been one for that nonsense. Drink a beer now and then with the boys, especially in the summer to cool off, but that's about it. Maybe one or two a week, if that. And no, I don’t smoke. Quit years ago, best thing I ever did. As for medications… just the Lisinopril, like I said. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, especially after a long day of work. Over-the-counter stuff, you know? And occasionally, if my stomach’s botherin’ me, I’ll take some antacids. That’s about it. Nothing fancy. I try to keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information, Mr. Coby. Given your history of hypertension, the recent worsening of symptoms with heat exposure – including dizziness, fatigue, increased urination, light-colored urine, and decreased appetite – I’d like to perform a physical exam. I want to check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and palpate your abdomen. We'll also check for signs of dehydration and edema. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds sensible, Doc. Go ahead. I figured you'd want to poke around a bit. Just get it over with, eh? I just wanna know what’s goin' on and how to get back to work. I’m not gettin' any younger, you know? Don't go too easy on me, either. I can handle it. I've built houses in worse conditions than this clinic. Just tell me what you find.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Coby. I’ll do my best to be thorough. Okay, your blood pressure is 150/90 on the right arm and 148/88 on the left. Your heart rate is 88 and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no palpable masses. I don’t detect any significant organomegaly. I notice slight edema in your lower extremities, particularly around your ankles. No jugular venous distention noted. Alright, Mr. Coby. Based on the physical exam, the elevated blood pressure, slight edema, and your reported symptoms, I suspect several possibilities. The heat exposure is likely exacerbating an underlying condition, potentially related to your hypertension and kidney function. It’s important to rule out dehydration, but the edema suggests you may be retaining fluid, not losing it.
PATIENT: So, what does that mean, Doc? You sayin' somethin’s wrong with my kidneys? I always thought kidneys were somethin' old people got, not someone like me. I feel fine, mostly. Just hot and tired. Is this gonna mean… hospital? I don’t want no hospital. I got work to do. And I don't want a bunch of tests, either. I ain't got time for that. Just tell me what I need to do to get back to normal. Plain and simple.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Coby. I’m not saying you definitively have kidney problems, but your symptoms and exam findings warrant further investigation. It's better to be cautious and rule things out. And I assure you, we'll try to minimize unnecessary tests. Based on what you've told me, I’d like to order some blood work. This will include a complete metabolic panel to assess your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. We’ll also check your hemoglobin and hematocrit to rule out anemia. A urinalysis will help us evaluate your urine for protein, blood, and infection. I also want to order an EKG to assess your heart function, given the rapid heartbeat you've reported. And, just to be safe, I'd like to get a basic lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. In the meantime, I recommend significantly reducing your physical activity, especially outdoors, and staying well-hydrated with water and electrolyte-rich beverages. We need to control your blood pressure better, and we might need to adjust your Lisinopril dosage or add another medication. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Adjust the pills? Now there’s somethin’ I don’t like. I been takin’ this Lisinopril for years, never had trouble with it. I don't want no new pills, Doc. Just fix what's broken. Is this heat… is this somethin’ new? Are people gettin’ sicker from the heat now? I read somethin’ about that on the internet… about global warmin’ and all. Sounds like a lot of hooey, if you ask me. And these tests… how long are we talkin’? And how much is this gonna cost? I’m on Medicare, but I still gotta pay somethin’, right? Just give it to me straight, Doc. No fancy doctor talk. Plain and simple. I just want to get back to work. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Coby. You’re right to be cautious about adding new medications. However, sometimes adjustments are necessary to optimize treatment and account for changes in your body and environment. We can discuss the potential benefits and risks of any medication adjustments before making a decision. Regarding your question about the heat, you are correct. There is increasing evidence that climate change is leading to more frequent and severe heat waves, which can exacerbate existing health conditions and lead to new ones. While I won’t get into a debate about global warming, it’s a factor we need to consider. As for the tests, they should take about 30-45 minutes at the lab, and we should have the results back within a few days, typically 2-3 business days. With Medicare, you’ll likely have a copay for the lab work and the EKG. I can have the billing department provide you with an estimate of the costs. I don’t have that information readily available. In the meantime, while we wait for the test results, I recommend the following: 1. Strictly limit outdoor activity, especially during the hottest part of the day. 2. Stay well-hydrated with water and electrolyte-rich beverages. 3. Monitor your blood pressure at home if you have a monitor. 4. If you experience dizziness, lightheadedness, or confusion, seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Monitor my blood pressure… I do have one of those things. My daughter bought it for me last year. Never used it much, to be honest. Always felt fine. But I suppose I can give it a try. And I’ll try to stay out of the sun. Not much choice, really. It's too hot to be out there anyway. And I’ll wait for the results. But I’m tellin’ you, Doc, if these tests show somethin’ serious, I’m holdin’ you responsible. I got a house to build, and I ain’t got time for fancy illnesses. Now, can we get this over with? Where do I go for these tests? And how do I get the results? I don't wanna be chasin’ people around all day. Just give me a clear answer, Doc. Plain and simple. No runaround.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Coby, and I assure you, I will do everything I can to ensure you receive the best possible care. And I take full responsibility for guiding you through this process. The lab is located right across the hall, Suite 205. You can go there anytime today, and they should be able to accommodate you. Just tell them you are here for the blood work and EKG ordered by Dr. Rakosky. As for the results, they will be sent directly to my office. My nurse, Sarah, will contact you as soon as they are available. You can also access them through the patient portal on our website, if you’re comfortable doing so. Sarah will also schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results and develop a plan moving forward. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that’s all for now. Just get those results back as quick as you can. I got work to do, remember? Thank you, Doc. I appreciate it. Though I still think this is all a bit much fuss over a bit of heat. And tell Sarah… tell her to be nice. I don't like people talkin' down to me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Coby. I'll be sure to let Sarah know. And I’ll do everything I can to get those results back to you as quickly as possible. We want to get you back to work too. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
