DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Piet. Good to meet you too. It's my back, mostly. It's been really bad lately. Hurts to move, hurts to sit… pretty much hurts all the time now. I… well, you know about the cancer, right? It's… in my back too, I think. That's why I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. I do see in your chart about your cancer history. It's good you came in to get this checked out. When you say “lately,” how long has the back pain been significantly worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three weeks ago? It was just a little ache at first, you know? I thought maybe I just slept wrong. But then it got worse… and worse. Now it’s hard to even get out of bed. It’s… different than the other pain. This is… sharp. More in my lower back.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp pain in the lower back, starting about three weeks ago and progressively worsening. And you said it feels different than your usual cancer pain?
PATIENT: Yes, very different. The other pain… it’s more of a dull ache, all over. This is… like someone is stabbing me with a knife, sometimes. Not all the time, but… often enough to scare me. It goes down my leg too, a little bit. Not the whole leg, just… the back of it. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Pain radiating down the leg is important information. To help me understand a bit better, can you point to exactly where the pain is the worst?
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… Right here. It’s mostly right here. And it goes down… like this. Not all the way to my foot, just to about here. Is that helpful? I can try to show you better… but I'm not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. So, localized pain in the lower back radiating down the posterior aspect of your left leg, stopping above the knee. Now, does anything make the pain better?
PATIENT: Hmm… When I lay very still, it's a little better. Not gone, but… not as bad. And sometimes, if I put a warm towel on it, it helps a little bit too. But not for long. And… sitting is bad. Standing is okay for a little while, but then it gets worse. Lying down is the best, I think. But I can’t always just lay down, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, lying still and warm compresses provide some relief, but sitting aggravates it. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I… I just want to know what’s going on. I'm a little scared, to be honest. Is it the cancer getting worse?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. I understand your concern, and we'll certainly investigate that possibility, but let's gather some information first before jumping to conclusions. Okay, I'm just feeling around here. Can you tell me if this is tender?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, right there. That’s… really sore. And… a little bit to the left of that, too. It feels… hard, almost. Not like a muscle. Does that make sense? I'm not good at… describing things.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness and a palpable mass in the lower back. Alright, Ms. Meigs, I'm going to lift your leg straight up. Just let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg as I do this. It’s okay if it hurts, just tell me where and how much.
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes! Down my leg! It’s… the same pain. Starts in my back and shoots down… right here. It's… pretty bad, Doctor. Not like a sharp stab, more of a stretching pain, I guess. Stop, please. That’s enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. Thank you for letting me know. I'll stop there. That test suggests there may be some nerve irritation. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it’s important to investigate the cause of your back pain. Given your history of cancer, we need to rule out any metastasis. However, the radiating pain and the results of the straight leg raise suggest a possible disc issue or nerve impingement as well. I'm going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. That will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. Yes, that’s alright. Whatever you think is best. So… you think it could be the cancer? Is that what you’re saying? I… I don’t want to go through all that again. It was… hard last time. But I understand. I need to know. And I want to know. Just… please tell me everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Meigs, and I want to assure you that we're going to take this one step at a time. The MRI will help us determine the cause of the pain, and it could be a number of things, not necessarily cancer. It could be related to your cancer history, but it could also be a separate issue like a disc herniation or nerve compression. We will review the MRI results carefully, and I will explain everything to you in detail. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and some pain medication to help manage your discomfort. I'll also give you a referral to a spine specialist for a consultation, just to get a second opinion. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… muscle relaxant and pain medicine… and a spine specialist… yes. That sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And… taking the time. I was so scared. It's just… hard to think about all of it. When can I get the MRI? And how long will it take to get the results? I just… want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It's completely understandable to be scared, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. I'm scheduling the MRI for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM at the imaging center across town. The address is 123 Main Street. I'll have my nurse print out the paperwork for you, and she'll also give you instructions on how to prepare. The results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if your pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like weakness or numbness in your legs, please go to the emergency room immediately. Here's the prescription for the muscle relaxant and pain medication. And I'll have the nurse print out the referral to the spine specialist. His name is Dr. Ramirez, and he's excellent. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Tomorrow at 9:00… 123 Main Street… okay. Thank you again, Doctor Piet. You’ve been very kind. I… I feel a little better, just knowing what’s happening. I think I can go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go now. Please take it easy, and remember to follow the instructions on your medication. My nurse will be right in to go over everything with you. If anything changes, or if you have any concerns at all, don't hesitate to call the office. Take care, Ms. Meigs, and I'll see you soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
