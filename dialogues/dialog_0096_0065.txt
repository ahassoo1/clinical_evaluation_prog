DOCTOR: Alright, Reneisha, good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Burlingham. Well, to be frank, I’m…concerned about my weight. It’s been increasing, and I haven’t really changed anything in my routine to explain it. It’s quite bothersome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm, bothersome, yes. Well, weight fluctuations can be concerning. And it's good you’re addressing it. Now, when you say you haven’t changed anything, that’s a bit broad. Let’s be specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Specifics. My apologies. I mean, my diet…it’s been the same for months, perhaps even a year. Mostly potatoes, some cabbage, a bit of meat when my husband, Tomas, manages to get it. Nothing extravagant, I assure you. And my activity level…well, it hasn’t increased. I still do the housework, the gardening…but that’s been consistent. It’s not more than usual. Perhaps less, if I am being truthful, now that it’s so warm.
DOCTOR: Potatoes and cabbage, hm?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's…traditional. My mother always said it was good, filling food. And it is filling. Though, I suppose…it's not the most varied diet. I haven't been feeling unwell, just…larger. It's simply unusual for me to gain weight without a reason.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "filling" doesn't always equate to "nutritious," Reneisha. And a lack of variety can certainly play a role. Now, let's talk about this weight gain. Approximately how much weight have you gained, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see…It began, I would say, around…November, perhaps? And I’d estimate…approximately 7 kilograms, maybe a little more. It’s difficult to be precise, I don’t weigh myself often. Tomas has the scale, and he isn't always inclined to share it. He says it's “frivolous” to worry over such things.
DOCTOR: Seven kilograms in roughly nine months…that is significant. And your husband’s opinion, while noted, isn't exactly a medical assessment. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with this weight gain?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me consider. I’ve been…more tired, I suppose. Not debilitatingly so, but I do feel a need to rest more frequently. And…my ankles have been a little swollen at the end of the day. Though, I attributed that to the heat. And…oh! My skin feels rather dry, now that I think about it. It's always been a little dry in winter, but this is…more pronounced. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Tiredness, swelling, dry skin…those could be related. Now, Reneisha, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been…quite healthy, thankfully. A few colds, of course, but nothing serious. My mother always said good food and hard work kept a person well. I had my usual childhood vaccinations, naturally. And…well, nothing else. I’ve never needed to visit a doctor much, until now. I hope this isn’t something…serious.
DOCTOR: We'll figure it out, Reneisha. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history…my mother…she had some trouble with her joints in her later years, arthritis, I believe. And my father…he had…high blood pressure, I think. He was always rather quiet about his health. Tomas’s mother…she was healthy as a horse, though. Very strong woman. He says it’s why he married me – I remind him of her. He jokes, of course. He's a practical man. But truly, she was robust. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's helpful. Arthritis and hypertension are relevant. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. Never have. Tomas doesn't smoke either. He says it's a waste of good money. And…it smells unpleasant. My mother always said a clean life was a long life. And, well, I suppose she was right, for the most part.
DOCTOR: Alright. And alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally, Doctor. Very occasionally. A small glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, perhaps. Tomas enjoys a beer sometimes, but he doesn’t drink heavily. It’s not a habit, certainly. We don’t…rely on it. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, Reneisha, a small glass of wine on occasion is unlikely to be the root of this problem. Now, one last question regarding your lifestyle. What kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I am an orderly, Doctor. Mostly cleaning, tidying, assisting the nurses at the hospital. It's…physical work, but not overly strenuous. I’ve been doing it for…fifteen years now. It keeps me busy, and it’s honest work. Although, as I mentioned, it’s becoming more difficult with the weight. It's…embarrassing to admit, but it’s true.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, Reneisha, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. It’ll just take a few moments. Then, I’ll order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…sensible. Please, proceed. I just…I would appreciate it if you could explain everything clearly, if you don’t mind. I don’t have much experience with doctors, as you can tell. I’m a practical woman, but medical matters…they are a little daunting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Reneisha. I understand. I'll explain everything as clearly as possible. Now, if you could just lie back on the examination table… First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Breathe normally for me, please… Heart sounds are normal, slightly fast, but not concerning given your recent weight gain. Take a deep breath…and exhale…Again…Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm… It might feel a little tight, but it won’t hurt. Blood pressure is 145/90. A little elevated. Now, let's take a look at those ankles… I do notice some slight swelling…not severe, but present. And your skin is indeed dry to the touch. Alright, Reneisha, based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it seems likely that your weight gain, fatigue, swelling, and dry skin are related. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and a basic metabolic panel. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Thyroid…and metabolic… Those sound…complicated. Is it something serious, Doctor? I worry about Tomas. He works so hard. I don't want to be a burden. Will the blood work tell us what's wrong? And…how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Now, Reneisha, try not to worry. Those tests are routine, and they don't necessarily indicate anything serious. Thyroid issues can cause weight gain and fatigue, and the metabolic panel will give us a better understanding of your overall health. They are just part of the process of figuring out what's going on. As for how long the results will take, it usually takes about three to five business days for the lab to get them back to us. Once I have the results, I'll call you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. I understand your concern for Tomas, but taking care of your own health is the best thing you can do for both of you. Right now, we're just gathering information. We’ll get to the bottom of this, together. In the meantime, I recommend trying to incorporate a little more variety into your diet, if you can, and drinking plenty of water. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…manageable. More variety…and water. I can do that. Tomas…he likes a good stew. I could add more vegetables to the stew. And I will be sure to drink more water. And…if it is something serious…what kind of treatment would I need? Is it likely to be…expensive?
DOCTOR: Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Reneisha. We haven't even seen the results yet. But to answer your question…treatment depends entirely on the diagnosis. If it’s a thyroid issue, it might involve medication. If it’s something else, it could be a different approach altogether. As for the cost…that depends on the treatment plan and your insurance coverage. Since you’re uninsured, we can discuss options for affordable care, such as payment plans or assistance programs, once we have a diagnosis. I assure you, we'll work together to find a solution that fits your budget. The hospital has a financial counselor who can assist with those arrangements. Let’s focus on getting those blood work results first, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. You are right. The results first. And…thank you. For explaining everything so clearly. And for offering help with the cost. It…it eases my mind, knowing there are options. When would be a good time to schedule the blood work? I should probably ask Tomas to take me, as he has the car.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. I'm glad I could ease your mind. As for the blood work, you can go to the hospital lab anytime tomorrow. They are open from 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM. You don't need an appointment, just tell them Dr. Burlingham sent you. And yes, it's perfectly fine if Tomas takes you. It's always good to have someone with you. I will have the lab technician send the results to me as soon as they’re available. I'll call you the moment I have them. For now, try not to worry, focus on drinking more water and eating some extra vegetables. And if you have any questions or concerns before our follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call my office. Here's a printed sheet with the lab information and my contact details. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is…very kind of you. No, I don’t think so. I believe that is everything. I will call if I have any questions. And…thank you again. For everything. You have put my mind at ease, Doctor Burlingham. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to speaking with you again soon. Don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. Goodbye. .
