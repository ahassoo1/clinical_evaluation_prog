DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s rather inconvenient to be here, but… well, things have been going. Dimming, you might say. Both my sight and hearing, just… fading. It happened quite suddenly, really. I don’t recall exactly when it began, but it’s been distressing. I suppose that’s why I’m here. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Dimming,” you say – both vision and hearing. And it's been sudden, although pinpointing exactly when is difficult. We'll try to get to the bottom of it as efficiently as possible. To start, can you describe the vision changes a little more?
PATIENT: Efficiently is good, yes. It’s… difficult to explain. It’s not like everything is black, not yet. More like looking through a… a dirty window, perhaps? And everything seems… muted. Colors aren't as bright. And sometimes… sometimes it’s blurry. Mostly at the edges, I think. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t pay much attention to such things. I’m a surgeon, not an artist! Do you need me to… stare at dots or something?
DOCTOR: No dots, Ms. Julie, not yet. A dirty window is a good way to describe it. Muted colors and blurry edges… okay. And this has been happening for… how long would you estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? I truly couldn't say with any precision. Perhaps a few weeks? Maybe a month? It's all rather blurred, if you’ll pardon the pun. I've been… rather busy with my practice, and truthfully, I didn't notice until it became… bothersome. It interferes with… things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks to a month. And it’s interfering with your daily activities now. Now, let’s talk about the hearing. How would you describe those changes?
PATIENT: Interfering is putting it mildly, Doctor. It’s… frustrating. As for the hearing… people seem to mumble more these days, or perhaps I simply can't hear them. It's like… a dullness, a quietness. Not completely gone, but… distant. And sometimes, a ringing. A faint ringing in my ears. It’s hardly a symphony, thankfully. Is this necessary to detail, Doctor? It’s rather unpleasant to recall.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to detail, Ms. Julie. The ringing—is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, helpful. Well. It comes and goes, Doctor. It’s not a… persistent annoyance, thankfully. More like a fleeting shadow. It appears… randomly, I suppose. After a particularly long day, perhaps? Or when it's quiet. Truly, I can’t pinpoint it. And I find it rather… irritating to focus on such trivialities when there are more pressing matters at hand. I trust you're a competent physician?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Julie, I assure you, I am. The fact that it comes and goes is important. Okay. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the vision and hearing changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly, Doctor, I haven't been cataloging every ache and pain. I'm a surgeon, not a hypochondriac! Let me think… I suppose I have been… a bit more tired than usual. And perhaps a little… off-balance. But that could be the long hours. I’m not a young woman anymore, you know. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply documenting my inevitable decline?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some imbalance. And you attribute that to long hours and age, understandably. Have you had any headaches, dizziness, changes in taste or smell, or any numbness or weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. Nothing debilitating, just… a mild pressure. Dizziness, no, not really. Taste and smell… I haven’t been particularly focused on my cuisine lately, if you must know. And numbness or weakness? Absolutely not. I still have a perfectly steady hand, thank you very much. It's essential for my profession, you understand. Really, Doctor, are you asking about every possible malady? This is rather tedious. Is there a quick test we can do? Perhaps a scan?
DOCTOR: Alright. A scan might be necessary, but we need to gather a little more information first. Now, regarding your medical history – do you have any chronic conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Doctor, I am a surgeon. I maintain a rigorous lifestyle. I do not have chronic conditions. Though… my mother had something with her blood pressure, I believe. Very high. She was a rather… nervous woman. I’ve always been quite healthy, relatively speaking. Though, I suppose I had a bout of… something, years ago. A minor infection after a particularly difficult surgery, but nothing significant. It resolved itself, naturally. Honestly, this is all rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with high blood pressure, and a minor infection years ago. Have you ever had any surgeries yourself?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Doctor, do you think I simply watched people be operated on? Of course, I’ve had surgeries! A tonsillectomy as a child, naturally. And… a minor repair to my shoulder a few years ago, after I… slipped on the ice. It was a foolish incident. Nothing more. I assure you, nothing affecting my hands. Are we nearing a conclusion, Doctor? I have patients awaiting my attention.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy, shoulder repair… And do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I barely have time to eat regularly, let alone ingest a pharmacy's worth of pills. No, I take nothing. Absolutely nothing. I prefer to rely on my own… constitution. And a strong cup of coffee, naturally. Honestly, are you certain you’re a qualified physician? This line of questioning is… baffling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. No medications. Now, are you allergic to anything – medications, foods, latex, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergic? Really, Doctor. I’ve lived a rather full life, and I assure you, I would know if I had a significant allergy. No. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I have an aversion to incompetence, perhaps, but that is hardly a medical condition. Now, is there a test, or shall I simply await a diagnosis based on these… exhaustive, yet ultimately trivial, questions? I have a waiting room full of people, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. I understand your impatience. Let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your vision, hearing, reflexes, and a neurological exam. It'll help me determine the cause of your symptoms. If you'll please follow me over to the examination chair… We can start with your vision.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Let us get this over with. I trust your equipment is… up to standard? I haven't much time to waste staring at letters. Lead the way. But do try to be efficient. And, if I may, avoid excessive chatter. It's rather… distracting.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat, Ms. Julie. And yes, I assure you, the equipment is fully functional. We'll start with a simple eye chart. Could you please cover your left eye and read the letters on the chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is rather beneath me. E… F… P… T… Very well. Is this necessary? The letters are… blurry. And small. Are you certain this chart is correctly positioned? It appears to be tilting slightly. V… L… 4… 6… Oh, bother. This is quite aggravating.
DOCTOR: Alright. It appears your visual acuity is 20/30 in your right eye. Now, let’s try your left eye. Cover your right eye, please. . And please, read the letters as you did before, starting with the top line.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is most peculiar. E… F… L… Oh… I can barely distinguish the letters. They’re… a smudge. Is this… right? It's considerably worse than the other eye. Are you certain this isn’t a fault with the equipment? Perhaps it needs… calibrating?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Your visual acuity in your left eye is 20/50. That indicates a difference in vision between your eyes. Now, let's check your peripheral vision. I'd like you to focus on this point and tell me when you can see something in your peripheral vision. I'll be holding a finger up on each side. Just say "yes" when you see it.
PATIENT: Very well. Yes. Yes. …No. No. Yes. No. No. It’s… rather inconsistent. What precisely are you attempting to determine? It seems… a rather pointless exercise.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, we’ll move on to your hearing. I'm going to put headphones on you, and I’ll play some tones at different frequencies. Please raise your hand when you hear a tone. I’ll start with your right ear. . It is standard procedure, Ms. Julie. And the results will help me assess the potential cause of your symptoms.
PATIENT: Very well. …No. …No. Yes. No. Yes. No. It’s… faint. Extremely faint. Are you certain these… contraptions are functioning correctly? They seem… rather unreliable.
DOCTOR: . Alright, Ms. Julie. Now, let's test your left ear. . Focus and tell me when you hear the tone.
PATIENT: …No. …No. …Yes. No. …No. It's… almost nothing. Like a distant hum. Are you quite finished? This is… thoroughly unpleasant. I believe I’ve provided sufficient data.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Thank you for your patience. Based on the preliminary examination – the difference in visual acuity, the inconsistencies in your peripheral vision, and the diminished hearing – there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. It could be age-related changes, but given the sudden onset and the discrepancies we've found, it’s important to rule out other causes. I’m concerned about the possibility of a neurological issue. I want to order an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A neurological issue? That's… preposterous. I am a surgeon, Doctor. I have examined countless brains. I assure you, my own is perfectly functional. An MRI? That's… an excessive measure. Completely unnecessary. I hardly think a few… minor inconveniences warrant such an invasive procedure. Are you implying something, Doctor? I find that… rather insulting. I think I need a second opinion.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your concern, and I assure you, I am not implying anything. My concern stems from the speed of the changes you’ve described. While it’s possible it's age-related, dismissing the possibility of something more serious would be irresponsible. An MRI is the best way to rule out any underlying issues, like a tumor or stroke. It is not about questioning your abilities, Ms. Julie. It’s about providing you with the best possible care. You are, of course, entitled to a second opinion. However, I strongly recommend we proceed with the MRI as soon as possible. It will give us peace of mind and allow us to determine the best course of action. Would you like me to refer you to a neurologist for a consultation?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Very well. A second opinion couldn’t hurt, I suppose. Though I maintain it’s a waste of time and resources. And the MRI… If it must be done, then schedule it. But I expect prompt results. And I expect a full explanation of any… findings. I have patients, Doctor. I cannot spend weeks waiting for ambiguous scans. And I expect you to treat me with respect. I am a professional, and I will not tolerate any condescending attitudes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Julie. I understand. I will schedule the MRI immediately, and I will ensure you receive the results as quickly as possible. I’ll also arrange a consultation with a neurologist – Dr. Ramirez is excellent – and I’ll make sure she has all of my findings. And, of course, I will treat you with the utmost respect. I have a referral form here. Do you have a preferred hospital or imaging center?
