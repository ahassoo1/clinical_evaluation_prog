DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and it’s…well, it feels worse when I lie down, you know? My heart…it isn’t what it used to be, and I worry it’s connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that's worse when you lie down and you're concerned it might be related to your heart. I understand. Let's start with the cough itself. How long have you had it now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, I’d say, about three weeks ago? Maybe a little longer. It wasn’t bad at first, just a tickle. But the last week it’s gotten…deeper. And more frequent, especially at night. It wakes me up, you know? It’s a dry cough, mostly. Not much…phlegm, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Three weeks, starting as a tickle and now deeper, more frequent, especially at night, and mostly dry. Okay. And have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse besides lying down?
PATIENT: Hmm. Trigger it… Well, sometimes when I’m making dinner, if I’m using onions…it seems to bother it a bit. Not always, but sometimes. And cold air, definitely. Walking outside when it’s chilly makes me cough more. Oh! And dust. If I’m doing a lot of cleaning, it gets bad quick. But mostly it’s just…there. Especially when I try to rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so onions, cold air, and dust seem to be irritants. Good to know. And you mentioned your heart. Can you tell me a little more about what's been going on with that?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's been…a long road. I have congestive heart failure, they told me years ago. It means it doesn't pump as well as it should. I take medicine for it, water pills mostly, to get rid of extra fluid. And another one to help it pump better. I see Dr. Ramirez for that, but he said to come see you about this cough, because he thought it could be…the heart again. I forget the fancy name he used. Something about fluid building up.
DOCTOR: Right. Dr. Ramirez likely mentioned pulmonary congestion – fluid in the lungs, which can happen with congestive heart failure and cause a cough. You're on water pills and a medication to help your heart pump, that's good. Let’s quickly review your other medications, just to be sure I have everything documented correctly. Could you tell me what else you're taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… besides the water pill – I think it’s furosemide, yes? – and the one for my heart… I take something for my blood pressure, lisinopril, Dr. Ramirez prescribed that too. And a little blue pill for my arthritis, meloxicam. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a half of a lorazepam. But not every night, just when I’m really restless. Oh! And a multivitamin, every morning. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very thorough, thank you. Furosemide, lisinopril, meloxicam, lorazepam as needed, and a multivitamin. Perfect. Now, let's talk a little about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to get stung by bees when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago and I didn't have a serious reaction then, just a little swelling. But no allergies to medicine, no food allergies, nothing like that. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Though onions bother my cough, that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that’s likely an irritation, not an allergy. Okay, good to know. And before we do a quick exam, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I had pneumonia when I was about 70, a bad case, and had to be in the hospital. And I had my gallbladder out maybe 20 years ago. And Dr. Ramirez told me a few years back that I have some arthritis in my knees and hips, that’s why I take the blue pill. Other than that… I haven’t been seriously sick, thankfully. I used to be very active, but the heart trouble has slowed me down a bit. I used to dance, you know? Salsa. But now…not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Pneumonia around age 70, gallbladder removal about 20 years ago, and arthritis in the knees and hips. I see. And do you have any family history of medical conditions—heart disease, lung problems, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a good question. My mother, she had high blood pressure, like me, and she died of a stroke when she was in her 80s. And my older brother, he had…emphysema, I think it was. He smoked a lot, you know? And my father, he had diabetes. And…oh, my aunt, on my mother's side, she had cancer, breast cancer, when she was younger. Does that help? It’s a long time ago, and I forget a lot of details.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. High blood pressure in your mother, emphysema in your brother, and diabetes and breast cancer in other family members. Okay. And lastly, do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a puff. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and my father never smoked either. I always stayed away from it. My brother, of course, was a different story, but I always told him it wasn't good for him. He didn't listen, though. It was a hard habit to break, he said.
DOCTOR: Okay. No history of smoking. Thank you for all of that information, Nadene. That gives me a very good picture of your overall health. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs and check your oxygen level. Can you please sit up on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Let me just… There we go. Be careful, I’m a bit… creaky these days. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm listening now. Take nice, deep breaths for me. Okay, I do hear some crackling in your lungs, especially at the base of both lungs. Your heart sounds a bit…irregular, and I can hear a murmur. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. And I notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Overall, these findings are consistent with fluid overload related to your congestive heart failure.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? Fluid overload… that’s what Dr. Ramirez was worried about, isn’t it? The crackling and the swelling… Is it bad, Doctor? Should I be worried? I just want to be able to breathe easier, you know? And maybe sleep through the night again.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're asking those questions, Nadene. It’s not an immediate emergency, but it does mean your heart failure is likely contributing to this cough and making it harder for you to breathe. The fluid in your lungs explains the crackling and the cough, and the swelling in your ankles indicates fluid retention. We need to adjust your medications to help remove some of that excess fluid and make breathing easier. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and confirm the fluid buildup. And I'll also check your blood levels to see how well your kidneys are functioning, as that affects fluid balance. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. An X-ray and a blood test… if that’s what it takes to get this sorted out, then let’s do it. My kidneys, you say? I do drink plenty of water, I always have. I try to take care of myself, you know. But the heart…it’s a stubborn thing. So, what kind of medication will you adjust? Will it make me feel different? I don’t want to be too tired to… well, to just live a little.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Nadene. We’ll likely increase the dose of your water pill, furosemide, to help your body get rid of the excess fluid. We may also consider a short course of a stronger diuretic. It’s possible you might feel a bit more tired initially, as you're losing fluid, and you’ll need to urinate more frequently. We will monitor your kidney function closely, and make sure the medication adjustments aren't causing any problems. It’s important to stay well-hydrated, as you mentioned, and to watch for any signs of dizziness or weakness. We’ll also want to rule out any other causes for your cough, just to be safe. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. More water pill, more trips to the bathroom… I can manage that, I suppose. And watch for dizziness… alright. So, X-ray, blood test, more pills, more bathroom trips, and watch out for feeling faint. And you'll keep an eye on my kidneys. Is there anything I should be watching for, besides the dizziness? Any warning signs I should tell you about right away? You know, just in case. I do worry sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's a good question, and it's smart to be proactive. Besides dizziness, please contact the office right away if you experience any shortness of breath at rest, if your cough gets significantly worse, or if you notice any swelling in your legs or abdomen that wasn't there before. Also, if you feel chest pain or have a rapid or irregular heartbeat, seek immediate medical attention. We’re going to get this under control, Nadene. We will start with the X-ray and blood tests, then adjust your medications accordingly. The nurse will be in shortly to draw blood and schedule the X-ray. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Shortness of breath, worse cough, swelling, chest pain…I’ll remember that. Thank you for explaining it all so clearly. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on, and that you have a plan. I appreciate your patience with an old woman and all her worries. You're a very kind doctor.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Nadene. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. I will have the nurse come in now to get the tests ordered. We'll take things one step at a time. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns. I'll be in touch once we have the results.
