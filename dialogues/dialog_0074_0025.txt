DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know more about where my family come from. I hear you can do a test… a DNA test to see that? I’m Laury Scobie, by the way. Maybe you know my work, I make small boats out of wood.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, it’s a pleasure to meet you as well. And thank you for sharing that – that’s wonderful work! I understand you’re interested in learning more about your ancestry and are asking about DNA testing. We do offer genetic testing through a third-party lab, and it can provide information about your ancestral origins. However, it’s important to understand what that testing involves and what the results mean. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit more about why you're interested in learning about your family history at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I get older, you know? Eighty-five years old now. And I think about my father, and his father before him… they never talk much about where we really come from. Just Marshall Islands, always. But where in Marshall Islands? And before that? I want to know. My sister, she passed last year, and she always wanted to know too. So, I think… for her, also. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Scobie. It's very common to feel a desire to understand your roots, especially as you reflect on your family history and the generations before you, and wanting to honor your sister's memory is a beautiful reason. So, to clarify, you're hoping a DNA test might provide more specific information about your lineage within the Marshall Islands, and potentially even trace your ancestry further back?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. More specific. My father, he say we always live on the islands. But… sometimes I feel like there’s more to it. I see pictures on TV, of other islands… and I think maybe… maybe we come from somewhere else long, long time ago? It's just a feeling. And like you say, for my sister. She liked all those old stories.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to have those questions and feelings. DNA testing can sometimes provide answers, although it’s important to remember it’s not always a complete picture. Before we discuss the testing process, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, just to ensure there are no contraindications or factors that might affect the results. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Medical… you mean like, if I’m sick? I’m pretty healthy for eighty-five. Just a little trouble with my knees. And my eyes, you see. I wear glasses. But I don’t take much medicine. Is that okay? Does it matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re generally healthy, Mr. Scobie. And yes, it’s important to know what medications you take, and any significant medical conditions, simply to ensure the testing process is safe and the results are interpreted accurately. “Contraindications” just means reasons why we might not want to do a test. It's a precaution. “A little trouble with your knees and eyes” is helpful information, thank you. And knowing you don’t take much medication is good. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never had one. I eat everything. Fish, taro, coconut… everything. My sister, she was careful about what she eat. I’m not. I like food. But no, no allergies. I'm sure.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No allergies is very good to know. Now, have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a young man, maybe sixty years ago, I had a bad fever. Very bad. Stayed in bed for many weeks. They give me some medicine, I don’t remember what. But I got better. Besides that… just the usual colds, nothing serious. No hospitals since that fever. I try to stay healthy. I walk every day. And I eat good food.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Scobie. A significant fever many years ago is good to know. And staying active and eating well is fantastic. Now, just to complete the picture, have you ever had any heart problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, no heart problems. My heart is strong. I work hard all my life. No diabetes. I like sweet things, but I don’t eat too many. And no, no high blood pressure. The doctor always say my blood is good. He check it every year, when I go for my shots. Is that enough questions? I feel like I’m at school!
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Mr. Scobie! And no, those are most of the important questions. We just need to be sure there are no underlying conditions that might impact the testing or the results. Now, one final thing regarding your family history. Are there any known genetic conditions that run in your family – anything like early-onset heart disease, certain types of cancer, or any other inherited illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a hard one. My family… we don’t talk much about sickness. If someone get sick, they just… get sick. Nobody talk about what caused it. My sister, she ask, but nobody know. Maybe some of the old people get sick with… a cough? But not like today. Nothing special. I don’t think so. No. No special sickness in my family. We just… live. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. It’s common for families not to have detailed records of medical history, especially across generations. Knowing that there's no known history of significant inherited illnesses is helpful. Okay, so to recap: you have no known allergies, no significant past medical history, and no family history of genetic conditions. That’s excellent. Now, let’s talk about the DNA test itself. It involves a simple cheek swab… …a gentle collection of cells from inside your cheek. The sample is then sent to the lab, and they analyze your DNA to estimate your ancestral origins. The results typically take about 2-3 weeks to come back. Would you be interested in proceeding with that?
PATIENT: Cheek swab? Like… they take a little bit of spit? That sounds easy. Two or three weeks… okay. For my sister, I do it. What does it… cost? Is it very expensive? I don’t have much money, you know. I make small boats, but it’s not much.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s very simple, Mr. Scobie. Just a quick swab inside your cheek. It's painless and doesn't require any blood. The cost of the test is $250. We do offer a payment plan if that would be helpful, and Medicare may cover a portion of the cost. Let me quickly check your coverage information… …Okay, it appears Medicare will cover 80% of the cost, leaving a patient responsibility of $50. Does that sound manageable for you?
PATIENT: Fifty dollars… yes. Yes, that’s okay. I can do fifty dollars. For my sister. And to know where I come from. Yes. Okay, let's do it. What do I need to do now? Do I sign something? You take the spit?
DOCTOR: Wonderful, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad we could discuss this and find a solution. Yes, there is a consent form I’d like you to review and sign, just to ensure you understand the process and what the results will and won’t tell us. Take your time reading it, and please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions. Once you’ve signed it, I’ll collect the cheek swab. It's a very straightforward procedure. Here, why don’t you have a seat and we’ll get started when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. This is… a lot of words. But I will try. For my sister… I will try my best.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Scobie. There's no rush. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. I’m happy to explain anything. I'll be right here if you need me.
PATIENT: “Informed Consent”… What does that mean? Is that… bad? Does that mean I have to agree to something I don't want? I just want to know about my family, not… agree to things.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Scobie. “Informed consent” simply means we want to make sure you understand everything about the test before you agree to it. It's a way to protect your rights and ensure you’re making an informed decision. It doesn’t mean you’re agreeing to anything you don’t want to do. It outlines what the test involves, what the results can and cannot tell you, and how your privacy will be protected. It’s a standard part of any medical procedure. Would you like me to go through it with you, section by section?
PATIENT: Yes… please. That would be good. I’m not so good with… with writing. And all those big words. If you can explain, that would be very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. It’s my pleasure. Let’s start with this first section, which explains the purpose of the test… it basically states that we're trying to understand your genetic ancestry… …think of it like tracing your family tree, but using DNA instead of old records. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes… family tree. That I understand. My sister, she liked family trees. So, you look at my spit, and you see… where my family come from? Is it like… a map? Does it show me on a map?
DOCTOR: That’s a great way to think about it, Mr. Scobie! Yes, it can be shown on a map, but it's not quite as simple as pinpointing one exact location. The test results will estimate the percentage of your ancestry from different regions of the world. For example, it might say something like "60% Marshallese, 20% Polynesian, 10% East Asian, and 10% other." It won't tell you exactly which villages your ancestors came from, but it gives you a broad idea of your origins. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Yes… percentages. Like, sixty out of a hundred people come from Marshall Islands? That I understand. Not exact, but… a good idea. Sixty percent… that’s good. What about the… the other things? This says something about privacy. Will everyone know about my spit? My neighbors? I don’t want everyone knowing my secrets!
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Mr. Scobie, and a completely valid concern. Your privacy is extremely important to us. The lab takes strict measures to protect your information. Your test results are assigned a unique code, and your personal details are kept completely confidential. They will never share your information with anyone without your explicit permission. This section explains that they only use your sample for the genetic testing, and they will dispose of it securely afterward. They will not share your results with your neighbors, your insurance company, or anyone else. You have complete control over your information. Does that ease your worries a little?
PATIENT: Yes… a code. Like a secret number. And they throw it away after? That’s good. I don’t want my spit floating around! And you said I have control? If I don’t like what they find… can I just… not know? Can I tell them to stop looking?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Mr. Scobie. You have complete control. You are not obligated to receive the results if you don’t want to. You can choose to opt-out at any time, even after the testing is complete. You can tell them to stop looking, as you say, and they will respect your decision. It's entirely your choice. This section explains your right to refuse the results and how to contact the lab if you want to withdraw your consent. You are in complete control of the process. Does that make you feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes… much more comfortable. Thank you, Doctor. You explain everything very well. I’m still a little worried, but… I think I can do it. For my sister. And to know… where I come from. Okay. Let’s do it. I will sign the paper. And you take my spit. But be gentle!
DOCTOR: Wonderful, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad to hear that. I assure you, the cheek swab is very gentle and painless. It’s just a quick swipe with a cotton swab. It’s very similar to using a Q-tip. Okay, if you could just open your mouth and say "Ah," I'll quickly swab the inside of your cheek. It will only take a few seconds. And that’s it! All done. Very easy. Now, we’ll send this off to the lab, and the results should be available in about 2-3 weeks. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re ready. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Easy. Yes, very easy. Like a little brush. Two or three weeks… okay. I can wait. Follow-up appointment… yes, that’s good. I like talking. I have some questions, if you don’t mind. About the results. If it says… I don’t know… sixty percent Marshallese… what does that mean? Does that mean I’m not really Marshallese?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Scobie. It’s perfectly natural to wonder what the results mean. It doesn’t mean you’re not really Marshallese. It simply means that, based on your DNA, your ancestors have origins in the Marshall Islands, and also in other regions of the world. Think of it like a family tree. You’re still part of the Marshallese community, and your cultural heritage is still very important. The test results just provide a broader understanding of your ancestral history. It’s like saying you have both blue and green eyes. You’re still a person with beautiful eyes, even though you have a mix of colors. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Eyes… yes, I understand. Blue and green. A mix. So, it doesn’t change who I am? I’m still Laury Scobie, the boat maker? And what if it says… a lot of somewhere else? Like, not much Marshallese? Will I still be welcome at the village?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Scobie. It absolutely does not change who you are. You are still Laury Scobie, the boat maker, and your identity comes from your experiences, your culture, and your community – not from a DNA test. And no, it will not change whether you are welcome at the village. Your community will always be your community. The test results are just information, and they don’t define your worth or your belonging. Think of it this way: Everyone’s family tree is unique, and everyone’s history is different. The test results just help you understand yours a little better. It doesn't change who you are to your family, your friends, or your community. It simply adds another layer to your story. Would you like to talk about any of this more?
PATIENT: Yes. That makes me feel better. A layer. Like adding paint to my boat. It’s still my boat, but it looks a little different. Thank you, Doctor Reisig. You are very kind. And you explain everything so well. I think… I think I’m ready now. I can wait for the results. And I can talk to my friends at the village. I think that’s all my questions for today. Unless you have something else to tell me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. I don’t have anything else to add for today. Just remember, these results are just one piece of the puzzle. Your life experiences and your cultural identity are far more important. It was a pleasure meeting you and learning about your boat making. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And we look forward to discussing the results with you in a few weeks. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Scobie. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye bye. .
