DOCTOR: Good morning, Nicoletta. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, to put it simply, I feel like I need a bit of a… well, a reset. A jumpstart, perhaps. I’m not as spry as I used to be, and I’d like to get back to feeling more like myself. I’m eighty-seven years young, you know, and I want to enjoy these years!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Nicoletta! It’s fantastic that you’re so proactive about your health at eighty-seven years young. A “reset” is a good way to put it. We can definitely work towards that. To get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a little more about what specifically you mean by not feeling like yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s kind of you to say. Well… it’s a little bit of everything, really. I tire more easily. Used to be, I could work in the garden all day, but now… a little weeding and I need a nap. And my memory isn't what it used to be, though I don't think it's too bad, mind you. Just… little things. Forgetting names, where I put my glasses… that sort of thing. And honestly, I just don’t have the energy to do the things I enjoy. I used to love to dance, but now… it feels like too much effort. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Nicoletta. It sounds like you're experiencing a gradual decline in your energy levels, and some changes in your memory, which is quite common as we get older. It's good you're noticing these changes and wanting to address them. Let's start with the tiredness. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely been building up over time, Doctor. Not sudden at all. It’s been… gradual, like you said. I’d say maybe the last year or so it’s become more noticeable. I used to just chalk it up to getting older, you know? But it's starting to interfere with things. I don't want to just sit around and… fade away, if you catch my drift. I still want to be doing things. It's just harder now. I used to be able to keep up with my grandchildren, but even playing with them is tiring.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nicoletta. It’s admirable that you want to remain active and engaged. And it's good you're not dismissing this as just “getting older.” There are many things that can contribute to fatigue, and we want to rule out any underlying causes. Besides the tiredness and memory concerns, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. My appetite is… okay, I suppose. Maybe a little smaller than it used to be, but nothing drastic. I sleep alright, though I do wake up a few times during the night sometimes. Just… old lady things, I expect. Oh! And my joints ache a bit, especially in my knees. That's probably just from gardening all those years, though. I don't think that’s new. Is there anything specific I should be looking out for? I don’t want to forget to mention something important.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you to consider everything, Nicoletta. It's good you're keeping track of things. Reduced appetite, waking during the night, and joint pain are all things we should take into account. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, sometime in the nineties, I believe. And I had a bit of a scare with my heart a long time ago, but they put a stent in and it’s been fine ever since. Nothing else major, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing that lingers. I see my dentist regularly and get my flu shots every year. I try to stay on top of things, you know? I take a small dose of medication for my blood pressure, but that’s it. Oh! And I used to have terrible arthritis in my hands, but a friend recommended some cream and it helps a lot. Does that sound like enough? I worry I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Nicoletta! That's very helpful information. Gallbladder removal, a heart stent, and controlled blood pressure are important to know. The arthritis and the cream are good to note as well. Just to clarify, the heart stent – do you recall roughly when that was placed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… let me think. It must have been around 1998, I believe. Maybe 1999? It’s been quite a while, you understand. They kept me in the hospital for a few days afterwards, and I had to take some blood thinners for a while. It was a scary time, but the doctor assured me everything was alright and I haven’t had any trouble with it since. I see a cardiologist every year for a check-up, just to be safe. Dr. Ramirez, lovely man.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent that you see Dr. Ramirez regularly, and that you've had no issues since the stent placement. 1998/1999 is good to know. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has had similar issues with tiredness, memory problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her memory towards the end, but we just chalked it up to old age, you know? And my father, he had heart trouble. He passed away when he was fairly young, actually. Heart attack, I think. And my brother, he’s still alive, thankfully, but he’s been having some issues with his energy levels lately. He's always tired, complains about it all the time. He lives on Guam, though, so I don’t see him very often. Is that helpful? I don’t know much about the health of my grandparents, to be honest. They lived a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Nicoletta. A family history of memory problems and heart disease is important to note. Your brother’s fatigue is also relevant. One last thing about your background before we move to a physical exam. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle. Well, I live alone, but I have a wonderful neighbor who checks on me every day. I try to eat healthy – lots of fruits and vegetables, fish when I can. I used to love to cook, but it’s gotten a bit harder lately. I don’t drink or smoke, never have. I used to be very active in my church, but it's been hard to get out and about lately. And, as I mentioned, I love to garden when I have the energy. I read a lot, mostly mysteries. And I try to stay in touch with my grandchildren as much as possible. Is that enough detail? I don't lead a very exciting life, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s a lovely and very full life, Nicoletta! It sounds like you have a good support system and enjoy many things. It's good to know about your diet, activity level and social connections. Okay, with all that information, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I’m ready whenever you are. I trust your judgment. I’ve always believed in listening to the doctor! Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, a slight murmur is present, which we know about from previous cardiology visits, and your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackling noted. Next, I’ll take your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your ears and nose look clear. Your throat is a little dry, but no signs of infection. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes and your strength in your arms and legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Your strength is good in all extremities. Everything seems generally okay, Nicoletta, but the diminished reflexes and slightly dry throat are things to note. Based on everything you’ve told me and this exam, I'm thinking we should run some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying causes for your fatigue and memory concerns. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood tests seem like a good idea. Yes, that’s perfectly alright with me. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this and get my energy back. Are there any specific preparations I need to make before the tests? Should I fast?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Nicoletta. Yes, for most of these tests, we’ll need you to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks – except for water – after midnight tonight. We'll also need a urine sample, so please try to collect a sample first thing in the morning when you wake up. The lab will give you specific instructions when you arrive, but it's good to be prepared. We’ll also check your blood sugar during the fast, just to be sure. I’ll write up the order for the lab now, and the receptionist will schedule an appointment for you. It should only take about 15-20 minutes to get the blood drawn. While we're waiting for the results, are there any specific medications or supplements you're currently taking that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, good question! I take a small dose of Lisinopril for my blood pressure, as I mentioned earlier. And… let me think. Sometimes I take a calcium supplement, but not every day. Just when I remember, really. And every once in a while, if my knees are particularly achy, I'll take some ibuprofen. Nothing else, I promise! Just the usual old lady remedies. Is that helpful? I don't like to take too many pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Nicoletta. Lisinopril, calcium and occasional ibuprofen are good to know. We’ll make a note of those. Okay, so to recap: We’ve talked about your history, performed a physical exam, and are ordering some blood tests to investigate your fatigue and memory concerns. We’ve also discussed your medications. Once the results are back, which usually takes a few days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache – please don't hesitate to call the office or go to the emergency room. Do you have any questions for me right now, Nicoletta, before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. You've been very patient and kind, and I feel much better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. Thank you so much for your time and attention. I really appreciate it. I’ll make sure to fast as you instructed and I’ll see the receptionist to schedule the tests. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nicoletta. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
