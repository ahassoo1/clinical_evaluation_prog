DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my head. Back of my head… hurts. Been hurting a few days now. Not… not a bad hurt, but always there. Like a weight.
DOCTOR: Okay. A constant headache, you said, at the back of your head. And it’s been going on for a few days. You describe it as a weight. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, a weight. That’s a good way to put it. Not sharp, not like a… a pounding. Just… heavy. It’s worse when I stand for too long, I think. I used to work on the trains, you see. Lots of standing, walking around the yard. Now… not so much. But when I do stand, it gets more bothersome. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. So, it seems to be aggravated by standing. And you mentioned you used to work on the trains – how long ago did you retire?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I stopped working… maybe fifteen years ago? Sixteen? Time goes quick, you know. It was a good job, though. Rail yard. Lots of different things. Dinkey operator, hostler… moving the cars around. Heavy work, but good. My wife… she liked it when I came home tired. Meant I was earning a good wage.
DOCTOR: Okay, fifteen or sixteen years ago. And physically demanding work. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this new?
PATIENT: No… no, not like this. I get little headaches sometimes, like when it's very hot, or if I don't drink enough water. But those go away quick. This… this stays. It doesn't get worse, exactly, but it’s always there. Even when I’m resting. That's what worries me. I never had a headache that just… stayed before.
DOCTOR: Alright. So this is a different type of headache than you’ve experienced before, constant and not easily relieved. Any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. I sleep okay. Eat okay. Maybe a little tired, but I’m ninety years old! I forget things sometimes, but that’s just… old age, I guess. No blurry vision, no dizziness… nothing like that. Just… the headache. And sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, but that could be from sleeping wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms. And a little neck stiffness, possibly related to sleeping position. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been told I had high blood pressure. My wife… she checked my blood pressure sometimes, with one of those things you put on your arm. Always said it was okay. And no diabetes. I like sweet things, but I didn't have the sickness. Never been to the hospital for anything serious, really. A few broken bones when I was young, working on the trains, but they healed up fine. I don't take any pills, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No known medical conditions and no current medications. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any. Just… a few stitches here and there when I was a boy, falling off my bike. Nothing major. My wife… she had her gallbladder out, a long time ago. But I never had anything like that. Just the stitches. I always thought if you had surgery, you wouldn’t be as strong afterward. Maybe silly thinking.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And no allergies to any medications or anything else that you know of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. My wife used to make a lot of different foods… Guatemalan foods, mostly. Spicy! Never had any trouble with food. And no allergies to plants, animals… nothing. I’ve always been a strong person, I think. Not much bothers me. Except this headache, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look at your neck and do a basic neurological exam – just check your reflexes and strength. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. My wife always said I was too stubborn to go to the doctor, so I’m trying to be good now. Blood pressure, pulse… go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 148 over 92. Not dangerously high, but something we should keep an eye on. Pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Some tenderness in the muscles here, particularly on the back of your neck. No swelling that I can feel. Strength is good in all extremities, reflexes are normal. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it could be a tension headache related to muscle strain in your neck, possibly aggravated by standing. However, given your age and slightly elevated blood pressure, I want to be cautious. I'd like to order some blood work just to rule out anything else. It'll check your basic blood counts, kidney function, thyroid, and rule out any inflammation. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work. Check everything. I want to know what's going on. My wife… she always said it was better to be safe than sorry. So, yes. Blood work. Whatever you need. What do I have to do? Do I have to drink anything special before?
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. No, you don’t need to do anything special beforehand – you can eat and drink normally. We’ll just need a quick blood sample. I’ll have the nurse draw it right here in the office. It should only take a few minutes. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to recommend you start with over-the-counter pain relief – either ibuprofen or acetaminophen, following the directions on the bottle. And try to avoid prolonged standing if possible. We'll review the results in a few days. If the headache gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, please call the office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen… I think my wife used to take acetaminophen when her arthritis bothered her. Avoid standing… that’s not too hard. And call if it gets worse… I will. Thank you. You seem… very thorough. It's good to know someone is looking after me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I want to make sure we get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. And I’ll have her schedule a follow-up appointment for us to review the results next week. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to call. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we’re checking things out. I appreciate you taking the time. My wife would have liked you. She was a very practical woman.
