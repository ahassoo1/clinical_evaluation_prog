DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Alvara, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Osga. Venus Alvara. Thank you for seeing me. I… I do not have much time today, if you understand. Is quick possible?
DOCTOR: Well, we all have things to do. But rushing through a medical consultation isn’t exactly…ideal. However, I suppose we can try to be efficient. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is… my memory. It has been… troubling me lately. Not big things, you understand. More like… forgetting where I put my keys. Or… the name of a neighbor. Small things, but they happen more and more. And my blood pressure… it is not good. The doctor before… he said it was high. Very high. Is this… related? I hope you understand.
DOCTOR: Memory, eh?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… worrying. I manage many properties, you see. And the community association. I must remember details. Dates. Names. Everything. It is… important work. And lately… I feel… a fog. It is very unsettling. Is this something serious, Doctor? I truly hope not.
DOCTOR: Well, memory lapses happen. Especially as we get older. It’s probably just stress, honestly. Managing properties and associations… that is stressful work. Now, you said your previous doctor mentioned high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes. Very high. He… he passed away last year. A heart attack, sadly. He put me on some pills, but… I stopped taking them. They made me feel… unwell. Tired. And dizzy. I did not like them. I thought maybe it would go down on its own. But it has not. And now… these memory problems. Do you think the pressure… is causing this? I am very worried about my work, you see. Everything depends on me.
DOCTOR: Stopping medication… that was unwise. Blood pressure is serious. And yes, uncontrolled hypertension can affect cognitive function. But frankly, it's likely a combination of things. Stress, stopping your medication… and, well, let's be realistic, you're not exactly a young woman. Now, let’s just get through this quickly. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: I… I do not believe so. Nothing diagnosed. I have aches sometimes, like most people. My knees bother me in cold weather. But nothing… serious. I eat… reasonably well, I think. Mostly fish and vegetables. I do not drink, and I do not smoke. Never have. Is this enough information, Doctor? I truly do not have much time this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No smoking, that's good. Fish and vegetables... acceptable. Let’s just take your blood pressure, and then we can discuss this further. Roll up your sleeve, please.
PATIENT: Very well. Quickly, if you please. I have a meeting at three o’clock. And I must check on the repairs at the Willow Creek apartments. The roof… it is leaking again. Is this cuff… tight? I do not like things too tight.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mrs. Alvara. Just relax. Hmm. 180 over 110. As expected. Very high. Uncontrolled. And frankly, quite dangerous. Now, about these memory lapses... have you noticed any changes in your personality?
PATIENT: Changes…? I do not understand. Personality? I am… the same. Perhaps a little more… frustrated lately. Because of the memory. And the work. It is very demanding. But I am still Venus Alvara. I am always… organized. And I always meet my deadlines. But lately, it requires… more effort. Is this what you mean? I do not… feel different. Just… stressed. And forgetful. Is that a change?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Alvara, I'm going to be blunt. Your blood pressure is significantly elevated, and while I suspect the memory issues are related to stress, we can't rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a B12 level. And, frankly, I think you need a referral to a neurologist. They’ll want to do some cognitive testing, maybe an MRI. I’ll write you a referral. It’s the responsible thing to do. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. But… a neurologist? Is this… serious? I simply came because of the memory. I did not expect… such a thing. Is this expensive? I… I do not have insurance. And my savings… are limited. This is… concerning. Will it take a long time? I have many responsibilities, you see.
DOCTOR: Well, everything is expensive these days. And yes, a neurologist is prudent. Look, I'm not saying you have anything serious, but we need to rule things out. Don't panic. The tests will give us a clearer picture. As for time… it depends on their availability. Now, let me write this referral. Here. This is Dr. Volkov. He's… competent. The blood work, you can do it at the lab across the street. They’ll take your insurance information. Or, you can explain your situation. I have other patients, Mrs. Alvara. Anything else?
PATIENT: No… no, I believe that is all. Thank you… I suppose. I… I will make an appointment with Dr. Volkov. And the lab. Is there… anything I should tell them? About the memory? About… the blood pressure? Or just… explain my situation? .
DOCTOR: Just tell them everything. And try to relax, Mrs. Alvara. Stress won’t help. Next!
