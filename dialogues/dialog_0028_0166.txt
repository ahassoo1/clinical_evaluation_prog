DOCTOR: So, Mr. Kinjerski, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Memmolo. It’s about my leg, actually. My left leg has been feeling… numb, off and on, for a little while now. It’s not painful, exactly, just… not right.
DOCTOR: Numbness, you say. “A little while” is… how long, precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it started, I believe, around the 14th of July. So, almost three weeks now. It comes and goes, mostly when I’ve been standing for a long time, or after a particularly long day at work. I do special effects and animation, so I’m often sitting quite still for hours, then on my feet setting things up.
DOCTOR: Animation…right. And you say it’s only when standing or sitting for extended periods?
PATIENT: Not only, no. Though those are the most common times, it’s happened a few times when I’m just… walking around, too. It’s less frequent then, but it's been there. It feels… like the feeling isn’t quite complete, if that makes sense? Like when your leg "falls asleep", but not as intense, and it doesn't last as long.
DOCTOR: “Not complete”… These subjective descriptions are… less than helpful. Any weakness associated with it?
PATIENT: Weakness? No, not that I’ve noticed. I haven’t tripped or anything, and I can walk and move it normally. It just… doesn’t feel entirely there. Like if I close my eyes and focus on my leg, it feels…distant, maybe? It’s hard to explain, Doctor. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's get some basics. Any prior injuries to the leg?
PATIENT: No, none that I recall. I was fairly active as a kid – some hockey, a bit of basketball – but no major falls or breaks or anything like that. I sprained my wrist once, when I was about fifteen, but that was a long time ago and didn't involve my leg. I did get a pretty bad bruise on my shin a couple of years ago, from bumping into a set piece, but that healed quickly.
DOCTOR: Any family history of…neurological issues?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… my maternal grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her balance, I believe. She wasn’t diagnosed with anything specific, but she started to have trouble walking steadily when she got older. It was just… part of getting old, as far as my mother knew. Nothing sudden or dramatic. My father’s side… I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. He wasn’t one for sharing.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything I’ve taken. I’ve had the usual – antibiotics for a sore throat, some painkillers for a headache now and then – but no issues. I do have a slight sensitivity to certain types of latex, but that’s more of a skin irritation than an allergy, and I’m careful to avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with some neurological testing on your lower extremities.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know what you’d like me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are…within normal limits, though slightly diminished on the left. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally, so no noticeable weakness. Sensation… appears intact, but slightly decreased to light touch on the lateral aspect of your left calf. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain at all. It just feels…less. Like when you’re wearing a very thin glove, and someone lightly touches your skin. You can feel it, but it's muted. It doesn't hurt, and it's not like a sharp sensation. Just…less pronounced.
DOCTOR: It’s likely peripheral neuropathy. It could be caused by a number of things – prolonged sitting, compression, even something as simple as a vitamin deficiency. We'll order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. I’m going to prescribe you a multivitamin, and I recommend you try to get up and move around more frequently during the day. Try to avoid prolonged sitting if possible.
PATIENT: Peripheral neuropathy… okay. That sounds…serious. Is there anything I should be particularly concerned about? And what sort of things would the blood work be looking for, specifically? A vitamin deficiency… I eat fairly well, but I suppose it's possible.
DOCTOR: It’s not usually a cause for major concern. Most cases are mild and resolve on their own, or with simple interventions. The blood work will check for vitamin B12 levels, glucose, kidney function, and thyroid hormone – the usual suspects. If those are normal, we may consider a referral to a neurologist, but it’s likely just a minor irritation. Take the multivitamin daily, and schedule a follow-up appointment in six weeks to reassess. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Six weeks… alright. Thank you, Doctor. No, I think that covers it for now. Just… should I be limiting any activities in the meantime? Or is it okay to continue working as usual? And if the numbness gets significantly worse before the six weeks, should I be concerned enough to contact you sooner?
DOCTOR: Continue your normal activities, but be mindful of your symptoms. If the numbness becomes severe – affecting your ability to walk, causing pain, or accompanied by weakness – then contact us immediately. Otherwise, follow up in six weeks as scheduled. I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Memmolo. I appreciate your time. .
