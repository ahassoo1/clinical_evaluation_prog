DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it's my… well, it's my stool. It's black. Been happening for a bit now, and honestly, I haven't got all day to sit here describing my bathroom habits. I take pills, see? For my aches, the ibuprofen kind. Lots of them. Is that what you need to know? Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your time is valuable, and we will get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. Black stool can be a sign of something we need to investigate, so it’s good you came in. When you say "a bit now," could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, for goodness sake. Maybe… three, four days? I don't keep a calendar of my bowel movements, you know. It’s not like it’s new, it just… is. I noticed it when I was cleaning up, and it looked… wrong. Dark. Like oil. Is that good enough for you? Honestly, I just want to know if I'm dying or not. It’s probably nothing, but my Harold keeps fussing.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four days. Thank you. And you mentioned you take ibuprofen for aches – how much ibuprofen are you typically taking each day, and for how long have you been taking it?
PATIENT: Oh, Harold gets on me about that, too. Well… let me think. It varies. When my arthritis flares up, it’s probably… six of those 200 milligram pills. Sometimes eight if it's really bad. I've been taking something for aches for… oh, goodness, decades. First it was aspirin, then something else, now this ibuprofen. Seems to work, you know? As long as I take enough. A few days a week, sometimes every day, depending. Why are you asking so many questions? It just is what it is!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard. I apologize if I seem to be asking a lot of questions, but it's important for me to get a complete picture of your situation so I can provide you with the best possible care. The ibuprofen is a key piece of information. Taking that much ibuprofen regularly can have side effects, one of which is bleeding in the stomach or intestines, which could cause black, tarry stools. Now, besides the change in stool color, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Bleeding?! Oh, Harold was right. See, this is what happens when you take too many pills. I knew it. But I need them, you understand? My back, my knees… everything aches. Other symptoms… well, I've been a little tired. And… my stomach’s been a bit funny. Not really painful, just… unsettled. Like when you've eaten something bad. But I eat perfectly good food, so it can’t be that. And I get heartburn sometimes. Is that what you mean by symptoms? Everything hurts when you get old, honestly. It's hard to tell what's new and what's just… me.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair point, Ms. Hatchard, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It is difficult to sort out what's new when you have ongoing aches and pains. The tiredness and unsettled stomach, along with the heartburn, are all things we should investigate further, especially in light of the black stool and your ibuprofen use. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your stomach and check for any tenderness. Then, I’d like to order a couple of blood tests to check your iron levels and assess your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. Blood tests, poking and prodding… honestly, doctors these days. It’s not like I enjoy this. And I hope it doesn’t take all day. I have errands to run, you know. Harold's expecting me back by noon. Just… hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I will be as quick and efficient as possible. First, let's listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to use the stethoscope to listen for any unusual sounds. Just breathe normally. Okay, I'm not hearing anything immediately concerning. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, no pain exactly. Just… uncomfortable. It always feels a bit tender, you know? Old age. It's like poking a bruise, sort of. You're pressing on things that ache anyway. But don't go digging around too much! I don’t want to feel worse. And are you wearing gloves? I don’t like people touching me with their bare hands. It's unsanitary.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hatchard, I am wearing gloves, and I always do for examinations. I understand your concern about hygiene. You’re right, it's difficult to determine what is normal discomfort versus something new. Given your history and the symptoms you’ve described, I think it’s important to run some tests to rule out any potential issues. I’ll order a Complete Blood Count to check for anemia, which can sometimes be caused by bleeding in the stomach or intestines. I'll also order a stool test to confirm the presence of blood and check for any other abnormalities. Finally, I'd like to check your iron levels. Would you be able to provide a stool sample today?
PATIENT: A stool sample?! Oh, honestly! Now you want me to… to collect it? That’s… humiliating! Can’t you just test the one I’ve already… you know? I’m not going to run home and… ugh. Harold will be furious. He hates when I have to go to the doctor, and this… this is just adding insult to injury. Look, is it really necessary? I told you, I've probably just taken too many pills. Just give me something for my aches and be done with it!
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, the stool sample needs to be relatively fresh to get accurate results. The one you've already passed won’t be suitable for testing. It's not about accusing you of anything, but about getting a clear picture of what’s going on. We need to rule out other potential causes of the black stool besides medication, such as bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The tests are relatively quick and straightforward. The clinic has collection supplies, and we can provide you with clear instructions. It's a vital step in ensuring we give you the right treatment. If the tests come back negative, and it's simply a side effect of the ibuprofen, we can discuss ways to manage your pain with a lower dose or alternative medications. Would you be willing to collect a sample before you leave today?
PATIENT: Fine. But I'm not happy about it. And I expect Harold to be very cross. Just tell me what I have to do, and let’s get it over with. And please, don’t make me talk about it. I’m a respectable woman, you know. Just the instructions, please. Quickly. I have errands, and Harold is expecting me. This whole thing is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I apologize again for the inconvenience. Here are the instructions. The clinic restroom has a stool collection kit. It includes a clean container and instructions. Please try to collect a small amount of stool, about a walnut-sized portion, in the container. Avoid any toilet water. Once collected, there will be a label to place on the container with your name and date of birth. And then you can hand it to the lab technician at the front desk on your way out. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A walnut-sized portion… honestly! This is degrading. No, I don’t have any questions. Just… get on with it. I’ll go do it, and then I want to see the results. And if it’s just the pills, I want something stronger for the pain. Something that will actually work. This whole ordeal has given me a headache, you know. And I’m getting very tired of standing around. Just… is there anything else? Are we done yet? I really need to get going. Harold will be furious if I'm late for dinner.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hatchard, we are almost done. I’ve ordered the blood tests and the stool test. The blood tests will take a little longer to come back, usually a few days. We’ll contact you as soon as we have the results. The stool test usually comes back faster, within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend temporarily reducing your ibuprofen dose to the lowest effective amount, if possible, while we investigate. Avoid taking more than four pills in a 24-hour period. I understand your frustration and your need to get back to your errands. I want to assure you that we are taking your concerns seriously and will do everything we can to get you a diagnosis and treatment plan as quickly as possible. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… hurry up with the results. And don't call Harold. I'll deal with it myself. Just… send me a message. A simple message. I don’t need a lecture, I just need to know what’s going on. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hatchard. We will contact you with the results as soon as they are available. And we will simply send a message, as you requested. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Have a good day.
