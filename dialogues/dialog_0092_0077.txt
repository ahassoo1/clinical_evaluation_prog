DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. My name is Dr. Mohamed Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Eh, morning to you too. Giganti, you say? Fine. They sent me here for... for checkin’. After all those years down in the ground. No sickness, mind you. Just… checkin’. They want me checked. Waste of time, if you ask me. But here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a general check-up, as requested. Even without any specific concerns, it’s always good to get a baseline assessment and ensure everything is functioning as it should be. It’s good preventative care. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Hmph. I worked. Hard work. Down in the mine. Years and years. Lifting, moving... you know. Not sitting around like some people. I ate what my wife cooked. Beans, mostly. And yam. Good, strong food. Before… before she passed. What kind of questions are these? You want to know if I breathe air?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem basic, Mr. Bigger. I just want to get a complete picture of your health history. It helps me understand what might be contributing to how you’re feeling now, and what to look out for. You mentioned working in the mine for many years – that's very helpful information. Were there any specific injuries you sustained while working, or any long-term effects you noticed from the work?
PATIENT: Injuries? Plenty. Scrapes, bruises... a twisted ankle once. Nothing a little rest didn’t fix. Long-term effects… well, my back ain't what it used to be. But who's back is at my age? And the dust. Always the dust. It got in everything. They gave us those… those masks. Thin things. Didn’t do much good, if you ask me. But what could you do? Job was a job. Needed the money. Wife needed things. Now… she doesn’t need anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. Working in the mine sounds very physically demanding, and the dust exposure is certainly a concern. We'll want to discuss that further. You mentioned your back isn't what it used to be. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Pain? It’s… a dull ache. Most days. Gets worse when I bend over. Or lift something. Not like a sharp pain, you understand? Just… a constant reminder. Like an old friend you don't want to see. I try not to complain. Makes me feel weak. My wife always said, “A strong man bears his burdens.” She was a good woman. A very good woman.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve lived a very full life, Mr. Bigger, and faced many challenges with strength. It's understandable to carry those burdens, both physical and emotional. Let's focus on the back pain for now. Does the pain radiate down your legs at all?
PATIENT: Radiate? What does that mean? You using big words again, doctor. Does it… spread? Sometimes, if I’ve been on my feet too long, my legs feel a little… heavy. And a little numb. But I figured that was just old age. Everything gets numb eventually, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: "Radiate" simply means does the pain spread from your back to other areas, like down your legs. And you are right, numbness can be a part of aging. However, it’s important to rule out any other potential causes. So, the numbness you experience is in both legs?
PATIENT: Mostly the left one. Sometimes the right. It comes and goes. Like a bad dream. I try to ignore it. What good does worrying do? Besides, I got better things to think about. Bills to pay, house to keep... though there's not much to keep anymore. Just me and the memories.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a lot. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and range of motion. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Hmph. More poking and prodding. I suppose. Get it over with. Don’t go tickling me now, doctor. I’m a strong man, but I don’t like surprises. Just be quick about it. I got things to do. Though, like I said, not much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your reflexes and strength in your legs and arms. Finally, I’ll assess your range of motion. Take a deep breath for me, please… and another… Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Could you please extend your legs?
PATIENT: Extend? Like this? Go on, get it over with. Don’t expect miracles, doctor. These legs have seen things. They’ve carried me a long way. And they’re tired. Very tired. That tickles! I told you, no tickling.
DOCTOR: Yes, a little diminished, as expected. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Squeeze as hard as you comfortably can… Good. And now the other hand… A bit weaker on this side, but still present. Now, let's check your range of motion. Could you bend forward at the waist as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oof! That's about as far as I go, doctor. It's… tight. Very tight. Like rusty hinges. Don't expect me to do any gymnastics now. I haven't been that flexible since… well, since before the mine, probably. My back is complaining. Loudly.
DOCTOR: I see. Limited range of motion, as expected, with some discomfort. Okay, Mr. Bigger, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it appears you have some age-related changes in your spine, likely contributing to the back pain and some nerve compression causing the numbness in your legs. The reduced reflexes and strength are also consistent with this. To rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order some imaging – an X-ray of your lower back to get a better look at the bones and an MRI to assess the nerves and soft tissues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Imaging? X-rays and… what was the other one? More poking and prodding, but with machines this time. Hmph. Seems like a lot of fuss for an old man’s back. But… if it gets me out of hearing people tell me to “watch my back,” maybe it’s worth it. Alright, doctor. Order your pictures. But don’t expect any miracles. Just tell me when and where to go. I got things to do... even if there’s not much to do.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Bigger. I’ll have the orders sent to the radiology department. They are located just down the hall, and they will schedule you for an appointment. It usually takes a few days to get in. In the meantime, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed, and try to avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates your back pain. Gentle stretching can also be helpful, but stop if you feel any sharp pain. I’ll review the results of the imaging once they are available and discuss the best course of treatment with you. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmph. What good would questions do? It’s an old back. It’s going to ache. It’s going to be stiff. That’s just life. But… Will these pictures… will they show everything? Will they show how much damage has been done? I don’t want to know if it's… serious. Just tell me what I need to do to make it stop hurting. That’s all. And… Will it get worse? Will I end up… stuck? Not being able to move at all?
DOCTOR: Those are very understandable concerns, Mr. Bigger. The imaging will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on in your spine – the bones, the nerves, and the soft tissues. It will help us determine the cause of your pain and rule out any serious underlying conditions. I understand your concern about knowing the extent of the damage. We can take things one step at a time. We don’t have to discuss every detail of the results if you’re not comfortable. I can simply explain what we need to do to manage your pain and improve your quality of life. As for your concern about getting worse, it’s difficult to say definitively. However, with appropriate treatment – which may include medication, physical therapy, or other interventions – we can often slow down the progression of symptoms and help you maintain your mobility and independence. I want to assure you that we'll work together to develop a plan that’s right for you, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. Do you want me to write down the over-the-counter pain relievers and some gentle stretches for you?
PATIENT: Write it down, doctor. Yes. And… thank you. For not making me feel like a… a broken-down old man. It's easy to feel that way sometimes. Just… write it down. And I’ll go get these pictures taken. Maybe they’ll show something. Maybe they won’t. But at least I'm doing something. Something to try and fix it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. Here you are. This lists ibuprofen or naproxen – the dosages are listed here. Please follow those instructions carefully. And these are some gentle stretches you can try. Start slowly and stop if you feel any pain. I’ve also included the radiology department's phone number and address. They'll schedule your appointment when you call. I will be in touch once the results are available. In the meantime, if your pain worsens or you experience any new symptoms – such as weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or fever – please contact the office immediately. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Bigger. And remember, you are not a broken-down old man. You are a strong man who has lived a full life, and I am here to help you continue to live it to the fullest. .
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. That… that means a lot. And… thank you for the writing. My eyes ain't what they used to be. I’ll call those people. And I’ll try those stretches. Maybe they’ll help. Well, I suppose I’ll be going now. Good day to you, doctor. And… thank you again. .
