DOCTOR: Good morning, Aurthur. Welcome in. I’m Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye, Dr. Renzi. Nice to meet ye as well. Well, it's this nausea, ye see. Been gettin' it most mornings now. It's not a pleasant way to start the day, I can tell ye that much. And the nurse mentioned somethin' about my heart... is that connected, d'ye think?
DOCTOR: Nausea in the mornings, alright. And the nurse mentioned something about your heart… yes, let’s definitely talk about both of those things. It’s good you brought that up. To start with the nausea, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Aye, right enough. Well, it usually starts soon after I wake up. Not right away, but within an hour or so. It’s not… violent, if ye ken what I mean. More like a queasy feelin', a rollin' in me stomach. Doesn't always come with vomitin', thankfully, but it makes me feel awful weak and tired for a good part o' the mornin’. I've been tryin' to eat a wee biscuit before gettin' up, but it doesn't seem to make much difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's within an hour of waking, not violent vomiting, more of a queasiness, weakness and tiredness… and the biscuit isn’t helping much. That's helpful to know. Now, has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not much, really. I’ve been keepin’ to me routine, walkin’ the dog every day, readin’… the weather's been a bit warmer, mind ye. And I did help my niece move some furniture last week, but it wasn't overly strenuous. Oh! And I switched to a new brand o' tea. Herbal tea, supposed to be good for yer digestion. Could that be it, d’ye think? It’s got… chamomile and somethin’ else. Fennel, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, new tea – chamomile and fennel. That’s definitely worth considering. Sometimes even small changes like that can upset things. And the warmer weather could be a factor too. Now, let's talk about what the nurse mentioned regarding your heart. Do you know what specifically they were concerned about?
PATIENT: Aye, she said somethin' about heart failure. I was diagnosed a few years back, but I've been managin' alright, or so I thought. Just a wee bit o' shortness o' breath when I'm climbin' stairs, that’s been about it. I take a couple o' tablets every day, water tablets I think they are, to get rid o' the swellin' in me ankles. But she seemed concerned that the nausea might be connected to it. I dinna understand how a sick stomach and a sick heart could be linked, to be honest. Is it somethin' serious, Dr. Renzi?
DOCTOR: Okay, heart failure diagnosis a few years ago, managed with diuretics for swelling… and the nurse’s concern about a link to the nausea. You’re right to ask if it’s connected, and it’s good you brought that up. It is possible. Sometimes, changes in heart function can lead to nausea, or medications can have side effects. Let's not jump to conclusions though. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your heart condition, and then do a quick physical exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Dr. Renzi. Ask away. I’ll tell ye what I can. I’m not one for bein’ poked and prodded overly much, but if it’ll help figure things out, I’m happy enough. Just be gentle, eh? My old bones dinna take to rough treatment. Fire away, then.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be as gentle as possible. Now, can you tell me approximately when you were diagnosed with heart failure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was… October o’ 2021, I believe. Aye, October. I remember it bein' a damp, dreich month, much like today, actually. I was stayin’ with my sister at the time, she lives down in Edinburgh. I was feelin’ awful weak and breathless, and she convinced me to go to the doctor. It was a bit of a shock, to be honest. I’d always been a healthy enough lad, up until then. They did a bunch o' tests, and that’s what they told me. Said somethin' about me heart not pumpin' as well as it should. They put me on the tablets, and I’ve been takin’ them ever since. Do ye need to know what kind o’ heart failure it was? I dinna remember the specifics.
DOCTOR: October 2021, diagnosed with heart failure… alright. It's helpful to know it was around that time. Don’t worry about the specifics of the type of heart failure right now, that’s something we can look up in your records if needed. Now, when you say your heart isn't pumping as well, has that gotten worse recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. It’s not like there’s been a sudden change, not exactly. But I reckon… aye, I reckon it has been a wee bit worse over the last few months. The shortness o’ breath seems to come on a bit easier now, and I find myself havin' to stop and rest more often when I’m out walkin’ the dog. It’s not terrible, mind ye, but it’s noticeable. And the ankles do swell up a bit more quickly if I stand for too long. I’ve been tryin' to put me feet up whenever I can. But that’s the only real change I’ve noticed, besides this blasted nausea. It’s just… feelin' a bit more tired overall, like I’m runnin' on empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual worsening over the last few months – easier shortness of breath, more frequent rests during walks, quicker ankle swelling, and overall fatigue. That’s important information. Before we move on, let’s quickly go through a review of other systems. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s a good question. My appetite… it’s been a bit off, actually. Not that I’m not eatin’ at all, but I just dinna feel as hungry as I used to. And when I do eat, it's more like pickin' at things than enjoyin' a proper meal. Especially in the mornin', which is maybe why I'm feelin’ so weak. This nausea just takes away any interest I might have had in food, ye see. It’s not somethin' I actively worry about, but I have noticed I'm not lookin' forward to meals the way I used to. It's just… bleh. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Aurthur. Reduced appetite, particularly in the mornings, and lack of interest in food… that certainly fits with what you’ve been describing. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, or palpitations – that is, a feeling like your heart is racing or fluttering?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No chest pain at all. And I haven't noticed me heart racin' or flutterin', not a single bit. I was a bit worried about that, to be honest, readin' things online about heart problems. But no, no chest pain or palpitations. I get a wee bit o' breathlessness, mind ye, but it’s not sharp or painful, more like I'm just runnin' out o' air. And it usually goes away if I sit down and rest for a bit. But no, nothin' like pain. I'm glad to hear ye ask, though. It’s good to get things checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Aurthur. No chest pain or palpitations is reassuring. Let's move on to past medical history. Aside from the heart failure, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had me appendix out when I was a wee lad, but that was ages ago. And I had a bad bout o' the flu a couple o' winters back, but that's about it. Oh! And I've always had a bit o' trouble with me back, old rugby injury. But that’s just aches and pains, not a proper medical condition. I dinna take any other medications besides the water tablets for me heart, and I'm not allergic to anythin' as far as I know. I've been fairly lucky, health-wise, up until this heart business. I used to smoke a wee bit, years ago, but I gave that up when I got married. That was… a long time ago now. Anything else ye need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, a bout of the flu, chronic back pain, no known allergies. You quit smoking, which is excellent. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s a good question. Me father… he had high blood pressure, I think it was. And he had a stroke when he was an old man. Me mother… she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. And me sister… she's got diabetes, type 2 diabetes. And… oh, and me grandfather on me mother’s side… he had a heart condition, but I dinna know what kind. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about things like that back then. Does that help? I’m not sure how much I remember, to be honest. It was a long time ago now, and nobody was particularly good at keepin' track o' these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and stroke in your father, arthritis in your mother, and diabetes and a heart condition in other family members. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Aye, I do. But not a lot. Just a wee dram o' whisky most nights, after me dinner. It helps me relax, ye see. And I’ll maybe have a pint o' beer with me dinner on a Saturday night. But that’s about it. I dinna go out drinkin’ much, and I certainly don’t binge drink. Just a wee bit to take the edge off. It’s more of a habit than anythin’ else, to be honest. My wife used to say it kept the cold away. I miss her somethin' awful, still. Does that answer yer question?
DOCTOR: That answers it perfectly, Aurthur. A wee dram of whisky most nights and occasional pint of beer. Alright. Thank you for answering all those questions so thoroughly. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine. Go ahead. I’m not overly fond o' bein' poked and prodded, but I understand ye need to do yer job. Just be gentle, eh? And tell me if ye find anythin' worryin’. I’d rather know about it straight away than wonderin’ about it later. Feel free to ask me to move or lie down if ye need to. Let’s get it over with, then. Fire away, Dr. Renzi.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be as gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 150 over 90. It can fluctuate, though. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and a bit of fluid in your lungs. And I notice some swelling in your ankles. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Everything else feels normal. But the elevated blood pressure, irregular rhythm, fluid in your lungs, and ankle swelling are all concerning.
PATIENT: Oh. That doesn't sound good, does it? Fluid in me lungs… irregular rhythm… That’s what I was worried about, aye. Is it bad? Is me heart gettin’ worse? What does it mean? I’ve been feelin' a bit more tired lately, and this nausea… could that be connected to all of that? I dinna want to end up in the hospital, Dr. Renzi. I’m too old for that. What do ye think I should do?
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Aurthur. It does sound like your heart failure is worsening. The fluid in your lungs and the irregular rhythm are signs of that, and the elevated blood pressure isn’t helping. The nausea could be a symptom of the worsening heart failure, as it can affect blood flow to your stomach, or it could be a side effect of the water tablets. Now, I don't want to scare you, but ignoring these signs could lead to hospitalization. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and a marker called BNP, which helps us assess the severity of heart failure. I also want to get an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. And I'd like to get a chest X-ray to confirm the fluid in your lungs. In the meantime, I’m going to adjust your water tablet dosage. And I want you to strictly limit your sodium intake – no processed foods, no added salt, and watch out for hidden sodium in things like bread and soup. And weigh yourself every morning and let my office know if you gain more than two pounds in a day, or five pounds in a week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… sensible. More tests, less salt, weighin’ meself… I can manage that. Though I do love a bit o’ salt on me dinner. But if it’ll help, I’ll cut back. And I’ll watch out for the weight gain. Two pounds in a day… right. And five in a week. What about this nausea, though? Is there anythin’ I can do for that? It’s just awful to start the day feelin’ sick. And what are the chances I'll need to go to the hospital? Be honest with me, Dr. Renzi. I dinna like surprises. And how long will it take to get these test results back? I'm just tryin’ to figure out what I’m up against here, ye see. It’s hard bein’ old and feelin' like yer body’s betrayin’ ye.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Aurthur. Let’s address everything. Regarding the nausea, we can try some anti-nausea medication. I’ll write you a prescription for something mild to start with. If that doesn’t help, we can explore other options. As for the chances of needing to go to the hospital… it’s difficult to say for certain. It depends on how quickly your condition progresses and how you respond to the treatment. If your breathing gets worse, you develop severe swelling, or you feel extremely weak or dizzy, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. The blood tests and EKG should be back within a few days. The chest X-ray results might take a bit longer, depending on the radiologist's schedule. Once I have those results, I’ll be able to give you a more definitive assessment and create a more tailored treatment plan. For now, let's focus on managing your symptoms, limiting your sodium intake, and monitoring your weight. I’ll also have my nurse call you in a couple of days to check in and see how you’re doing. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… alright. A plan is good. Medication for the nausea, watch the salt and weight, and ye’ll call when ye have the results. And if it gets worse, go to the hospital. I can remember all that. Thank ye, Dr. Renzi. Ye’ve been very patient with an old man, and I appreciate it. I’ve been worryin' myself sick, and ye’ve at least given me somethin’ to focus on. I'll try to follow yer instructions as best I can. If ye don't mind, though… what kind o’ medication did ye prescribe for the nausea? Just so I know what to expect. And… is there anythin’ else I should be doin'? Any special exercises, or foods I should be avoidin' besides the salt? I just want to be prepared, ye see. This is all a bit overwhelmín’.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aurthur. I'm glad I could help ease some of your worries. The medication I prescribed is called Metoclopramide. It's a mild anti-nausea drug that helps speed up digestion and empty your stomach. It can sometimes cause drowsiness, so be careful when driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you. As for other things you should be doing, try to stay as active as possible, but listen to your body and don't overdo it. Avoid strenuous exercise. You should also avoid alcohol, as it can worsen heart failure and interfere with the medication. And try to eat small, frequent meals instead of large ones. It's also important to stay well-hydrated, but limit your fluid intake if you're experiencing swelling. And, of course, if you notice any new or worsening symptoms, don’t hesitate to call my office. Here’s a copy of your prescription, and a handout with information about heart failure and dietary recommendations. And my nurse will be in touch soon to answer any further questions you may have. Do you have any questions for me right now before we finish?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s… a lot to remember. Metoclopramide… small meals… avoid alcohol… limit fluids… I'll try to write it all down. I think I've got it. No, I don't think so, Dr. Renzi. Ye've covered everythin' I was worryin’ about, and I appreciate it. I'll take the medication, watch me diet, and keep an eye on me symptoms. Thank ye again for yer time, and for bein' so patient. I’ll be seein’ ye again soon, I expect.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aurthur. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We’ll get through this together. Have a good day, and remember to rest.
