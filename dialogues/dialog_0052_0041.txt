DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Shely. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s getting worse, you see. Been happening for a while now, but lately, it’s… harder to do things. Just feeling tired and… not strong. I think it’s this Multiple Sclerosis the other doctor told me about.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Astore. It’s helpful to know what’s been concerning you. You mentioned this weakness has been worsening, and you’ve been told about the possibility of Multiple Sclerosis. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Hmm… where to start? It’s mostly in my legs, I think. Makes walking… difficult sometimes. Not always, but often. And my hands… they feel clumsy. Like I can’t hold things as tight as I used to. It’s hard to explain. It comes and goes, but it’s been happening more often these last few months. It's not pain, exactly… just… not working right. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Astore. It sounds quite frustrating to experience that fluctuating weakness in your legs and hands. To help me understand the pattern of this, could you describe a typical day?
PATIENT: Well, usually I wake up with my wife, Leilani. We have breakfast, simple things, toast and fruit. I try to do a little bit of gardening, mostly weeding, but sometimes that’s… hard now. It takes longer, and I need to sit down more. I used to be able to work in the garden all morning! Then we might go to the market. Walking around there… that can be tiring too. Afternoons, I usually rest. Read a bit, watch some TV. Evenings are quiet. We eat dinner, talk. But lately… I find myself needing more naps during the day. It’s not like I'm sick, sick, but… tired all the time. It’s just… different.
DOCTOR: Thank you for painting that picture, Mr. Astore. It sounds like this fatigue is significantly impacting your daily activities, and that's certainly concerning. Now, could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms alongside this weakness and fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my vision gets blurry, but it doesn’t last long. Just a little bit fuzzy, then it goes away. And I’ve been… a little clumsy, like I stumble more than I used to. Not falling, just… off balance. My wife says I sometimes slur my words a little, but I don’t always notice that myself. It’s hard to say what’s normal at my age, you know? And… oh! Sometimes I feel a tingling in my arms and legs, like pins and needles. But that doesn’t happen every day. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all very important information, Mr. Astore. The blurry vision, occasional clumsiness, slurred speech, and tingling sensations are all things we need to consider. It’s good that you’re sharing all of these details with me, even if they seem minor. To get a better understanding of your medical background, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been okay since then. I also had a surgery on my knee a long time ago, when I was playing football. But that's healed up fine. Oh, and I had the flu a couple of winters ago, but everyone gets the flu, right? Other than that… not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. That's why this is so… confusing. I don't understand why this is happening now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astore. It’s helpful to know about the high blood pressure and the previous knee surgery. Could you please tell me the names of any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a pill for the blood pressure, it’s called… Lisinopril, I think. Just one every morning. And sometimes, when my joints are a little achy, I take some ibuprofen, the over-the-counter kind. Not every day, just when I need it. And… oh, my wife gives me a vitamin D supplement sometimes. She says I don’t get enough sun. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. I don't like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astore. That’s very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always says I’m lucky. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, except maybe that one time I tried spicy curry, but that was just my stomach! No allergies, Doctor. I think. I’ve never had anything bad happen.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Astore. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had arthritis, pretty bad towards the end of her life. And my older brother, he had some trouble with his heart, needed a surgery a few years ago. My father was healthy as a horse, though, lived to be 89. And… I think my aunt, on my wife’s side, had diabetes. But that’s all I can really think of right now. We didn’t talk about health much when I was growing up. It wasn't something we focused on.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astore. That gives me a good starting point. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I used to be very active. Gardening, playing football when I was younger. Now, it's mostly… relaxing. I don’t smoke, never have. I drink a little bit of beer sometimes, with dinner. Not a lot, maybe one or two. I try to eat healthy, my wife is a good cook. We eat lots of fish, fruits, vegetables. I don’t do much exercise now, except walking around the garden. It's a pretty quiet life, Doctor. Nothing fancy. I like it that way. But I miss being able to do more.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astore. That's very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs, neurological function, strength, and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I'm not as young as I used to be, you know? But I’m happy to cooperate. Just take your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore, if you could please extend your arms in front of you. Your strength is a little diminished in your legs, as you mentioned, about 4 out of 5 on both sides. Your reflexes are slightly brisk, and there is some mild incoordination when performing the finger-to-nose test. Your gait is also a bit unsteady and wider than normal. I’m also noting some mild sensation loss in your feet. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Based on your history and the physical examination findings, it’s clear you’re experiencing a number of neurological symptoms, including weakness, fatigue, vision changes, tingling, and coordination difficulties. While it’s impossible to make a definitive diagnosis without further testing, these findings are suggestive of a possible demyelinating condition, such as Multiple Sclerosis, as the other doctor suspected. However, other conditions could also be responsible for these symptoms. Would you be comfortable with me ordering some tests to help narrow down the possibilities?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. Tests… yes, that’s a good idea. I want to know what’s happening, you know? I don't want to just sit here wondering. So, yes, please order whatever tests you think are necessary. Whatever it takes to figure out what's wrong. I trust you. Just… please explain the results to me when they come back, okay? I don't understand all the medical talk.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Astore. I understand your concern and will absolutely explain the results in a clear and understandable way. I’m going to order an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to look for any lesions or abnormalities that might be causing your symptoms. I’ll also order some blood tests to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or inflammatory conditions. I’m also going to order a visual evoked potential test to assess the electrical activity in your optic nerve, as you mentioned some vision changes. These tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. It may take a few days to schedule and complete all of these tests. The lab will contact you directly to schedule the appointments. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest and avoiding any strenuous activity. If your symptoms worsen significantly, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That all sounds… thorough. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Just… the MRI… is it uncomfortable? And how long will it take? I've never had one before. And… will I have to stay overnight? Just worried about that. But other than that, no, I think I understand. Thank you again. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results. I’m anxious to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astore. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about an MRI, especially if you've never had one before. The MRI itself is not painful, but it can be a bit uncomfortable. You'll be lying on a table inside a large, tunnel-like machine. It can be quite loud, so we’ll provide you with headphones to wear. It’s important to remain very still during the scan, as any movement can blur the images. The scan typically takes about 30-60 minutes. You will not need to stay overnight. It’s an outpatient procedure, meaning you'll be able to go home immediately after the scan. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available and will contact you directly to schedule a follow-up appointment. We'll discuss everything in detail at that time. I understand your anxiety, and I will do my best to provide you with clear and concise information. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. Thank you. I'll just… wait for the lab to call. And I’ll try to rest in the meantime. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astore. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
