DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I'm Dr. Cumper. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get on with it. It's my stool. It's black. Been taking these pain pills for years, you know, for my arthritis, and now it's just…black. Is that serious? I hope not.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard, I understand you're concerned about the color of your stool. Black stool can be a sign of something going on, and it's good you're getting it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Well, what more is there to tell you? It's black! Like…tar, almost. Not normal, obviously. I haven't eaten anything that would turn it black, I assure you. I eat perfectly normal food. Meat and potatoes, mostly. And vegetables, sometimes. Don’t go thinking I live on junk. It’s been happening for…oh, a week, maybe? A little longer. I really don’t keep track of these things. It's just... unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week or so of tar-like black stools. And you haven’t noticed anything else different – no changes in your appetite, no nausea or vomiting, no abdominal pain or cramping?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I eat the same amount as always, maybe a little less when my arthritis is acting up, but that’s just because it hurts to move, not because I'm sick. No throwing up, no belly aches. Just…the stool. Look, I take these pills, these pain pills, every day for years. Could it be something to do with those? They’re the only thing that keeps me going.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Hatchard. Certain medications can cause changes in stool color. Let’s talk about those pills. Do you happen to know the name of the medication, and the dosage you’re taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names… I never remember names. My husband, Harold, he handles all that. Let me think… they’re little white ones. Small, round, and I take…two in the morning and two at night, I think. No, wait, three in the morning, two at night. Or is it the other way around? It's something with ‘profen’ in it, I'm pretty sure. Naprofen, maybe? Or Ibuprofen? Honestly, it all blurs together. It comes in a big orange bottle. That’s about all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, an orange bottle with a medication ending in ‘profen’ – likely either naproxen or ibuprofen. We’ll look that up in your records, if we can. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any blood in your stool, even a little bit?
PATIENT: Blood? Heavens, no! I would know if there was blood. That would be… alarming. No, nothing like that. Just black, like I said. Not bright red, not mixed in, just… dark. Look, I've lived a long life, I know what normal stool looks like and this isn't it. Can you just tell me if it’s something to worry about or not? I haven't got time for a lot of tests and poking around.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and wanting to get straight to the point, Ms. Hatchard. Black, tarry stools can be a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract, which we definitely need to investigate. The medication you're taking can irritate the stomach lining, and that's a possibility we need to rule out. I'm going to need to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. After that, we may need to run a blood test or two, and possibly a stool test. It's the best way to get a clear picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. More tests? Look, I told you, I haven’t got time for all this. I’ve got a garden that needs weeding, and Harold needs help with the groceries. I suppose…I suppose I can answer a few questions, but no poking and prodding, understand? And no sending me off to specialists. Just tell me what's wrong, and give me something to fix it. I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard, I understand. We'll try to keep it as brief as possible. Let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis is enough, thank you very much. It’s bad enough, believe me. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago, but it went away on its own. Harold always said it was because I wasn’t getting enough fresh air. He’s always got some opinion. I don’t think it ever needed medicine, I just…slowed down a bit. And I had my gallbladder out, ages ago, but that was no big deal. Other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy. Tough as nails, my mother always said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that resolved on its own, and gallbladder removal. And you’re generally feeling well otherwise?
PATIENT: Yes, generally. A bit creaky in the mornings, and I get tired easily, but that's just old age, isn't it? Honestly, I think this stool business is just the pills. They upset my stomach sometimes, you know. Give me a little heartburn. I've got some tablets for that, if that matters. Pink ones. But this is different, this is…dark.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard. You mentioned you take tablets for heartburn. What is the name of those tablets?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. More names! It's…Tums, I think. Or maybe Rolaids? One of those. The ones you chew. They’re white, and they fizz a little bit. Harold buys them for me. He keeps a big container of them in the kitchen. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to the names, just that they help my stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll try to get a clearer picture of everything. Now, have you ever had any issues with ulcers or stomach bleeding in the past?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Goodness, no! I've never had anything like that. I eat sensible food, I told you. Meat and potatoes, mostly. And I don't drink or smoke. I take care of myself, as much as an old woman can. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Though, these pills…they do seem to be causing some trouble, don't they?
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, for colds and aches and pains. Never had a reaction, not once. Harold says I’m as tough as an old boot. Honestly, I think all this questioning is a waste of time. Can't you just give me something to stop the black stool? It's unpleasant, and I've got a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your frustration. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check your vital signs. It won’t take long. Then, depending on what I find, we can discuss some possible next steps, including a stool test to look for blood. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to lie there all day. I've got things to do, you know. And no cold instruments, understand? I don’t like cold things on my skin.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. No cold instruments, I promise. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’m just going to listen to your belly with my stethoscope. Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90, and your pulse is 78 and regular. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the upper part. No masses or obvious abnormalities. It's not a definitive finding, but we still need to investigate the cause of the black stool.
PATIENT: Elevated? See? I knew something was wrong. It's those pills, I tell you. They're messing with my insides. So, what now? Are you going to send me off to some fancy specialist? Because I’m not going. I want a simple solution, not a lot of poking and prodding. Just tell me what to take to make it stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I'm not going to send you to a specialist right away. The first thing I want to do is order a stool test to check for hidden blood. It’s a simple test you can do at home. That will help us determine if there is indeed bleeding in your digestive tract. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you temporarily stop taking the naproxen or ibuprofen – whichever one it is – until we get the results of the stool test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Stop taking the pills? But my arthritis! It will flare up something awful. I won't be able to move. Harold will have to do everything, and he complains enough as it is. Is there anything else I can take in the meantime? Something for the pain, you know? I can’t just sit around and suffer while you run tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the arthritis pain, Ms. Hatchard. Stopping the naproxen or ibuprofen even temporarily can be difficult. We can discuss some options for managing the pain while we investigate the cause of the black stool. For mild to moderate pain relief, we could try acetaminophen . It doesn't have the same stomach-irritating effects as naproxen or ibuprofen. However, it's important to follow the dosage instructions carefully, as taking too much acetaminophen can be harmful to your liver. We'll also need to keep a close eye on your symptoms to ensure they don't worsen. Would you be comfortable trying acetaminophen, and doing a stool test as soon as possible?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen… yes, I think I’ve heard of that. Pink tablets, aren’t they? Harold might have some. And a stool test… ugh. Fine, I’ll do it, but I want clear instructions. And I don't want to have to go anywhere special to get it done. Can I do it at home? I'm not going traipsing around town for a silly test. And make it quick, I’ve got a garden to tend to!
DOCTOR: Yes, you can absolutely do the stool test at home. I’ll give you a kit with clear instructions on how to collect the sample and where to mail it. It’s a fairly simple process, and you shouldn’t have to go anywhere special. The lab will send the results to me directly. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, please start taking acetaminophen as directed – 500mg every six hours as needed for pain, but don’t exceed 3000mg in 24 hours. And please let me know if your symptoms worsen at any time. Here’s a prescription for the acetaminophen, and the stool test kit. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just get me out of here so I can get back to my garden. Honestly, all this fuss over a bit of black stool. Harold will be wondering what’s keeping me. Tell you what, if it doesn't get better soon, I'm blaming you. Good day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your concerns. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Here’s the number for the office. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. And please, don't blame me until we have the results of the test. It's best to rule things out before jumping to conclusions. .
