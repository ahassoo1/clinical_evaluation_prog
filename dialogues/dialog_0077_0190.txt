DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s this unsteadiness, you see. I’ve been feeling rather off-balance. It’s hard to explain precisely, and honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It just… happens. I stumble sometimes, or feel like I might fall. It's been worrying me, naturally.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly concerning to feel unsteady, and it's perfectly alright that it’s difficult to explain. We’ll take our time. When did you first notice this unsteadiness, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That’s… a tricky one. It feels like it’s been gradually getting worse, but pinpointing a specific date… I’m afraid I couldn't say. Perhaps a few months ago? It's all a bit blurry, truthfully. I… I do remember it being more noticeable after… after my husband passed. But it’s hard to say if that’s connected.
DOCTOR: A few months ago, with a possible connection to a stressful life event… that's helpful to know. And I understand memory can be affected by such things, so don’t worry about being precise. Has this unsteadiness been constant since it started, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Some days are better than others. There are moments where I feel perfectly fine, and then… suddenly, I'll just feel wobbly. It doesn't seem to have a pattern, not one I’ve noticed, at least. It’s not every day, thankfully. But it’s enough to make me anxious, especially at work. I operate a… a rotary drill. It’s important to be steady, you see.
DOCTOR: A rotary drill… that is important work requiring good balance. And the anxiety is understandable. Now, Lilyanna, could you describe what this “wobbly” feeling is like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How to describe it… It’s not like dizziness, exactly. Not spinning. It’s more like… my feet aren’t quite connected to the ground, perhaps? Or like I’m… floating a little. It's hard to explain. And sometimes I feel… off-center, like I’m going to tip over. It doesn't last long, usually just a few seconds, but it’s frightening when it happens. I have to hold onto something.
DOCTOR: Not spinning, more of a disconnection or feeling off-center… That helps me narrow things down. Do you experience any other symptoms when you feel this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes my vision gets a little blurry when it happens, but I wear glasses, so I thought it might just be them needing adjusting. And… occasionally I get a slight headache afterward, but I’m prone to those anyway. Nothing major, I don't believe. Just… those little things. It's difficult to say if they are related, though. My memory, you understand. I could be forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and occasional headaches… we’ll consider those. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My medical history… Well, I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing serious. As an adult… let me see. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, and I take medication for that. And I had a… a rather bad bout of the flu last year. Apart from that… I don't recall anything significant. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur, as I mentioned. I had a very good doctor before, but… well, things changed after my husband. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication… and a recent bout of the flu. Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… let me think carefully. No, I don’t believe so. Just the medication for the blood pressure. A small white pill, I take it every morning. I make sure to take it regularly. My previous doctor was very strict about that, and I've continued the routine. I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for headaches, but that’s it, I think. Though I might be forgetting something… I really wish my memory was better. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Just the blood pressure medication and occasional pain relievers. Alright. Now, Lilyanna, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. No rashes, no difficulty breathing, nothing like that. I don’t have any food allergies, and I don’t typically suffer from hay fever or anything. I live in the suburbs, so I don’t come into contact with a lot of pollen anyway. Though, again, my memory… I could be forgetting something. It’s a constant worry.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a difficult one. My mother had… heart problems, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t remember much about it. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. But honestly, I don’t know a lot about my family’s medical background. We weren’t very close, and no one really talked about those things. It’s another blank in my memory, unfortunately. I wish I knew more. It might be helpful.
DOCTOR: Heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your father… that's something to consider. Now, Lilyanna, let's talk briefly about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. I wouldn't say I drink regularly at all. I prefer a cup of tea, if you don't mind. And I try to eat a healthy diet, although it's been difficult since... since my husband passed. It's just me now, you see. I don't have much of an appetite sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Lilyanna, before we proceed with a physical examination, I’d like to ask about your work. You mentioned operating a rotary drill. How long have you been doing that?
PATIENT: Oh, the rotary drill… I've been doing that for… about five years now, I believe. It’s demanding work, very precise. A lot of standing, and… well, you have to be steady on your feet. It’s important, as I mentioned. I enjoy it, in a way. It keeps me busy. But lately… lately it’s been worrying me, with this unsteadiness. I don't want to put myself, or anyone else, at risk. It’s a responsibility, you see. It's a difficult job, and this makes it even harder.
DOCTOR: Five years operating a rotary drill… and you're understandably concerned about your unsteadiness impacting your work. Alright. Now, Lilyanna, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and assessing your balance and coordination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and hopefully find a way to feel steady again. It's been… unsettling, to say the least. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. 135 over 85. That’s a bit elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear. Now, I’d like you to stand up slowly and I’ll check your balance. You do seem a bit unsteady on your feet. Mild swaying noted, particularly when walking heel-to-toe. Also, some difficulty with rapid alternating movements. Finally, I'll check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Is that… bad, Doctor? The unsteady feeling, the swaying… I felt it while I was walking, naturally. I try not to mention it, but it's rather difficult to ignore. The murmur, you say? That sounds… concerning. Is it something serious? My memory, you understand, is not what it used to be, so I don't recall ever being told about a murmur before. I appreciate you checking everything so thoroughly. It's just… unsettling to hear these things.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be unsettled, Lilyanna. These findings do warrant further investigation. The slight murmur I heard is not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it’s something we’ll want to explore with an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart. As for the unsteadiness and mild swaying, it could be related to a number of factors. The elevated blood pressure could contribute, as could inner ear issues, or even medication side effects. Given your symptoms and these initial findings, I’d like to order a few tests to help us determine the cause of your unsteadiness. I’ll order an echocardiogram, as mentioned, and also a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. We should also perform a Dix-Hallpike test to rule out Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo , which is a common cause of dizziness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… sounds like a lot of tests, Doctor. But if it will help me find out what’s wrong, then yes, that sounds alright. An echocardiogram, blood counts… and the other tests you mentioned. I trust your judgment, of course. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. I need to be steady for work, you see. I'm a little anxious about the Dix-Hallpike test, if you don't mind me saying. What exactly does that involve? I don't want to be… alarmed, if it’s something unpleasant. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It helps to know what’s happening. It's just… I wish my memory were better, so I could remember all of this.
DOCTOR: It is a fair amount of testing, but it's best to be thorough. As for the Dix-Hallpike test, it's quite simple, although it can briefly induce a feeling of dizziness in some people. It involves quickly moving you from a sitting to a lying position with your head turned to one side. We’ll do it quickly and carefully, and I’ll be right there to support you. It helps us determine if the inner ear is causing your dizziness. We'll also review your medication list to make sure nothing is contributing to your symptoms. While we await the test results, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity, especially operating machinery, until we have a better understanding of what’s going on. I'll also prescribe a low dose of meclizine to help manage any dizziness you may experience. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. Avoiding strenuous activity… that's probably wise. I was feeling anxious about operating the drill anyway. And the meclizine… that sounds helpful, to manage the dizziness. I appreciate you prescribing that. The Dix-Hallpike test… I’ll try not to be alarmed. Quickly moving me, you say? I trust you’ll be right there. So, we'll wait for the test results, avoid the drill, and take the meclizine. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I should be looking out for? My memory, you understand… I want to make sure I don’t forget anything important. This has been… unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: You're doing very well, Lilyanna. You're being very proactive, and that’s excellent. Besides avoiding strenuous activity and taking the meclizine as directed, just be mindful of your balance. If you feel dizzy, sit or lie down immediately to prevent a fall. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, blurred vision, or difficulty speaking—please go to the emergency room immediately. I'll also send a referral to a cardiologist to review the echocardiogram results and provide further guidance. And I'm happy to answer any questions you may have, so don’t hesitate to ask. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the test results and formulate a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Avoiding strenuous activity, mindful of my balance, and watching for new symptoms… I’ll remember that. And I'll be sure to go to the emergency room if anything worsens. A referral to a cardiologist, you say? That sounds… thorough. I appreciate you thinking of everything. A follow-up appointment in two weeks… I’ll mark that in my calendar. Thank you, Doctor Pirl. You’ve been very kind and reassuring. It’s… unsettling to feel unsteady, and you’ve helped to put my mind at ease. Though, truthfully, I’m still anxious. It’s hard to shake this feeling. But I trust you’ll do your best to help me find out what’s wrong. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and try to rest. And remember, we are here for you.
