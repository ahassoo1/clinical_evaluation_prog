DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. My face gets very red. It started maybe a week ago? Not sure exactly. Happens sometimes when I eat, sometimes not. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable how, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: It feels… warm. Like a hot feeling. Not a fever, just… my face. And a little itchy sometimes. Not all over, just where it gets red. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not pain, exactly. More… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, redness and warmth, sometimes itchiness, primarily on your face, occurring intermittently, and seems to be connected, but not definitively, to eating. And it began approximately a week ago. Do you notice what you've eaten when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… I don’t really keep track. I eat a lot of different things. Curry, rice, vegetables… sometimes noodles. I had some spicy chicken yesterday, and I think it was worse after that, but… I’m not positive. It happens with just plain rice sometimes too. I don’t know. It’s very confusing.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed anything else accompanying this flushing?
PATIENT: Accompanying…? You mean… other things happening at the same time? Let me think. Sometimes… my heart feels a little fast. Not like pounding, just… quicker than usual. And maybe a little sweaty. Just my face, though. Not the rest of my body. No dizziness. No… nothing else really. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any changes in your medications, or started any new supplements recently?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't take anything regularly. Not since… well, a long time ago. And supplements… no, nothing like that. I just take a multivitamin sometimes, but I haven’t taken one in weeks. I try to eat healthy food. That’s why this is so strange!
DOCTOR: And what about allergies, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never been tested. I… I get a little sniffly sometimes when the flowers bloom in the spring, but everyone does, right? Nothing serious. No hives, no trouble breathing. Just a little… sneeze. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look at your face. And I’ll listen to your heart and check your blood pressure. It's important to rule out some basic causes. If you could just sit up a bit…
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. Just tell me if you see anything. It’s… not very noticeable all the time. Sometimes it’s better, sometimes it’s worse. It’s very odd.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140 over 90. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Your skin is warm to the touch, and I do see some redness, as you mentioned, primarily on your cheeks and nose. No rash or obvious lesions. Do you have a family history of anything like this, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a difficult question. My wife… she passed away a few years ago. We didn’t talk much about… medical things. And my parents… they lived in India. We didn’t see them very often. I… I don't really know. My mother had… something with her stomach, I think. But I don’t know if that’s related. No one had… red faces, as far as I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history, and the intermittent nature of this, and the fact that it's not accompanied by any other serious symptoms, my initial thought is rosacea. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to ensure there are no underlying issues. We'll also check your thyroid levels. And, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I want you to monitor it at home for a week, and keep a log of your meals and when you experience this flushing.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… complicated. A blood test and… a log? I don’t have a machine to measure my blood pressure at home. And I'm not very good at remembering things. Will these tests be… expensive? I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: The tests themselves aren't excessively expensive, but I understand your concerns about cost. We can discuss options for reduced-cost labs in the area. As for the blood pressure monitoring, you can purchase an affordable home monitor at most pharmacies. It's a small investment for your health. Regarding remembering, it's important to be diligent, Mr. Withycombe. Keeping a log of your meals and symptoms is crucial for an accurate diagnosis. I can provide you with a simple form to fill out. I’ll write a note for the lab and give you the form. Come back in two weeks with the results and the log. If things worsen significantly before then, of course, come back sooner. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. A log, blood tests… two weeks. I will try my best. The pharmacy… yes, I can go to the pharmacy. It's just… a lot to remember. Will… will you explain everything again when I come back? Just to be sure?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Withycombe. We will review everything again when you return. I’ll also provide you with some written information about rosacea. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t think so. Not right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For trying to help. I will… I will try to remember everything. Two weeks… the log… and the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get the tests done as soon as you can, and keep that log diligently. I'll see you in two weeks.
