DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, good day to you too, Doctor… Nooruddin, is it? Well, I’m here for… a thing. A check-up. For… sports. My son, he says I need this paper. For a team. Some kind of tryout. I don’t really… follow these things. It’s hot out, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. A sports physical. Yes, I see that here. And it is rather warm. Let's get this done then, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, good, good. Let’s get it over with. I haven't… done one of these in a long time. What do you need to know? I mostly just… work. Outside. Lifting things. It's not so bad, really. Though my back… sometimes it complains. But who doesn’t have a complaining back these days?
DOCTOR: Well, it's good to know you're active. But "complaining backs" need investigating, Mr. Bartok. It's not just a matter of getting old, you know. Let's start with the basics. When did you first notice the back pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… a long time. Years, probably. I don’t really remember a first time. It just… started being there. Maybe after… a big job. We were doing some roofing. Hot work. Lots of bending. But I’ve had it even when I wasn’t doing roofing. It’s just… a dull ache. Most of the time. It doesn’t stop me from working, though. I need the money, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. But ignoring pain isn't a good strategy, Mr. Bartok. It could be something simple, but it could be more. Is it constant, this ache?
PATIENT: No, no. Not always. Like I said, dull. Sometimes it’s… sharper. If I lift something heavy. Or bend over wrong. Then it really lets me know it’s there. But it goes away. Eventually. I used to take… pills. For it. But they didn’t really do much. And they made me… sleepy. So I stopped. Is that bad? Should I be taking pills? I don’t really like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Well, stopping medication without discussing it with a doctor is generally not advisable, Mr. Bartok. It's good you told me. What kind of pills were they?
PATIENT: Oh… now, that's a good question. My… ex-wife, she handled all that. I just… took them. Little white ones, I think. Maybe some blue ones too. It was a long time ago. I don't pay attention to those things. She said they were for… inflammation. Something like that. She's very… organized. I am not. Does that help? I mostly just remember being tired. And the pain still being there.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, that doesn’t give me much to go on, unfortunately. Let's move on to other things then. Do you have any trouble with your breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. Not really. I mean, I get… winded sometimes. When I’m climbing a ladder. Or carrying something up stairs. But who doesn’t? It’s just… being out of shape, I guess. I don’t do much… exercise. Besides work. Is that bad? Should I be exercising? I don't have time for all that. I need to… provide. You understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand the need to provide. But we need to assess your overall health, Mr. Bartok, not just whether you can lift things. Have you ever had any problems with your heart?
PATIENT: Heart? No, no problems. Not that I know of. I get… palpitations sometimes. When I’m really stressed. Or after I’ve had a lot of coffee. But that’s just… nerves. My ex-wife, she said I needed to cut back on the coffee. She's always telling me what I need to do. But a man needs his coffee, you know? Keeps me going. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. Are you sure I need all these questions? This is for a sports tryout, right? Not a… a full check-up?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, a sports physical is to ensure you are safe to participate in physical activity. That means asking about your heart, your lungs, any potential issues that could be exacerbated by exercise. It’s not just about whether you can lift things, it’s about whether it’s safe for you to do so. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? Cholesterol? No, I don't think so. No one ever told me. Like I said, I haven't been to a doctor in… years. My ex-wife, she used to handle all that. She kept all the papers. I don't really keep papers. It all gets… lost. I'm a simple man, Doctor. I work hard, I provide, and I try not to cause trouble. Is that enough? This is… becoming stressful. Are you sure you need to know all this for a sports tryout? I just want the paper.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, your reluctance to provide a medical history is concerning. It’s difficult to assess your fitness for physical activity without knowing your baseline health. Let's try this: do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. No, I don’t smoke. Never liked it. Makes you cough. My father, he smoked. Terrible habit. Horrible cough. I always stayed away from it. My ex-wife, she was glad about that. She always worried about my lungs. She worried about everything, really. But no, I don’t smoke. Never have. Is that… better? Can we get to the paper now? This is… quite a lot. For a tryout.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. Just to check your heart and lungs, and assess your back pain. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your chest and feel your back. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Examination table… Fine. Whatever you need. But I don't like lying down. Makes me feel… weak. I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. And this table is… cold. Is there a blanket?
DOCTOR: There. Use that. Now, please lie flat and take deep breaths. Deep breath in… and out… again… Your breathing sounds a little wheezy, Mr. Bartok. Any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Wheezy? No, no asthma. Never had asthma. Maybe it's just… the air. It's hot out, isn't it? And dusty. From the construction. I work with a lot of… debris. Dust, wood, things like that. Maybe that's it. I don't get sick often, though. A little cold now and then, but nothing serious. This is… uncomfortable. Is this almost over? My back is starting to ache from this table. It’s very… hard.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your back muscles are quite tense. And you do have some tenderness here… and here. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Ow! Yes, there! That's… sensitive. No, no numbness. Not usually. Sometimes, after a long day… my feet feel a little… asleep. But that’s just from standing all day. It goes away when I sit down. This table is… terrible. I really need to get off this table soon. My back is killing me. Are you sure this is necessary for a sports tryout? It's just a local team, you know. Mostly just for fun. They need extra players. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your frustration. However, given your history of chronic back pain, your tense muscles, and the wheezing I’m hearing, I’m concerned about your overall physical condition. While it may be a local team, we need to ensure your safety. I recommend an X-ray of your spine to rule out any structural issues. And I think a visit to a pulmonologist would be beneficial to assess your breathing. I won't be signing off on this sports physical until we have those results. It’s irresponsible of me to do so, given the information you’ve provided, or rather, haven’t provided. I can give you a referral to both a radiologist and a pulmonologist. Would you like that?
PATIENT: X-rays… Pulmonologists… This is… ridiculous. For a sports tryout? My ex-wife would… she would have all the appointments scheduled already. She always knew what to do. Fine. Fine, do the X-rays. And… the lung doctor. But this is… a waste of time and money. I need to work, you know. I can't just… go to appointments all day. Just… get me the referral. And… is there anything else? Can we please be done now? My back is screaming. This whole thing is… a nightmare.
DOCTOR: Here. These are referrals to Dr. Ramirez, a radiologist, and Dr. Chen, a pulmonologist. Both are excellent doctors. Their contact information and instructions for scheduling appointments are on the slips. I understand your frustration, Mr. Bartok. But your health is my priority. Once you have the results from those tests, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss them and determine a plan of action. For now, I’m going to advise you to avoid any strenuous activity. And I recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen for your back pain. And please, do follow up with these referrals. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, nothing else. Just… ibuprofen. And… avoid strenuous activity. Fine. I’ll… try. But I have to work, you know. I need to provide. This whole thing… a complete waste of time. .
