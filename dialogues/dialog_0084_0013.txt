DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Voytek. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s…trouble with going to the bathroom, mostly. I just…can’t get it to go all the way, if that makes sense. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s getting more bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with complete bladder emptying. That is bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it, complete emptying. It feels like…like there’s always some left in there, even after I try. And I have to…push, sometimes, which doesn’t feel right. It's not always, but more often than not these days. It's hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: No, that’s a good start. It is helpful to know you have to strain. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…maybe six, seven months ago? It was just a little bit at first, barely noticeable. I thought it was just getting older, you know? But it's gotten worse steadily over the last couple months, like I said. I'd say the pushing started about three months ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to seven months of increasing difficulty, with straining for the last three. Have you noticed any other changes – like frequency, urgency, or any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No pain or burning, no. And I don’t have to go more often, not really. It just…takes effort when I do go. Sometimes it starts and stops a few times, if that makes sense? Like it’s not a strong stream, it cuts out and then comes back. That’s new, that stopping and starting.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittency is good to know – the starting and stopping. And no fever, chills, or back pain at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of that. No fever, no chills, and my back feels fine. Just…this trouble with going. It’s mostly just uncomfortable, but it’s getting to be a worry. I don't like feeling like I can't…fully empty, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. Let’s go through some other things quickly. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or prostate problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Diabetes…no, not that I know of. I've never been told I have that. And…prostate problems? I’m not sure. I’ve never had any trouble with that before, never been checked. I’m a widower, you see, and my wife always took care of those things. I haven't really seen a doctor regularly since she passed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think…I broke my arm when I was a boy, a long time ago. Had surgery to fix it, but that was…sixty years ago, maybe more. Other than that…no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, nothing I can recall, anyway. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood arm fracture, no other surgeries. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. A small white pill. I take it every morning. That's it. Nothing else. I try to stay away from medicine if I can, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a blood pressure medication. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I can eat anything, take any medicine, no problem. My wife used to say I had a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you have any family members – father, brothers – who have had any problems with their bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. My father…he didn’t talk much about his health. I know he had some trouble walking when he got older, but I don’t recall anything about bladder problems. I had a brother, but he passed away young, from an accident. I don’t know anything about his health either, to be honest. We weren’t very close.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone, mostly. I used to work at the fish plant, but I retired a few years back. I like to go for walks when the weather is nice, and I do a little bit of carving, Yupik style. I don't drink much, maybe a beer now and then, and I don't smoke. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and berries, what I can get. Quiet life, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, Mr. Hilber, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and then I’d like to do a prostate exam. It’ll give me a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. It’s just…that exam doesn’t sound very pleasant, if you don’t mind me saying so. But I understand you need to check things, so go ahead.
DOCTOR: I understand, and you are right, it's not the most comfortable thing. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, I'm going to listen to your abdomen first. Just relax and take some deep breaths. Everything sounds normal there. Now, I will perform a digital rectal exam. Please lie on your side with your knees bent. Okay… I feel some mild enlargement of the prostate, but no obvious nodules or tenderness. It feels relatively smooth. Alright. Everything feels normal other than the mild enlargement.
PATIENT: Mild enlargement…that doesn't sound good, does it? Is that what's causing the trouble? I was hoping it was just something simple. What does that mean, Doctor? Will I need…surgery?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily something to be overly worried about right away, Mr. Hilber. Prostate enlargement is common as men get older – it’s called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It means the prostate gland has grown larger, which can press on the urethra and cause the symptoms you're experiencing – difficulty starting and stopping urination, feeling like you can't empty your bladder completely, straining. We'll need to do a urine test to rule out infection. I also want to check your PSA level – that’s a blood test that can help us assess your prostate. Surgery is not necessarily the first step. Often, we can manage this with medication or lifestyle changes. But we need more information first. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Benign…something. Enlargement pressing on the…urethra. So it’s not cancer, not right away? That’s a relief. Medicine first, that sounds good. I'd rather not have surgery if I can avoid it. A urine test and a blood test…okay. When can we do those? And what will those tests tell us, exactly? I like to know what's going on, if you don't mind me asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Mr. Hilber. It's good to be informed. The urine test will check for infection, which can cause similar symptoms. The PSA test measures a protein made by the prostate gland. An elevated PSA can be a sign of prostate cancer, but it can also be elevated for other reasons – like infection, inflammation, or even BPH. It's just one piece of the puzzle. I’ll get the orders for those tests sent to the lab right now. You can go there anytime today, and the results should be back within a few days. Once I have those results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if you develop any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or abdomen, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Fever, chills, back pain…I’ll watch for those. I’ll go to the lab today, and I’ll wait for the results. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It's a relief to have some answers, even if it's not a simple fix. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor Voytek.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll figure this out together. Here are the orders for your tests. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
