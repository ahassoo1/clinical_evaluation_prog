DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot is giving me trouble. A sore, it is. Been there a little while now, and it’s not getting better. Hurts to walk, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been bothering you for a while and is causing pain when you walk. I understand. Just to clarify, is this a new sore, or has it been there for a long time?
PATIENT: It hasn’t been that long, maybe a month or so. But it’s not getting better like a normal scrape would. It just…stays. And it hurts more now than it did at first, if that makes sense. I’ve tried putting some ointment on it, but nothing seems to help much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A sore that isn’t healing as expected and is getting more painful is definitely something we should take a look at. And you mentioned using ointment…do you recall what kind of ointment you’ve been using?
PATIENT: Oh, um…let me think. It was…a white one. For cuts and scrapes, you know? My daughter, she usually gets it for the grandkids. Neosporin, maybe? Or something like that. I’m not good with names. It was in a little tube. I put it on every day, like she told me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white ointment in a tube, possibly Neosporin, applied daily as instructed. Thank you. Now, can you describe the sore to me?
PATIENT: Well…it’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It’s…red around the edges. And kinda…deep. Not bleeding much, but it looks…angry, if you know what I mean. Not smooth like normal skin, more…rough. And it’s a little bit smelly, I think. I try not to look at it too much, it bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, red edges, deep, rough texture, possibly a bit of odor…that gives me a better picture. It sounds like it could be a bit more than a simple scrape. I’m going to take a look at it for you, if that’s alright. It’ll just involve a quick physical exam of your foot. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to get better. It’s making it hard to get around. I like to walk, you see. It’s good for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. I see the sore now. It is located on the plantar aspect of your foot, near the metatarsal heads. There is some surrounding erythema and induration. It appears to be approximately 1.5 cm in diameter, and there is some maceration of the surrounding skin. There doesn't appear to be any active drainage at this moment, but there is a distinct odor. There is some tenderness to palpation, but no warmth extending beyond the immediate area. I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes in your leg or ankle. Based on what I see, it’s possible you have a developing foot ulcer, perhaps complicated by a mild infection. We need to rule out other possibilities, though. I'd like to order a few tests.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. What kind of tests, Doctor? I don’t like needles much, if you know what I mean. And what does “ulcer” mean? Is it…serious? I have…well, I have the sugar sickness, my daughter says. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Stoegbauer. Let's take things one step at a time. An ulcer is essentially a break in the skin. In your case, it appears to be on the bottom of your foot. It can be serious if left untreated, but we're catching it relatively early. And yes, your daughter is right, you do have diabetes. That's important information, because people with diabetes are more prone to foot ulcers, and they can take longer to heal. This is because diabetes can affect blood flow and nerve function in the feet. The tests I'm thinking of are a simple blood test to check your blood sugar levels, and a wound culture to identify any bacteria that might be causing an infection. The blood test is standard, and the wound culture involves gently swabbing the sore—it shouldn’t be painful. We’ll also do a basic assessment of your circulation in your foot. No needles are required for that part. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. No needles, you say? That’s good. A swab sounds alright. And checking the…circulation, that’s alright too. My daughter always tells me I need to watch my sugar. So, if this is about that… then it’s good to get it checked. Will these tests tell me how to make it better? Can we fix it, Doctor? I really want to keep walking.
DOCTOR: Yes, these tests will help us determine the best course of action to get you back on your feet – literally. They'll give us a clearer picture of your overall health and what’s happening with the sore. The wound culture will tell us if there’s an infection, and what kind of bacteria is present, so we can choose the right antibiotic if needed. The blood sugar test will tell us how well controlled your diabetes is, which is crucial for healing. And the circulation test will help us see if there are any underlying blood flow issues. We may also need to consider offloading pressure from the sore—that means reducing the amount of weight you put on that foot. We can discuss options for that, such as special shoes or orthotics, after we get the test results. This might sting just a little. After that, I will send the samples to the lab, and we should have results in a few days. In the meantime, I want you to keep the wound clean and dry, and avoid putting too much weight on your foot. Are you able to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Clean and dry, and not too much weight. My daughter will help me, I’m sure. She’s very good at taking care of things. It did sting a little, but not too bad. A few days, you say? That doesn’t sound too long. Will she be able to come with me when I come back to hear the results? She asks good questions, you know. I sometimes forget what the doctor tells me. It’s an old man thing, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Stoegbauer. And yes, absolutely, your daughter is more than welcome to join us when we discuss the results. It’s always helpful to have someone else there to take notes and ask questions, and I’m happy to answer them both. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in three business days. In the meantime, if you notice any signs of worsening infection – increased pain, redness, swelling, fever, or pus – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you for taking such good care of me. And thank you for letting my daughter come with me next time. It makes me feel better knowing she’s there. I believe that’s everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and try to rest that foot.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
