DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Steines, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Venna Steines. And please, call me Venna. I don’t hold with all the “Ms.” and such. Just Venna is fine. Let’s get this over with, dear. I got bread to bake.
DOCTOR: Very well, Venna. Let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, the nurse took my blood pressure and said it was a little high. Been feelin' a bit…off, I reckon. Not sick, exactly, just tired quicker than usual. And sometimes my head feels kinda funny. That’s why I’m here, I suppose. My daughter insisted.
DOCTOR: “A little high,” you say?
PATIENT: Well, that’s what she said. Numbers and whatnot, I don’t rightly remember 'em. I just know she looked worried. And honestly, I’ve been forgettin’ things more lately… small things, mind you. Where I put my glasses, what I was bakin’… things like that. Don't go thinkin' I'm losin' my marbles!
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness at your age is… not uncommon. Still, we need to rule things out. So, this tiredness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, mostly. Some days I’m as strong as an ox, bakin’ all day long. Others… I just need to sit a spell. It's been worse lately, though. Used to be I could just push through. Now… now I gotta listen to my body, I reckon. I’m gettin’ old, I suppose. Though I don’t feel old. Mostly.
DOCTOR: And this “funny” feeling in your head… can you describe it?
PATIENT: It's hard to say, exactly. Not a headache, not like a pain. More… a sort of pressure, behind my eyes. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like everything’s a little… distant. Like I'm lookin' through a fog. It don't last long, usually. Just a minute or two, then it's gone. But it's enough to make me stop and wonder.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My feet get a little swollen some evenings, after I’ve been on 'em all day. But I bake a lot. I figured that was just from standin'. And sometimes… well, my hands shake a little when I’m tryin’ to frost a cake. But I used to have a steady hand, always. That’s been gettin' worse, too. Small things, mostly. It's hard to say what's important and what ain't.
DOCTOR: Swollen feet, shaky hands… Are you experiencing any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… maybe a little blurry sometimes. But I always figured it was just my eyes gettin' old. I haven't been to the eye doctor in… oh, goodness, I don’t even remember. Years, certainly. It ain't bothered me enough to go bother with it, if I’m honest. I can still see well enough to bake a good loaf of bread. That's what matters, right?
DOCTOR: Right. We'll need to do a brief physical exam. Please sit up straight. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Then we'll take a look at your feet. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Get it over with. But don’t poke and prod too much, I’m a delicate flower, you know. And try to be quick about it. I got a sourdough starter that needs feedin'.
DOCTOR: Very well. Deep breath, please. Heart sounds are… regular, though slightly muffled. Lungs are clear, but there's a faint crackling on the lower lobes. Nothing overly concerning at this point. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Just get it done, dear. I'm not comfortable bein' poked and prodded, even if it is for my own good. And don't go lookin' at me like I'm some sort of… experiment. I'm a baker, not a patient. Though I reckon I'm both right now.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… diminished, but within acceptable range for your age. Now, if you’ll allow me to examine your feet. There is some moderate swelling in both ankles and feet, and the skin is slightly cool to the touch. Circulation appears to be adequate, but diminished. I’ll need to check your blood pressure again, and then we’ll discuss some possible causes and next steps.
PATIENT: Fine, get on with it. This is takin’ a long time. I got things to do, you know. And my bread ain’t gonna bake itself. Just tell me what's wrong and what I gotta do to fix it. I ain't one for fancy explanations, just the plain truth.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated - 150/90. Combined with your symptoms of tiredness, forgetfulness, blurry vision and swollen feet… it’s likely you’re experiencing hypertension. It's quite common at your age, but it needs to be managed.
PATIENT: Hypertension… is that bad? Is that why I feel so tired all the time? And the forgettin'? My daughter always says I worry too much, but… it's hard not to when you feel like you’re fallin’ apart. What do I gotta do to fix it? Pills? I don't like takin' pills.
DOCTOR: It can be managed. And yes, it can contribute to those symptoms. Pills are often the most effective way, but we can discuss lifestyle changes as well. Diet, exercise… reducing stress. However, given your age and the severity of the readings… medication is likely necessary. We'll start with a low dose and monitor your response. We’ll also need some blood work to rule out any other underlying causes. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Well, I don't rightly know. I ain’t taken much in my life. I always preferred a good cup of chamomile tea when I felt poorly. But I don't think I'm allergic to anything… though my skin gets a little itchy sometimes when I use certain soaps. Does that count? And… chamomile tea won’t fix this, will it?
DOCTOR: Itchy skin is unlikely to be relevant. Chamomile tea is a fine comfort, but it won’t lower your blood pressure. We'll start you on a low dose of Lisinopril, ten milligrams daily. You’ll need to have a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your blood pressure and monitor for any side effects. I’m also ordering a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… sounds awful. And a complete what-now? Look, I'm just a baker, dear. I don't need fancy words and complicated tests. Just tell me what I gotta do, in plain English. Will these pills make me sick? Will I be able to bake? I got orders to fill, you know. People depend on my bread.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril is a common blood pressure medication. It may cause some mild side effects – dizziness, fatigue, a dry cough. But most people tolerate it well. The blood tests are to get a better picture of your overall health and rule out other possible causes for your symptoms. They won’t interfere with your baking. You will need to take the Lisinopril every day, as prescribed. And it is important to follow up with me in two weeks. I’m also going to recommend a low-sodium diet, and some light exercise – a short walk each day, if you’re able. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Pills every day. No too much salt. Walk a little. Blood tests. Two weeks. I think I got it. But if I start feelin' awful, I’m callin' you, you hear? And if my bread starts comin' out wrong, it's on your head! I got a reputation to uphold, you know. Now… can I go bake? I’m wastin’ daylight here. And my sourdough starter is lookin’ at me funny.
DOCTOR: Yes, you may go. Here's a printed summary of your instructions and lab orders. Please schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. And Ms. Steines… try to reduce your stress. It won't help your blood pressure, or your bread. Next!
