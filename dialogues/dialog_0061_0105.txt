DOCTOR: Bula and welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Kimm. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's... about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? I think my wife set this up. She said I needed an evaluation before… before anything happens. I don't really remember all the details, honestly. Something about bariatric surgery?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common to feel a little overwhelmed with all the information. So, you’re here today to discuss bariatric surgery options. Your wife mentioned she set up an evaluation, which is a great first step. Let me pull up your information... Bradlee Kochubey, age 38. I see here we have a referral for weight management consultation. Before we get into specific surgery options, could you tell me a little bit about why you are interested in exploring this now?
PATIENT: Yeah, Bradlee Kochubey, that's me. It’s… hard to say why now, exactly. I just… feel tired a lot. And things are getting harder to do. I used to be able to… well, I used to be able to keep up with my kids more easily, I guess. And my wife worries. She’s a good woman. I don’t really know what I want, to be honest. She thinks this will help. It just feels like a big step. Is that making sense? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Bradlee. It sounds like you're feeling a little unsure but also open to exploring options to improve your energy levels and keep up with your family. That's very understandable. It's perfectly okay to feel hesitant about a big step like this. So, focusing on those things you mentioned – the fatigue and difficulty keeping up – how long have you been feeling this tired?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… a while. A few years, I think? It's kind of crept up on me, you know? It wasn't sudden. I used to just… push through it. But it’s gotten worse lately. Like, even walking up the stairs leaves me winded. My wife says I snore really bad too, and I wake up feeling tired even after sleeping. I don't know if that's connected, but… she read something about that being a thing. Does that make any sense? I really don’t keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense, Bradlee. A few years of gradual fatigue and now shortness of breath with exertion and snoring – those are all things we want to explore. Snoring can be very significant, and it's good your wife has noticed that. It could be related to something called sleep apnea, which is often linked to weight and can contribute to fatigue. Okay, let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I haven’t really been to the doctor in… a long time. My wife usually handles all that. I think I had my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy once, and it was… okay? I don't remember the number. I don’t take any medications, either. Honestly, I mostly just try to ignore things until they go away. Which doesn’t always work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. It's helpful to have a sense of your medical history, even if it's limited. Ignoring things isn't the best strategy, but it’s common! Let’s talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings – has had any health problems like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… my mom, she had… something with her heart, I think. It was a long time ago. She’s passed away now. And my dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. He’s still alive, but he doesn’t really talk about it. And my brother… he’s pretty healthy, I think. He runs a lot. I don’t really keep in touch with him that much. I’m sorry. I’m not very good at remembering these things. It feels like a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Bradlee. It’s completely understandable. You’re not a medical historian! Knowing your mom had heart issues and your dad had high blood pressure is helpful, though. That gives us a little more information to work with. Okay, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and just get a general sense of your overall health. It's a pretty standard check-up. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds okay. Whatever you need to do. I haven't had a checkup in… well, a long time, so I guess I should get one. Just… try not to make it too uncomfortable, okay? I'm not really good with doctors.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Bradlee. I’ll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. We’ll take things slowly. If you could just have a seat here, we'll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Heart rate is 88, which is normal. Your breathing sounds a little wheezy, but nothing too concerning at the moment. Okay, abdomen is soft. Now, could you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Uh, okay. I... try not to look at the numbers usually. My wife keeps track of that too. Just tell me what it is, okay? I'd rather not stare at it. It's… not a happy number, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, 258 pounds. And I see here your wife had previously recorded your height as 5'10". Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Five-ten. It hasn’t changed in… a long time. So, what does that mean? What does the number mean? Is it… really bad? My wife gets worried when I don’t lose weight, and… I don't want to worry her.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bradlee. Let’s just look at the facts. You’re 5’10” and weigh 258 pounds. That gives you a Body Mass Index, or BMI, of 36.9. A BMI over 30 is considered obesity. It's important to remember that BMI isn’t a perfect measurement, but it gives us a starting point. It means you could benefit from losing some weight to improve your overall health. And that's why you're here today, exploring options like bariatric surgery. Before we discuss surgery, though, I want to run a few blood tests to get a better understanding of your current health status. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your weight and fatigue. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… sensible. If it helps figure things out, then yeah. Blood tests are fine. My wife always says I need more blood tests. She's probably right. Where do we go from there? Do I need to… fast for these tests? I always forget those things. Is there something I need to do before the tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Yes, blood tests will give us a lot more information. You do need to fast for these tests. It’s important that you don’t eat or drink anything, except for water, for 12 hours before the appointment. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. Here’s the requisition form. It has the list of tests and instructions. And the nurse will be along shortly to draw your blood. While we wait for the results, we can discuss the different types of bariatric surgery options available. Do you have any questions at all before we get to that?
PATIENT: Twelve hours… okay. That's… a long time. I usually eat something late at night. I guess I can skip dinner. No, I don't think so. Not right now. I don't even really know what the options are. That's why I came here, right? To find out? Maybe if you just… explained them to me? I'm not very good at making decisions. I mostly just let my wife decide things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Bradlee. It’s my job to explain everything. There are a few different types of bariatric surgery, but the two most common are sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. With a sleeve gastrectomy, we remove about 80% of your stomach, leaving you with a smaller, tube-shaped stomach. This reduces the amount of food you can eat and also decreases the production of a hormone that makes you feel hungry. With Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, we create a smaller stomach pouch and then connect it directly to the small intestine, bypassing a large portion of your stomach and small intestine. This also reduces the amount of food you can eat and decreases the absorption of calories and nutrients. Both surgeries have risks and benefits, and the best option for you will depend on your individual health status and goals. We’ll discuss those in more detail once we have your blood test results back. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Um… smaller stomach… bypassing… it all sounds a little… scary, honestly. Like, cutting things out… and hormones… and… I don’t really understand what bypassing means. Does that mean… it changes how I digest food? I mostly just eat… regular stuff. Burgers, pizza… things like that. I don’t want to have to eat… special food for the rest of my life. My wife worries about my diet as it is. I think I’m getting overwhelmed. It’s a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It is a lot, Bradlee. And it’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed. It’s a big decision, and it’s good you’re asking questions. You’re right, both surgeries change how your body digests food. With the bypass, some of the food goes around a portion of your small intestine. This means you absorb fewer calories and nutrients. But it doesn't mean you have to eat special food forever. It just means you need to make sure you’re getting enough protein and vitamins, and you might have to take supplements for the rest of your life. It’s also important to understand that these surgeries aren't a magic bullet. You still need to make lifestyle changes – eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly – to achieve long-term success. Let’s not get too bogged down in the details right now. We'll discuss everything thoroughly once we have your blood test results back, and we can tailor a plan specifically for you. In the meantime, is there anything I can clarify about the surgeries, or anything else on your mind?
PATIENT: I think… I think I just need to think about it. And get the blood tests done. It all sounds… a little scary, like a big change. I don’t really like change. My wife says I’m stubborn, but… I just get comfortable with things, you know? It's hard to explain. I guess… I’ll let her know what you said. She’s good at figuring things out. And… I guess if she thinks it’s a good idea, then… I’m willing to try. But I’m still scared. And I wish I understood everything better. Do you think… do you think I'm too old for this? Maybe I should just try to lose weight on my own?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to be scared, Bradlee. And it’s very reasonable to feel overwhelmed. It's a big decision, and you're allowed to take your time. You're not too old for this at all. 38 is still young, and many people have successful bariatric surgery at your age and even older. There's no age limit as long as you're healthy enough to undergo the procedure. And you’re right, trying to lose weight on your own is always an option. It’s often the best place to start. But if you’ve tried that and haven’t had success, or if you have underlying health conditions that make it difficult, surgery can be a good alternative. Let’s focus on getting those blood tests done first. Once we have the results, we can discuss your options in more detail and see what’s right for you. And remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about the blood tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… no food for twelve hours. I think I can manage that. I guess I’ll go get them done. And then… I’ll wait. It feels like a long time. Is there anything… anything I need to do while I'm waiting? Besides not eating? Maybe… think about what I'll eat after I'm allowed to eat again? That sounds… less scary. Is that a good idea?
DOCTOR: That's a great idea, Bradlee. Focusing on what you’ll eat after the tests is a perfect way to distract yourself and start thinking positively. Maybe you can even look up some healthy recipes with your wife. Aside from not eating, just try to get some rest and drink plenty of water. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s a number for the nurse line. I think that’s everything for today. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. You explained everything really well… even though it was a lot. I'm still scared, but… less scared than before. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. I appreciate it. I’ll go get the blood tests done and… try not to think about it too much. And maybe look at some recipes. My wife will like that. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bradlee. I'm glad I could help. And don't worry about being scared – it's perfectly normal. Remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, and I'll see you when your results are back.
