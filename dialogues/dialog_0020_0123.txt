DOCTOR: Good morning, Carla. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s driving me a little crazy, to be honest. It just...itches all over, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, itchy skin all over. That sounds quite uncomfortable. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it probably started a couple of weeks ago, maybe three? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little annoying, but it’s gotten worse each day. I can’t really pinpoint exactly when, you know? It just sort of…appeared.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for things to start gradually. And you said it’s all over…is it worse in any particular areas, or is it fairly uniform?
PATIENT: It’s…probably a little worse on my arms and back. Hard to reach back there to scratch, of course! And my legs, especially after I’ve been walking. But it’s really everywhere, just different levels of itchiness, I guess. Not like, a rash or anything, just…dry and itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generalized itchiness, more pronounced on your arms, back, and legs, particularly after walking. No rash, just dry and itchy skin. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse, besides walking making it worse?
PATIENT: Well… warm baths seem to help for a little while, but then it comes back. And I’ve been trying to use lotion, but it doesn’t seem to do much good. I haven't really noticed anything else that specifically makes it better or worse, no. I mean, I think it’s a little worse when I get stressed, but who isn’t stressed these days, right?
DOCTOR: You're right, stress can certainly play a role. Warm baths providing temporary relief is good to know. Let’s talk about your medical history a little bit, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let’s see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been pretty well controlled with medication for years now. And… arthritis in my knees, that’s why I said I notice it more when I walk. Other than that, not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I did have a divorce, does that count as a medical condition?
DOCTOR: I think we can safely say that doesn’t count as a medical condition, though it can certainly feel like one! So, high blood pressure, well-controlled, and arthritis in the knees. Are you currently taking any medications for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a water pill for the blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And I take Ibuprofen for the arthritis, when it’s really acting up. Mostly just as needed, not every day. Oh! And a Vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me my levels were low a while back.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and Vitamin D supplement. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve been pretty lucky with allergies too, thankfully. I mean, I get a little sniffly with pollen sometimes, but that’s just a seasonal thing. Nothing serious, no medications, no hives, nothing like that. I’ve always been able to eat pretty much anything, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Good, no known allergies. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long, long time ago. And a hysterectomy, oh, goodness, must be thirty years ago now. Other than that, nothing. Oh! And I had a mole removed from my back a few years ago, but it was just a little one, the doctor said it was nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, hysterectomy thirty years ago, and a mole removed a few years ago. Now, one more question about your medical background: is there a family history of skin conditions, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother had dry skin, always complaining about it, but I don’t think it was anything serious, just part of getting old. And my aunt, on my father’s side, she had some sort of rash when she was younger, but I never really knew what it was. Nothing major, as far as I know. We weren’t really big on talking about medical things in my family, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, that’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay. I just want to take a look at your skin, check your blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart and lungs sound good. And as I’m looking at your skin, I do see some dryness and some areas where it looks like you've been scratching, but no sign of a rash or anything else alarming. It’s fairly diffuse, as you mentioned. I'm not seeing anything that immediately jumps out as a clear cause. Given your history and the exam findings, it’s possible this is simply dry skin exacerbated by age and possibly some stress. However, we should rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel, just to get a baseline and make sure everything else is normal. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. I want to get to the bottom of this itchiness! It’s just driving me crazy, honestly. So, blood tests, okay. Do I need to fast for any of them? And where will I get them done?
DOCTOR: Yes, the comprehensive metabolic panel does require a 12-hour fast, so no food or drinks after midnight tonight. The complete blood count doesn’t require fasting. You can get the blood work done at the lab right across the street, here at the clinic. I’ll send the orders over electronically to them now. They’ll be expecting you. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Across the street is easy enough. And no food after midnight, got it. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, I appreciate it. So, just go across the street tomorrow, after I’ve had my breakfast, and they’ll be expecting me?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Go across the street tomorrow morning after breakfast, and they’ll be expecting you. The lab technician will know I've sent the orders. It usually takes a day or two for the results to come back. I’ll have my nurse call you to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, continue using lotion, and try to manage your stress levels as much as possible. If the itchiness gets significantly worse, or you develop a rash, please don’t hesitate to call the office right away. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Lotion, manage stress…easier said than done, but I’ll try! Thank you again, Doctor Beinborn. I feel much better knowing we’re getting it checked out. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Carla. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too!
