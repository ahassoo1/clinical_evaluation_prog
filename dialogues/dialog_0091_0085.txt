DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's about this…patch on my skin. Honestly, it’s quite bothersome, and I’d like to get it sorted. It's not like I have time to be dealing with this.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. It’s good you’re addressing it now. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about this patch?
PATIENT: Oh, details, of course. It appeared…oh, maybe three weeks ago? On my left forearm, right here. . It started small, really, just a little lighter than the rest of my skin. Now it’s…noticeable. And it doesn't itch or anything, which is…odd, isn’t it? Things usually itch when something's wrong.
DOCTOR: That is good information. Not all skin changes itch, so the absence of itching doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not something we need to investigate. Three weeks…and located on the inner left forearm. Has it changed in size or shape since it first appeared?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It has. It's…grown, I suppose. Not dramatically, don’t misunderstand. But when I first noticed it, it was barely the size of a dime. Now, it’s…closer to a quarter, maybe a little larger. The shape…I’d say it’s still roughly circular, but the edges aren't as defined as they used to be. It's…fading into the rest of my skin, if that makes sense. A very subtle fade, though. I do pay attention to these things, you know.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your detailed observation, Ms. Bartock. That’s very helpful. A gradual increase in size over three weeks, a roughly circular shape with somewhat ill-defined borders… We should certainly take a closer look. Before I do a physical exam, could you tell me if anything specifically triggered its appearance?
PATIENT: Triggered? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the slightest idea. I live a very…controlled life. I haven’t been exposed to anything unusual. No new soaps, no gardening, no new jewelry… I certainly haven’t been traipsing through the wilderness. It just appeared. It’s quite frustrating, really. I maintain a very precise skincare routine, and this is…unacceptable. Perhaps it’s the water? Though, I do have a whole-house filter…
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s good you’ve been so diligent with your skincare and are aware of potential exposures. The fact that you haven't identified any obvious triggers is noteworthy. Now, let’s move on to some general questions. Have you noticed any other skin changes anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. And I would have noticed. I examine myself regularly. No new moles, no unusual rashes, no dryness, no flaking… nothing. I assure you, my skin is usually quite…impeccable. This patch is a complete anomaly. It's… disruptive. And frankly, I don't appreciate anomalies.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your thoroughness, Ms. Bartock. That’s very reassuring. Now, let's briefly discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have managed hypertension, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I take Lisinopril, 20mg daily. Otherwise, no. I'm not prone to illness, and I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I don’t believe in unnecessary medical interventions. My doctor back in the city always said I was a picture of health…until this, of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. Lisinopril, 20mg daily for hypertension. And no other significant medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just a hysterectomy, about ten years ago. Routine, really. No complications. And a wisdom tooth extraction, decades ago. Nothing else. I’m not one for…going under the knife unnecessarily. It’s a rather barbaric practice, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Hysterectomy ten years ago, wisdom tooth extraction. No complications from either procedure. Now, regarding family history, are there any instances of skin cancer, or any other significant medical conditions, in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother had basal cell carcinoma, on her nose, about fifteen years ago. They removed it, and she was fine. Otherwise…no. My father was perfectly healthy, until the end, of course. And my sister…she’s always been a bit…delicate. A touch of eczema, but nothing serious. It’s certainly not a family prone to…major ailments.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Basal cell carcinoma in your mother, and a history of eczema in your sister. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What precisely are you asking, Doctor? I am married, have been for twelve years. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink—a glass of wine with dinner occasionally—and I have no…unusual hobbies. I volunteer at the historical society, cataloging documents. Is that what you mean? I lead a very quiet, respectable life.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. I appreciate your openness. And no, I didn’t mean to imply anything untoward. I was simply gathering a comprehensive understanding of your lifestyle. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None whatsoever. I’ve always been very careful about what I consume, and I avoid anything synthetic whenever possible. I react poorly to strong fragrances, but that’s a sensitivity, not an allergy. Honestly, I’m remarkably…robust. It’s quite puzzling, this whole situation.
DOCTOR: Very good. No allergies, and you are generally robust. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough medical history, Ms. Bartock. Now, if you'll permit me, I would like to examine the patch on your forearm. Please keep your arm still while I do this.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with, then. I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon, and I’m already running late. Just…be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. I've examined the patch. It is roughly 2.5 centimeters in diameter, located on your inner left forearm. It appears slightly lighter in color than the surrounding skin, with somewhat indistinct borders. There's no tenderness to the touch, and I don’t feel any swollen lymph nodes in the area. It doesn’t feel raised or hardened. Based on what you've told me and my initial examination, it could be a few things. The most likely possibilities include a post-inflammatory hypopigmentation—perhaps from a mild, unnoticed irritation—or a form of pityriasis alba. However, to be certain, I would like to order a few tests. Would you be agreeable to a skin scraping and a fungal culture?
PATIENT: Tests? Really? A scraping? Is that absolutely necessary? It sounds…unpleasant. And a fungal culture? I haven’t been gardening, Doctor. I told you, I live a very controlled life. I sincerely doubt it’s a fungus. Couldn’t we just…try something? Perhaps a topical cream? I have a very sensitive complexion, and I’m wary of anything invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Bartock. You’re right to be cautious, and I appreciate your sensitivity. The scraping is a very quick, painless procedure – it simply involves gently collecting a small sample of skin cells to examine under a microscope. The fungal culture is also non-invasive—we simply apply a small swab to the area. These tests are not invasive, but they are important to rule out other possibilities, such as a fungal infection or other skin condition that might require specific treatment. Without them, we would be operating on speculation, and I always prefer to have a clear understanding of the cause before recommending any treatment. However, if you are truly opposed to the tests at this time, we could start with a topical corticosteroid cream, a mild one, for two weeks, and observe if there's any improvement. But please understand that this is not ideal, and if the cream doesn't work, we would need to revisit the possibility of testing. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. A mild corticosteroid cream, you say? For two weeks? And if it doesn’t work, then we have to do the scraping and the…culture? Fine. But I hold you personally responsible if it irritates my skin. And I expect detailed instructions on how to apply it, and what to look out for. I don’t want this to get any worse.
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Bartock. I will prescribe a topical corticosteroid, Hydrocortisone 1% cream, to be applied thinly to the affected area twice daily for two weeks. It's a very mild strength and should not cause significant irritation, but please discontinue use and contact me if you experience any redness, itching, burning, or worsening of the condition. I will also give you a written instruction sheet detailing the proper application technique and potential side effects. If there is no improvement after two weeks, or if the condition worsens at any time, we will need to proceed with the skin scraping and fungal culture. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. Just…please be quick about writing the prescription. And make sure the pharmacist understands it’s a very sensitive complexion. I don't want anything strong. I have a luncheon to attend, you know.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Ms. Bartock. The prescription is for Hydrocortisone 1% cream. I’ve made a note for the pharmacist regarding your sensitive skin. I would like to see you back in two weeks to assess your progress. Please call the office to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No. Just…thank you. I suppose. I do hope this works. I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Bartock. I hope it does as well. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a pleasant day and enjoy your luncheon.
