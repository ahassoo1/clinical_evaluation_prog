DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Lawther. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Thanks for seein’ me. Right… well, it’s me head. Been gettin’ these headaches, pretty bad ones. And… somethin’ else goes along with ‘em, I think. It's hard to explain, honestly. It’s not… constant, just when the head pain hits. Sweatin’ and… me heart feels like it’s racin’, maybe? It’s a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Headaches with accompanying symptoms can certainly be concerning, and it's good you came in to have it checked out. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Could you tell me a bit more about these headaches?
PATIENT: Sure, I’ll try. Um… they kinda come on quick, like a wave. Not slow buildin’ up or anythin’. And they’re usually… on the sides of me head, I guess? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. And they’re strong. Like, really strong. Makes it hard to think, y’know? I usually just have to lie down in a dark room. How long they last… that’s a good question. Maybe an hour or two? Sometimes longer, I reckon. It’s all a bit fuzzy. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize at all. It's perfectly understandable that details are hazy when you're dealing with intense pain. "Coming on quickly, like a wave, on the sides of your head, lasting an hour or two…" That gives me a good starting point. And you mentioned sweating and a racing heart with the headaches. Does anything trigger these headaches—certain foods, stress, bright lights, or anything else you've noticed?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. I haven’t really… kept track, to be honest. I dunno if there is somethin’ that sets ‘em off. I work in a factory, so it's pretty loud most days, maybe that? And it can get hot, real hot. Stress… yeah, probably. Me divorce wasn’t exactly… smooth. But it's been a while now, so I wouldn't say it's that directly. I really haven’t noticed a pattern, no. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Lawther. You're being very helpful. It's common not to identify specific triggers right away. Loud noise and heat at work, and a recent stressful life event… those are both things we should keep in mind. Now, aside from the headaches, sweating, and racing heart, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a bit tired sometimes, but I figured that was just from work, y’know? I ain’t been sleepin’ the best, but nothin’ terrible. No blurry vision, no weakness or numbness, no… I don’t know, nothin’ else comes to mind. I’m pretty sure that’s it. Honestly, I'm tryin' to remember if anything else happens when these things come on, but it’s all a bit of a blur like I said. I just want it to stop, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lawther. It’s good that you haven’t noticed any changes in vision, weakness, or numbness – that’s helpful information. “Tiredness, possibly related to work and sleep,” we'll note that as well. Let’s move on to your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I… haven’t really been to the doctor much, to be honest. Always figured I was healthy enough. Just the usual colds and flu, but nothin’ serious. I definitely don't have anythin’ written down anywhere. I didn’t even have insurance for a long time, so… yeah. Just never really needed to see a doctor much before this. It’s… kinda weird, now that I think about it. Always felt okay, until these headaches started.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon to avoid the doctor when you're feeling well. It’s good to know you haven't had any prior diagnoses. And you are right to seek care when something changes, as you’ve done here. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single one. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Just the occasional scraped knee as a kid, but nothin’ that needed a hospital or anythin’. Definitely haven’t been under the knife. Me ex-wife had her appendix out once, but that's about as close as I’ve gotten to surgery. Sorry, I don't mean to ramble.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Lawther. It’s helpful to have that information. Alright, let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has a history of migraines or severe headaches?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My… me mum used to get headaches sometimes, I think. But it was just normal headaches, like when you’re stressed or somethin’. Not like these, definitely. Me dad… he never really complained much about anythin’. And I don't really know me grandparents well enough to say. We weren't close, y'know? I don’t think anyone had serious headaches like I'm gettin', but I honestly couldn’t say for sure. It's hard to remember all that.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not always easy to recall family medical history. Okay, and just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. Tried it once or twice when I was younger, but didn’t like it. Me dad smoked for years, but I always said I wouldn't start. Glad I didn’t, really. Always felt it was a bad habit.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh, I have a few beers now and then. Mostly on the weekends. Nothing too heavy. Social drinking, I guess. I don't drink to excess, or anything. Maybe a couple on Friday night, a couple on Saturday. Usually with me mates. It's not a regular thing, not like some people I know. I wouldn’t say I need it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anythin' a doctor has given me before. Like I said, I don't go to the doctor much. But I definitely don’t think I'm allergic to anythin'. Just a general lack of experience with medications, really. Is that everything?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very thorough, Mr. Lawther. Thank you for answering all those questions so candidly. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological assessment – just to rule out any immediate concerns. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what's goin’ on with me head, so do what you gotta do. I'm not too bothered about bein' poked and prodded, as long as it helps. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable, or anythin’.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that could be due to some anxiety about being here, or just the general stress you've been under. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function. I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I'll test your reflexes. This is just routine. Everything appears to be normal neurologically as well. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light, your reflexes are intact, and you are able to follow my finger without difficulty. However, I do notice some mild tenderness to palpation in your temporal arteries. It’s subtle, but it's worth noting. Based on what you've told me, and the results of the exam, my initial thought is that you're likely experiencing tension headaches, potentially with some features of migraine. The elevated blood pressure is something to keep an eye on, but could be situational. The tenderness in your temporal arteries is not concerning in isolation, but we should rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Tension headaches… migraine? I just get really bad head pain, that's all. What does that even mean, though? And what about the sweatin' and the racin' heart? Is that just part of it? What do you want to do next? I'm not too keen on bein' poked and prodded any more, if I'm honest. Is there a pill I can take?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Lawther. It’s frustrating when you’re experiencing discomfort and not entirely sure what's causing it. "Tension headaches" are a very common type of headache, often described as a tight band around the head. "Migraine" is a more complex type of headache that can cause severe pain, and often comes with other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. What you describe—the headaches coming on quickly, the sweating, and the racing heart—can sometimes overlap with migraine, although your symptoms don’t fully align with a classic migraine presentation. The sweating and racing heart could be related to the pain itself, or a response to the stress the pain is causing. Sometimes, the body reacts strongly to severe pain. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some basic blood work to rule out other potential causes, such as infection or thyroid problems. It's a simple test, and will give us more information. I also recommend we monitor your blood pressure over the next few weeks, to see if it returns to normal when you’re less stressed. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I can prescribe a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to help with the pain. It's important to take it as directed, and to stop taking it if you experience any side effects, such as stomach upset or heartburn. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood work… alright, if you think it’s necessary. I just want to feel normal again, you know? As for the pill, yeah, sure. If it'll help with the pain, I’ll take it. What sort of side effects should I be lookin' out for? And how long does it usually take to work? I don’t want to be stuck in bed for days, just because I took a pill. And what about the blood pressure thing? Do I need to buy one of those machines, and check it myself?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Lawther. It's good to be cautious and aware of potential side effects. The NSAID I'm going to prescribe—Naproxen—can sometimes cause mild stomach upset, heartburn, or nausea. If you experience any of those symptoms, I recommend taking it with food. More serious side effects are rare, but can include stomach ulcers or bleeding. If you notice any black or tarry stools, or vomit blood, you should seek medical attention immediately. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes for Naproxen to start working, and the effects should last for several hours. It’s important to take it at the first sign of a headache, rather than waiting for the pain to become severe. Regarding your blood pressure, I recommend purchasing a home blood pressure monitor. They're relatively inexpensive and easy to use. I'll give you a written instruction sheet on how to measure your blood pressure correctly. Ideally, you should check your blood pressure twice a day—morning and evening—for the next two weeks, and record the results. Bring those results with you when you come back for your follow-up appointment. I will also give you a sheet with information about headache triggers, lifestyle modifications, and when to seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it for now. Headache triggers… that’s somethin’ to think about. I still haven’t figured out what sets ‘em off, but I’ll try to keep track. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen, and explain everything so clearly. It makes me feel a bit better, knowin’ what’s goin’ on. Where do I go to get the blood work done? And will you send the prescription to my pharmacy?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lawther. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. You can have the blood work done at LabCorp, located at 14 Oak Street. I’ll print out a requisition form for you with all the necessary information. Just take that form with you, and they’ll take care of the rest. And yes, I will send the prescription for Naproxen electronically to your usual pharmacy. Please let me know if there are any changes to your pharmacy information. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, to discuss the blood work results and monitor your blood pressure. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks sounds good. Let me check my calendar… yeah, that should work. I’m free most afternoons. Thank you again, Doctor. I think that’s everything. I appreciate your help. I’ll go get the blood work done, and check my blood pressure like you said. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Lawther. I’m glad we were able to formulate a plan. I will have the receptionist schedule your follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. You have a good day as well. And remember, if your headaches worsen, or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, stiff neck, or vision changes, please seek immediate medical attention.
