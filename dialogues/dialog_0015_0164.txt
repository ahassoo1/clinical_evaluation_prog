DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired and…yellow. Like, my skin and eyes are yellowing. It started a few days ago, and I think it might be connected to something I ate – fava beans, actually. It sounds silly, I know.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I had them with dinner a couple of nights ago, and then again for lunch yesterday. I love them, but…well, now I’m not so sure I do. It’s just…after eating them, I started feeling weak and then noticed the color change. I haven’t felt this unwell in years.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And this is a recent development, directly following the fava bean consumption?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. I mean, I’ve eaten fava beans before, lots of times, growing up even. Never had this happen. It really started the day after the first time I had them this week, and got worse after I had them again yesterday. I haven’t changed anything else in my diet or routine.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said weakness accompanies this yellowing?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A lot of weakness. I feel like I could sleep for a whole day and still be exhausted. And just… generally unwell. A little nauseous, but I haven’t actually been sick. It’s hard to describe…just really run down. It’s making it hard to even think straight, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Any fever, chills, or abdominal pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. My stomach feels a little…off, but not really pain. More like a dull ache, if anything. It’s not constant, and it’s not severe. Honestly, the tiredness and the yellowing are much more concerning. It’s just…scary looking in the mirror, you know?
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your urine color?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… Actually, yes, now that you mention it, it is darker than usual. Like, a really dark yellow, almost brown. I hadn’t really paid much attention until you asked. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: Dark urine, in conjunction with the yellowing skin and eyes, and reported weakness following fava bean ingestion… Alright. I'm going to need to ask a few more questions, and then I'll do a physical examination. Have you ever been diagnosed with any blood disorders, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been generally healthy, aside from the usual colds and things. My family… my mother had some problems with her gallbladder when she was older, but nothing like this. I’ve never had any tests done for blood disorders or anything. Is this something serious, Doctor? I’m starting to get a little worried.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively, Ms. Haggar. However, your symptoms are suggestive of a condition called Favism. It’s a genetic deficiency where individuals are unable to properly process fava beans. Now, before we jump to conclusions, we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Just a multivitamin every now and then, but I haven’t taken one in weeks. I really try to eat a healthy diet, so I don’t usually need anything. I haven’t been sick enough to need prescription medication in… well, I can’t even remember when. Could this be something that just…happens, even if I've eaten fava beans before? Like, can you develop it later in life?
DOCTOR: It's unusual to develop the deficiency later in life, Ms. Haggar. It's typically a genetic predisposition present from birth, though sometimes it can be mild enough to go unnoticed until triggered by fava bean consumption. Alright. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever had any issues with anemia?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never been told I was anemic. I’ve always felt…normal, energy-wise. I mean, until this, of course. My doctor always said my bloodwork looked good at my yearly checkups. I really haven't had any serious health problems, honestly. It’s what makes this so strange. Is there a test you can do to see if this is what’s wrong? And if it is Favism… what does that mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a test we can perform – a G6PD enzyme assay. It measures the level of the G6PD enzyme in your blood. A low level would be indicative of G6PD deficiency, the cause of Favism. Now, if it is G6PD deficiency, it means your red blood cells are vulnerable to breakdown after exposure to certain triggers, like fava beans. It's not typically life-threatening, but it requires avoiding those triggers. First though, we need to rule out other potential causes of your jaundice and anemia. I'm going to perform a physical examination now, Ms. Haggar. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and examine your skin and sclera more closely.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Avoiding fava beans doesn't sound too bad, honestly, if that's all it takes. I'm happy to do whatever tests are needed. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Haggar. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No organomegaly palpable. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt at all. Just feels…normal, I guess. A little pressure, but no pain. I haven’t had any stomach problems, like I said. It’s just the tiredness and the yellowing that are worrying me. Everything else feels okay.
DOCTOR: Sclera are markedly icteric – noticeably yellowed. Skin also exhibits jaundice, particularly evident in the palms and face. No bruising or lesions noted. Capillary refill is slightly prolonged at approximately three seconds. Alright. Based on the physical examination, your jaundice is quite pronounced. Prolonged capillary refill could indicate mild dehydration. I'll need to order some bloodwork to assess your liver function, bilirubin levels, and complete blood count, including a reticulocyte count. This will help us determine the cause of your jaundice and rule out other possibilities. I'm also ordering a G6PD enzyme assay, as we discussed.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds thorough. So, blood tests, basically? How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to fast before the tests? I have a small appointment later this afternoon, so I’d like to know if I need to reschedule it. And… is there anything I should be doing now, while we wait for the results? Like, should I be drinking more water, or avoiding certain foods, besides the fava beans?
DOCTOR: Yes, blood tests. The results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. You do not need to fast before the tests. While we await the results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake to prevent dehydration. Avoid alcohol, as it can further stress the liver. Beyond that, continue to avoid fava beans and foods containing them. And please, monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any abdominal pain, fever, or dark urine, seek immediate medical attention. This is primarily a precaution, but it's always best to err on the side of safety. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Drink more water, no alcohol, avoid fava beans, and watch for any worsening symptoms. I can definitely do that. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better just knowing we're doing something to figure out what's going on. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. When should I follow up for the results? Will someone call me, or should I schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Haggar. My office will call you within 48 hours with the results. If you haven't heard back by then, please don't hesitate to call us. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results to discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your help. I really appreciate it. I’ll wait for the call. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. Haggar. .
