DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It's nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…fine. I suppose. It’s this discoloration. It’s just… not right. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it hasn’t gone away. It’s on my arms, mostly. And it’s… well, it’s a funny color, isn’t it? Not a pleasant shade at all.
DOCTOR: I understand. A few weeks ago, you noticed a discoloration on your arms that hasn't resolved. You described it as… not a pleasant shade. Could you describe the discoloration a little more for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like a bruise, you understand. Bruises you can understand. This is…patchy. Like someone took a watercolor brush and just…dabbed it on. And it’s… sort of brownish, but with a grey undertone. It's not raised or anything, thankfully. I wouldn’t want that. It just… looks unwell. Honestly, it’s terribly distracting when I’m cataloging. Everything has to be so precise, you see, and this just… clashes.
DOCTOR: Patchy, brownish with a grey undertone, not raised… distracting with your work. Thank you for clarifying. And you mentioned cataloging – is that your profession?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m an archivist. At the historical society, downtown. It’s very important work, you know. Preserving things. Everything must be documented correctly. Which is rather difficult when one is… visually compromised, shall we say? It requires a certain aesthetic sensibility, and this discoloration is simply… detrimental. It’s not something one expects to see on a professional, is it?
DOCTOR: Certainly not, and I understand how concerning it is when something affects your professional life. Just to get a better understanding, Ms. Bartock, has this discoloration appeared anywhere else on your body besides your arms?
PATIENT: No, just my arms. Mostly the insides, actually. And a little bit on my wrists. I haven’t really examined my legs closely, to be honest. I don't generally wear shorts. Too… common. But no, as far as I can tell, it’s contained to the arms. Though, now that you mention it, I think I saw a tiny spot on my hand yesterday, but I could be mistaken. I really need to get better lighting in my apartment.
DOCTOR: Primarily on the insides of your arms and wrists, with a possible spot on your hand. I see. And has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. My husband, Bohdan, and I have been keeping to our usual routine. He’s been quite busy with his woodworking, and I’ve been, well, archiving. We did start using a new brand of hand soap a few weeks ago, at the same time I noticed the discoloration. It's lavender scented. Bohdan bought it. He thought it would be… relaxing. I haven’t said anything about the soap, though. He tries so hard.
DOCTOR: A new lavender-scented hand soap around the time you noticed the discoloration… That’s useful information, thank you. And you haven’t experienced any itching, burning, or other symptoms associated with the discoloration?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. It doesn’t feel different. It's just… there. Visually unpleasant, but not irritating or anything. Honestly, I'm more bothered by the appearance of it than anything else. It's quite distracting when I’m examining delicate documents. One has to maintain a certain level of… composure, you see. It’s simply unprofessional to be distracted by one’s own skin.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Bartock. It’s concerning when something impacts your comfort and professionalism. Would you mind if I took a closer look at your arms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Please do. Though, I must warn you, the lighting in here isn’t the best. And, frankly, I’m rather particular about how things are handled. Gently, if you would. I wouldn’t want to damage the… delicacy of my skin.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be very gentle. Just let me put these gloves on first. I see the discoloration you mentioned. It appears to be a patchy, brownish-grey hyperpigmentation on the inner forearms and wrists. The texture is normal, no raised lesions or signs of inflammation. It’s somewhat symmetrical, which is good. No associated edema, warmth, or tenderness. It doesn’t appear to be an infection or allergic reaction based on this initial examination.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Though, what is it, then? I mean, just to have brownish-grey patches on one’s arms is hardly a diagnosis, is it? It’s terribly inconvenient. And I have a very important appraisal next week. I simply must be presentable. Is it… contagious? Bohdan and I work quite closely sometimes, organizing things, and I wouldn't want to… transmit anything to him. He's not very robust.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. It's not a diagnosis just to observe the patches, and it's important to understand the cause. As for contagiousness, it doesn’t appear to be, based on what I see, but we need to determine the underlying cause before we can be certain. There are several possibilities. It could be a form of contact dermatitis from something you've been exposed to, perhaps the new hand soap, even if it’s not causing irritation. It could also be related to sun exposure, even if you don’t spend a lot of time in direct sunlight. Less commonly, it can be associated with certain medications or underlying medical conditions. Given your profession and the location of the discoloration, I’d like to order a few tests to rule out any underlying issues and get a clearer picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. I’m not terribly fond of tests. Are they… unpleasant? And will they interfere with my schedule? The appraisal is very important, you see. It involves a rather valuable collection of antique maps. I simply must be focused. What sort of tests are we talking about? And how long will it take to get the results? Bohdan will be quite cross if I’m away for too long. He’s very particular about me keeping a regular schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Bartock. We'll try to keep everything as simple and quick as possible. The tests I'm thinking of are routine blood work – just to check your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the discoloration. And a patch test – a small amount of various substances, including ingredients in the hand soap, are applied to a small area of your skin to see if any of them cause a reaction. It doesn't usually cause any discomfort, but can take a few hours to develop. The blood work will take a few days for the results, and the patch test will require a follow-up appointment in about 48-72 hours to assess the reaction. We can schedule everything around your appraisal if you’d like. We will try our best to minimize any disruption to your routine. Would you be amenable to proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, a few tests, I suppose, are better than leaving this unresolved. But please, be as gentle as possible with the blood draw. I faint easily. And the patch test… is it visible? I wouldn’t want to be seen with… anything adhered to my skin. It’s terribly unprofessional. And 48-72 hours… that’s cutting it rather close to the appraisal. But if it’s necessary… very well. Schedule it for as early as possible. And please, remind your staff to be extremely careful. I have sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bartock. I will ensure that the phlebotomist is aware of your history of fainting and will take extra precautions during the blood draw. And I will personally oversee the patch test to ensure it is applied discreetly and that you are comfortable throughout the process. We will schedule everything for as early as possible, keeping your appraisal in mind, and will aim for minimal visibility. I will also write detailed instructions for the staff regarding your sensitive skin. I'll have my assistant schedule the appointments for you now, and she'll go over everything in detail. Do you have any other concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… please, emphasize to everyone how important it is to be gentle. And discreet. And on time. Bohdan is terribly punctual. If I'm late for the appraisal because of… medical procedures, he will be quite cross. I trust you will handle everything with the utmost care. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. I have a great deal of cataloging to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I will personally ensure that everything is handled with the utmost care and discretion. My assistant will be in touch shortly to schedule the appointments. Thank you for your patience, and please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I wish you well with your cataloging.
