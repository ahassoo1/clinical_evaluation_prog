DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Have a seat. So, you're here today because…?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Fourney. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Brendan, by the way. Just…itching. Everywhere, really. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now and it’s driving me a bit crazy, to be honest. Not a sharp itch, more…constant. Like a really bad mosquito bite all over.
DOCTOR: “Itching,” right. A couple of weeks. Constant. Well, that’s… helpful. Let’s try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Sorry, Doctor. I just… I don’t really know how specific. It’s just…all over. Arms, legs, back, even my stomach. It doesn't seem to be getting worse, thankfully, but it's not going away either. It's just…there. And it's making it hard to sleep, if that makes any sense. I've tried some lotion, but it doesn't really help much.
DOCTOR: "Some lotion." Of course you have. Alright. Is it worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I think…maybe a little worse at night? Or maybe it just bothers me more at night, because I'm trying to relax, you know? Everything feels more noticeable when I'm quiet. I really hadn't thought about when it was worse specifically, just that it was…always there.
DOCTOR: “Always there.” Right. And any rash?
PATIENT: No rash, Doctor. That’s the weird thing. That’s why I thought it was…odd. No bumps, no redness, no blisters. Just…itchiness. It's like an internal itch, almost. That’s what it feels like anyway. I’ve been looking, and I can’t see anything.
DOCTOR: "Internal itch," you say. Interesting. And you’ve had this…“internal itch” for two weeks, no visible changes to your skin. Any recent travel?
PATIENT: No, no travel, Doctor. Not for a long, long time. I haven't left this county in… well, since my wife passed, to be honest. I mostly just stay home, garden a bit. Nothing exciting. I haven't been around any new plants or anything either, at least not that I'm aware of. I’m pretty careful with what I touch.
DOCTOR: "Careful." Of course. Alright. Any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. Old Man Hemlock down the road gave me some of his tomatoes. Huge things, they were. Best tomatoes I've had in years, but… I did eat a lot of them. Maybe a week ago? Could that be it? I hadn’t really thought about it.
DOCTOR: Tomatoes. Right. And how many “a lot” is “a lot”, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Probably… four or five a day? I really liked them, you see. Made a big salad with them, had them with my sandwiches… I wasn’t keeping track, but I ate a good many. Is that… a lot? I always thought tomatoes were good for you.
DOCTOR: “Good for you” doesn’t mean unlimited, Mr. Ferneding. Tomatoes are acidic. And consuming a large quantity… can cause a reaction. It's unlikely, but a mild histamine reaction could explain the itchiness. Now, let's have a look at your skin. I need to physically examine you. Please turn around.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. I hadn’t thought of that. Histamine, you say? I suppose I should have mentioned I had a little bit of hives when I was a boy. Nothing serious, but… Yes, alright. Here I go.
DOCTOR: No visible rash, as you said. Skin is warm and dry. No wheals. Lymph nodes are unremarkable. It's likely a mild cutaneous reaction to the tomatoes, or possibly some other dietary irritant. I'm going to recommend an over-the-counter antihistamine – loratadine, 10 milligrams daily. And reduce your tomato intake. Significantly. If it doesn't improve within a week, we'll consider further testing. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Loratadine. I think I’ve seen that at the store. And yes, I’ll definitely cut back on the tomatoes! I’m just glad it’s probably something simple. Allergies…hmm. Not that I know of. I was a bit sensitive to bee stings as a child, but I haven't been stung in decades. Nothing that required an EpiPen or anything like that. Just a little swelling. Does that count?
DOCTOR: "A little swelling" doesn’t require an EpiPen. Right. So, no current medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No current medications. Just… the loratadine, starting tonight. And less tomatoes. It’s a good thing gardening season is winding down anyway. I was starting to feel overwhelmed by them.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. I'm writing you a prescription for the loratadine. If the itching persists or worsens after a week, or if you develop any other symptoms – hives, swelling, difficulty breathing – you need to contact me immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. Loratadine, one a day. Less tomatoes. And call if anything changes – hives, swelling, breathing… Got it. Thank you very much, Doctor Fourney. I really appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: Very well. And try to be more mindful of your dietary intake in the future, Mr. Ferneding. It's not always about what you can eat, but how much you eat. One last thing, do you have a primary care physician I should send this information to?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s a good point. No, I don’t, actually. Haven’t seen one in years. I usually just… try to tough things out. But maybe I should get one. You wouldn’t happen to know a good one around here, would you? And thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Here. This is a list of physicians accepting new patients in the area. I suggest you schedule an appointment and establish care. And Mr. Ferneding, “toughing things out” is not a healthcare strategy. Now, if there’s nothing else… .
PATIENT: Oh. Thank you very much, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. Yes, you’re right. I should probably be more sensible. Alright then. I think that’s everything. Thank you again for your time, and for… the advice. I appreciate it. .
