DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s these hiccups, really. They just won’t stop. Been going on for… goodness, I think nearly a week now. It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a full week. Started last Tuesday, I believe. Not constantly, you understand. Comes and goes, but it’s… persistent. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down… all those little things people suggest. Nothing seems to do the trick.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And are there any other symptoms accompanying these hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Just the hiccups themselves. No pain, no shortness of breath, no… well, nothing else feels off. I’m eating normally, sleeping alright… just a bit annoyed, if I’m honest. It’s distracting, especially when I’m trying to watch my stories on TV.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… not that I can pinpoint, exactly. Sometimes they start after I eat, but not every time. And sometimes they just… happen. I was gardening yesterday, and a whole bunch started then, but I wasn’t doing anything particularly strenuous. It’s a bit of a mystery, really.
DOCTOR: Let’s take a look at your chart… I see you have a history of… well, not much, actually. No significant medical problems listed. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. I eat pretty much everything, though I do try to watch my salt these days. My mother always said too much salt wasn’t good for a person.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, now and then. They get a bit creaky, you know, being an old girl. It’s called… let me think… glucosamine, I believe. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I'll take a little bit of melatonin. But that's it, really. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and just feel around a bit. Can you lie back for me on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. No problem at all. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, won’t I? Old bones aren’t as forgiving as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. I don't feel any masses or abnormalities. Everything seems… normal. Which, frankly, is a bit perplexing with hiccups lasting this long.
PATIENT: Perplexing, is it? Tell me about it! It’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. It's just… persistent. I was hoping you might have some magic trick up your sleeve, Doctor. Is there anything else you can check? Perhaps something to do with… nerves? I always heard hiccups were something to do with nerves.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It can be nerve related, yes. Sometimes the phrenic or vagus nerve gets irritated. Given your age and the lack of other symptoms, it’s unlikely anything serious, but a prolonged bout like this warrants a little further investigation. I'd like to order a chest X-ray just to rule out anything unusual in your lungs, and perhaps a basic blood panel to check your electrolyte levels. Sometimes imbalances can cause persistent hiccups. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it puts my mind at ease, I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. An X-ray and a blood panel… yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Will it be alright if I drive myself home afterwards? I usually have someone take me to appointments, but I didn't think I'd need it for just… hiccups.
DOCTOR: Yes, you should be perfectly safe to drive yourself home. Those tests are routine. I'll have the lab draw the blood now, and then we can get you scheduled for the X-ray. I'll also write you a prescription for a medication called baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help with persistent hiccups. Start with a low dose, as directed on the label, and if it doesn’t help after a few days, we can discuss increasing it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Thank you. Baclofen, you say? Alright, I'll take it as directed. And I'll get scheduled for the X-ray. Is there anything I should avoid doing while I'm taking the medication? Or anything I should be looking out for? I always like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Baclofen can cause drowsiness, so be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how it affects you. Also, it can sometimes cause dizziness. If you experience either of those, stop taking the medication and contact my office. More rarely, it can cause confusion or muscle weakness. If you notice any of those symptoms, stop taking the medication immediately and seek medical attention. I'll give you a written list of side effects to take home with you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor, and explained everything so clearly. A written list of side effects is perfect. I appreciate you taking the time to look into these pesky hiccups for me. Hopefully, this medication will do the trick. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get those tests ordered and the prescription sent to your pharmacy. We'll follow up in a week to see how you're doing. If the hiccups don’t improve, or if you experience any concerning side effects, don’t hesitate to contact my office sooner. Here’s the paperwork for the lab and the information about the medication. Have a good day, Ms. Sucich. And try to relax—stress can sometimes make hiccups worse. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. I'll try to take it easy, and I'll be sure to call if anything changes. You have a good day too, and thank you again for everything. .
