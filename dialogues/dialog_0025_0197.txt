DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about getting a card… a medical card for driving, you see. I want to keep doing some ride-share work, if that’s alright. It’s what I need for that, right? A check-up to make sure I’m still able?
DOCTOR: A "medical card" for ride-share… right. It’s more of a commercial driver's license endorsement, often requiring a DOT physical. But yes, a general health assessment is part of that process, and certainly prudent given your line of work. So, let’s get some information down. First, have you been experiencing any new or unusual symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Oh, “DOT physical,” is that what they call it now? So many names! No, no new symptoms, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains for an old lady who spent decades in the woods with logging equipment, you know? Nothing I haven’t dealt with before. My knees bother me sometimes, and my back… well, my back always bothers me. But nothing new.
DOCTOR: "Old lady," Ms. Sciarotta?
PATIENT: Oh, don't mind me, Doctor. Just being honest! Seventy years will do that to a person. But, yes, you're right. I shouldn't call myself that. Sorry. Are we getting back to the check-up now? I’d like to get this done if possible, I have a little schedule I’m trying to keep.
DOCTOR: Well, "honest" doesn't negate the need for a thorough assessment, does it?
PATIENT: No, of course not, Doctor. You're perfectly right. I just… I’m trying to be efficient. It’s not that I don’t trust your judgment, I just… well, time is a little precious these days, you know? But please, ask away. Whatever you need to know, I’ll tell you. I have a very good memory, so don’t worry about me forgetting things.
DOCTOR: Excellent. A good memory is… helpful. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis – anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes, Doctor, I was diagnosed about fifteen years ago. I take medication for it, and it’s usually well-controlled. The doctor checks it regularly. Arthritis, too, in my knees and lower back, which I already mentioned, I suppose. Nothing else major that I can recall. Oh! I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but that was a one-time thing. Is that what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal… good. And do you have any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, late in life. And my father… he had heart problems, a stroke, I believe. On my husband’s side, his mother had Alzheimer’s, but that was a long time ago. Does that give you enough information, Doctor? I could go further back if you like, but I'm not sure how relevant it would be. We had a big family, so it’s a bit difficult to recall everything perfectly.
DOCTOR: "Difficult," is an understatement. Alright. Let’s talk about your medications. You mentioned taking something for your blood pressure. Can you tell me the name and dosage of all the medications you currently take?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s where I struggle a little. I have several, and I usually let the pharmacist handle keeping track. Let me see… I take Lisinopril, I believe, for the blood pressure. Twenty milligrams, daily. And then there’s something for the arthritis… Ibuprofen, usually, when it flares up. Not every day, though. Just as needed. And… oh! A vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was low on that last year. I think it’s 2000 IU. Is it alright if I try to find the bottles? It’ll be quicker than trying to remember everything. They're in the kitchen.
DOCTOR: "Quicker," is appreciated, Ms. Sciarotta. But accurate is preferable. Please, don't trouble yourself. I'll make a note to verify all of this with your pharmacy. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. No, no allergies that I know of, Doctor. Truly. I've eaten everything put in front of me my whole life, and never had a reaction. No trouble with penicillin or anything like that, either. I'm a pretty simple woman, as far as allergies go. I just want to get this card, if that’s possible. I have a few rides lined up next week, and I don’t want to disappoint anyone.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I'll need to assess your reflexes and range of motion.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be gentle with my knees, if you would? They're not what they used to be. And please, don't take too long. I'm trying to keep to my schedule, you see. Is there a chair I can sit on for some of it? Getting up and down is… a bit of a struggle.
DOCTOR: We'll start here, Ms. Sciarotta. The examination table adjusts, and I'll take things slowly. Please, lie back. First, let’s take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. As long as it's gentle, I’m fine. It’s a little chilly in here, though. Is it possible to adjust the temperature? Just let me know when you’re ready. I’ll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: 148/82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please, extend your arms.
PATIENT: There we go. A little stiff, but I’m extended. The murmur… is that something to worry about? My old doctor never mentioned anything. I’ve had a good life, but I don't want anything to slow me down now. It's just... important to me to keep working. Just a little bit, you see. It keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Now, let’s examine your knees. Please, bend them for me, if you can. There is some crepitus, and mild tenderness to palpation. Range of motion is limited. Now, could you please stand up slowly?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s not easy, Doctor. I told you, my knees aren’t what they used to be. But I can stand. It just… takes a moment. Is everything alright? It's just... a bit painful. It's always worse in the mornings. Is this all you need? Perhaps we can skip the other tests? I really am trying to keep to my schedule.
DOCTOR: Stand, steady. Gait is slightly antalgic. Range of motion limited. Alright, Ms. Sciarotta, I think I have sufficient information for a preliminary assessment. We need to discuss your blood pressure, your knee condition, and the potential implications for commercial driving. Now, let's talk about this "card" you're seeking…
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please do. I was hoping… hoping everything would be alright. I understand if it's not. I just… I enjoy driving, and it helps me get by. So, what’s the verdict? Is it a “no”? Please be honest with me. I can take it. And please, don’t make me go through any more painful tests if you can avoid it. I just want to know if I can still do this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarotta, obtaining this commercial driver’s license endorsement requires a certain standard of physical health. Your blood pressure is elevated, and your knee condition—while not an immediate disqualification—does present a concern. Driving a commercial vehicle requires physical stamina and the ability to react quickly in emergency situations. Based on my initial assessment, I am hesitant to sign off on the medical certification at this time. However, this does not necessarily mean a definitive “no”. I recommend a cardiology consult to evaluate your blood pressure further and a referral to orthopedics for a more thorough assessment of your knees. Depending on their findings, we can revisit this discussion. Furthermore, I strongly advise against operating a commercial vehicle until these evaluations are complete. It is not a matter of convenience, Ms. Sciarotta; it is a matter of safety—your safety and the safety of others.
PATIENT: I see. So… it’s not good news, then. A cardiology consult… and orthopedics… That's going to take time, isn't it? I don't know if I have time. And the cost… oh dear. I understand about safety, Doctor. I truly do. I'm not reckless. But this driving… it's how I manage. It's not just a hobby. It’s… well, it's everything. Is there anything else I can do? Any medication that might help lower my blood pressure quickly? Any exercises for my knees that could make a difference? I’m willing to try anything. Just… please, don’t take this away from me completely. .
