DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're 73 years of age. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think? That’s what the lady on the phone said. Honestly, things are a bit fuzzy these days. Medicare sent something, and they told me to come here. Do I need to… fill something out? I don't really remember what they said on the phone.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the administrative staff should have handled the paperwork. It appears there’s a scheduled routine check-up and some blood work ordered by Medicare. However, it's helpful to have a clear understanding of why those tests were requested. Is there anything specific you've been experiencing that prompted a call from Medicare, or have you been feeling generally unwell?
PATIENT: Unwell… hmm. Not particularly, no. I mean, I get tired easily, but that's just getting old, isn't it? Honestly, I don’t recall anything specific prompting a call. Maybe just a standard thing? Look, I'm a power plant operator, been doing that a long time. I’m pretty good at keeping things running, but my body… not so much anymore. Can we just get the lab work done? I have to get back to the plant.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, while I appreciate your dedication to your work, simply completing lab work without a proper assessment is… suboptimal. We need to ascertain why Medicare deemed these tests necessary. "Just getting old" is not a diagnosis, and fatigue, especially in someone your age, warrants investigation. Now, let’s begin with a brief history. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes… weight? I eat… I suppose I eat less than I used to. Everything tastes a bit bland, to be honest. And I think my trousers might be a little looser. Maybe. It's hard to say. I haven't weighed myself in… goodness, decades, probably. Look, is this going to take long? I really don’t have a lot of time today. Can we just check my blood sugar? That’s what my brother had trouble with.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, it's precisely because your brother experienced difficulties with blood sugar that we need to be thorough. We cannot simply assume that is your issue without proper evaluation. Decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss, even a small amount, are significant findings that require attention. Let’s move on. Do you have any difficulty with breathing, or have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… Sometimes, I think. My boots feel a little tight at the end of the day, but that’s probably just from being on my feet so long. Breathing… not really. Maybe a little winded when I climb the stairs at the plant, but who doesn’t get winded climbing stairs? Honestly, Doctor, are these questions necessary for a simple blood test? I'm starting to get a little anxious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, I assure you these questions are necessary. We are attempting to build a comprehensive picture of your health, not simply chase a single number. Dismissing symptoms as “getting old” or attributing them to your occupation is not responsible medical practice. Now, concerning your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? Oh, goodness. Let me think… the doctor at the plant did say something about my blood pressure being a little high a few years back. But it wasn’t serious. He said watch the salt. And… I think I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. When I was younger. Honestly, I’ve seen so many doctors over the years, working at the plant, it all blurs together. They just patch you up and send you back to work. Can we please just get this over with? I have a shift to cover.
DOCTOR: Very well. A history of elevated blood pressure, even if previously managed, is relevant. And pneumonia, while in the past, is also noted. Now, regarding medications: are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Medications… uh… I take a little something for my knees, sometimes. Over the counter, you know, the kind you can buy at the store. Ibuprofen, I think. When they really bother me. And… sometimes a little something for sleep. But just when I can’t get to sleep, which isn’t very often. Honestly, Doctor, I really don’t like taking pills. They make me feel… sluggish. Is this all you need to know? I promise I’m generally a healthy guy.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, as needed for knee pain, and a sleep aid, occasionally. Those are important details. Now, allergies: do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes, but that's just from the dust at the plant. And I don’t eat shellfish. But that’s not an allergy, just a preference. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your thoroughness, truly. But I'm starting to feel a little overwhelmed. Can we please just get to the lab work now? I need to get back to work and make sure everything is running smoothly.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. While I strongly recommend a more comprehensive assessment, I understand your concerns about time. However, please understand that proceeding without a complete history may delay an accurate diagnosis. Before we proceed to the lab work, I need to conduct a brief physical examination. It will be quick. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and briefly examine your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination… Look, Doctor, I work around heavy machinery all day. I’m pretty sure I know what’s going on with my body. But… fine. Just make it quick, okay? I really don't have a lot of patience for this. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though there's a slight wheeze on exhalation. Blood pressure is elevated at 150/90. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no palpable masses. Slight distension noted. Okay, Mr. Croonquist. That concludes the brief physical examination. Now, we’ll proceed to draw blood for the routine lab work ordered by Medicare. The nurse will be in shortly. I still strongly advise you to schedule a follow-up appointment for a more thorough evaluation. This is not simply about checking boxes; it’s about ensuring your long-term health.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. I’ll… think about it. Just… let’s get this blood work done, okay? I really need to get back to the plant. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. I will inform the nurse to prepare the lab requisition. Please remain seated, and she will be with you shortly. And Mr. Croonquist… please be sure to inform your plant physician of the elevated blood pressure reading. .
