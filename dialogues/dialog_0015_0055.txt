DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s been reading things on the internet, and she thinks it might help with… well, with getting a good night’s sleep. I haven’t been sleeping properly, you see. Not since… well, a long time. And frankly, I'd like to explore all options before I resort to those… pills the other doctors keep pushing.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're interested in medical marijuana for insomnia. And you've already discussed this with your daughter. Before we go any further, Ms. Ranells, I need to understand your sleep issues a bit better. When did this trouble sleeping begin?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must we go through everything? It’s been years. Decades, even. It started after… well, let’s just say a very difficult time in my life. My husband, Harold, he… he passed. It’s been a struggle ever since. I’m not one to dwell, but it certainly disrupted my routine. Is that enough detail for you? I find it rather personal, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand it is personal, Ms. Ranells, and I apologize if I'm pressing. It's simply that understanding the cause of the insomnia can help determine the best course of action. "A very difficult time" is… broad. Were there any other changes around the time of your husband's passing that might be contributing?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, Harold died, Doctor. What changes could be more significant than that? Everything changed. The house felt empty. My social life… diminished. My appetite… suffered. It was a complete upheaval. I don’t see how listing every minor detail will help with this… marijuana business. I just want to know if I qualify and what I need to do. Are we getting anywhere, or are we simply dissecting my personal history?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, I assure you I am trying to get somewhere. It’s not simply a matter of "qualifying" for medical marijuana. It has potential risks and benefits, and I have a professional obligation to ensure it’s appropriate for you, specifically. I need a comprehensive picture of your health. Let’s try this: aside from the difficulty sleeping, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? At my age, Doctor, one has symptoms. My knees ache, my back bothers me, I get winded walking up the stairs… the usual. Is that what you want to hear? I assure you, I’m not in perfect health. But I manage. I always have. This isn’t about a litany of aches and pains. It’s about being able to close my eyes at night without… without dwelling on things. Frankly, I find this line of questioning rather tedious. Are there forms I can fill out? Perhaps that would be more efficient.
DOCTOR: Forms will certainly help, Ms. Ranells. But they won't provide the nuance I need. You mentioned aches and pains. Are these constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, they come and go, of course. It’s not as if I’m in agony constantly. But they’re… bothersome. Especially in damp weather. And sometimes they keep me awake more than anything else. It’s a vicious cycle, you see. Pain keeps me awake, and not sleeping makes the pain worse. Honestly, Doctor, I don't see what any of this has to do with… the marijuana. I'm a practical woman. I just want to know if it might give me some peace. Is it legal? What’s the dosage? What are the side effects? Let’s stick to the facts, shall we?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s address your questions directly. Medical marijuana is legal in this state, although regulations are… evolving. As for dosage and side effects, those vary significantly depending on the product and the individual. That's why a thorough assessment is crucial. Now, before we discuss specific products, I need to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Doctor, are you implying I'm falling apart? I’ve seen doctors for years, they all know my history. Harold and I had excellent insurance until… well, never mind. I’ve had the usual aches and pains, a touch of arthritis in my hands, but nothing… serious. High blood pressure, perhaps, but it’s controlled with… with a little something the previous doctor prescribed. I don't see the need to rehash everything. Honestly, this is becoming rather exhausting. I hope this doesn’t take much longer.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, controlled with medication. Do you remember the name of that medication, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking me something difficult. It was… a small white pill. Or perhaps it was pale blue. Harold always managed the medications, you see. He had a very organized system. I just… took them as instructed. I really couldn’t say what it was called. It’s been a while, and honestly, Doctor, I don’t make a habit of memorizing pharmaceutical names. Is it terribly important? I’m sure it’s on record somewhere.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Ranells. Certain medications can interact with cannabis, and it’s vital to understand what you’re currently taking. We can access your previous records, but it may take some time. In the meantime, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite robust, you see. I don’t recall ever having a serious reaction to anything. A little itching sometimes, perhaps, but nothing a bit of cream couldn’t fix. Honestly, Doctor, I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. I just want to explore a potential remedy for sleeplessness, not undergo a full medical investigation. Are we any closer to determining if I qualify for this… marijuana?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, I understand your frustration, but I must prioritize your safety. Without a clear understanding of your medical history and current medications, I cannot responsibly recommend any treatment, including medical marijuana. Let’s try a different approach. Do you currently take any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter… well, sometimes I take an antacid. After dinner, you know. Harold always said I ate too quickly. And occasionally, if my knees are particularly bothersome, I’ll take… something for the pain. Ibuprofen, I think. Or naproxen. Something like that. I honestly can’t recall the exact name. I buy whatever’s on sale at the pharmacy. They all seem to do the same job. Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? I just want to sleep. I'm getting quite tired just talking about all of this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, intermittent ibuprofen or naproxen use, antacids as needed. Alright. One final area. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Doctor, really! I was raised better than that. Harold and I both disapproved of smoking. A terrible habit, we always said. No, I have never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I certainly don’t intend to start now, even if it’s… medical. Honestly, this line of questioning is becoming rather… intrusive. I trust you're not suggesting I take up smoking as a condition for getting this marijuana?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Ranells, absolutely not. I simply need a complete picture. Now, before we discuss potential options, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. Just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you must. But please be quick about it. I have a luncheon appointment this afternoon and I don't want to be late. And please don't poke around too much. I'm not particularly fond of being examined. I suppose it's necessary, if you're determined to proceed. But do hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells. Blood pressure is… 148 over 92. A little elevated, which is consistent with your reported history. Breathing sounds are clear, but a slightly rapid heart rate. Pulse is 88 and a little irregular. I’d like to order an EKG to assess the irregularity further. It's a simple test, and it will help me determine if the cannabis would be safe for you, given your heart rate and blood pressure.
PATIENT: An EKG? Doctor, are you telling me I need more tests? I came here for a simple certification, not a full cardiac workup! Frankly, this is becoming quite ridiculous. I'm starting to think this whole marijuana business is more trouble than it's worth. Harold always said I worried too much, and he was right. This is only going to exacerbate my anxiety. I’m not sure I want to proceed with this anymore. Perhaps a nice cup of chamomile tea would be a better solution after all.
