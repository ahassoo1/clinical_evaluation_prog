DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Hatchard, let's get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's my… stool. It’s black. Like, really black. And I take those pills, you know, for my aches. The red ones. Been taking them for years. My sister-in-law, Bernice, she said it could be serious, so here I am. Honestly, I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Black stool, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, black. Not brown, black. Like tar, almost. And I told you, I'm on those pain pills. The doctor gave them to me, years ago. Don't see why that would matter, but Bernice said something about bleeding, and I figured I should get it checked. Honestly, it's probably nothing. I’ve had worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, these pain pills… what are they for, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, everything. My knees, my back, my hip… you name it, it aches. Arthritis, mostly. Old age, really. They’re… let me think… Naproxen, I believe. Little red ones. Two every morning, sometimes more if I’m doing something. Gardening, mostly. Although I haven't been doing much of that lately. Honestly, the pills are the only thing keeping me going.
DOCTOR: Naproxen... right. And how long have you been taking more than the prescribed dose?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, who keeps track of that? Years, probably. When I’ve got a lot to do, I take an extra one or two. It’s not like I'm popping them all day, just when I need to. And they work, you know? I need to be able to keep up with things. Honestly, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Hatchard, taking more than the recommended dose of anything can have consequences. Especially with Naproxen. It can irritate the stomach, cause ulcers... potentially lead to bleeding. That black stool could be a sign of that. But let's not jump to conclusions. Have you noticed any stomach pain?
PATIENT: Stomach pain? Well, sometimes a little bit of heartburn. But I have that all the time, honestly. Probably just something I ate. I've always had a sensitive stomach. But pain? No, not really. Just… discomfort. It's probably nothing. I told you, I've got a high tolerance. Honestly, I just want to know if I need to stop taking the pills. Because frankly, I can't function without them.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, just to be thorough. Lie back on the table, please. I'm going to listen to your stomach and check for any tenderness. Don't make a fuss if it’s a little uncomfortable. Honestly, it's just a formality.
PATIENT: Honestly, a formality is right. Fine. Just get it over with. Hurry it up, will you? I have a luncheon to get to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is a little tender in the lower right quadrant, but nothing alarming. Your bowel sounds are present, though a bit diminished. No significant masses palpated. Honestly, it's not conclusive, but we should run a stool test just to rule things out. And a CBC to check your blood count.
PATIENT: A stool test? Honestly, that’s ridiculous. I’m not comfortable with that. And a blood test? Really? For a little bit of black stool? I’m telling you, it’s probably just something I ate. Look, I appreciate your concern, but I'm not sure this is necessary. Can't we just… stop the pills and see what happens? Honestly, I’d rather not have all these tests. It’s a waste of time and money. .
DOCTOR: Mrs. Hatchard, I understand your reluctance, but I have to rule out serious causes. Black stool can be a sign of internal bleeding, and ignoring it could have… consequences. Look, I'm not trying to waste your time, but this is basic medical procedure. We’ll do the tests, get the results, and then we can discuss stopping the pills if that’s what the results indicate. Honestly, it's for your own good. I'm ordering the tests now. The nurse will get you set up. .
