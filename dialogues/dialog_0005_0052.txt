DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, thank you, Doctor. Well, it's been a bit of a bother, really. For the past wee while now, I've been feeling sick to my stomach most mornings. Not proper sick, mind you, more like…nausea. It’s been happening more often, and it's got me a bit worried, seein' as how my heart's not been the strongest.
DOCTOR: Right. Nausea, you say. And you're concerned because of your heart. Let’s get this straight – you're 63, and you’re just now mentioning heart issues now?
PATIENT: Och, now hold on a minute, Doctor. I didn't say I hadn’t mentioned it before. I've been under the care of Dr. MacIntyre for years for it. He's the one who diagnosed it, and he’s been monitorin’ it. It's just…this nausea feels different, and it's started happenin' more frequently, and I thought I’d best get it checked out. It just feels like it could be…related, y’know? I didn’t want to just assume.
DOCTOR: MacIntyre, eh?
PATIENT: Aye, Dr. Alistair MacIntyre. He's a good man, runs a wee practice over on Elm Street. Been seein’ him since…oh, must be close to ten years now. He’s the one who told me about the heart failure, and he’s been keepin’ an eye on it ever since. He’s always been thorough, but…well, he's a busy man. That's why I thought I'd pop in and get another opinion, if you don't mind. Especially with this nausea comin' on. It’s not somethin' I've ever dealt with before.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s not waste time. So, this nausea… when did it actually start happening?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started maybe a month ago, give or take a week. It wasn’t constant at first, just now and then. But it’s been nearly every mornin' for the past two weeks, I’d say. It usually comes on shortly after I wake up, before I’ve had any breakfast. It doesn’t last all day, thankfully, usually fades after a couple of hours. Just enough to put me off my porridge, mind you. It's a bit unsettlin’, that’s what it is.
DOCTOR: And you've made no changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Och, no, not really. Same as always, more or less. Porridge most mornin’s, bit of fish and tatties a couple o’ times a week, maybe a roast on a Sunday. I’ve been tryin’ to cut back on the salt, Dr. MacIntyre told me to, but nothin’ drastic. I haven’t started takin’ any new vitamins or anything like that either. I'm a pretty simple eater, you see. Always have been. Is salt a problem, do you think?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Benic, with your history of heart failure, any change in your condition warrants attention. You’re telling me you haven’t changed anything?
PATIENT: I'm tellin’ you honestly, Doctor, nothin’ major. I maybe had a wee bit more chocolate than usual last week, my niece brought some round, but that’s the extent of it. And I did try a new brand of tea, a sort of herbal one, but I stopped drinkin’ that after a couple of days 'cause it didn't taste very nice. I’m tryin’ to think if there's anything else, but… no, I’m fairly certain it’s just been the same old routine. I wouldn't lie to you, Doctor. I just wanted to check if the nausea could be connected to my heart. It's got me a wee bit worried, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It's just a formality, but we need to rule things out. Lie back on the table, please.
PATIENT: Aye, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to cooperate. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I haven't had much trouble with my blood pressure before, but I'll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… slightly muffled, as expected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 140/90. A bit elevated, but not alarming. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. So, everything seems normal. Though, again, with your history… I'm going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you bein’ thorough. I’m just relieved to hear nothin’ obvious is wrong. I understand with my heart condition, it’s best to check everything. When do you think I’ll get the results back? And will someone contact me, or should I be followin’ up with the clinic?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about three to five business days. Someone will contact you if anything is significantly abnormal. Otherwise, you can follow up with the clinic in a week. Honestly, Mr. Benic, it's likely just indigestion. But we’re covering all bases. Do you have any other concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Indigestion, you say? Hmm. Well, I suppose that's possible. I've been a bit stressed lately, my niece is movin' away, and that's always a worry. No, I don’t think there’s anything else at the moment, Doctor. Just the nausea, and the worry about it bein’ somethin’ to do with my heart. Thank you for lookin' at me, and for ordering the tests. I appreciate your time. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Fasting for 12 hours isn’t necessary. Just drink plenty of water beforehand. And try to relax. Honestly, Mr. Benic, you're probably overthinking it. The nurse will show you the way out. Don't hesitate to call if you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath, understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I understand, Doctor. Chest pain or shortness of breath. I’ll keep that in mind. And I’ll try to relax, though that’s easier said than done sometimes. Thank you again for your time and your help. I'll be seein' you, then, if the results need discussin’. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you to the nurse as well, when I see her.
DOCTOR: Right. You have a good day as well.
