DOCTOR: Good morning, Miss Swaby. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my speech. It’s been… a bit off, I think. Hard to explain, really. It just feels… slurred sometimes. I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "A bit off," you say. And you don’t recall when this “bit off” began?
PATIENT: No, sir, I don’t. It’s… fuzzy. Everything feels a bit fuzzy lately, if I'm being truthful. My husband noticed it first, I believe. He said I wasn’t… as clear as usual when I was talking to his mother on the phone last week, maybe? It's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy. Right. And this slurring... is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. It's not all the time, definitely not. Some days I don't even notice it, and other days… well, like today, I suppose. It's more noticeable when I’m tired, maybe? Or if I've been talking for a long time. It's just… strange. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It’s… vague, but alright. Have you experienced any other symptoms accompanying this… speech irregularity?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not that I've noticed, exactly. My husband says I've been a bit clumsy, bumping into things. And I’ve been feeling… more tired than usual, I suppose. But I work long hours, so… honestly, that could just be the job. Is that… is that helpful? I’m not very good at remembering these things, I apologize.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness and fatigue. And you work long hours. Yes, well, that could account for much. Do you have any difficulty with your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… no, not that I’m aware of. Everything looks pretty clear to me. I haven’t needed new glasses in ages. But… now that you mention it, sometimes things seem a little… blurry at the edges, maybe? But I just thought that was my eyesight getting old. I'm not entirely sure. It's not something I've really paid attention to.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I had… chickenpox as a child, of course. And… I think I had a bad bout of the flu a few years ago, but nothing major. My husband handles most of the doctor’s appointments, so I don’t really keep track of all that. I have Medicare, if that helps? I’m married, and I work as a construction manager… Does that matter? I'm truly sorry if I'm being unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Medicare is noted. Construction management… potentially strenuous work. Very well. Any surgeries, Miss Swaby?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I don’t think so. Not that I recall, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that was ages ago. Nothing since then. Honestly, sir, I haven't had much need for doctors, thankfully. My husband usually takes care of things, so I don't often have to remember these details. I apologize for my… vagueness. It's very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tough one. My mother… she passed away a few years ago. Heart problems, I think. And my father… he’s still alive, but he lives in Jamaica. We haven’t seen each other in a long time. He always said he had good health, but… honestly, I don’t know much about his medical history either. It’s all a bit… distant, I'm afraid. I wish I could be more helpful. Is this important? Should I try to call my husband?
DOCTOR: "Important" is a relative term, Miss Swaby. Your husband is… not present. Let’s proceed with what you know. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. I don’t take any medications. I try to stay healthy, eat well… when I have time, that is. It’s hard with the job. Long hours, lots of physical work. I don't really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. So, no, no medications. I just… take vitamins sometimes. Is that something to note? I'm starting to feel a bit… flustered, honestly. I hope that's alright.
DOCTOR: Vitamins noted. Very well. Now, let’s proceed to a brief physical examination. I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head.
PATIENT: Okay, sir. I can do that. Just follow your finger, right? I'll try my best not to move my head.
DOCTOR: Very well. And now, I’d like you to close your eyes. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Tongue is midline. No fasciculations noted. Alright. Now, open your mouth and say "ah."
PATIENT: Ah… Is that okay, sir? Does it sound… alright? I hope I’m not making this difficult. It just feels… strange to say it.
DOCTOR: Your speech… is still somewhat slurred. And I observe mild difficulty with articulation. Miss Swaby, based on this brief examination, I suspect you may be experiencing early neurological symptoms. However, this is purely preliminary. We need to conduct further testing. I am ordering an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Also, I’d like you to schedule an appointment with a neurologist immediately. I will provide you with the necessary referral information.
PATIENT: An MRI… and a neurologist? Oh dear. Is it… is it serious, Doctor? I… I don't understand. What kind of… abnormalities are we looking for? And what does this mean for my job? I… I need to work. My husband… he depends on me. I just want to know… is it something to worry about?
DOCTOR: "Worried" is an emotional response, Miss Swaby. I am a physician, not a counselor. The MRI is standard procedure to investigate the cause of your symptoms. It does not confirm any diagnosis. As for your employment, that is a matter for you and your employer. I am concerned with your health, not your livelihood. See a neurologist as soon as possible. They will conduct a more thorough evaluation and determine the appropriate course of action. Do not delay. And I suggest you inform your husband of these findings immediately. This is not something to be taken lightly. Are there any other questions… before I dismiss you?
PATIENT: No… I… I don't think so. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll try to schedule the appointment right away. And I’ll tell my husband. I… I think that's all. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Good day, Miss Swaby. .
