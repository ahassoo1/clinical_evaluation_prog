DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Beinborn. It’s very nice to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been having some…pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. I see. And when you say “a little while now,” could you give me a rough estimate of how long that is?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, about two months, give or take a week. It hasn’t been constant, but it’s frequent enough that it’s becoming a concern.
DOCTOR: Alright, about two months. And you said it’s not constant… can you describe what makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Certainly. It seems to get worse if I have to hold it for a long time – like when I’m in a meeting at work, or if I’m driving and can’t stop right away. Drinking caffeine definitely makes it worse too. When I’m just relaxing at home and able to go when I need to, it’s much better. It almost disappears then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so holding it and caffeine seem to be triggers. That’s helpful to know. Is it just pressure, or are you experiencing any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: It’s mostly just the pressure, but…now that you mention it, I have been going to the bathroom a little more often than usual. Not drastically more, but enough that I’ve noticed it. And sometimes, after I go, it doesn't feel like I've emptied my bladder completely, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Increased frequency and a feeling of incomplete emptying… okay. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no pain or burning. It’s never been painful, just…uncomfortable with the pressure and the feeling of not being fully emptied. I'm glad it isn't painful, to be honest. It’s just…annoying and a little worrisome.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or burning is good. And I understand it being worrisome. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see. I had chickenpox as a child, and I broke my arm once, but nothing major. I've been generally very healthy. My husband, Ricardo, has high blood pressure, but I don't. As for anything else…no, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything significant. I do have Medicare, as I mentioned earlier.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, no significant medical history. And you mentioned Ricardo has high blood pressure. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I've been fortunate enough to avoid needing any surgeries so far. I had all my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that was a very routine procedure, and I didn’t have any complications.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And how about allergies?
PATIENT: No known allergies. I can eat pretty much anything without issue. No food allergies, no medication allergies, no seasonal allergies…nothing. I'm very lucky that way too, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not taking any medications at all. I try to avoid them if I can. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that's it. I really prefer to just rest and see if things get better on their own, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. That simplifies things. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. Ricardo used to smoke, but he quit about ten years ago. He was very proud of himself for that, and it’s been wonderful not having smoke around.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: We have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing excessive, and Ricardo and I both drink responsibly. It’s mostly just a habit, really, and we don't go out drinking very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate alcohol consumption. And what about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat a healthy diet. Lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein… we cook at home most nights. Ricardo is a wonderful cook, and he focuses on Mexican cuisine, naturally. We eat a fair amount of beans and rice, and I try to limit processed foods and sugary drinks. I do enjoy a good dessert sometimes, though! I can’t resist a good flan.
DOCTOR: Okay, healthy diet, mostly home-cooked meals. That’s all very helpful. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll do a quick neurological check, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright with me. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I appreciate you being so thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. Your reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. Everything appears to be within normal limits so far. I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for any infection or abnormalities in your urine. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. A urinalysis seems like a good idea. Absolutely, please go ahead and order one. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get this pressure sorted out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll get the order sent to the lab right away. They’ll need a sample of your urine, and the nurse will give you instructions on how to collect it. It should only take a few minutes. While we’re waiting for the results, let’s talk about some things you can do at home to potentially alleviate your symptoms. Have you tried increasing your fluid intake?
PATIENT: Yes, I have actually. I've been trying to drink more water, especially since this started. I usually have at least eight glasses a day, maybe more. It doesn't seem to make a huge difference, but I figured it couldn't hurt. It sometimes feels like it makes it worse, actually. I'm drinking more, but I'm going to the bathroom more frequently, and it doesn't necessarily relieve the pressure completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, increasing fluids hasn’t been as helpful as you’d hoped. That’s good to know. And you mentioned caffeine makes it worse… have you tried reducing or eliminating caffeine from your diet altogether?
PATIENT: I have cut back a little, but I do enjoy my morning coffee. I’ve tried switching to decaf a few times, but it’s just not the same. I’ve reduced it to about one cup a day, but I haven’t completely eliminated it yet. Perhaps I should try that next? I do rely on it to wake me up in the mornings.
DOCTOR: It’s definitely a lifestyle change, and it’s okay to take it slowly. Eliminating caffeine completely might help, but we can discuss it further once we have the urinalysis results. In the meantime, avoid bladder irritants like alcohol, spicy foods, and citrus fruits. It might also be helpful to practice pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, to strengthen your bladder muscles. Are you familiar with those?
PATIENT: I’ve heard of Kegel exercises, but I’ve never actually tried them. I think I read something about them online once, but I’m not entirely sure how to do them correctly. Is there a way you could explain them to me, or perhaps give me a handout with instructions? I'm willing to try anything to get some relief.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Kegel exercises involve squeezing the muscles you use to stop the flow of urine. Imagine you're trying to stop yourself from urinating, and squeeze those muscles. Hold for a few seconds, then relax. You should be able to do this without engaging your abdominal or buttock muscles. Start with 10-15 repetitions, three times a day. It might take a little practice to get it right. I’ll have the nurse bring you a handout with detailed instructions. We’ll see what the urinalysis shows, and then we can discuss further steps. If the urinalysis is normal, and your symptoms persist, we may consider a referral to a urologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds very reasonable, Dr. Beinborn. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. A referral to a urologist if needed is good to know. I'm happy to start with the Kegel exercises and see if they help. I’ll definitely ask the nurse for the handout. Thank you again for your time and your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. I'm glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to collect a urine sample and give you the handout. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, flank pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the office immediately. Otherwise, we’ll follow up once we have the lab results. Do you have any questions for me before I go?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Dr. Beinborn. I don't have any further questions at the moment. I feel much better informed and less anxious now. Thank you again for your excellent care. I will contact the office if anything changes.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. Have a good day, Marialena.
