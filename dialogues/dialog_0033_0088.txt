DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Dhanoa, let's get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, hi Doctor. It’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been… annoying me for a bit now. It’s like a high-pitched whine, mostly. Just wanted to see if there’s something wrong with it. I’d like to get this sorted quickly if possible, if that's alright?
DOCTOR: Annoying, yes. Vague complaint, though. “A bit now” isn’t particularly helpful. How long exactly has this “ringing” been going on?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. You're right. Um… about three weeks, I think? Maybe a little longer. It started after I was at a wedding, actually. There was a really loud band, and I was standing pretty close to the speakers. It wasn't painfully loud, but… you know, a wedding. It just hasn’t gone away since.
DOCTOR: So, noise exposure. Predictable. And has it been constant for three weeks, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yeah. It's worse at night, when it’s quiet. During the day, with all the noise at work, I barely notice it. But when I'm trying to sleep… that's when it really gets to me. It keeps me awake sometimes. It’s a pretty constant whine when I try to focus, too, even if it’s quiet. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s…slightly more specific, I suppose. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, no. No pain, no dizziness, nothing like that. Just… the ringing. Sometimes I feel a bit… stressed about it, if I’m honest. Like, I’m worried it’s something serious, you know? But other than that, I feel okay. I haven’t noticed any changes to my hearing, either. I can still hear everything fine.
DOCTOR: Stress doesn’t cause tinnitus, Mr. Dhanoa. It merely exacerbates it. Let’s have a quick look in your ears. Please sit up. I need to rule out any obvious causes.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable or anything. I’m a bit sensitive, haha.
DOCTOR: Tympanic membranes are clear bilaterally. No cerumen impaction. No signs of infection or structural abnormalities. Right. As I suspected. It's likely just noise-induced tinnitus.
PATIENT: Noise-induced? So… is that bad? Is there anything I can do about it? I really need to be able to sleep, and I can’t really afford to miss work because of this. I’m a waiter, you know? I need to be on my feet.
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, but it's also not immediately life-threatening. It means prolonged exposure to loud noises has likely caused some damage to the hair cells in your inner ear. There's no cure, unfortunately. We manage it. Avoid loud noises where possible. Consider earplugs when you have to be in them. There are sound therapies you can try, white noise machines, that sort of thing. I can give you a handout.
PATIENT: A handout would be great, thanks. So… no way to fix it completely? Even if I just… rest my ears for a while? I mean, I can try to avoid loud places, but it’s hard when you’re working. And weddings, you know? They happen. Is there… anything else? Like, medication or something?
DOCTOR: There are no medications proven to reliably cure tinnitus, Mr. Dhanoa. Some antidepressants can help with the associated anxiety, but they come with their own set of issues. Honestly, most people learn to live with it. I can refer you to an audiologist if you'd like, but they'll likely tell you the same thing: noise avoidance and coping strategies. I'm going to print you that handout now. Do you have any other complaints, or can we be finished?
PATIENT: No, I think that's it. Just… the ringing. And trying to figure out how to deal with it. Okay, yeah, the handout is fine. Thanks, Doctor. I guess I’ll just… try to avoid loud noises. Hopefully it gets better on its own. I appreciate you taking the time. .
DOCTOR: Right. Well, good luck. Avoid loud noises. And don't come back unless it’s something serious. .
