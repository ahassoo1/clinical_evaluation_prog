DOCTOR: Hi Dawnetta, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven’t got all day. It's my stool, alright? It's… dark. Black. And I take these pills, you know, for the arthritis. Been taking ‘em for years. Not thrilled about this whole thing, but what can you do? It’s probably those pills, isn’t it? They always mess something up.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark, black stools and you're taking medication for arthritis. I understand you’re concerned it might be related to those pills, and you’re short on time, so let’s try to be efficient. To be sure, can you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed the change in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… hmm. A few days, I suppose. Maybe four? It wasn't sudden, you understand. Just… gradually got darker. I don't sit around examining my… waste, if you catch my drift. It's not something a lady does. But I noticed it when I went to the bathroom, and it bothered me, so I paid attention. Is that good enough? I really need to get back to my garden. The tomatoes won't weed themselves.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly good enough, Dawnetta. Four days of gradually darkening stools. Okay. And has there been any change in the amount of stool you’re passing?
PATIENT: No, not really. Same as always, I suppose. Regular, if you want to know. Always have been. It’s the color that’s the issue, not the… volume. Honestly, are we getting anywhere with this? I’m starting to feel a bit silly talking about all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, regular bowel movements, just a change in color. No other changes. Right. Now, I need to ask a few more questions, and then I’ll need to do a quick exam. Have you noticed any blood in your stool at all?
PATIENT: Blood? Good heavens, no! I would know if there was blood. That would be… alarming. No, no blood. Definitely not. Look, I’ve lived seventy-three years, alright? I know what blood looks like. It’s not a delicate color, let me tell you. This is just… dark. Like coffee grounds, maybe? Though I haven’t had coffee in ages. Is that what it means? Is it the pills? Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood. Dark, like coffee grounds. It could be the pills, yes, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Just to be thorough. Now, have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. You’re asking a lot of questions, aren't you? Pain? A little. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, you know? My stomach grumbles sometimes, like everyone's does. Nausea? Not really. Maybe a bit queasy after I eat something rich, but that’s it. Vomiting? No. I haven't thrown up in… well, I can’t remember the last time. Really, Doctor, I'm a practical woman. If it was serious, I’d know. This is probably just the pills, and I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Okay, some mild abdominal discomfort, no nausea or vomiting. Right. And just to clarify your medications, what specifically are you taking for your arthritis?
PATIENT: It's… Naproxen, I think? That’s it. A little white pill. Two of them, twice a day. My husband gets them for me, so I don't pay much attention. He handles all that. He's a good man, very organized. But yes, Naproxen. Been on it for years, like I said. And it's probably the culprit, isn't it? This is what I’ve been telling you. Can we just get this over with? I have a rose bush that needs pruning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen twice a day for years. We’ll look into that. Just to be complete, have you noticed any fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath lately?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Fatigue? Of course I'm fatigued! I'm seventy-three years old! I get tired just walking to the mailbox. Weakness? Well, I don’t lift heavy things anymore. Shortness of breath? A little when I climb the stairs, but that’s just… age. You’re asking me if I’m falling apart, aren’t you? I’m a perfectly functional woman! This is ridiculous. Can we please get to the point? Is it the pills or not? I need to know if I should be worried, or if I can just keep gardening.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. And I apologize if my questions seem excessive, but it’s important to rule things out. Now, let’s do a quick exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check your vital signs. It’ll just take a few minutes. Then we can discuss possible causes and a plan. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, I have better things to do than sit here being poked and prodded. But hurry, please. My tomatoes are waiting. And don’t tell me it’s something dreadful, alright? I don’t have time for that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta, take a deep breath for me. And again. Good. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, though a bit diminished. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and your respiratory rate is 16. Oxygen saturation is 96%. Now, diminished bowel sounds could be related to the Naproxen, or something else. I'm going to order a stool test to check for occult blood and rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Occult blood? You mean blood I can't see? Honestly, this is getting more and more complicated. Fine, alright. Do the test. But if it's just the pills, I'm going to be very cross. My husband will hear about this. He always says I worry too much, but I knew something was off. So, what do I do? Do I stop taking the pills? I don’t want my arthritis flaring up. And where do I… go to do this test? Is it far? I don't drive anymore. This is a whole ordeal.
DOCTOR: Okay, a stool test for occult blood. It’s a fairly simple procedure, Dawnetta. We’ll provide you with a kit here at the clinic, with instructions. You’ll collect a small sample at home and bring it back to us tomorrow. In the meantime, do not stop taking your Naproxen. Stopping suddenly could cause problems. We need to see what the test results show first. We will also review your medication list in more detail, just to be certain there aren't any other interactions. While we wait for the results, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and eating a balanced diet. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. A kit. Tomorrow. No stopping the pills. I suppose that’s… sensible. Honestly, it's a lot of fuss over a bit of dark stool. But alright. I’ll do it. Just please don’t tell me it's something dreadful. I have a garden to tend to, and I haven't got time for serious illnesses. Now, can I go? I really need to get back home. My tomatoes are waiting, and my husband will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. Here's the kit, and the instructions are inside. We'll call you tomorrow with the results. Please don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns. And please, try not to worry too much. We're just being thorough. You can go now. Get back to your garden. And enjoy your tomatoes. It was nice meeting you.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Thank you, I suppose. Though I still think it's probably just the pills. Tomatoes… honestly.
