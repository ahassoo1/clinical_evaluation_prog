DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… concerning, really. I have these patches on my skin. Not a pleasant sight at all, I assure you. It’s just… discolored. And I’d like to know what it is.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I understand your concern; any change in skin appearance warrants investigation. “Discolored” is a good starting point. Could you describe these patches for me?
PATIENT: Oh, really? What else would I be here for? They're… different shades. Some are a bit reddish, others are almost… greyish. And they're not raised, thankfully. Flat, mostly. Though one on my arm feels a little… rough. It’s quite unsightly, honestly. They just appeared, you know? A few weeks ago, perhaps. Not a gradual thing. Just… there.
DOCTOR: I apologize; I didn’t mean to ask a redundant question. It’s important for me to build a complete picture, and sometimes details that seem obvious to you are helpful for me. "Just there," you say… that’s useful information. And you’ve noticed them for a few weeks now. Could you tell me where on your body these patches are located?
PATIENT: Well, let's see. There's one on my left forearm, as I mentioned. And another… yes, two on my right hand, the back of it. A small one on my neck, right at the hairline – very inconvenient, that one. Oh, and a couple on my abdomen, lower down, of course. Not all over, thankfully. Just… strategically placed, so to speak. It's quite bothersome. I haven't noticed any itching or pain, if you were wondering.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Ms. Bartock. That is very helpful. And no itching or pain, good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, may I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, must we? Very well. Get on with it, then. I suppose it's necessary. But I generally keep excellent health, if you’re wondering. I'm quite fastidious about things, you see. Medicare covers everything, thankfully. Though, to be honest, I rarely need to use it.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Bartock. Knowing you generally enjoy good health is very reassuring. And it’s good to know you have Medicare coverage. Let’s start with past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Absolutely not. I’ve never had a day’s illness in my life, practically. My mother always said I had a constitution of iron. I eat very well, you know. Mostly Ukrainian cuisine, of course. Very healthy. None of those… American processed foods for me. No, no chronic conditions whatsoever. I can assure you of that. Though… my husband, bless his heart, he had some trouble with his cholesterol a few years back. But that’s neither here nor there, is it?
DOCTOR: Certainly not. That's good to know. No personal history of chronic conditions is very helpful. And thank you for mentioning your husband’s cholesterol; family history can be relevant. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single surgery. And I’ve only been to the hospital once, when I was a child, with a rather nasty bout of chickenpox. But that was… oh, sixty years ago, practically! A different world entirely. No, I've never required hospitalization as an adult. I take very good care of myself, you see. Preventative measures are key. I wouldn't dream of risking anything like that.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Bartock. No surgeries or hospitalizations is excellent. Now, may I ask about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really, Doctor? I live in the countryside! One must build up an immunity to something. No, I have no allergies. None whatsoever. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to dust, but that’s hardly an allergy. My grandmother always said fresh air cures everything. I certainly don't go around with a list of things I can't tolerate. It's simply… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Ms. Bartock. It's good to know you have no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness no. I don't believe in poisoning my body with all those… chemicals. I get everything I need from my diet. A little bit of garlic, perhaps, for general health. And my husband sometimes gives me a multivitamin, but honestly, I doubt it does much good. I prefer natural remedies, you see. Fresh herbs, a bit of honey… that sort of thing. I haven’t taken a prescription medication in… well, I can’t even remember. It's all rather unnecessary, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Bartock. No medications, vitamins, or supplements currently. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, may I ask about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Must we delve into all of that? Very well. My mother lived to be 87, thankfully. A very strong woman. She died peacefully in her sleep. My father… he had a bit of trouble with his heart later in life, but that was probably all the smoking. And my brother… well, he's perfectly healthy, as far as I know. A bit of a recluse, really. He lives in Kyiv. Not much contact these days, unfortunately. No history of… skin problems, if you were wondering. Nothing untoward, thankfully. Though, my great-aunt on my mother’s side… she had a rather large mole. But that was generations ago! Is this really necessary, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Bartock. That information is helpful. No known family history of skin problems is reassuring. And it's good to know about your great-aunt; sometimes distant relatives can offer clues. Now, would you mind if I performed a physical examination?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be gentle. I have rather sensitive skin, you know. And do try to be quick about it. I have a luncheon engagement later.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bartock. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. Alright, let’s start with your forearm. The patches here are approximately 1-2 centimeters in diameter. They are flat, as you mentioned, and slightly rough to the touch. The color is a reddish-brown hue, with some areas of lighter pigmentation. There's no warmth or tenderness to the touch. Now, let’s examine the patches on the back of your hand. The patches on your hand are similar in size and appearance to those on your forearm. However, there's a slight scaling present on one of the patches. I will also quickly examine the patches on your neck and abdomen. The patch on your neck is small, approximately 0.5 centimeters in diameter, and slightly raised. The patches on your abdomen are flat and reddish in color. No other abnormalities noted. Overall, the patches appear to be localized and non-inflammatory. However, I would like to order some laboratory tests to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Laboratory tests? Really, Doctor? Must we go to such lengths? I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. But… very well. If it will put my mind at ease, I suppose. Though I highly doubt anything will come of it. What sort of tests are we talking about, exactly? And will they be… painful? I do have a low tolerance for needles, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Bartock. It's simply a precautionary measure. We will start with a complete blood count to assess your overall health and rule out any signs of infection or inflammation. We will also order a skin biopsy to examine the patches under a microscope and determine the exact cause. The CBC involves a simple blood draw, which may cause a brief pinch. The skin biopsy involves removing a small sample of skin, which may cause some mild discomfort. We will use a local anesthetic to minimize any pain. The procedure is generally well-tolerated. Would you like me to explain the results of these tests in detail once they are available?
PATIENT: A skin biopsy? Oh, dear. Well, if it must be done… but please be quick about it, Doctor. And make sure it’s a very small sample. I don’t want a gaping hole in my skin. And yes, do explain the results to me, in plain English, please. None of that medical jargon. I haven't the slightest idea what "inflammation" even means, frankly. And how long will all of this take? I really mustn't be late for my luncheon. It’s with the Ladies’ Auxiliary, you see, and Agatha is very particular about punctuality.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Bartock, the skin biopsy will be as quick and minimally invasive as possible. We will only take a very small sample of skin, and the area will be numbed with local anesthetic beforehand. It will be a small procedure, and we will take great care to minimize any discomfort. The results of the tests typically take 5-7 business days to come back. Once they are available, I will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. I will ensure to explain everything in plain English, avoiding any medical jargon. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid scratching or rubbing the patches, and to keep the area clean and dry. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… please don't keep me waiting too long for the results. And be gentle with the biopsy, alright? I have sensitive skin, you know. And I do hope it isn't anything serious. Agatha would be horrified if I had to cancel the luncheon. Very well, then. Let’s get it over with. Where do we begin?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Bartock. I understand your concerns, and I will do everything I can to ensure your comfort. Alright, Ms. Bartock, we'll start with the patch on your forearm. This may feel like a slight pinch, but it should be relatively painless. I will let you know when I'm about to begin. There we go. That's all done. Now, let’s move on to the patch on your hand. And that's all done. Please keep the bandages clean and dry for the next 24 hours. You may experience some mild discomfort or redness, but this should subside within a few days. I will now provide you with a written set of instructions outlining the aftercare for the biopsies. Do you have any questions about the procedure or the aftercare?
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t pleasant. But I suppose it’s over now. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… keep it clean, keep it dry, and don’t bother Agatha. Is that right? And how will I get the results? Will I have to come back here? I really do hope it’s nothing serious. Honestly, I haven't a clue what could be causing this. Perhaps it's the humidity? It's been dreadfully humid lately. Very well, then. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I'll see you in a week or so. Do try to be prompt. I have a rather busy schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Bartock, that is correct. Keep the area clean and dry. And avoid scratching or rubbing it. The results will be sent to me within 5-7 business days. I will then contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you. I understand your concerns about the cause of the patches, and we will determine the exact cause once the results are available. I will do my best to be prompt with the scheduling of your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Honestly, I’m rather relieved it’s over. I do hope it’s nothing too dreadful. Very well, then. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you… I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bartock. I hope you have a pleasant rest of your day and a wonderful luncheon. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. .
