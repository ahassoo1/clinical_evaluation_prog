DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. So, tell me… what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… well, it’s my chest. Hurts when I… when I take a big breath. Not all the time, just when I… try to. It’s been… a little while now, I guess. I don’t really keep track of dates anymore.
DOCTOR: A little while… yes. Well, "a little while" isn't terribly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. It’s… hard to remember. Maybe a few months? Longer? Everything just… blends together these days. I just know it bothers me when I try to do things, like… lift stuff. Or walk up the stairs. It’s a sharp pain, right here.
DOCTOR: Right here… yes. Could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… It's… in the middle, sort of. Not on the side. And not… down low. Just… in the center. It feels like… a tight squeeze, when I breathe. Like something is blocking the air. But it comes and goes. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. A central chest pain that’s worse with exertion, comes and goes… and feels like a tightness. Do you have any trouble breathing at rest?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can breathe fine when I’m just… sitting. It’s only when I try to do something. Like… I was trying to help my daughter with some boxes last week, and that's when it really flared up. Made me stop. I just slowed down, and it went away after a bit. I don't know. I just want to be able to… do things, you know?
DOCTOR: And this pain... does it radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate? Does it… spread? I don't know. I mostly just feel it right here. Maybe… a little in my back sometimes? But I have bad back too, so I don’t know if it’s the same thing. It's hard to tell, really. Everything aches when you get old, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Indeed. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I get… tired easily, but I’m old! I used to be able to work all day, building things. Now, I get winded just walking to the mailbox. And… my legs swell up sometimes, at the end of the day. But I always figured that was just from being on my feet. Does that mean anything?
DOCTOR: Swelling in the legs, fatigue… alright. Have you had a cough recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, a little. Just a tickle in my throat, mostly. I’ve had it on and off for a few weeks. Not a bad cough, just… annoying. Old man cough, I call it. It doesn't bother me much. Nothing like when I had pneumonia, years ago. That was a bad one!
DOCTOR: Pneumonia… when was that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time ago. Must have been… twenty years? Maybe more? It was when my… my wife was still alive. Before the divorce, of course. Everything gets mixed up. I just remember being very sick, in the hospital. That’s all. A long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Let’s have a listen to your lungs. And I’m going to want to check your blood pressure and feel your legs. Just routine. If you could just sit up for me.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you need, doctor. Just… try to be quick, okay? I have things to do. My daughter is expecting me to help her with the garden later. If I'm not careful, she’ll do all the work herself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Yes. Your lungs sound a little… congested. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, 150 over 85. And there is some swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. I don't take much, really. Just… a little something for my arthritis now and then. Ibuprofen, I think. The over-the-counter kind. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I just try to tough things out, you know? Is it something serious, doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, "toughing things out" isn't always the best strategy, Mr. Ruocco. Especially when you’re eighty years old. Given your symptoms - the chest pain, the fatigue, the swelling, and the congested lungs - it could be a number of things. It could be a simple exacerbation of arthritis, or it could be something more concerning, like congestive heart failure or even pneumonia. We need to rule things out. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a blood test. The blood test will check your kidney function and rule out infection. We'll also check your BNP level which can indicate heart failure. And I’ll want an EKG to look at your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Oh. X-ray? Blood tests? That sounds… complicated. And expensive. I don't have insurance, doctor. I just… I can’t really afford all that. Is it really necessary? Maybe I just need some rest? I can take it easy for a few days, and see if it gets better.
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruocco, I understand your concerns about cost, but we cannot simply ignore these symptoms. Ignoring them could lead to a much more serious situation, one that will be far more expensive to treat. There are some programs available to assist with the cost of care for uninsured patients. I will have my nurse, Susan, speak with you about those options after your tests. In the meantime, we need to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Susan will schedule the tests for you. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. Just… please try to make it quick, okay? I really don’t like being poked and prodded. And I need to get back to my daughter. If you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll just sit here and wait for Susan. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Susan will be with you shortly.
