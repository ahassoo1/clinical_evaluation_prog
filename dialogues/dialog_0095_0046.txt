DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been having some… well, pressure on my bladder. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to become quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bladder pressure… and how long is “a little while” exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It really started becoming noticeable around the beginning of June, so maybe… two months? It wasn’t constant at first, just now and then, but it’s definitely more frequent these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, two months. And would you describe it as pain, or more of a feeling of fullness, or something else?
PATIENT: It’s not exactly pain, Doctor. More like… a heavy feeling, like I need to go all the time, even when I don’t really have to. It's uncomfortable, and it distracts me, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy feeling and the frequent urge to urinate, even without much urine. Do you find yourself waking up at night to use the restroom more often than usual?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I used to sleep right through, but now I've been getting up at least once, sometimes twice, during the night to go to the bathroom. It's making me quite tired, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any change in your urine itself?
PATIENT: No, not that I've observed. It looks normal, the usual color, no blood or anything like that. I haven't noticed a strong odor either. It just... is. Sorry, that's probably not very helpful.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or sides?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those things. No fever, no chills, and my back feels perfectly normal. It really is just this pressure and needing to go so often. I was hoping you could tell me what might be causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, have you had any recent changes in your diet or fluid intake?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've been drinking about the same amount of water as usual – I try to stay hydrated, you know? And my diet hasn't changed significantly either. I haven’t been consuming more caffeine or anything like that. I do drink a glass of orange juice with breakfast most days, but I’ve been doing that for years.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I'm generally quite healthy. I do have Medicare, as I'm getting older, but I haven't been diagnosed with anything major. My husband handles most of the paperwork, and I haven't had any concerning issues come up on my statements lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any regular medications. Just over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally for a headache. And… let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, a very long time ago, but that's it. No other surgeries or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. No food allergies, no reactions to any medicines… nothing like that. I used to worry about bee stings as a child, but I've never actually been stung.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, a couple of slightly more personal questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any pain during intercourse?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That's… a bit awkward, Doctor. No, not really. It's not painful, but sometimes it feels… uncomfortable, I suppose. Like there's a bit of pressure, but it's not sharp or anything. It's not something I've brought up before, if that makes sense. It's more of a mild annoyance.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. And finally, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am married and we are active. It's… been a little less frequent lately, to be honest, mostly because I've been feeling tired from having to get up at night, and a little self-conscious about the pressure. It's just… not as enjoyable when I'm worrying about things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for answering all of those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll need to check your abdomen and do a quick pelvic exam. This will help me rule out some potential causes. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. I just want to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh. Let's start with your abdomen. Just lie back on the examination table, and I’m going to gently press on different areas of your stomach. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. First, I’ll start on your lower abdomen. Tell me if anything feels unusual… Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. Just feels… normal, I suppose. A little pressure, but not uncomfortable. Like you said, just the usual feeling of needing to go, if anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about here, slightly to the right?
PATIENT: No, still nothing. No pain. It feels… firm, maybe? But not in a bad way. Honestly, it’s hard to describe. It doesn’t hurt or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And on your left side?
PATIENT: No, still nothing painful there either. It feels about the same as the other side, honestly. I'm starting to feel a little silly here, Doctor, because it doesn’t feel like anything is wrong, but I’m glad you’re checking.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. … Everything sounds normal there. Alright, now I’m going to need to do a quick pelvic exam. I’ll explain everything as I go. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright, Doctor. Please do. I appreciate you explaining things. I just want this resolved.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to gently insert this instrument to get a better look at your cervix. You might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. … Everything looks normal there. No obvious signs of infection or inflammation. Now, I'm going to do a quick bimanual exam to check your uterus and ovaries. … Everything feels normal. No tenderness or masses. Okay, that’s all done. Everything feels normal to me. I don't feel any obvious abnormalities. However, given your symptoms, I think it's best to order a urine analysis and a urine culture to rule out a urinary tract infection, and potentially a blood test to check your kidney function. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A urine analysis and culture seems sensible. And the blood test too, if that’s what you recommend. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. Thank you for being thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we can collect a urine sample before you leave. She'll give you a cup and instructions. I also want to rule out other possibilities. Given your age and symptoms, and to be completely sure, I’m going to recommend a pelvic ultrasound. It’s a non-invasive imaging test that will give us a detailed look at your bladder, uterus and ovaries. Would you be able to schedule that with the front desk?
PATIENT: Yes, I can certainly schedule the ultrasound. A detailed look sounds good, if it will help. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best, Doctor. So, the urine sample and the ultrasound, and then we wait for the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. The urine sample will give us a quick indication of whether you have an infection, and the ultrasound will provide more detailed information. Once we have those results, we can discuss the next steps. I’ll also give you a prescription for a mild pain reliever in the meantime, just to help manage any discomfort. I’ll print out the lab requests and the prescription for you now. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood pressure and go over the post-exam instructions with you. Do you have any questions for me before I finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough and explained everything clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and investigate this properly. I feel much more reassured now, even though we haven’t gotten the results yet. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s good to hear. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease a little. We'll get to the bottom of this. Here are your lab requests and the prescription. Please let the nurse know if you have any questions. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Creagh. We'll be in touch with the results as soon as they're available. .
