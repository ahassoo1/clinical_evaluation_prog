DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me see... It's this… needing to go to the bathroom quite a bit, actually. More than usual, I think. It’s been… a little while now, this has been going on. I don't quite recall when it started, precisely. Perhaps a few weeks? It's just… frequent urination, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. Frequent urination. And you estimate this has been occurring for a few weeks now?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks, I believe. Though, honestly, time… it seems to slip away these days. I wouldn’t want to give you a precise date and be incorrect. It’s not painful, not at all. Just… inconvenient. And I find myself… drinking quite a lot to compensate, I suppose. It's a bit of a cycle, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, a cycle of increased frequency and increased fluid intake. That’s helpful to know. Are you noticing this happening more at night, requiring you to get up to urinate, or is it mostly during the day?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. It’s… both, I think. Though, yes, more at night, perhaps. I used to sleep right through, you see, but now… I’m up once, sometimes twice. It doesn’t leave one feeling terribly rested, if I’m being honest. It’s not terrible, but noticeable. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Verbos. Any change in your sleep is certainly worth discussing. Now, besides the increased frequency and nighttime awakenings, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. No… I don’t believe so. No pain, no fever, no… unusual color, I suppose. My appetite is normal, and I’ve not lost any weight, that I’m aware of. Everything feels relatively normal, aside from this… bathroom business, of course. I sometimes feel a little… thirsty, naturally, given the drinking. But nothing dramatic.
DOCTOR: Good. No fever, no changes in appetite or weight, and no unusual color to your urine. That’s all helpful information. Now, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: My past medical history… That’s a rather broad question, Doctor. I try to stay healthy, you see. I’ve not been a frequent visitor to doctors, thankfully. I believe I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. As an older gentleman, I've had the usual… aches and pains, arthritis in the knees, nothing that required extensive treatment. I have Medicare, of course. I… I don’t recall any major surgeries or anything of that nature. I’m a bit vague on details, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. We’ll work with what you recall. No major surgeries, typical childhood illnesses, and arthritis in the knees. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, or has a doctor ever mentioned you having high blood sugar?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. No, I don’t believe so. No one has ever mentioned that to me, not directly. I do recall… a distant cousin, on my mother’s side, had something similar. But that was a long time ago, and I wasn't terribly close to her. I eat a reasonable diet, mostly. I enjoy my dumplings, of course, being Czech, but I try to balance it out. I don’t drink excessively, either. I really don’t think it’s diabetes.
DOCTOR: Alright, no personal history of diabetes, and a distant family history. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. Just a little something for the arthritis in my knees, a small white pill. I believe it’s… naproxen, is that correct? And… occasionally, if I'm having trouble sleeping, I might take a mild over-the-counter sleep aid. Nothing regular, only when absolutely necessary. Other than that, no. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Naproxen for arthritis and an occasional sleep aid. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, such as food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I am aware of. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat most anything, and I haven’t noticed any particular reactions to… pollen, dust, or anything like that. My skin can be a bit sensitive in the winter, but that’s simply dryness, I believe. Nothing a little lotion can’t handle. I don’t recall ever having a serious allergic reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Now, Mr. Verbos, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. This will include checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. I’ll also do a quick abdominal exam and, if you’re comfortable, a prostate exam. This is a standard part of evaluating frequent urination in men your age. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical examination sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I… a prostate exam, you say? Well, if it’s standard procedure, then yes, I suppose so. I confess, I'm not terribly fond of medical examinations, but if it’s necessary for a diagnosis, then please proceed. Just… be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbos. I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie down on the examination table, and we’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning at this time. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses are palpated. Now, if you are comfortable, we will proceed with the prostate exam. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but it is smooth and symmetrical. There is no tenderness. Alright, Mr. Verbos, the physical exam is complete. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the exam, I suspect your frequent urination may be related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a common condition in men your age. It occurs when the prostate gland enlarges, putting pressure on the bladder and urethra. However, to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a urine test to check for infection, and a PSA test to measure the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, BPH… that sounds… complicated. An enlarged prostate, you say? Well, if that's a common condition, I suppose it's not terribly surprising. A urine test and a PSA test… yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever is necessary to determine the cause, Doctor, I am agreeable. Though, I confess, all this talk of prostates is rather… unsettling. But if it's common, as you say, then I trust your judgment. Yes, please proceed with the tests.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbos. It’s common, and often manageable. We’ll get the tests ordered right away. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will be in shortly to collect a sample and draw your blood. While we wait for the results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake during the day, but limiting fluids in the evening to reduce nighttime awakenings. Also, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Are you able to manage these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, those seem quite reasonable. More water during the day, less before bed. No caffeine, no alcohol… I can certainly manage that. I don't drink excessively, to begin with, so limiting those won’t be a hardship. Perhaps I'll have a glass of chamomile tea instead of my evening coffee. It's good to know there are simple steps I can take in the meantime. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Small changes can often make a big difference. We’ll review the test results as soon as they come back, and then we can discuss the best course of treatment, which may include medication or lifestyle modifications. The nurse will be in shortly, and I’ll give her a copy of the lab order. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Verbos?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything for now. You’ve been most thorough, and I appreciate your patience with my… vagueness. I trust your judgment, and I’m grateful for your help in figuring this out. I’ll see the nurse, and we’ll get these tests done. Thank you again. .
