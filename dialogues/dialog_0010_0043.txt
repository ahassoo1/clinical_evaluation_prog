DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. I’ve been having this headache, right in the back of my head… the occipital part, I think my daughter called it. It’s been bothering me for a few weeks now, on and off. It's not the worst pain, but it’s… persistent, you know? Like a dull ache that just won’t quite go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a persistent headache in the back of your head for a few weeks. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts in the afternoon, and it feels… tight. Like a band squeezing my head. Sometimes it spreads down my neck a little, too. I've tried taking some over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen, mostly – and those help take the edge off for a bit, but it always comes back. It doesn’t really interfere with my work, thankfully, but it’s just… annoying. I like to stay busy, you see, and this just makes it harder to focus. I work as a financial advisor, so gotta keep my wits about me!
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's a tight, band-like sensation, mostly in the afternoon, radiating to the neck. Ibuprofen provides some relief, but it's temporary. And it doesn’t interfere with your work as a financial advisor. Good to know you’re still able to focus. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. Let me think… I don't think so, not really. I mean, nothing obvious. I’ve been trying to pay attention, but it doesn’t seem to be related to what I’m eating, or how much sleep I’m getting. I used to think maybe it was the computer screen, but I spend all day looking at one for work, and it doesn't happen every time. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not. Honestly, I'm a bit puzzled myself. I don't do much strenuous activity, so it's not like it's from that, either. I mostly just sit and talk with people all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no obvious triggers related to diet, sleep, computer use, or activity level. That's helpful. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this a new experience?
PATIENT: This is… new, I think. I get the occasional tension headache, you know, when I'm stressed about something with a client, but those are usually gone pretty quickly with a little rest and some ibuprofen. This one is… different. It’s more constant, even if it’s just a dull ache. It doesn't feel like the same kind of pain. And it lasts longer. I’m 84 years old, Doctor, I’ve had my share of aches and pains, but this is one I haven’t really experienced before. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gibbel. It’s good you’re paying attention to changes. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me see… no fever, no dizziness. My vision seems okay, I haven't noticed any blurry spots or anything like that. No nausea, thankfully. I haven’t felt any weakness or numbness in my arms or legs, either. I suppose… maybe a little bit of fatigue lately, but I figured that was just from getting older, you know? I've been a little more tired than usual, but nothing drastic. My daughter keeps telling me I need to slow down, but… well, that's another story! Mostly, it’s just the headache. Nothing else really stands out.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, dizziness, vision changes, nausea, weakness, or numbness. A little fatigue, but you attribute that to age. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been pretty well managed with medication for years now. I don’t see the doctor too often, to be honest. I used to have some arthritis in my knees, but that hasn’t bothered me much lately. Other than that… not much. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I had a surgery on my hip about ten years ago, but that healed up fine. I don't really have any allergies that I know of, and I'm not taking any medications other than the blood pressure pills. I take those every morning, religiously!
DOCTOR: Okay, well-managed hypertension, a history of arthritis in the knees, and a hip surgery ten years ago. No known allergies, and you’re currently taking medication for blood pressure. Do you know the name of the medication you are taking?
PATIENT: Let me think… my daughter helps me with refilling the prescriptions, so I don't always remember the names. I think it's… Lisinopril? Yes, that sounds right. Lisinopril. I take 10 milligrams every morning. She always makes sure I have enough, and reminds me to take it. I'm not the best at remembering those things these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. Good. Now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… my mother had high blood pressure, like me. She lived to be 88, so I guess it didn't bother her too much. My father had some heart trouble later in life, but I don't remember the specifics. My sister had diabetes, but she passed away a few years ago. Other than that… not much that I can think of. No history of headaches or anything like that on either side of the family, as far as I know. We weren't really ones to talk about medical stuff much when I was growing up. It was more of a "tough it out" kind of attitude.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of hypertension, heart trouble, and diabetes. No known history of headaches. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she used to smoke a little, when we were younger, but she quit years ago. I always told her it was a bad habit, and thankfully, she listened. We both valued our health, as much as we could. It's just… getting older brings on enough problems without adding smoking to the list.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: I used to, a little. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, mostly on special occasions. But I haven't had a drink in… oh, probably five or six years now. My doctor suggested I cut back, and honestly, I didn't really miss it. It didn't bother me much. I found I sleep better without it, and I don't really enjoy the taste anymore. It's just not something I think about much these days. I prefer a nice cup of tea, if you want to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, you used to drink alcohol occasionally but stopped five or six years ago. And finally, do you have any questions for me before we move on to a physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not right now, Doctor. You’ve asked me a lot of good questions. I feel like you’ve got a pretty good understanding of what’s going on. I'm just hoping you can figure out what’s causing this headache. I'm ready for the exam whenever you are. I trust your judgment, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's good to know someone is paying attention.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mr. Gibbel, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature first, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll take a look at your eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and do a neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'll just sit here and relax. Let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, and your lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are normal, and I don't detect any weakness or numbness. Now, I’m going to take a look at your eyes, ears, nose, and throat.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Take your time, Doctor. I'm not in any particular rush. I'm just glad to be getting this checked out.
DOCTOR: Everything looks normal so far, Mr. Gibbel. No signs of infection or inflammation in your eyes, ears, nose, or throat. Now, let me palpate your neck. Your neck feels normal, no swelling or tenderness. Finally, I'm going to check your range of motion. You have a little stiffness in your neck, but no pain with movement.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to hear. So, what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious? The stiffness… I do feel a little achy sometimes, but I figured that was just from sleeping in a bad position.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Gibbel, based on the exam, everything appears generally normal. The neurological exam was normal, and there are no signs of infection. The mild stiffness in your neck could be contributing to the headache, but it’s not severe. Given your age and the fact that you've had this headache for a few weeks, I suspect this could be a tension headache, possibly related to muscle strain in your neck. However, given your blood pressure reading today and to be thorough, I want to rule out any other potential causes. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to check your overall health and kidney function. We should also check your thyroid stimulating hormone level just to make sure your thyroid is functioning properly. Finally, I think it would be wise to do a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural issues. It's likely nothing serious, but it’s always best to be cautious. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is that really necessary, Doctor? I mean, I feel okay, aside from the headache. And I'm 84 years old, you know? Is it going to be difficult for me? I don’t want to go through a lot of trouble if it's probably just a muscle strain. The blood tests sound reasonable, but the scan… that worries me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gibbel. It’s perfectly reasonable to be worried about a CT scan. Let me explain why I’m recommending it. At your age, and with a persistent headache that hasn't improved, we need to rule out any less common but potentially serious causes, such as a small bleed or a structural abnormality. It’s a precautionary measure, and we’re not necessarily expecting to find anything. The scan itself is very quick and relatively painless. You’ll lie on a table, and a machine will take images of your head. There is some radiation involved, but the amount is minimal and the benefits of ruling out serious causes outweigh the risks in this situation. If you're truly uncomfortable with the scan, we can discuss alternative approaches, but I strongly advise it to ensure we’re not missing anything. We could try physical therapy and stronger pain medication, but if the headache persists, we would need to revisit the possibility of imaging eventually. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a lot to take in. I suppose if you really think it's necessary, Doctor, I'll trust your judgment. I don't want to ignore something serious, even if it’s unlikely. But… could we do the blood tests first? See what those show before we jump to the scan? Maybe that will give us a better idea of what’s going on. I'd feel a little better if we took it one step at a time. And… is there anything I can do to prepare for the scan, if we do end up doing it?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable request, Mr. Gibbel. Absolutely. We can start with the blood tests. That will give us a good baseline and help us rule out other potential causes, such as anemia or thyroid problems. We'll schedule those for tomorrow morning. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide whether or not the CT scan is necessary. If we do end up doing the scan, there’s very little preparation involved. You can eat and drink as normal. We may ask you to remove any jewelry or metal objects. The technologist will explain the procedure in detail before you lie down on the table. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. I'll also give you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with the neck stiffness. And if the headache is particularly bothersome, you can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better, Doctor. Blood tests first, then we’ll see. And the muscle relaxant… that sounds good. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It really helps to calm my nerves. So, tomorrow morning for the blood tests, and then we’ll go from there? Do I need to fast for those tests?
DOCTOR: Yes, tomorrow morning for the blood tests. You will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks after midnight tonight, except for water. I’ll have the lab call you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are available, my nurse will contact you to discuss them and let you know the next steps. In the meantime, if the headache worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and your patience. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, and I appreciate that. I’ll remember to fast for the tests, and I’ll contact the office if anything changes. I guess I’ll see you after the tests, then. Have a good afternoon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good afternoon to you as well.
