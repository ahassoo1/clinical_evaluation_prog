DOCTOR: Right. Nixon Kreckel, 18 years old. Good. Well, Nixon, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It's my left leg, it’s gotten quite swollen. And… well, the nice lady at the desk said something about my heart being a bit… off? I’m not entirely sure what she meant, but she said it was important to tell you.
DOCTOR: Swollen leg, and the receptionist mentioned something about your heart. Honestly, receptionists… Alright. Let's start with the leg. How long has it been swollen?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a week ago? It was just a little bit at first, I thought it was just from walking too much. But it’s gotten bigger each day, especially in the evenings. It doesn't hurt, exactly, just… feels heavy and full.
DOCTOR: A week. Gradual onset, worse in the evenings, heavy sensation, no sharp pain. Good. And is it just the left leg, or is the right leg affected at all?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just the left leg. The right one is perfectly normal, thank you. I checked this morning to be sure. It's very strange, really. I haven’t done anything to injure it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Um… well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But I've also been studying a lot for university. It’s hard to tell what's normal tiredness and what isn’t, if that makes sense. I’ve not had any fever or anything like that.
DOCTOR: University students are always tired. Still, good to ask. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever had any problems with your heart before?
PATIENT: The nice lady at the desk said something about… atrial fibrillation? Is that… is that the heart thing? I don't know much about it. I just saw a doctor a few months ago for a regular check-up, and nothing was mentioned then. But she said it was important to tell you about it. I don’t remember being told about this before, but she seemed very certain.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation. And you’re just learning about this now, from the receptionist?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I wasn’t quite sure what she was talking about. She just said it was in my chart, and I should tell you. I apologize, Doctor. I don’t understand a lot about medical things. I thought it might be best to just let you explain it to me. Is it… is it serious?
DOCTOR: Well, someone needs to learn how to properly read their medical records. Obviously it's something to investigate. Alright, let’s get a proper look at your leg. And then we'll discuss your… alleged atrial fibrillation. Please, roll up your left pant leg.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. There you go, Doctor. I hope it’s not too unsightly. I did try to wear sensible socks today.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there's definite pitting edema. And the skin is a little discolored. Alright. Now, let’s take your blood pressure, and listen to your heart. Sit back.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Should I be worried about this swelling? I'm supposed to be starting university next month, and I'm a little concerned it might prevent me from going.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… acceptable. Heart rate is irregular, as expected. Listen carefully… yes, there's a clear irregularity. It’s… not surprising. Now, I’m going to order a D-dimer test and an EKG to get a better picture of what’s going on. Don’t panic. It could be a simple blood clot, or it could be something more serious. We'll know more when the results come back.
PATIENT: A D-dimer test? And an… EKG? I’m afraid I don’t know what those are. Will they… will they hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I have some important reading to do for university, and I don’t want to fall behind.
DOCTOR: A D-dimer is a blood test to check for clots. And an EKG… it's a simple test where we put stickers on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. Neither of them will hurt. The EKG takes five minutes, the blood test… well, it’s a needle. It’s not pleasant, but you’ll survive. The results should be back by the end of the day. Now, I’m going to write you a prescription for compression stockings to help with the swelling. Wear them religiously. And try not to worry. Though frankly, given your history – or lack thereof, thanks to inadequate record keeping – I'm not optimistic.
PATIENT: Compression stockings? Oh dear. Will they… be visible? And I apologize again, Doctor, about the lack of information. I truly did not know about any heart problems. I… I just want to get to university and start my studies. I’m reading computer science, and I’m quite excited about it. Is it still possible for me to go, even with this… irregularity?
DOCTOR: They’ll be visible, yes. Whether they ruin your aesthetic is your problem. And yes, you can probably go to university. Though I strongly advise speaking to the university's health services about your condition. An irregular heartbeat is not something to be taken lightly. Computer science is irrelevant. We're dealing with your cardiovascular system, not your academic pursuits. I'm ordering the tests now. The lab is just down the hall. Don’t delay. And frankly, you should have known about this already. Someone dropped the ball somewhere.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I… I suppose I'll go to the lab then. And I will speak to the university health services. Is there… anything else I should be aware of? Or any symptoms I should look out for? Before I go?
DOCTOR: Shortness of breath. Chest pain. Dizziness. Fainting. If you experience any of those, go to the emergency room. Immediately. And don’t waste my time with follow-up questions unless you have concrete results. Now, off you go. .
PATIENT: .
