DOCTOR: Alright, Blain, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors, honestly. But my mother… well, she's been pushing me to get checked out. It's a long story, and frankly, a bit dramatic. She's convinced I'm going to end up like her brother.
DOCTOR: Right. Mothers. Always worrying. And this brother… what was wrong with him, exactly?
PATIENT: It's… complicated. He had some sort of… nerve thing. Kept getting weaker, couldn’t really do anything anymore. Eventually he… passed away. She doesn’t go into details, just says it was awful and I need to be “proactive”. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. But she’s relentless, and Medicare covers it, so here I am. I teach engineering, I’m on my feet all day, I don't see what the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Engineering, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Postsecondary. I lecture, run labs… it’s fairly demanding, actually. Requires a lot of focus, problem-solving. Not exactly the life of someone who's about to fall apart, if you ask me. She keeps talking about “genetic predispositions” and things I don’t even bother to listen to. It all sounds… a bit much. I just want to be told I'm healthy and can go back to work. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Well, "feeling fine" and being fine aren't always the same thing. A lot of these things develop slowly. But alright, let's start with the basics. Any current symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Nothing that I’ve noticed. Maybe… sometimes my hands feel a little… clumsy? But I work with tools all day, so honestly, it could just be fatigue. And I get headaches, but who doesn't get headaches? I’m generally just… stressed. It's the start of the semester, you know? Lots of prep work. I don’t think a little stress equals a serious illness.
DOCTOR: "Clumsy" hands… and headaches. Right. When did you first start noticing the clumsiness?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. I don’t know. A few months ago, maybe? It’s not like I’m dropping things constantly or anything. It’s just… occasionally I’ll fumble with a screwdriver or something. Nothing major. I really don’t pay attention to these little things. Honestly, I'm a bit perplexed why we’re even discussing this. Is this what doctors do? Focus on minor inconveniences?
DOCTOR: It's called taking a history, Blain. And seemingly minor things can be… indicative of larger issues. Now, these headaches… are they constant?
PATIENT: No, not constant. They come and go. Usually after a long day, or if I’m staring at a screen for too long. I just take some ibuprofen and they go away. Look, I appreciate you doing your job, but I really think my mother is overreacting. She's always been a bit of a hypochondriac, frankly. She probably just read something online and now she thinks I'm dying. It's exhausting. Is there any way to just… fast-track this and tell me everything’s probably fine?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just cover the basics, then. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness? No. Not at all. I lift equipment, I walk around all day, I'm perfectly capable. I did some hiking last month, actually. A pretty challenging trail. I wouldn't have been able to do that if I was weak. Honestly, I think she's projecting her own anxieties onto me. Her brother, he was always… frail. I'm not frail. I exercise, I eat reasonably well… I’m just… a normal, healthy person. I’m starting to feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Any difficulty with balance or coordination?
PATIENT: No. Look, I used to play cricket, actually. Requires a lot of coordination. I haven't played in a while, admittedly, but I certainly don't feel clumsy or off-balance. This is… frustrating. I feel like I'm being made to justify my perfectly normal existence. Are you going to ask me about my bowel movements next? Because honestly, that's just ridiculous.
DOCTOR: We're getting somewhere, then. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision? No. I wear glasses, always have. My prescription hasn't changed in the last year. I had an eye exam six months ago, everything was normal. This is… I’m sorry, but I feel like you’re just going through a checklist, not actually listening to me. I’m perfectly healthy. Can we just… end this? I have a lecture to prepare for. A very important one, actually. And I’m wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just take a quick look at your EHR then. Height and weight are noted as 181 cm and 60 kg… that’s… quite lean. Anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Lean? Yes, I exercise. I told you that. I'm an engineer, I'm not a linebacker. What does my weight have to do with anything? Look, I’m starting to feel like you’re questioning my entire lifestyle. I'm perfectly aware of my own body. I'm not ill. I'm just… stressed. And frankly, a little annoyed. Can we please wrap this up? I have things to do. Important things. Is there anything else you need to know, or can I just go?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a brief neurological exam, just to be thorough. It’ll be quick. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Seriously? Now you're going to do tests? Look, I came here to appease my mother, not become a science experiment. I’m a busy person. I have a responsibility to my students. I’m not going to waste my time playing games. If you’re not going to give me a straightforward answer – that I’m healthy and can go – then I’m leaving. I’m not going to sit here and let you poke and prod me based on my mother's paranoia. .
DOCTOR: Fine. As you wish. But I would strongly advise you to reconsider. Just to rule things out. However, I respect your decision. Here's a referral to a neurologist, just in case. Perhaps they can reassure you. .
