DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Andraca, you say? A lovely name. Hmm… what did bring me in… now, let me think a moment. It’s about my blood, I believe. My… well, someone mentioned I should find out what type it is. Something about needing to know, just in case. I don’t quite recall why, though. It’s slipped my mind. It’s important, I think… yes, very important.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It is good to know your blood type, and it’s common for people to want to check it, especially as they get older. It's helpful for emergency situations, and sometimes needed before certain procedures. I see here you’re 79 years old. Have you ever had your blood type checked before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Seventy-nine, yes… feels older some days! Oh dear… have I had it checked? That’s a good question. I used to work with… ropes, you know? A rigger, that was my trade. Lots of… lifting. But blood tests… I don’t really remember having one for just my type. We had them sometimes, for the work, I think. But not specifically to know what it was. It’s all a bit foggy, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Do you understand? It feels like trying to grab smoke.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Darl. It’s very common for memories to become a little less clear as we age. No need to worry about that at all. It sounds like you may have had blood work done in the past as part of your job, but we’ll just go ahead and do a new test to confirm your blood type today. To start, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s another good question. Let me think… I don’t believe so. Not to anything… common. I used to eat all sorts of things! Shellfish, nuts… everything. Though, my skin does get a bit itchy sometimes, but I think that’s just the sun. I spent a lot of time outdoors, you see, working with those ropes. But a proper allergy… no, I don't think I’ve ever had one. Are you sure that’s alright, just checking? I wouldn't want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Darl. It sounds like you haven’t had any known allergic reactions, and that’s good to know. We’ll still be careful, of course. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take something for my knees, I think. They ache something awful when the weather changes. A little white pill, I believe. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take… something. A small one, too. But the names… they escape me. I get them from the pharmacy, you see. I just tell them what I need and they give it to me. I don't bother trying to remember the names, it just confuses me. Is that alright? Will that make it difficult?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Darl. We can usually figure it out. Do you happen to know the name of the pharmacy you use?
PATIENT: Hmm… the pharmacy… let me think… it’s just around the corner, you see. A small one. There's a… a blue sign, I believe. And… a picture of a… mortar and pestle, perhaps? It’s on Elm Street, I’m quite sure. Old Man Hemmings used to own it, but I believe someone else has it now. It’s very close to the bakery. Oh dear, I’m terrible with names! But it’s the one just past Mrs. Gable’s flower shop. Is that any help? I feel like I’m going around in circles.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful actually, Darl. That sounds like Hemmings Pharmacy on Elm Street. I can look up your medication history there. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Long-term conditions… My knees, definitely. They’ve bothered me for years. And my back, it aches something awful. But as for conditions… the doctor used to mention something about my cholesterol. It was a bit high, I think. And… oh, what was it? Something about my breathing, a few years back. I had a bit of a cough. But they gave me something for it, and it went away. I honestly can’t recall the specifics. I see so many doctors, it all blurs together! Does that make things difficult? I’m sorry I’m not very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're perfectly helpful, Darl. It's very common to have a lot of medical information, and it’s alright if you don’t remember every detail. We can look through your records to get a clearer picture. Okay, I see here you were diagnosed with hyperlipidemia – high cholesterol – about five years ago, and you had a bout of bronchitis two years ago. Do you currently take any medication for your cholesterol?
PATIENT: Cholesterol… yes, that sounds right. And bronchitis… a terrible cough that was! Medication… now, let me think. I believe so. A little yellow pill, I think. I take it every morning, with my breakfast. But as for the name… Oh dear, it escapes me again! I just know I take something to keep it under control. Do you think it matters much? I've been taking it for quite some time, and I seem to be alright.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’ve been taking something for it, and it’s helpful to know you’ve been feeling alright. I can see here you're prescribed Atorvastatin 20mg. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That was a long time ago, of course. And… oh, yes! I broke my wrist once, when I was working with the ropes. A silly accident, really. But that was many years ago. Hospitalized… I think I was in the hospital when I had the bronchitis, but it wasn’t for very long. Just a few days, I believe. Nothing major. I’m a pretty healthy woman, all things considered. Or, I used to be! Old age is catching up with me, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Darl. It sounds like you’ve had a fairly active life. Now, finally, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, dear. That’s a tricky one. My mother… she had a weak heart, I believe. She wasn’t very strong. And my brother… he had some trouble with his lungs, I think. He smoked, you see. A terrible habit. As for cancer… I think my aunt had it, many years ago. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t recall the specifics. We didn’t talk about it much, you see. It was a sad topic. Is that helpful? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. It all feels so… hazy.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Darl. Knowing about your mother’s heart condition and your brother’s lung issues is good information to have. Okay, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical exam sounds perfectly fine. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I used to be quite strong, you know. Working with the ropes… it takes a lot of muscle. Not so much anymore, though! But do what you need to do. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. I’ll make a note of that. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but breath sounds are slightly diminished at the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally, but slightly weak. Blood pressure is 140/90. Eyes are clear, ears are normal. Okay, all done. Everything seems generally okay, but the murmur, diminished breath sounds, and weak pulses are things we'll want to keep an eye on. Now, let's get that blood test done to determine your blood type. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… a lot of things! A murmur… and diminished breath sounds… Are those… bad things, Doctor? Should I be worried? I do get a bit breathless sometimes, especially when I walk uphill. And I always feel a bit cold in my hands and feet. Is that what you were listening for? Will it be alright? I'm not a young woman anymore, you see. I don't want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: It’s good you asked, Darl. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned when you hear things like that. The murmur isn’t necessarily a cause for immediate alarm, but it means we should investigate it further. It could be benign, or it could indicate a valve issue. That's why we'll follow up. The diminished breath sounds could be due to a number of things, including age, and we'll keep an eye on that as well. And the feeling of coldness in your hands and feet is consistent with slightly weaker pulses, which could indicate some circulation issues. We’ll do the blood test first and get a clearer picture of your overall health. Then, I'd like to order an EKG – an electrocardiogram – to check your heart’s electrical activity. And I'd recommend a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and decide on the best course of action. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An EKG… and a follow-up appointment… it sounds… a bit overwhelming, Doctor. I’m not very good with all these medical things, you see. I just want to know I’m alright. Is my heart… going to be alright? And what about the blood test? Will that tell you something? I just want to know what’s going on. It's just that... I don’t want to be a burden. I have family, you know. They look after me. I don’t want to worry them unnecessarily. Perhaps… perhaps we could just skip the EKG? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Darl, it’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. It’s my job to explain everything clearly and to make sure you feel comfortable. I understand your concerns, and I would never suggest anything unnecessary. The EKG is a simple, painless test that gives us valuable information about your heart’s rhythm and function. It’s a quick way to rule out any serious issues. It's a precaution, really. I understand you don’t want to worry your family, and we can certainly discuss the results with them if you’d like. We don't have to involve them if you prefer. The blood test will tell us your blood type, which is useful information to have. It will also give us some basic information about your overall health. I strongly recommend the EKG, just to be on the safe side. It's a quick and easy test, and it will give me more information to work with. If everything looks normal, we can simply monitor your blood pressure and follow up with regular check-ups. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s really necessary… then I suppose I can have the EKG. But please, Doctor, be gentle. I’m not a young woman anymore. And… promise me you’ll explain everything clearly, if anything is wrong. I don’t want to be left in the dark. And… perhaps we could schedule the follow-up appointment for a bit further out? Just to give me a bit of time to… process everything? I don't want to rush into anything. Perhaps three weeks instead of two? And… could you maybe write down everything you’ve told me? Just so I can remember? My memory isn't what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Darl. I promise I’ll be as gentle as possible. The EKG is a very simple procedure. We'll simply place some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all. And I absolutely promise to explain everything clearly. I’ll go over the results with you in detail, and I’ll answer any questions you have. Three weeks for the follow-up is perfectly fine. That will give you plenty of time to process everything. And yes, I’ll absolutely write down everything we’ve discussed today, including the reasons for the EKG, the expected results, and the plan for the follow-up appointment. Here you go. Now, let's get you scheduled for the EKG. The nurse will come in shortly and explain the procedure and get you set up. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. This is… very helpful. I do appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. Hmm… let me see… Will I need to do anything special before the EKG? Should I avoid caffeine? Or… is there anything I need to eat or drink? And… will I be able to drive myself home afterwards? I don’t want to trouble my family unnecessarily. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Darl. You're very thoughtful to ask. You don't need to do anything special to prepare for the EKG. You can eat and drink normally, and you don't need to avoid caffeine. Just try to relax beforehand. And yes, you should be perfectly fine to drive yourself home afterwards. The procedure is quick and painless, and it shouldn't affect your ability to drive. The nurse will give you more detailed instructions before the test, but generally, just relax and breathe normally. If you feel any discomfort during the procedure, just let the nurse know. I believe the nurse should be in shortly to get you set up. Do you have any other questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and kind. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel… a bit less anxious now. Oh, one last thing… Do you think… it’s alright if I just sit here for a moment? And… gather my thoughts? I just need a bit of time to… process everything. It’s a lot to take in, you know. Perhaps I’ll just sit quietly and… look out the window. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Darl. Please, take all the time you need. There's no rush at all. You are very welcome to sit here quietly and gather your thoughts. I'll let you have some peace and quiet, and I'll check back with you shortly. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or if you need anything at all. Take care.
