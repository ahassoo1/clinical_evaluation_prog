DOCTOR: Right, Chelise Geho. Fifty-four. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Ruocco. Well, I got a letter from the lab, you see. Something about my cholesterol being a bit high. Hyper… hyperlipidemia, it said. I don’t really know what all that means, but it sounded important enough to come see you.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia… yes, high cholesterol. It is important, though many people make too much of it. It’s… prevalent. So, you’re here because of that letter. Have you been experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I feel fine, actually. Perfectly normal. That’s why I was a bit surprised when I got the letter. I mean, I haven't been feeling sick or anything like that. Just my usual self, I suppose. Do high cholesterol levels always cause symptoms? I’m a little confused, to be honest.
DOCTOR: No, not always. That’s… common. Often, it’s silent. Which is why we screen for it. It's a bit like… a slow leak in a tire. You don’t feel it until it’s causing a problem. Now, let’s get some history. Do you have any family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good way to put it, a slow leak! Yes, family history… hmm. My father, he had a heart attack when he was in his sixties. And my mother, she was always watching her diet, very careful with fats and things. She said her father had something with his heart too, but I don't remember the details. They’re both gone now, so it’s hard to recall exactly what they told me. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… useful. Heart disease in a first-degree relative is… pertinent. And your mother being careful suggests awareness. Alright. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was ages ago. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. I get a yearly checkup with my regular doctor, and everything is usually fine. I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because of the long nights here, but that’s it. I have Medicare, of course, so they usually catch anything.
DOCTOR: Tonsils... irrelevant. Vitamin D… fine. Medicare is… adequate. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never. I wouldn't dream of it. Always thought it was a terrible habit. My husband – well, ex-husband, now – he tried it for a while when he was young, but I put a stop to that quickly. I'm very careful about what I put in my body. Clean eating, I always say!
DOCTOR: Good. Alright. And alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing heavy, you understand. Usually red wine, I think it's better for you than white. It’s… sociable, you know? But I don’t drink to excess. Really, I don’t. It’s mostly just a little something to enjoy with the meal.
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. Let’s move on. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, really. I’m pretty lucky that way, I think. I love trying new foods when I travel – well, I used to travel more before… never mind. But no, no allergies. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Just a routine thing. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds good. Happy to. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I am rather tall, if that makes a difference. Sometimes things don’t fit properly. But I’m perfectly comfortable, honestly. Go ahead when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138/82. Heart sounds… regular, no murmurs appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Weight is 124 pounds, height 199 centimeters, as you mentioned. Overall, unremarkable physical exam. Now, the letter mentioned specific cholesterol numbers?
PATIENT: Yes, it did. Let me see... Here we are. It says… total cholesterol was 240. HDL was 40, which it says is low. LDL was 160, and that's marked as high. And triglycerides… 150. Those numbers mean anything to you, Doctor? I just looked at the paper and got more confused, to be honest. It felt like another language.
DOCTOR: Yes, those numbers… confirm the hyperlipidemia. LDL is elevated, as is the total cholesterol. HDL is… suboptimal. Basically, you have high "bad" cholesterol and low "good" cholesterol. We need to address this. Now, before we start medication, we'll do some further blood work. Check your liver function and rule out secondary causes. Also, let’s get a basic metabolic panel. It's standard protocol. Will you be able to come back next week for another blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Elevated and suboptimal… Right. So, more blood work. Yes, I can come back next week. Tuesday would be good, if that works. Is there anything I should do before the next appointment? Anything I should avoid eating or anything like that? I like to be prepared. I used to work as an engineer, you know. Planning is very important!
DOCTOR: Avoid excessive saturated fats and trans fats. Lean protein, fruits, vegetables… the usual. Nothing drastic. We’ll base the treatment plan on the blood work results. Let's schedule that appointment for Tuesday at 9 AM. And frankly, a modest weight loss wouldn't hurt, though it’s not imperative. Now, do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 9 AM is perfect. I will put it right in my calendar. Saturated fats... I think I can manage that. Hmm… Yes, actually, I do have a question. My ex-husband – he had to take pills for his cholesterol. Are we talking about pills too? I’m not a fan of taking medication unless it’s absolutely necessary. Is there anything else we can try first? Maybe a special diet or something? I'm a bit worried about side effects, you see. I've heard some terrible stories.
DOCTOR: Statins are the first line of treatment, and generally well-tolerated. But we won't jump to medication immediately. We’ll see the results of the blood work. Diet and exercise can help, but often aren’t enough. We’ll discuss all your options next week. But frankly, avoiding a heart attack is generally a good reason to consider medication. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Avoiding a heart attack is… certainly a good reason. You're right. It’s just… I always prefer to try the natural route first, if possible. Well, I guess my other question is… how long will I have to come in for checkups if I do start taking medication? Is it forever? I used to work on long-term projects, and I know things can change a lot over time. It's just… I like to have a plan. A good, solid plan.
DOCTOR: If you begin statin therapy, you’ll need regular lipid panels to monitor effectiveness and check for side effects. Yes, it's generally a long-term commitment, assuming you tolerate the medication. It’s not a ‘quick fix’. Now, is there anything else before I dismiss you?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You’ve answered everything I was worried about. It's good to know I don't have to rush into anything. I'll focus on the diet, and I’ll see you next Tuesday. Thank you, Doctor Ruocco. I appreciate your time. And… maybe I'll try to walk a little bit more. It's a good habit to get into, anyway.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll see you next Tuesday. The lab results will be sent to my office, and we'll discuss them then. .
PATIENT: .
