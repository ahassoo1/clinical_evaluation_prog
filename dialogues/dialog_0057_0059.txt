DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it’s… my speech. It hasn’t been quite right lately. I’m having a bit of trouble getting my words out, and things feel…slurred, I suppose. It’s all a bit hazy, though. I don't really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble getting your words out and some slurring, and it's been happening without you pinpointing a specific start date. That's helpful to know. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by “not quite right”?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s hard to explain. It’s not like I can’t talk, Doctor, just… it feels like my mouth isn’t cooperating sometimes. Like the words get all tangled up before they come out. And I have to… concentrate a lot more than usual to speak clearly. It's exhausting, if I'm being honest. I don't think it's gotten worse recently, but it's definitely not normal. I hope that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Adyn, thank you for explaining that so clearly. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with articulation and it's requiring more effort to speak. That is concerning, and we want to figure out what's going on. To get a better understanding, can you tell me if this happens all the time, or are there specific situations when it's worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It doesn’t seem to be constant, no. I think… I think it’s more noticeable when I’m tired, definitely. And maybe when I’m trying to speak quickly. If I slow down and really focus, it’s a bit better. I'm a construction manager, so I'm usually on a job site all day, giving instructions… that can be pretty stressful, and I'm talking a lot. Perhaps it's worse then? It’s difficult to recall specifics, I apologise. Everything feels a bit… blurred.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Adyn. It's perfectly understandable that it's hard to pinpoint things when you're dealing with this. So, it sounds like stress and fatigue, particularly at work, seem to be contributing factors. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the speech difficulty?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… hmm. I've been feeling a little… off balance sometimes, I suppose. Not enough to fall, but just a bit unsteady on my feet. And, now that you mention it, I have been feeling more tired than usual, even when I get enough sleep. It’s like I’m constantly sluggish. I haven't really connected it to the speech, but… perhaps it's all related? Is that possible, Doctor? I do seem to be a bit forgetful as well… now that I think about it. It's just… little things, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we're now talking about some unsteadiness, increased fatigue, and some forgetfulness. Those could be related, yes. It’s good you’re bringing all of this to my attention. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor, you may ask anything. Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, that's about it, I believe. Nothing major since then. I’ve always been generally healthy, to be honest. I don't have any ongoing medical conditions that I'm aware of. As for illnesses… I get the occasional cold, like anyone else, but nothing serious. I'm married, and my husband says I haven’t been particularly sick in years. He's got a much better memory than I do, so he might recall something I’ve forgotten. I hope that's helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Tonsillectomy as a child and generally good health – good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… hmm. That's a bit trickier. My mother… she passed away a few years ago. I don’t recall her having any specific illnesses, but she was older, of course. My father is still alive, but he lives in Jamaica and we don’t speak often. I believe he has high blood pressure, but that’s all I really know. As for other family members… I’m not really sure. I don’t have a lot of close relatives, and we don’t keep in close contact. I apologise, Doctor. I wish I could provide more information. My memory is just… lacking.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Adyn. It's perfectly understandable. High blood pressure in your father is good to know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don't smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I work long hours, and honestly, I’m usually too tired for anything like that. I try to eat healthy, though it's sometimes difficult with my schedule. And I try to get as much rest as possible, but that’s also a challenge. I’m a fairly straightforward person, Doctor. Nothing too exciting.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Straightforward is perfectly fine. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a daily multivitamin, just to keep things topped up, you know? And sometimes, if I'm feeling particularly stressed, I'll take an over-the-counter sleep aid, but that's only occasionally. Other than that, no, I’m not on any regular medications. I’m generally healthy, as I said, so I try to avoid taking too many pills if possible. Is that alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Adyn. Multivitamin and occasional sleep aid – good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any serious allergic reactions. I’m not allergic to any foods that I’m aware of, and I’ve never had any issues with medications. I think I’m pretty lucky in that regard. No allergies, thankfully. Is there anything else I can tell you, Doctor? I want to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Adyn. No known allergies is good. Okay, thank you for answering all of those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve checking your vital signs, looking in your ears and throat, and a basic neurological assessment to check your balance and coordination. That will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgement completely. Please, go ahead. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I just want to figure out what’s causing this… this slurred speech and everything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your vital signs. I'm going to take your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Please relax your arm for me. Okay, your blood pressure is 128/76, your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. That’s all within normal limits. Now, let's take a look at your ears and throat. Please open your mouth and say “Ah”. Okay, your ears look clear. Your throat is a little bit red, but nothing significant. Now, I’m going to check your balance and coordination. Please stand up for me and follow my instructions. Okay, please stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Now, please touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger, then touch your nose again. Repeat that a few times. And finally, please walk a straight line, heel to toe, for a few steps. Okay, thank you. Please have a seat. Your neurological exam is largely normal, although I did notice a slight unsteadiness with your balance and a very mild slurring when you speak. This is consistent with what you’ve been describing. Your reflexes appear normal, and your strength is good. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on at this point, but your symptoms suggest that something is affecting your nervous system. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and an MRI of your brain. The blood tests will help rule out any underlying infections or vitamin deficiencies. The MRI will allow us to see if there’s anything going on in your brain that could be causing your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Blood tests and an MRI… if that’s what you think is necessary to figure out what’s happening, then I’m happy to do it. It’s just… all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I just want to feel normal again. An MRI… will it be a long process? And will it be uncomfortable? I apologize for asking so many questions, I just feel a little anxious.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Adyn. It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. You’re not asking too many questions at all – it’s important for you to understand what’s going on and what we’re doing. The MRI will take about 30-45 minutes. You’ll lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it will make a loud knocking sound. You'll be able to communicate with the technician during the entire process. It’s not painful, but it can be a little uncomfortable if you’re claustrophobic. If you are, we can discuss giving you some medication to help you relax beforehand. We'll also ensure you remove all metallic objects before the procedure. The blood tests will just involve a simple sample from your arm. The results should be back in a few days. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. And if you experience any sudden weakness, numbness, or difficulty breathing, go to the nearest emergency room. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. Thirty to forty-five minutes in the MRI, and blood tests. And contact the clinic if things worsen, or go to the emergency room if it’s serious. I think… I think I’ll be alright. I'm not terribly claustrophobic, so medication shouldn't be necessary. I'll just try to stay calm and focus on my breathing. Thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so thoroughly. It’s reassuring to know that you’re taking this seriously and trying to figure out what’s going on. What about work? I'm a construction manager, and I'm responsible for a lot of people… I can't just disappear for weeks if this turns out to be something serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. It’s my job to help you, and I take that responsibility very seriously. That’s a valid concern, and it's good you're thinking ahead. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to say definitively how long you might need to be off work until we have the results of the tests. However, depending on the diagnosis, we may be able to modify your duties or arrange for temporary accommodations. I’m happy to write you a note for work explaining that you’re undergoing medical evaluation and may need to take some time off. I can also discuss with you the possibility of short-term disability if necessary. We should also explore whether any of your symptoms are related to work-related factors, such as stress or exposure to toxins. If so, we may need to involve a workers’ compensation specialist. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and seeing what the results show. Once we have those, we can develop a more specific plan for managing your work situation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. A note for work, and exploring the possibility of short-term disability… and looking into work-related factors. Thank you for being so understanding and thorough. It’s reassuring to know that you’re taking all of these things into consideration. I think… I think that’s all I need to know for now. I’ll schedule the tests, and hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Thank you again, Doctor Sieh. You’ve been incredibly helpful. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. I’ll have the nurse schedule those tests for you before you leave. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Have a good day, Adyn.
