DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Gegan. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. It is… difficult to explain, truly. I am Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, my memory is not what it was. It is concerning, because I manage many properties, and forgetting things… it is a problem. I notice it more now, lately. I am… hypertensive, you see. My husband… he passed, and after that, things… shifted.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Alvara. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s very common for memory to be affected by stress and grief, especially with a change in your health like hypertension. It's good you're addressing this. So, to clarify, you're noticing a decline in your memory since your husband's passing?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Before… before he was gone, everything was… organized. I could recall details about each property, each owner, everything. Now… sometimes names escape me. Dates. Even what I had for breakfast this morning! It is… frustrating, and a little frightening, to be honest. It is not everything, but enough to worry a woman who must keep things… precise.
DOCTOR: I see. And would you say this memory loss is gradual, or have there been sudden instances of forgetting?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It did not happen overnight. Slowly… things began to… slip. I would misplace keys, and then forget where I misplaced them. Then, forgetting appointments. It is… more frequent now. Not sudden, no. More like a slow leak, if that makes sense. A small drip at first, now a… steady flow. It is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good way to describe it, Ms. Alvara – a slow leak. And you mentioned you are hypertensive. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take… Lisinopril, I believe. A small white pill, once a day. The doctor, before… my husband's doctor, prescribed it. I continue to take it, of course. I do not always remember when I took it, but I try. My blood pressure… it is usually high. Very high, sometimes. I do not check it often anymore. It… upset my husband, to see the numbers.
DOCTOR: I understand. And aside from the Lisinopril, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. Just the Lisinopril. I… I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped. It was… after my husband. So many little routines… they simply fell by the wayside. I eat… reasonably well, I think. Mostly vegetables and fish. Not much red meat. I try to stay active, but… my energy is low, sometimes. It is difficult to explain. Everything feels… heavy.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the memory issues, such as headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or difficulty with speaking or understanding language?
PATIENT: Headaches, yes. Sometimes. Not severe, but… persistent. A dull ache, mostly in the back of my head. And… dizziness, occasionally, when I stand up too quickly. My vision… no, I do not think so. It is fine. I wear glasses, for reading, but that is… simply age. Speaking… no, I do not believe I have trouble speaking. Understanding… perhaps sometimes I ask people to repeat themselves, but I thought that was simply because of the… quietness here. It is very rural, you see. People speak softly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… not really. I had… pneumonia, when I was a child, but that was many years ago. I broke my arm once, falling from a tree, but that is all. I have had… some problems with my back, from lifting heavy things, when I manage the properties, but nothing that required… hospitalization. My husband… he had heart problems. Many heart problems. I spent a great deal of time at the hospital with him, but I have not been… seriously ill.
DOCTOR: And has anyone in your family—parents, siblings, or other close relatives—experienced memory loss, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. My mother… she became forgetful in her old age, yes. But we simply attributed it to… old age. She lived a long life. My father… he died young, from an accident. He was… robust, always. No memory problems, to my knowledge. My siblings… I have a sister, in Russia. I have not seen her in many years. We do not… communicate often. I do not know about her health. My husband’s mother… she had some… confusion, towards the end, but it was… after a stroke. A bad stroke. It is… difficult to say. Perhaps. But nothing… clear. Nothing like this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I have never smoked in my life. And I… rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner, on special occasions. And… recreational drugs? Never. I am a… responsible woman. I manage properties, you see. One must be… clear-headed. It would be… irresponsible. No, I do not partake in such things. Never have. Never will.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Alvara. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I do not think so. I have never had a… reaction to anything. I eat many things. I am not… a fussy eater. I sometimes get… a rash, if I touch certain plants, but that is simply… nature. Nothing serious. No, I do not have any… true allergies. Nothing I am aware of, at least. This is… all very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate it. I simply wish to… understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. You've been very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment – check your reflexes, balance, and memory. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your… judgment. Please, proceed. I am… ready. Although, I warn you, my memory… it is not what it was. Do not be surprised if I… forget things. I apologize in advance. I simply… want to know what is happening. Do not hesitate to… ask me to repeat myself.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Alvara. That's perfectly fine. We’ll take our time. First, let's just take your blood pressure. Could you please relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. As relaxed as I can be. It… tends to be high, you see. It always has. Do not be alarmed. It is… simply my nature. Although, I do wish it were… lower. It caused my husband much… distress. But… he is gone now. Still… it is… unsettling. Take your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 162/98. A bit elevated, as you suspected. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly strong. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please sit with your legs dangling and I’ll tap on your knees?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. As you wish. My legs… they sometimes feel… heavy. And my knees… they ache, in cold weather. But… proceed. I will… cooperate fully. I simply want to… understand what is happening. It is… unsettling, this feeling of… slipping. Tap away, Doctor. Tap away.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let's do a quick memory test. I’m going to say three words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me, and then I'll ask you to recall them again in a few minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. As ready as I can be. My memory… it is… fickle. But I will… try my best. Please, say the words. I will… concentrate very hard. Do not… hesitate to repeat them if I fail. I apologize in advance, should I… forget. Proceed, Doctor. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me, please?
PATIENT: Apple… table… and… and… penny. Yes. Apple, table, and… penny. Is that… correct? It is… difficult to hold them all in my head. Apple, table, penny. I hope… I have not forgotten already. It is… unsettling, this feeling.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Alvara. Perfect. Now, we'll move on to some other questions and checks. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: The year… the year… It is… August, is it not? August… Two thousand… twenty-five. Yes. Two thousand and twenty-five. I believe. It is… hard to keep track, sometimes. All the years… they seem to… blur together. But yes, Two thousand and twenty-five. Is that… correct, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. And can you tell me your date of birth?
PATIENT: My date of birth… Oh dear. It is… it is… June… the fourteenth. Yes. June fourteenth. And… nineteen… nineteen sixty… two. I believe. Yes, June fourteenth, nineteen sixty-two. It is… a long time ago. I apologize if I am… slow. It is… difficult to recall things these days. My husband always… remembered everything. I… miss that.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Ms. Alvara. You're doing very well. Now, let's try a simple calculation. If you have ten apples and you give three to your neighbor, how many apples do you have left?
PATIENT: Ten apples… minus three… that is… seven. Yes. Seven apples. I have… seven apples left. Is that… correct, Doctor? It is… simple arithmetic. But my mind… it feels… slow. Sometimes. I used to be… very good at numbers. I managed accounts, you see. For the properties. But… now. It is… difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, can you please name three things for me?
PATIENT: Three things… Oh dear. Let me see… A… a chair. Yes. A chair. And… a table. Yes. A table. And… a… a plant. A green plant. Is that… acceptable, Doctor? It is… difficult to think of things. My mind… it feels… empty, sometimes. I apologize if I am… slow. It is… unsettling, this feeling.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly acceptable, Ms. Alvara. Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier – apple, table, penny. Do you remember what they were?
PATIENT: Apple… table… Oh dear. I… I believe it was… apple… and… and… table. And… something else. Something… small and round. But I… I cannot recall it. I apologize, Doctor. My memory… it is… failing me. I remember… apple, table… but the third word… it has… slipped away. I am… very sorry. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Alvara. Don't worry. It was penny. You remembered two of them, which is good. Okay. Based on the examination and your responses, you’re experiencing some memory difficulties, which are concerning given your history of hypertension and recent grief. It's important to investigate this further. I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood tests… Yes, Doctor. If it will… help me understand what is happening, then… yes. I am… willing to do whatever is necessary. Although… I do not like needles. And… an MRI… it sounds… frightening. But… if it will help… yes. Please proceed. I simply want to… know what is happening. I cannot continue to… live in this fog of uncertainty. It is… unsettling, Doctor. Very unsettling. But… yes. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll get the lab orders and MRI request sent to the front desk. They’ll schedule the tests and the MRI for you. The MRI will likely require you to fill out a safety questionnaire, and you'll need to remove any metal objects before the scan. I also want to refer you to a neurologist for a formal evaluation. They are specialists in memory disorders and can provide a more detailed assessment. Would you like me to help you schedule an appointment with a neurologist?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Yes, please. If you could… help me schedule an appointment, I would be… very grateful. I… I do not want to… navigate that myself. It is… overwhelming. A neurologist… yes. Please, help me. I simply want… answers. And… perhaps, a way to… regain my clarity. It is… all very frightening, Doctor. I appreciate your… help. Very much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. Let me see… Dr. Ramirez is a highly recommended neurologist in the area. He has appointments available next week on Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning. Would either of those days work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… yes. That would be… acceptable. Tuesday afternoon, if possible. Although… I do not like being… rushed. But… if that is the earliest appointment, then… yes. Tuesday afternoon. Please, schedule it. I trust your… judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is… best. I simply want to… get this… sorted. It is… unsettling, this feeling. But… Tuesday afternoon. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. I have scheduled you an appointment with Dr. Ramirez for Tuesday at 2:00 PM. His office is located at 123 Main Street, and his number is 555-1234. They will send you a confirmation email with details about the appointment and any necessary preparations. In the meantime, please try to get plenty of rest, eat a healthy diet, and avoid stress as much as possible. If you experience any sudden changes in your memory, such as confusion, difficulty speaking, or weakness on one side of your body, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have been… very thorough. Very kind. I… appreciate your… patience. And your… understanding. I am… simply relieved to… be taking steps. To… find out what is happening. 123 Main Street… Tuesday at two… Yes. I will… remember that. I think. Thank you, Doctor. Very much. I… truly do. It is… unsettling, this feeling. But… thank you. For everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we'll get to the bottom of this. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, Ms. Alvara. I’ll see you on Tuesday.
PATIENT: .
