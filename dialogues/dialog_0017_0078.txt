DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I am Dr. Blim. So, let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a…reset, I suppose. A jumpstart to feeling like myself again. I haven’t been feeling quite right for a while now, and I was hoping you could help me figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: “Stuck,” you say. A rather…vague complaint, Ms. Pitzel. While I appreciate a poetic description, medicine requires specifics. Can you elaborate on what “not feeling quite right” entails?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I understand. It is vague. Hmm… well, it’s a bit of everything, really. My energy levels are consistently low, even after a full night’s sleep. And I’ve been having trouble concentrating; I forget things easily, little things mostly, but it’s worrying me. It’s not like me at all. And honestly, Doctor, I just don’t have the…the drive I used to. I feel…flat. Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: Low energy, difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness… "flat," as you put it. Very well. Let’s try to establish a timeline. When did you first begin noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… It started gradually, probably around… six months ago? It was subtle at first. Just needing a little more sleep, maybe. But it’s definitely gotten worse over the last three months or so. Around the time my daughter had her first baby, actually. A lot of stress with that, I suppose, but it should have passed by now.
DOCTOR: Six months, coinciding with your daughter’s childbirth…Stress is certainly a factor. Do you have any pertinent medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major. I had the usual childhood illnesses, and I broke my wrist when I was younger. No serious surgeries or anything. I do have a little bit of high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. Just a small dose, really. And… oh, I had gestational diabetes with both of my children, but that resolved after the pregnancies. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Everything matters, Ms. Pitzel. The gestational diabetes could be relevant, though many years removed. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: It’s Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for… oh, about five years now, I think? And I take a multivitamin, but that’s it. Nothing else regularly. I try to eat a healthy diet, but… with everything, it's not always easy.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril. Very well. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, no. Well, sometimes my hands feel a little numb, but I thought it was just from working with clay all day. You know, my job? I’m a… a molder, shaper, and caster. Mostly decorative pieces, small things. It requires a lot of fine motor skills, and I’m on my feet a lot. But it’s not a constant thing, the numbness. Just occasionally.
DOCTOR: Fine motor work, occasional numbness… Hmm. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband is allergic to pollen, but that’s him, not me. I’ve always been quite lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: Lucky, you say. Right. And finally, Ms. Pitzel, do you consume alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally – perhaps once or twice a month – but that’s it. My husband and I don't smoke, and we certainly don't use any drugs. Never have. Is that… is that what you needed to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pitzel, that is all the preliminary questioning I require for now. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Please sit back, and I’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: 130 over 80… slightly elevated, but within acceptable parameters given your current medication. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… normal. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are… normal. Now, I'd like to check your neurological function. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can see it perfectly, Doctor. No trouble at all. Is this…is everything alright so far?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can. I do a lot of work with my hands, you know, shaping the clay. So hopefully they are still strong!
DOCTOR: Adequate grip strength. Now, I'm going to check your sensation. Close your eyes, please. Tell me when you feel this. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel it. Yes… and yes… and yes, there. Everything feels…normal, Doctor. Is something wrong? It all feels a bit… thorough.
DOCTOR: Sensation is intact. Everything appears normal, Ms. Pitzel. However, given your reported symptoms – fatigue, difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness – and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a thyroid panel, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. It will help rule out any underlying medical causes. I’ll also order a lipid panel, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Anything to figure out what's going on. Will these tests require a separate visit? And… how long will it take to get the results? I do have a pottery show coming up in a few weeks, and I’d like to be feeling my best for that.
DOCTOR: The lab is downstairs. It should be a relatively quick process. The results typically take 3 to 5 business days. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest and maintain a healthy diet. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop any new symptoms, contact the office immediately. While we wait for the results, I'm also going to refer you to a neurologist, just as a precaution. It’s always best to be thorough. Here. Schedule an appointment at your convenience. Do you have any further questions, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: A neurologist… That sounds… a little concerning, Doctor. But, alright. If you think it's best. Three to five business days… I can manage that. No, I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, even if it’s a bit… unsettling. I’ll schedule the appointment with the neurologist and get the lab work done as soon as possible. Have a good day, Doctor. .
