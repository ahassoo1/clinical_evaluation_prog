DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Abady, you say? A… Spanish name, isn’t it? Yes, well. I’ve been… experiencing a bit of an… issue. A rather unpleasant issue, truthfully. It’s… down there. A discharge, the young man at the desk mentioned. Not something a gentleman discusses lightly, you understand. I haven’t the foggiest why it would be happening at my age, frankly. Most peculiar.
DOCTOR: Yes, Abady is Spanish, that’s correct. And you are quite right, these things aren’t always easy to discuss. Please don’t feel any embarrassment, Mr. Krok. It's my job to help, and we encounter these issues at all ages. You mentioned a discharge. Could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Hm. Well… let me see. It’s… not a flood, thankfully. More of a… dampness. And… yellowish, I suppose. Though it could be white. My eyesight isn't what it used to be, you know. It’s been going on for… oh, a week or so, perhaps? Longer? Time does seem to slip away these days. It’s certainly… irritating. And rather… unsettling. I haven't noticed any pain, thankfully. Just this… constant feeling of… uncleanliness. My wife, bless her heart, noticed it first, naturally. She has a very keen sense of smell.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Mr. Krok. A week or so of yellowish or whitish discharge, no pain, but causing irritation and noticed by your wife. That’s very helpful. And just to be clear, has there been any change in your urination – any burning, frequency, or difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Urination… Hmm. Let me think. No burning, no, not at all. Frequency… I suppose I’ve been going a bit more often, now that you mention it. But that could simply be the weather, couldn't it? It’s been rather humid. And difficulty… no, no trouble getting it out, if you’ll pardon my bluntness. The stream seems… normal. Though, perhaps a bit… weaker than it used to be. One loses things as one ages, I suppose. It’s the natural order of things. But I haven't connected it to this… problem.
DOCTOR: No burning, slightly increased frequency potentially related to weather, and a weaker stream but not necessarily connected to the discharge. Thank you. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven't felt feverish. Not a bit. And chills… no, it's been quite warm, as I said. Lower abdomen… no pain, no. Back… well, my back always aches a little. Old age, you know. But it’s not new pain, not associated with this… affliction. Just the usual creaks and groans. I do take a little something for it, but that's beside the point. Are you certain this isn’t just… a normal part of growing old? My father never spoke of such things. Men didn't discuss these matters in my day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Krok, and your point about men not discussing these things historically is well taken. While some changes are certainly part of aging, this discharge warrants investigation. We need to rule out any potential infection or other causes. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions, and then I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Well. I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. I’m not a young man, you know. Everything is rather… delicate. But if you insist. I trust you’ve seen worse? My wife will likely want to know what you're doing, naturally. She’s quite protective. Are we talking about… prodding? Because I’m not particularly keen on being… prodded. Explain precisely what this involves, Doctor. I'd appreciate a little… decorum.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I completely understand your apprehension and will proceed with the utmost respect and decorum. I assure you, I have seen a variety of conditions and approach each patient with sensitivity. The exam will involve a visual inspection of the area, and a gentle external examination. I may also need to collect a small urine sample to check for infection. It's unlikely I will need to do anything internal, but I will explain everything step-by-step before it happens. The goal is simply to gather information and determine the cause of the discharge. We can discuss the specifics with your wife if she is present, and I will ensure you are comfortable throughout the entire process. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A urine sample, yes, that seems reasonable enough. But… a visual inspection? I hope you’re not expecting a… parade. I'm a modest man, Doctor. And gentle, you say? I should hope so! Well. Very well. If it must be done. But please, proceed with the greatest discretion. And explain everything before you touch anything. I do not like surprises. Will this… examination be cold? And will I need to… undress completely? My wife is excellent at finding drafty rooms. This is most unsettling, you know. Perhaps a blanket would be advisable?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns completely and will do everything to ensure your comfort and privacy. You will not need to undress completely. We can likely perform the visual inspection with you appropriately draped and covered. And yes, we have blankets available, and I will ensure the room is warm. I will explain each step before I proceed, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. We’ll start with the urine sample – I'll provide you with a sterile container and instructions. Then, we can move to the physical exam at your pace. Does that sound more comfortable?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… marginally better. A urine sample first, then a… draped examination. And warm, you promise? Good. And you'll explain everything. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I appreciate clarity. Lead on, then. Let's get this over with. I have a garden that requires my attention, you know. Tomatoes don’t prune themselves. Where is this… container you speak of? And should I drink something first? My wife always tells me to drink plenty of water.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll start with the urine sample then. The bathroom is right this way. I’ve left a sterile container on the counter, and instructions are posted on the door. Drinking some water beforehand is a good idea – it helps to produce a sample. About 8 ounces should be sufficient. Take your time, and let me know when you're finished. I will be just outside the door if you need anything.
