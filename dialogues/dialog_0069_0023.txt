DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… it’s my chest. It hurts a little. Not all the time, but… yeah. It's like a pain, you know? In my… breast.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing some chest pain. "A little" is helpful, but can you tell me more about the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It's not like a sharp pain. More… dull? And kinda achy. It’s… hard to explain. It feels more on the inside, not on the skin. Sometimes it feels like it’s spreading a bit, but not always. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Dull and achy, coming from inside, and sometimes spreading... Okay. And when did this pain start?
PATIENT: Um… I think maybe… a week ago? It started slow. I didn’t really pay attention at first. Thought maybe I slept funny or something. But it’s not going away. It’s… still there. Not worse, just… still there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been about a week, started gradually, and hasn't significantly worsened. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. I haven’t really tried anything to make it better. I just… tried to ignore it. I haven’t noticed anything that makes it worse either. I work… on roofs, you know? Lots of moving around. It doesn’t feel different after work. Or before work. Just… always kinda the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's consistent, not related to activity. That's good to know. Now, can you show me exactly where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right here. Mostly here. Sometimes I feel it a little bit on this side too… But mostly just… here. It’s not like a really specific spot, more… the whole area. It's hard to show you, sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. It's often difficult to pinpoint pain exactly. Thank you for showing me. And just to get a better understanding, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I haven’t felt sick or anything. No fever, no cough. Nothing like that. Just the pain. My wife said… maybe I’ve been a little more quiet than usual, but… I don’t know if that’s from the pain, or just… life, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. No fever, cough, or other illnesses. And you haven't noticed any changes in your appetite or energy levels?
PATIENT: No, everything is normal with that. I eat okay. And I’m tired after work, but that’s just… work! Roofs are hard work. Not more tired than usual. I think. I don’t know. Maybe a little? But I don’t know if that's because of the pain, or just… being tired. Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: That's alright, you're doing fine. It's helpful to know you've noticed a possible slight increase in fatigue. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing really. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. I usually just try to push through things. No heart problems, no diabetes… nothing like that. I’m pretty healthy, I think. Just… this pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was just a cast. Nothing serious. And that was… a long time ago. No hospitals, no surgeries. Just the broken arm.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mom is okay, she's old. My dad… he passed away a few years ago. He had… I think just old age things? Nothing that I know of that I need to worry about. No heart problems or anything like that in my family, as far as I know. It’s hard to say, you know? We don’t talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for those conversations to be difficult. Okay, and finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can eat anything. I take… nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I don’t need them. Never had any bad reactions to anything, as far as I know. Just… nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No allergies or current medications. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel around your chest to check for tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? It's a little sore, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your chest to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Does this feel tender here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, that hurts a little bit. Not bad, just… uncomfortable. It feels… kinda like a bruise, but I didn’t hit myself. It's not sharp, just… achy when you push. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. It does feel like some tenderness to palpation on the left side of your chest. It doesn’t appear to be anything acutely alarming, but it's good we're documenting that. And on this side, it doesn’t seem to be as tender. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your chest pain at this moment. It could be musculoskeletal pain, meaning pain originating from the muscles, bones, or cartilage in your chest wall. It’s also possible it’s costochondritis, which is inflammation of the cartilage that connects your ribs to your breastbone. However, given that you haven't had a recent injury and the pain has persisted for a week, I would like to order a chest X-ray just to rule out any other potential causes, such as pneumonia or other lung issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Um… okay. If you think it's a good idea, Doctor. I don't like going to hospitals, but… I trust you. Is it expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, and I completely respect that. We can discuss options to help minimize the expense. The cost of a chest X-ray varies, but I can check with the radiology department to get an estimate for you. We can also explore some lower-cost imaging centers in the area. Okay, a chest X-ray will cost $150 here at the clinic. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. In the meantime, while we wait for the X-ray results, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that might aggravate the pain. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, following the instructions on the label. Do you have any allergies or medical conditions that would prevent you from taking those medications?
PATIENT: No, I can take those. Ibuprofen is fine. I've taken it before for headaches. No problems. And I'll try to take it easy at work… but you know, it’s roofs. Hard to take it too easy. $150… okay. That's… manageable. Can we do the X-ray today?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can absolutely do the X-ray today. I'll have the technician come in and get you set up. It’s a very quick procedure, just a few images of your chest. Could we get a technician to room three for a chest X-ray, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Good. I’m ready when they are. I hope it doesn’t take long. I have work… you know? Trying to not fall off roofs.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It shouldn't take long at all. And safety first – always. I'll be back in the room as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, if the pain suddenly worsens, or you experience any difficulty breathing, or feel any dizziness or lightheadedness, please let the nursing staff know immediately. Do you have any questions for me before the technician arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm good. Just… get the X-ray done, and hopefully it's nothing bad. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you not making me feel like I’m crazy for complaining about chest pain. Some doctors don’t listen very well.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. It's my job to listen, and I take that very seriously. It’s important to advocate for your health, and I’m glad you came in to get this checked out. I’ll be right back with the results as soon as they’re available. .
