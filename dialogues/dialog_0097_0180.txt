DOCTOR: Hi Hedy, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have a lot of time. Just... tired. Really tired. And I been... eating dirt. Don't look at me like that. It's stupid, I know. I just... feel like I need it. It started a few months ago, maybe? I dunno. It's hard to keep track. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me. Not stupid at all – it's good you're being honest with me. Feeling excessively tired and… the dirt eating – that's what we call pica, by the way – both those things are important clues. A few months ago... can you try to pinpoint when it started, even roughly?
PATIENT: Pica? Never heard of it. Look, months ago... maybe after my husband... passed. Things get blurry. Before that, I was fine. Well, normal tired, you know? Like anyone working with those machines all day. But this is different. Makes me weak. And I just... crave it. Red clay mostly. Don’t ask me why. It's embarrassing! Can we just… get to the part where you fix it? I got work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it's completely understandable that things are blurry right now. And yes, pica – it's a craving for things that aren't food, and it can be related to underlying issues. It’s good you brought it up. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on so we can figure out the best way to help. When you say “weak,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Like... no energy. Just dragging. Can't even finish a shift without needing a nap. It’s not like normal tired, where coffee helps. This... it’s bone deep. Makes my head spin sometimes, too. And my stomach… it’s always upset. I thought it was just the dirt, but it was happening before that, too. It's just... everything is awful. Can we please stop talking about dirt? It's making me feel weird just saying it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Bone-deep fatigue and dizziness… and stomach upset. Okay. Is the stomach upset more like nausea, pain, bloating, or something else?
PATIENT: Mostly pain. Like a constant ache. Sometimes it gets really bad, feels like twisting. And…I don’t… I haven’t been…regular, you know? If you catch my drift. It’s uncomfortable. Look, I'm a simple woman, I work with machines, I don’t need a fancy diagnosis. Just fix it, okay? I got bills to pay. This is costing me money.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Hedy, and I'll do my best to help you get back on your feet. Constant stomach pain and changes in your bowel habits…those are important things to address. Before we talk about potential solutions, I just need to ask a few more questions to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Have you noticed any blood in your stool or when you use the bathroom?
PATIENT: Ugh, don’t ask me that. Seriously? Look, I'm not… I don't want to talk about that. I… maybe a little. A little bit of blood sometimes. It's not… a lot. I just figured it was… from the dirt. Rough stuff, you know? Can we just skip that part? This is horrible. I feel like I’m at the doctor for everything but the real problem. Just give me something for the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy, you don’t have to go into detail if you're uncomfortable. The blood is important information, and we'll definitely investigate that. It’s good you told me. Because of the fatigue, the stomach pain, and the blood in your stool, I think it’s important to do a few tests to rule out some possibilities. Would you be okay with a blood draw and a stool sample?
PATIENT: Tests? More money. And… a stool sample? Are you serious right now? This is ridiculous. I told you, I’m a simple woman! I work with machines, not… this! Can’t you just give me a vitamin or something? I don’t need tests. I just need to feel better. But… fine. Fine! But if it's expensive, I'm not paying for it. I got enough bills as it is. And don’t expect me to haul around… samples. Honestly. Just tell me where to go. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns about the cost, and we'll definitely talk about options to help make it manageable. We can see what assistance programs are available. As for the sample, we have collection kits here at the clinic, and the lab will cover the transport. It's a standard procedure, and honestly, it will help us rule out a few things quickly. Let's start with the blood draw. I'll have the nurse come in and get that started. Then, I'll give you instructions for the stool sample. After we get the results back, we can talk about next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. The blood first, I guess. And make the nurse quick about it, I hate needles. I really, really hate needles. Just… hurry. And don’t tell me about all the things that could be wrong. I don't need that stress. Just do the tests and tell me what to take. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Hedy. I will make sure the nurse is quick and gentle, and I won’t overwhelm you with details unless you ask. We’ll focus on getting you feeling better. I’ll just step out and get her now. She’ll be in shortly. Please, just relax as much as possible. Is there anything I can get you to make you more comfortable while you wait?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And tell her not to poke too much. Seriously. This is already awful. Hurry. Please. I got work waiting. .
