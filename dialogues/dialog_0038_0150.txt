DOCTOR: Good morning, Angelle. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get right to it. I want to have a baby. A healthy baby. And I’m… not getting any younger, you understand. I’d like to know what I need to do to make sure everything goes smoothly, without… complications. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Angelle. Completely understandable – planning for a healthy pregnancy is a very sensible approach, and age is definitely a factor we’ll want to consider. We’ll take our time and get all the necessary information. First, let’s pull up your record… Alright, Angelle Shteynberg, born… okay. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, it’s probably not that interesting. I’ve always been… robust. I broke my arm once, skiing. And I had the usual childhood illnesses. But nothing major. Divorced, as you can see. Insurance is Medicare. I work. Bicycle repair. Keeps me active, I suppose. Is that what you need? I haven’t spent a lot of time in doctor’s offices, if that’s what you’re getting at.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. “Robust” is good! And no major medical issues – that's a fantastic start. The skiing injury is noted. Bicycle repair… that is active, and generally a healthy lifestyle. Just to be thorough, have you had any serious illnesses as an adult?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses? No. Nothing that required, you know, lengthy hospital stays or anything dramatic. A few colds, the flu… I had COVID, of course, but it wasn't bad. A bit of a fever, a headache, that was it. I recovered quickly. I’m not a delicate flower, doctor. Is this going to be a long list of questions? Because I really do have things to do.
DOCTOR: No, not a long list at all, Angelle. Just covering the bases. It’s good to hear you recovered well from COVID – that’s important information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Good heavens, no. I eat properly. I don’t need… pills. Medications… occasionally, if I have a terrible headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. That’s about it. Really. I don’t believe in relying on pharmaceuticals unless absolutely necessary. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for headaches. That’s perfectly fine. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And she was a bit… anxious, always worrying about things. My father… he died of something or other. A heart attack, maybe? It was a long time ago, I don’t really remember the details. They weren't exactly forthcoming with information, if you catch my drift. Not a very… communicative family. Is knowing what my parents had going to change anything?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know, even if the details are limited. High blood pressure and a possible heart attack are worth noting, and anxiety can sometimes have a genetic component. We’ll want to consider those possibilities. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely none. I’ve eaten everything. Travelled everywhere. I’m not one of those… sensitive types. Dust doesn’t bother me, pollen doesn’t bother me, cats don’t bother me… nothing. Honestly, doctor, I’m remarkably healthy. Are you starting to see that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Angelle, I am. You’ve certainly presented as a very robust and healthy individual. That’s excellent. To get a clearer picture of your overall health, would you mind if we did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Must we? I don’t really see the point, frankly. I feel perfectly fine. But if you insist. Just… try to be quick, alright? I don't enjoy being poked and prodded unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s standard procedure when planning a pregnancy, just to ensure everything is functioning optimally. We’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. If you’d like to change into a gown, we can start with your blood pressure, heart rate, and a quick listen to your lungs. Then we’ll do a basic abdominal exam. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Look, doctor, with all due respect, I'm not entirely comfortable with this. I told you I'm healthy. Do you really need to listen to my lungs? I just want to know what I need to do to have a baby, not undergo a full medical investigation. Can’t you just… tell me if there’s anything I need to be concerned about based on what I’ve already told you?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to question me, Angelle. I apologize if I’m pushing too hard. It’s my job to be thorough, but I also respect your concerns and your assessment of your own health. Perhaps we can approach this differently. While a full physical exam would be ideal, we can certainly proceed with a focused discussion about preconception health. We can talk about important nutrients, lifestyle factors, and potential risks based on your family history. However, I do want to strongly recommend a blood test. It will give us valuable information about your hormone levels, thyroid function, and any potential deficiencies. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A blood test… that seems… reasonable. Less invasive, at least. Fine. I’ll agree to a blood test. But no unnecessary poking and prodding, alright? Just the blood test. And then you tell me what I need to do to make this happen. I don’t have time for endless appointments and tests.
DOCTOR: Excellent. A blood test is a great first step. I completely understand your desire to be efficient. We'll get that ordered right away. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They're expecting you. It's just a standard panel, nothing too extensive. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a personalized plan for you. In the meantime, I'd like to give you a handout with information about folic acid supplementation and a list of foods to avoid during pregnancy. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Fine. Folic acid… I've heard of that. Good. Give me the list. I suppose I can… skim it. Honestly, doctor, I eat a perfectly balanced diet. But if you insist. So, that’s it? I get the blood test, then you call me? No need to wait around here for hours, is there?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s it for today. Just the blood test, then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment. I'll have my assistant, Sarah, call you with the results as soon as they’re available. She’ll also be happy to schedule the follow-up appointment then. It was lovely meeting you, Angelle. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Goodbye. .
