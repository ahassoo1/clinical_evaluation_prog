DOCTOR: Hi Mikeisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. It is… my sinuses. They have been bothering me. For… some time now, I think. It’s hard to say exactly how long. A while.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a while” is helpful, but let's try to narrow that down a bit if we can. Would you say weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Hmm… months, I believe. Maybe… four or five months? It comes and goes, you see. Not every day is bad. But when it is bad… it is very uncomfortable. I have a… pressure, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, four or five months of intermittent sinus pressure. And when you say pressure, can you tell me where exactly you feel it?
PATIENT: Here, mostly. And… sometimes, here. It feels… full. Like when you have a very bad cold, but not as bad. No fever, thankfully. Just… stuffy and heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so forehead, cheeks, and bridge of your nose. No fever, just stuffiness and pressure. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with that—like a runny nose, cough, sore throat, or anything like that?
PATIENT: A runny nose… yes, sometimes. Mostly… clear. Not much color. And… I think a little cough. Not a bad one. Just when I lay down at night, sometimes. It doesn’t keep me awake or anything. A little scratchy, maybe? It's difficult to remember everything, you see. It all feels… jumbled.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be hard to keep track. Clear runny nose and a scratchy cough when lying down. Have you tried anything to relieve the symptoms – over-the-counter medications, nasal rinses, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. We… do not have much money for those things. I try to drink lots of water. And… rest when I can. But it does not always help. My husband, he suggests… something with eucalyptus? But I do not know. I do not like strong smells much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no medications, just water and rest. And you’re hesitant about eucalyptus due to the smell. That's good to know. Do you have any allergies that you're aware of—to foods, medications, pollen, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I have never been told I am allergic to anything. I eat… everything, usually. And I have not taken many medicines in my life. We don't go to the doctor often. Unless it's… really bad. I remember being stung by a bee once, when I was a little girl, but I did not have a bad reaction. Just… a little swollen.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, chronic bronchitis, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have always been… healthy, I think. Strong, mostly. I work very hard, you see. Out in the oil fields. It is… dusty work, sometimes. But I have not had any trouble breathing, not until… maybe recently. But that could just be the weather. It has been very hot and dry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of lung conditions. Dusty work in the oil fields is good to know. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospital… no. Not that I can remember. I had my babies, of course. But that was a long time ago. And… I think I had my tonsils out when I was very small. But that was in El Salvador, before we came to America. It was a long time ago. Everything is… hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, and your babies. No other surgeries or hospitalizations that you recall. And what about your family – do you know of any family members with allergies, asthma, or similar conditions?
PATIENT: My mother… she always coughed a lot when she was old. A little bit of asthma, I think. Not very bad, but enough that she had to use an inhaler sometimes. And my brother… he has very bad allergies. To pollen, mostly. He sneezes a lot. My father… he was strong. Never sick. But I do not have much contact with my family anymore. They are all still in El Salvador.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of asthma in your mother and allergies in your brother. That's good information to have. Now, just a few more quick questions, and then I'll do a quick exam. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I do not like taking pills. I try to eat healthy and get enough rest. That is enough for me, usually. My husband, he takes something for his blood pressure, but that is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And finally, do you smoke, or are you exposed to secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor! Never. Smoking is… bad for you. My husband does not smoke either. We stay away from it. Out in the oil fields, some of the men smoke, but I try to stay away from the smell. It makes me cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or secondhand smoke exposure. Thank you, Mikeisha. That gives me a good idea of your overall health. Now, if you don’t mind, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears, nose, and throat, and listen to your lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, let me take a look at your ears. And now your nose… hmm. Your nasal passages are a little congested, but no signs of infection. Your throat is a little bit red, but no visible signs of strep or anything concerning. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Okay, take a deep breath… and exhale… one more time… deep breath in… and out. Your lungs sound a little bit wheezy, but nothing too alarming. It could be related to the congestion and the work you do.
PATIENT: Wheezy? That does not sound good, Doctor. Is that… serious? It is the oil fields, you think? I worry sometimes about the dust. It gets everywhere.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious right now, Mikeisha, but it's something we need to pay attention to. The wheezing could certainly be aggravated by the dust in the oil fields. It could also be a sign of some mild inflammation in your airways. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order a chest X-ray, just to rule out anything more serious like pneumonia or bronchitis. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Is that… expensive? We do not have much money, you see. And… is it safe? I have heard things about radiation.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mikeisha. I understand your worries about cost and safety. An X-ray is relatively inexpensive, and the amount of radiation is very low—much less than you’d receive from a cross-country flight, for example. We can also check if the clinic has any financial assistance programs available to help with the cost. It's important to get a clear picture of what’s going on in your lungs, and an X-ray is the best way to do that. If you're not comfortable with it, we can explore other options, but it will make it harder to determine the cause of your symptoms. Would you like me to check into the financial assistance programs for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please, check for the assistance. If there is help… that would be good. I do not want to get more sick, and I do not want to spend all our money.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will definitely look into that for you right away. While I'm doing that, let’s talk about some things you can do to feel better in the meantime. I’m going to recommend that you use a saline nasal spray a few times a day to help keep your nasal passages moist and clear out some of the congestion. Also, try to avoid exposure to dust as much as possible. If you have a mask at work, make sure to wear it consistently. And drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. I’m also going to write you a prescription for an albuterol inhaler. It’s a quick-relief medication that can help open up your airways if you start to feel short of breath or wheezy. It’s not a long-term solution, but it can provide temporary relief. Here’s the prescription for the inhaler, and I’ll also give you some information about using the saline spray. We'll get the X-ray scheduled as soon as we can confirm the financial assistance. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: An inhaler… that sounds strong. Will it make me feel… dizzy? And… the saline spray, is that easy to use? I am not good with those things sometimes. And… thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. It's my job to help. The albuterol inhaler is generally well-tolerated, but dizziness is a possible side effect, although it's not very common. If you do feel dizzy, just sit down and take slow, deep breaths. We'll start with a low dose to see how you tolerate it. And the saline spray is very easy to use—you just tilt your head back, insert the nozzle into your nostril, and squeeze the bottle. I’ll have the nurse show you how to use it properly before you leave. Since you have been feeling this way for several months, and your work exposes you to dust, I also think it would be a good idea to refer you to a pulmonologist—a lung specialist. They can perform more comprehensive testing to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and recommend a long-term treatment plan. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A specialist… that sounds expensive too. And more doctors… I do not want to keep going to so many people. Is it… really necessary? Maybe if I just avoid the dust more… and use the spray… would that be enough? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and seeing more doctors, Mikeisha. It's frustrating to navigate the healthcare system. However, given the duration of your symptoms and your work environment, it's important to rule out any underlying lung conditions. A pulmonologist can perform tests—like a pulmonary function test—to assess how well your lungs are working, which can help us determine the best course of action. We can also explore options for affordable care and financial assistance for the specialist visit. I’m going to give you a referral to a pulmonologist, but you are not obligated to see them. I want you to feel comfortable and in control of your healthcare. In the meantime, focus on using the saline spray, avoiding dust as much as possible, and using the albuterol inhaler as needed. If your symptoms worsen—if you experience severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Emergency room… that sounds scary. I will try the spray and the inhaler… and I will try to avoid the dust. And… I will think about the specialist. Thank you, Doctor. You have given me… a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. It is a lot to take in, and you’re right to feel overwhelmed. Remember, I'm here to support you. Here’s the referral information, the prescription, and some information about using the saline spray and inhaler. The nurse will be in shortly to review everything with you before you leave. If you have any questions or concerns later on, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. I hope you feel better soon. And please, prioritize avoiding the dust as much as possible, and don't hesitate to use the inhaler if you're experiencing any difficulty breathing. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Amussen. You have been very kind. I will try my best. .
