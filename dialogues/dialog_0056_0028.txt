DOCTOR: Hi Nadene, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it’s been feeling a little funny with it. It’s been going on for… oh, maybe three weeks now? Longer, even. I lose track sometimes, you know. But it’s definitely bothering me more lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks or longer with a cough and some heart palpitations… I understand. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Can you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a bad cough all the time, you know? Sometimes it’s just a little tickle, and I have to clear my throat. But other times… other times it feels deep down, and I have to really cough to get it out. It doesn’t bring up much, though. Just a little… clear stuff, mostly. Not much color to it, if that makes sense. And it’s worse when I lie down, definitely. I have to prop myself up with pillows to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it varies – sometimes a tickle, sometimes deeper, mostly clear mucus, and worse when lying down. That’s helpful. And you mentioned your heart feeling funny. Can you describe that sensation for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s hard to explain. It’s not pain, exactly. More like… fluttering? Like a little bird trying to get out of a cage, maybe? It doesn’t last long, usually just a few seconds. And it happens when I cough, sometimes. Not every time, but often enough that I notice it. It makes me a little breathless, too, when it happens. It’s just… unsettling, you know? I worry about my heart. It’s old, after all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your heart, especially with the fluttering and breathlessness. Let's get some more information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough and heart palpitations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I get tired pretty easily, but I’m 89 years old, so that’s not new. My ankles do swell up some in the evenings, always have when I’ve been on my feet too long. And… oh! I’ve been a little more short of breath than usual, even when I’m just walking around the house. Nothing terrible, but I have to stop and catch my breath sometimes. And I haven't been eating as much lately. Everything just… tastes bland, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, ankle swelling, increased shortness of breath even with minimal activity, and a decreased appetite. That gives me a better picture. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or sweats. Definitely not. I've felt warm sometimes, but that's just the weather, you know? It’s been awfully hot these last few weeks. And I sleep pretty well, even with the cough. I just need a lot of pillows! No, nothing like a fever or feeling cold. Just tired and… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, have you been around anyone who’s been sick recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Old Man Hemandez down the street had a bad cold last week, I think. But I didn’t get close to him. Just waved hello from across the yard, you know? My daughter, Elena, she had a little sniffle a couple of weeks ago, but she said it was just allergies. Other than that… no, not really. I try to stay mostly to myself these days. It’s safer, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent close contact with anyone sick. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, the doctor told me years ago I have… congestive heart failure, that’s what he called it. It means my heart doesn’t pump as strong as it should. And I have high blood pressure, too. I take pills for both of them, every day. I can't remember the names of the pills, though. Elena helps me keep track of those. And… oh, I had pneumonia a few years back. A bad case, it was. But I got over it, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Okay, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, and a history of pneumonia. That’s important information. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh, I had my gallbladder out when I was younger. A long time ago, that was. And… I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my hip a couple of years ago. Fell in the garden, it was. But that's about it, I think. No other surgeries or long hospital stays. Mostly just regular check-ups with the doctor, you know? And that pneumonia, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family... My husband, God rest his soul, he had a bad heart too. He passed away ten years ago. My daughter, Elena, she’s healthy as a horse, thank goodness. She lives nearby and helps me out a lot. And I have a grandson, Miguel, he lives in Florida. He calls sometimes. No one else in the family had a heart problem like mine, I don't think. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any pills, as far as I can remember. Elena always tells the doctor if she knows of anything. I eat everything, mostly. I like my platanos and black beans, you know. No allergies, no. Just getting old, that’s my problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. It won't take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I’m used to doctors listening to my heart, you know. It’s not a very happy sound these days, but what can you do? Go right ahead, Doctor. I’ll sit still.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take nice, deep breaths for me, please. Okay… I do hear some crackling in your lungs, especially on the lower right side. And your heart… it’s a little bit irregular, and the rhythm is weak. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 160 over 90. And yes, I can feel some swelling in both of your ankles, and a little bit of pitting edema when I press on them. Now, I would like to order a chest x-ray and an EKG to get a better picture of what's going on in your lungs and heart. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Crackling and irregular… My heart has been feeling funny. Yes, an x-ray and… what did you call it? An EKG? Yes, do whatever you think is best, Doctor. If it can help me feel better, then yes, please. Elena can help me get there, I’m sure. She drives. I just hope it’s not too serious. This cough… it’s just been wearing me out.
DOCTOR: It's good that we're getting this checked out, Nadene. The x-ray and EKG will give us more information. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's best to be thorough. I’m also going to order a basic blood panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Based on your symptoms and the initial exam findings, it sounds like your congestive heart failure may be worsening, and the cough could be related to fluid buildup in your lungs. We’ll need those tests to confirm that. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a diuretic, also known as a water pill, to help you get rid of some of that extra fluid. It’s called Furosemide. It will help your body get rid of extra water and salt through your urine. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh, a water pill… I think I’ve heard of those. To get rid of the extra water… yes, that makes sense. My ankles are awfully swollen. Furosemide… Is that hard to take? Elena usually handles my pills, but I like to know what I’m taking, you know? And… it won’t make me worse, will it? I get a little nervous about new medicines. It sounds complicated, all this fluid and… electrolytes. But I trust you, Doctor. If you think it will help, then I’ll try it.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly reasonable to be nervous about new medications. Furosemide is generally well-tolerated, but it can have some side effects. The most common one is increased urination, which is actually the goal – to get rid of the extra fluid. It can also cause some dizziness, especially when you stand up quickly, and it can lower your potassium levels, which is why we're getting the blood panel. The dosage I’m prescribing is 20 milligrams once a day in the morning. It’s important to take it at the same time each day. I’ll also give you a handout with more information about the medication, including the potential side effects. I want you to monitor your weight daily, and if you notice any sudden weight gain or increased shortness of breath, please call the office immediately. And be careful when standing up, especially in the mornings, to avoid dizziness. I'm also going to give Elena a referral to a cardiologist – a heart specialist – for a more comprehensive evaluation. This will help us get a better understanding of your heart condition and develop the best long-term treatment plan for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a lot to remember. Daily weight… increased shortness of breath… dizziness… and a heart specialist. Elena will be so helpful with all of this, you know. She's very organized. A cardiologist… yes, that sounds good. Maybe they can fix my heart, or at least make it feel a little bit better. 20 milligrams in the morning… I’ll tell Elena to set an alarm. And I'll try to remember the weight thing. It's just… everything feels a little overwhelming. But you've explained everything so clearly, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not making me feel like I'm just an old woman with a cough.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. It’s my job to listen and help you feel better. And you’re not just an old woman with a cough – you’re a valued patient, and I want to make sure we get to the bottom of this and manage your condition effectively. I'm going to print out those prescriptions and the handout for Furosemide, as well as the referral to the cardiologist. I’ll also send a copy of my findings to Elena’s email address. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Just… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind a little bit at ease. I’m glad I came in. And please tell Elena I said thank you for everything, too. She worries about me, you know. She’s a good daughter. I think I just need to sit down now, and let her take care of the rest. Is there a waiting room where I can sit for a few minutes?
DOCTOR: Of course. I will have the nurse escort you to the waiting room after she prints out those documents. She can also help you schedule a follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. And don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this together. It was nice meeting you, Nadene. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor Amussen. Thank you for everything. .
