DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s… well, it’s my stomach. It’s been acting up. Food keeps… coming back up. It’s a nuisance, really. And frankly, I don’t have all day to sit here and discuss it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Acting up” and… coming back up, you said. Vomiting, then?
PATIENT: No, not vomiting. Not like that. It’s more… a return trip. You know, after I eat. It just… comes back up. It’s unpleasant. Look, do we really need to dissect every little detail? It’s food. Going the wrong way. Is that enough for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Mr. Altine. It sounds… like regurgitation, then?
PATIENT: Regur… what now? Look, I don't speak doctor-talk. Just… food comes back up. It happens after I eat. Is that so hard to understand? Honestly, sometimes I wonder about these medical professionals. It’s a simple problem. A simple return of food. No need to make it complicated.
DOCTOR: You’re right to tell me, Mr. Altine. Apologies for the doctor-speak. Food coming back up after eating – that’s what we’re talking about. And it’s good you're pointing out it's a simple problem, because most of the time, that’s exactly what it is. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When? Well, usually it’s a few hours after I eat. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Could be a sandwich, could be a nice plate of pierogi… makes no difference. A couple of hours later, up it comes. It’s not constant, thank goodness. But it’s frequent enough to be annoying. And messy. I don’t like making a mess. Do I need to list everything I ate last week? Is that what you want?
DOCTOR: No, no, listing everything isn’t necessary at all. Just a few hours after eating, regardless of the food… that gives me some idea. And it’s not constant, just frequent enough to be annoying. Okay. Is there anything else that seems to bring it on?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes if I lie down too soon after eating. That seems to make it worse. And… honestly? Sometimes after my wife makes something a little… spicy. She likes to experiment. She means well, but her cooking… let’s just say it doesn’t always agree with my stomach. She'll try anything. It's a nuisance, really. Are we getting anywhere with this? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are, Mr. Altine, thank you. Lying down soon after eating and sometimes after spicy food… that's very helpful. Does it happen every time you lie down, or just sometimes?
PATIENT: Just sometimes! Not every time. If I sit up for a bit, it’s usually fine. But if I… relax a little too much right after a meal? That's when trouble starts. Honestly, it's just common sense. Don't lie down with a full stomach. Why is this so difficult to understand? It's basic biology, really. I feel like I'm explaining the obvious. Are we done here? I really don't want to spend the rest of my afternoon talking about my digestion.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, it does sound like common sense. And you’re explaining it perfectly. I just need to rule a few things out to be sure. Now, have you noticed any heartburn or indigestion along with this?
PATIENT: Heartburn? Look, I'm not a delicate flower. A little discomfort? Sure. But full-blown heartburn? No. And indigestion… well, sometimes my stomach feels a little… off. But nothing major. Honestly, I've got a pretty strong constitution. I grew up on pierogi and kielbasa, you know. That builds character. And a sturdy stomach. I'm not one of these people who needs coddling over every little ache and pain. So no, no serious heartburn. Is that sufficient? I really would like to be going now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. No significant heartburn. Okay. Now, just a few more quick questions, Mr. Altine. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
