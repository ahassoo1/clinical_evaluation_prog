DOCTOR: Right. Demondre, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Demondre Heindel. Good to meet you, Doctor... uh, Murtic, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Doctor Murtic. Though just Murtic is fine, if you must. Now, let’s not waste time. You're here today for…?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Well, to be honest, I just… wanted to check things out. Been feelin’ okay, mostly. Just figured it couldn’t hurt to get a look-over, you know? I don’t really have anything wrong, if that makes sense. Just…curiosity, I guess.
DOCTOR: “Just curiosity.” Right. Well, preventative care is… admirable, I suppose. Though generally, people come to see a doctor when something is wrong, not when they're feeling “mostly” okay. Tell me, when was the last time you saw a physician?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It’s been a while. Probably… before the divorce, maybe? A couple years back, at least. It was just a quick check-up then, nothing serious. Work usually keeps me pretty busy, so I don’t really have time to go to the doctor unless I need to, you know?
DOCTOR: A couple of years. And in those two years, you’ve experienced no illness, no injuries, no changes in your health whatsoever?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing that needed a doctor, anyway. I pulled a muscle on the ship once, but my coworker wrapped it up and it felt better in a couple days. Just aches and pains from the job, mostly. It’s hard work, bein’ a sailor and oiler. Lots of liftin’ and bendin’. But nothin’ serious, I promise. Just the usual wear and tear, you know?
DOCTOR: “Wear and tear.” Of course. And what exactly does this “wear and tear” entail?
PATIENT: Well… my back gets sore sometimes, especially after a long shift. My shoulders too, from luggin’ those oil drums around. And my hands get kinda rough and cracked from the salt water and grease. Nothing I can’t handle, really. I just put some lotion on my hands at night, and try not to lift anything too heavy if I can help it. It’s part of the job, you know? I’m used to it. I guess I just wanted to make sure it wasn’t somethin’ more than just the usual aches.
DOCTOR: So, primarily musculoskeletal complaints. Back and shoulder pain, rough skin on your hands. And no other symptoms?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. I sleep okay, eat okay… maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? Nothing that keeps me from workin’. I haven’t been coughin’ or sneezin’ or anything like that. Just… feelin’ pretty normal, all things considered. Honestly, I probably just worried myself over nothin’. I just thought it was a good idea to get checked out. Better safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: “Better safe than sorry.” A commendable sentiment, though frankly, a waste of valuable resources. But alright. Let’s proceed with a basic physical exam, just to appease your… anxieties. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Yeah, sure, a physical exam sounds good. Uh, allergies… not that I know of. I haven’t really taken much medicine in my life, to be honest. Maybe some ibuprofen for a headache once or twice, but that’s about it. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I think I'm good there. But, just in case, what kinda stuff are you checkin' for? Just curious.
DOCTOR: Standard vitals: blood pressure, pulse, respiration. Auscultation of the heart and lungs. Palpation of the abdomen. Range of motion in your joints. Neurological assessment. We'll assess your musculoskeletal system as you mentioned discomfort. I'm looking for anything abnormal. Now, if you’ll please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, okay, that sounds… thorough. Yeah, sure, I can lie down. Is there anything I need to do? Like, should I cross my arms or anything? I don’t want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Just relax. Arms at your sides. And try to breathe normally. I'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if somethin' feels weird, okay? Don’t want you squeezin’ too hard. I’ve got kinda thin veins.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is… elevated. Slightly. And your lungs sound clear, though there is a subtle… wheezing on exhale. Do you have a history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Wheezin’? Oh. Uh, no, not that I know of. Never been diagnosed with asthma or anything. My grandpa had bronchitis once, I think, but not me. Maybe it's just from… bein’ on the ship? Lots of dust and salt spray. We don’t exactly have air conditioning down there. Is that bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It could be environmental. Though it warrants further investigation. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just let me know if you find somethin’, okay? This is kinda weird. Is everything alright down there?
DOCTOR: And did you experience any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yeah, a little. Right there. Not bad bad, just…sensitive. Like a little pinch. I dunno, maybe I just ate somethin' weird last night? We had fish. Could be gas? It's usually fine, I promise. Just bein’ poked and prodded is makin’ me tense up.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the lower right quadrant, and a history of eating fish. While it could be simple indigestion, it could also indicate something more serious. Now, tell me about your bowel movements. Frequency, consistency, any pain or blood?
PATIENT: Oh boy. Uh… well, pretty regular, I guess. Usually once a day. Consistency is…normal? Not too hard, not too soft. And no, no pain or blood, thankfully. Just… normal. Sorry to get so graphic. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary to gather a complete medical history. Now, let's move on to your musculoskeletal system. I'll need you to rotate your shoulders, elbows, and wrists. Start with your shoulders.
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It’s a little creaky, sorry, like I said, it's from the work. I do a lot of heavy lifting. Is that bad for my shoulders?
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion, with crepitus on rotation. While crepitus isn’t necessarily alarming, it indicates underlying joint degeneration. Now, elbows.
PATIENT: Okay, elbows. Like this? It's kinda hard to explain, it's just a general ache. It doesn't really hurt, unless I really strain myself. I try not to push it too hard, you know?
DOCTOR: And finally, wrists. Flexion, extension, rotation.
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It's kinda hard to get a good rotation, it's just stiff, probably from all the work. I do a lot of twisting and turning with ropes and stuff. Is everything alright? You're writin' a lot. Is there somethin' wrong?
DOCTOR: Frankly, you present a constellation of findings that, while not immediately alarming, warrant further investigation. Limited range of motion in multiple joints, crepitus, tenderness in the lower right quadrant, and wheezing. I want to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. We’ll also need a urinalysis. And I'm going to refer you to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of the abdominal tenderness.
PATIENT: Whoa. Okay. That sounds… a lot. A blood count, a chest X-ray… and a gastroenterologist? Is everything really that bad? I just thought I was a little achy from work. What are you lookin’ for, exactly? And how long is this gonna take? I have a ship to catch, you know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, you presented for a “general check-up” despite reporting multiple symptoms over an extended period. I'm not going to dismiss potential underlying issues simply because you attribute them to “work.” The blood count will assess for inflammation and infection. The metabolic panel will evaluate your organ function. The chest X-ray will rule out any respiratory pathology. And the gastroenterologist will investigate the source of the abdominal tenderness. It's a precautionary measure. The tests can be done at the lab downstairs, and the results should be available within 48 hours. I'll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. As for the gastroenterologist, their availability will vary. I will provide you with a referral and contact information. Now, do you have any questions?
PATIENT: 48 hours... okay. And the gastroenterologist... what are they lookin' for specifically? Like, is it somethin' serious? And what about the ship? I’m scheduled to leave on Friday. Is it okay if I wait until after that to see them? I can get it checked out when I get back… I just... I don't want to lose my job over this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, delaying medical evaluation is rarely advisable. While I understand your concern regarding your employment, I cannot in good conscience recommend postponing a referral to a specialist simply for convenience. The gastroenterologist will be looking for any abnormalities in your digestive system, ranging from inflammation to structural issues. While it’s possible the tenderness is benign, it's equally possible it’s indicative of a more serious condition. We need to rule out potential causes. As for waiting until after your voyage, I strongly advise against it. However, if you absolutely insist, you will need to sign a waiver acknowledging the potential risks of delaying evaluation. And I will document your refusal in your medical record. Now, do you have any allergies to contrast dye, should imaging be required?
PATIENT: A waiver...? Okay. That doesn’t sound good. But… losing my job would be worse. Look, I… I don’t know anything about contrast dye. I’ve never had an imaging scan before. No allergies, as far as I know. But… could it wait just a little while? Like, until I get back from this voyage? I’m leaving Friday, and I won’t be back for at least two weeks. I can schedule an appointment as soon as I get back, I promise. Is that okay? I really need this job.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Heindel. You may postpone the referral to gastroenterology for two weeks. However, you must understand that any delay could exacerbate a potential underlying condition. If you experience any worsening symptoms – increased abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits – you must seek immediate medical attention, regardless of your voyage. I will provide you with the referral information, and I expect you to schedule an appointment upon your return. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No worsening symptoms, I got it. I’ll schedule an appointment as soon as I get back. Thank you, Doctor Murtic. Really. I appreciate you workin’ with me. What about the blood work and X-ray? Do I need to do that now, before I leave?
DOCTOR: Yes. The lab and radiology are downstairs. The lab will draw blood, and radiology will perform the chest X-ray. You will need to bring your insurance card and a valid form of identification. I will have my nurse forward the orders to both departments. Once the results are available, she will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions, Mr. Heindel?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Murtic. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Mr. Heindel. And do try to prioritize your health.
