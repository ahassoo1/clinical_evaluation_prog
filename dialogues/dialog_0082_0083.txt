DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Iuzzolino, you say? A bit of a name, that is. Well, I don't usually come to doctors unless I have to. But my daughter... she thinks I need a little… encouragement. A card, she said. From you. A "get well" card. Is that how you do things here?
DOCTOR: Well, that’s… a unique way of putting it. We generally use cards to document a visit, yes, after we’ve discussed what’s going on. Your daughter sounds like a caring woman. So, to clarify… what's been bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Nothing’s bothering me, Doctor. I feel… fine. Regular. Like a machine, you know? I operate things. Boilers, mostly. Big ones. Always gotta be regular. My daughter just thinks… I should write things down more. Like a log. But a card from the doctor… that’s her idea, not mine. You understand? I just need a card to show her I came. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: I see… So, you’re feeling generally well, but your daughter is concerned and suggested this visit to… document your health?
PATIENT: That’s right. Document. She calls it “preventative care”. Sounds fancy. I just need the card, Doctor. With your signature. So she stops… hovering. Is that so much to ask? I’ve been regular for sixty years, you know. Never a problem. A card will prove it to her.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand wanting to reassure your daughter. Before I simply write a note, though, would you mind if I asked a few quick questions, just to get a better understanding of your overall health?
PATIENT: Questions? Really, Doctor? I told you, I'm regular. Like clockwork. But… alright. If it makes her happy. Just don't expect anything exciting. I mostly just… look at things. Boilers, pipes… things that don’t talk back. What kind of questions? Hopefully not about… feelings. I don't do feelings.
DOCTOR: No feelings, I promise. Just a few routine things. Let’s start with this: Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Well, now… that's a good question. I haven’t stood on a scale in… a long time, to be honest. I'm built like a boiler, you know? Solid. Always the same. But… I suppose my clothes feel a little… looser. Maybe. It’s been hot, though. Things expand in the heat. Just like metal. Does that count? Is that what you’re asking about?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. We're just trying to see if there's been a significant change. And you mentioned feeling looser… about how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: How long…? Hmm. Well, let me think. The heat… it started properly about a month ago, I’d say. June. Maybe a little before. My daughter noticed first, naturally. She notices everything. She says I'm losing my… “bulk”. Whatever that means. I'm still solid. Just a little… less contained, perhaps. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. I’m not a doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: A month, approximately. And she noticed a difference in your… overall size. Okay. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? I eat when I'm hungry, Doctor. Same as always. A good breakfast, a decent lunch… Sometimes a little something in the evening. Nothing fancy. No cravings or anything like that. I’m not one for sweets. Or anything complicated. I mostly eat… regular food. Like a machine, you know? Fuel. Does that answer your question? I'm a simple man. Simple needs.
DOCTOR: Regular food, consistent appetite… Alright. Have you noticed any difficulty with your digestion?
PATIENT: Digestion? Now that’s a personal question, Doctor. I operate boilers, you know. I understand pressure. Things move through me just fine. Always have. I haven't had any... issues. Problems. Blockages. I'm a regular machine, I told you! Everything's… contained. And consistent. Is this really necessary? All for a card?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m being intrusive, Mr. Kammer. It's standard to ask these questions, even if everything seems… regular, as you say. Just one more, and then we can move on. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits?! Doctor, with all due respect… Are you serious? I came here for a card to appease my daughter, not a… a full examination! I am a stationary engineer, a man of… systems! Not a topic for polite conversation! I’ve told you everything you need to know. I’m regular! I eat! I digest! Everything is contained! Now, can we please just get the card? Before I have to explain this to my daughter? This is… undignified. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your discomfort. It seems like I've pushed too far. My apologies. You’re right, a card is what you came for. Before I write it, though, would you be willing to let me quickly check your blood pressure and pulse?
