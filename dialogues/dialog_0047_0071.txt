DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s about getting some shots. My daughter… she’s trying to get her husband settled here, you see. He’s from over in… well, not from around here, and I believe he needs certain vaccinations for his visa. I’m trying to help her figure out what all is required. It’s a bit confusing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Vaccinations for a visa, you say. Right. And you’re hoping I can advise on what he needs?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am, that’s right. She asked me to come in, as I’m… well, I’m good with paperwork and such, and I thought a doctor would know best what’s needed. I don’t even know where to begin looking, to be honest. It's all new to me.
DOCTOR: Well, it is a bit outside the usual scope of things, frankly. Visa requirements… they change, and it depends where he’s coming from, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. He’s from… let me see… Ukraine. That’s right, Ukraine. Does that change things much, Doctor? I'm afraid I don't know all the details about what countries need what. She just asked me to get a list of what he’d likely need to get started.
DOCTOR: Ukraine… yes, that does make a difference. There are specific recommendations for immigrants and visa applicants depending on their country of origin. Let me pull up the CDC guidelines… Alright. It appears he’ll likely need documentation of MMR – measles, mumps, rubella – vaccination, varicella – that’s chickenpox – and an updated tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis booster, if he hasn't had one in the last ten years. And depending on his age and previous exposures, influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations are also usually recommended. Do you happen to know if he has any records of previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a lot of names. No, I don’t believe she has any records. He left Ukraine quite a while ago, you see, and I don’t think he brought anything with him. Would we need to… start over, then? Is there a way to find out if he’s had them without records? I’m just trying to get a handle on what’s involved.
DOCTOR: Well, without records, we’d have to assume he hasn’t had them and proceed with the vaccinations. It’s the safest course of action, really. Titers can be done, but they are expensive and not always reliable. And truthfully, it’s often simpler to just revaccinate. It's also important to know, these vaccinations require a series of shots, spaced out over time. It won't be a one-and-done situation.
PATIENT: Oh, a series of shots… That sounds… complicated. And expensive, I imagine. My daughter’s a teacher, you see, and they don’t make a lot of money. Is there a way to… spread out the cost, perhaps? Or are there any programs that might help with the expense? I wouldn’t want to burden her too much.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, I’m not aware of any specific programs to assist with visa-related vaccinations. We do offer a payment plan, but it still requires upfront costs. Honestly, these are requirements he needs to meet for his visa, and the financial responsibility generally falls to him… or those sponsoring him. We can discuss the cost of each vaccine individually, if you’d like, and you can determine what’s feasible for your daughter. But I must be frank, it’s not an inexpensive undertaking.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. I figured as much. Well, let’s talk about the costs, then. Perhaps we can prioritize which ones are absolutely necessary to get started. What’s the most important one to begin with, in your opinion? And how much does that one cost? I just need to get a sense of what we're dealing with.
DOCTOR: The most critical, given his country of origin and potential immigration status, would be the MMR vaccine. Measles is highly contagious, and documentation is almost always required. It’s a two-dose series, administered at least 28 days apart. The cost per dose is… let me see… $150. So, $300 for the series. And then, of course, there’s the cost of the consultation fee for each visit to administer the shots. Do you want me to go ahead and schedule the first appointment, then?
PATIENT: Three hundred dollars… That's… a good bit. But I suppose it’s better to start with the most important one. Yes, let’s go ahead and schedule the first appointment. What day would work best? And how long does the appointment usually take? I need to make sure my daughter can get time off work. She has a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Alright. I have an opening next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. The appointment itself will be relatively brief – about 30 minutes – primarily for administration of the shot and a brief observation period to monitor for any immediate reactions. However, there is paperwork involved, and I will need to review his medical history with you. So, allow at least an hour overall. Does that time work for your daughter?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM… Yes, I believe she can make that work. An hour, you say? Alright, that’s good. Is there anything she needs to bring with her besides… well, herself? Any previous medical records, even if they are old? Or anything else I should be aware of? I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: As we’ve discussed, any previous medical records would be helpful, but we are proceeding as if there are none. It would be beneficial if she could list any known allergies or medical conditions on a piece of paper beforehand, just to expedite the process. And I must stress, she needs to be prepared for the possibility of mild side effects – fever, soreness at the injection site – after the shot. It's normal, but she needs to be aware of it. Otherwise, just herself and a valid form of identification. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Doctor. Allergies and medical conditions on a piece of paper, and be prepared for side effects. We’ll make a note of everything. Thank you for explaining it so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. So, Tuesday at 2:00 PM it is. I believe that’s all we need for now, then.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Tuesday at 2:00 PM. My nurse will contact your daughter to confirm the appointment details. Please arrive 15 minutes early to complete the necessary paperwork. Do you have any further questions, or can we conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and assistance. We’ll be sure to arrive early. I appreciate you squeezing us in.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day. And please, encourage your daughter to review the CDC website for further information on required vaccinations. It will likely save us both time. .
