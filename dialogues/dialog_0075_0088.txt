DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been bugging me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. That’s also called tinnitus. “A little while” is a bit vague, could you tell me approximately how long it’s been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe, like, three or four weeks now? It started quiet, just a little thing, and I kinda ignored it, hoping it would go away. But it hasn’t. It's getting… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four weeks. And you said it started quietly and has gradually gotten more noticeable. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. It's definitely worse at night, when it's quiet. During the day, with all the noise… I don't really notice it as much. Unless it's really quiet, then it’s there.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's more prominent in quiet environments and especially at night. Is the ringing in one ear, both ears, or does it feel like it’s inside your head?
PATIENT: It's… both ears, I think. It’s hard to tell exactly, but it feels more… balanced. Not like it's super loud in one and quiet in the other. It just feels… in my head, if that makes sense. Like a high-pitched whine, mostly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. A high-pitched whine in both ears. Have you noticed any hearing loss associated with it?
PATIENT: Hearing loss…? Not that I've noticed, no. I mean, I work as a waiter, it’s pretty noisy in the restaurant sometimes. I figured it was just… the noise. But no, I don’t think I’m going deaf or anything. I can still hear fine, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And you mentioned working as a waiter in a noisy restaurant. Have you been exposed to any other loud noises recently – concerts, machinery, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual restaurant stuff, I guess. We had a bit of a party a couple of weeks back, music was pretty loud for a few hours, but nothing out of the ordinary. It started before that party, I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we move on, can you tell me a bit about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. No dizziness, no headaches, nothing like that. Just the ringing. Maybe… a little bit tired lately, but I just figured that’s from working long hours. No pain or anything. Just… annoyed, to be honest. It's distracting.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, no headaches, just fatigue and the annoyance of the ringing. Good. Now, let’s go through some general medical questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I just… take the occasional painkiller if I get a headache, and that’s about it. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And what about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Nothing major. I had the flu a couple of times, and I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. I haven’t been to the doctor in… well, it’s been a while. I usually just tough things out, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no chronic medical conditions. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the broken arm, they put a cast on it, that’s all. No surgeries, nothing like that. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Never needed anything serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings – have any history of hearing loss, tinnitus, or other ear problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mum, she's getting on a bit now, and she says her hearing isn’t what it used to be, but she hasn’t ever mentioned ringing. My dad, he's fine. And I’m an only child. So, not that I know of, no. No one’s ever said anything about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no family history of hearing issues. And lastly, before we do a quick examination, could you tell me a little about your social habits – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, don't smoke. I'll have a beer with dinner sometimes, but nothing heavy. Maybe a couple a week. And no, no drugs or anything like that. I'm pretty straight-laced, to be honest. Just work, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Just a couple of beers a week. Alright, Jaylyne, I’d like to take a quick look in your ears and do a brief hearing test, if that's alright with you. It'll just take a few minutes. Do you have any wax build-up in your ears that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Yeah, go ahead. I’m fine with that. And no, I don't think so. I haven't noticed any wax build up, no. I don’t really mess around in my ears much, if that makes sense. I leave that to the professionals. Let’s get it over with, eh? I got a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be quick. Please have a seat, and I’ll just take a look. Okay, so the ears look clear. With the Weber test, you said you hear the sound equally in both ears, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, I did. Didn’t seem louder in one than the other. Just a… buzzing sound. Equal, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, and with the Rinne test, you said the sound was quieter when I took the tuning fork off your ear, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Sound faded when you moved it away. Not much different, but it was definitely quieter. It’s… hard to explain, but yeah, quieter when it wasn't touching my ear.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on that, your hearing does seem slightly reduced, but it's difficult to say for sure with this quick test. It’s consistent with mild conductive hearing loss, but the tinnitus is the primary concern here. Given the length of time it’s been going on, and the fact it’s affecting you, I recommend we get a formal audiogram. That’ll give us a better idea of what's going on with your hearing. We can do that here at the clinic, or I can refer you to an audiologist. Also, because it’s happening with your age, we may want to rule out other causes. Would you mind if I order some routine blood work to check your thyroid and vitamin levels?
PATIENT: Right. Blood work and the hearing test. Sounds… sensible. I'm happy enough to do both, yeah. I just want to know what’s causing it, and hopefully get rid of it. I don’t want to be hearing buzzing forever. So, whatever you think is best, Doc. Let's get it done. How much is all this gonna cost me? I’m on a budget, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jaylyne. I’ll have my assistant give you a breakdown of the costs for the blood work and the audiogram before we proceed. The audiogram will likely be covered by your insurance, but we’ll double-check. As for the blood work, it's fairly inexpensive. I’ll also give you a referral slip for the audiologist, just in case you prefer to go elsewhere. In the meantime, to help manage the tinnitus, I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible and minimizing stress. I also suggest using earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones if you're frequently exposed to loud environments. We can also discuss potential therapies like tinnitus retraining therapy if the problem persists. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Right, good. Earplugs and avoid stress… Easier said than done, that. But I'll try. No, I don’t think so. Just… when can I get the blood work done? And the hearing test? I got a busy schedule, you see. I need to know what days and times are available. And will the results be quick? I don't want to be waiting weeks for answers. That's it, I think. Thanks, Doc. You've been helpful.
DOCTOR: Certainly. My assistant, Sarah, will schedule those appointments for you right away. She usually has availability within the next couple of days for both the bloodwork and the hearing test. As for the results, the bloodwork typically takes 24-48 hours to come back, and the audiogram results will be available almost immediately after the test is completed. Sarah will also let you know how to access the results online. Do you have any work notes that I need to fill out?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can take a day off, I reckon. I'll just tell 'em I'm sick. No need for work notes. I just want this sorted, Doc. I appreciate you not making me fill out a bunch of paperwork. Thanks again. Right, well, I'll let Sarah get me sorted. Cheers, Doc. And thanks again.
