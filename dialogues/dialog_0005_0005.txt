DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. TKAC, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is good to meet you. I believe my… arrangements have sent me to ensure I am fit enough for a senior living facility. A place where I can… not worry so much about things, you see. I want to make sure everything is in order before I move.
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-placement physical. Sensible. A lot of places require those. So, let's get a good history down. "Everything in order" is pretty broad. Tell me, what specifically are you worried about?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my bones ache sometimes, Doctor. More on cold days, or if I've been doing a lot of baking. My hands, mostly. It doesn't stop me, mind you, but it’s… noticeable. And my memory isn’t what it used to be, though I can recall things quite clearly when I focus. It's just… everyday things, like names, or where I put my spectacles. Small things. I don't want them thinking I'm… incapable. I still bake a very good loaf, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Aches and pains, some memory difficulties. Alright. And these aches… how long have they been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time, Doctor. Decades, I suppose. It comes and goes, like the seasons. Though they've been a bit more persistent these last few years. I thought it was just getting older, truthfully. My father's hands were the same when he was my age. He was a carpenter, a skilled one. Perhaps it's in the blood. But I haven't asked a doctor about it, not really. I usually just… work through it. Baking keeps my hands moving, you see. It’s good for them.
DOCTOR: "Working through it" is admirable, Mr. TKAC, but it doesn’t always address the underlying issue. Decades of pain… that deserves a closer look. And we should rule out anything serious. Do these aches radiate anywhere, or are they solely in your hands?
PATIENT: They stay mostly in my hands, Doctor. The knuckles, the wrists… sometimes up my forearms. Never further than that, thankfully. A little stiffness in my shoulders, perhaps, but nothing that keeps me from… reaching for things. I can still lift a sack of flour, you know. Though I have my grandson help with the heavier loads these days. He’s a strong boy. I don't want to be a burden, you understand. That’s why I haven't… bothered anyone about it.
DOCTOR: Right, I see some notes from previous visits about…routine check-ups, mostly. No specific complaints documented about the hand pain. Alright. Let’s move on. And you mentioned some memory difficulties. Can you give me an example of a recent instance where you experienced that?
PATIENT: Just yesterday, actually, Doctor. Old Mrs. Henderson from across the street brought over a pie, a lovely apple pie. But I couldn't recall her name, even though she's been bringing me pies for years! She was very kind about it, said I was probably just preoccupied. But it bothered me. I knew her name, or I should have. It was right on the tip of my tongue, but I couldn’t grasp it. Little things like that… they add up, you see. It's not a constant thing, mind you. Most days my memory is fine. I can recall recipes from my grandmother perfectly, and stories from my childhood. Just… everyday names, or appointments… those are harder now.
DOCTOR: Right. Selective memory lapses. We'll document that. Alright, Mr. TKAC, let’s do a quick physical exam. I want to check your range of motion, look at your joints, and listen to your heart and lungs. Standard stuff. We'll start with your hands. Please extend your arms, palms up.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. I have nothing to hide. I hope I'm not too much trouble. I’m not as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just checking for tenderness, range of motion, any signs of inflammation. Hmm. There’s a little crepitus here, which isn’t uncommon at your age, but we’ll note it. Can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It’s a bit stiff, you see. And it aches a little when I do that. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. I've gotten used to it, I suppose. It's been years, as I said. But go ahead, examine it as you need to. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noting some mild swelling and enlargement of the joints in your hands, particularly at the knuckles. Range of motion is slightly limited. And, as you mentioned, there’s some discomfort with flexion. Now, can you open and close your hands for me, as quickly as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? It’s not as easy as it used to be. They feel… clumsy, you see. And that ache… it’s a bit more pronounced now. I used to be able to knead dough for hours, without a second thought. But that was… a long time ago. Forgive an old man’s slow movements.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this quick exam, and your history, it appears you're likely experiencing osteoarthritis in your hands. It's a common condition, especially with age, and can cause pain, stiffness, and decreased range of motion. The memory lapses... those are less clear. Could be normal age-related changes, stress, or a number of other things. We’ll need to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel – just to get a baseline. I also want to order X-rays of your hands to confirm the osteoarthritis and assess the extent of the joint damage.
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Blood work and X-rays. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Osteo… what was it? Arthritis? I suppose that explains the aches, doesn't it? All those years of baking, perhaps. Will the results take long? I'm hoping to get settled into the facility soon. Not that I'm rushing you, mind you. Just… trying to get things arranged.
DOCTOR: It’ll take a few days to schedule the X-rays and get the blood work results back, Mr. TKAC. Probably a week, give or take. Don't worry, we'll get it done as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I can recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen – to help manage the discomfort. And there are also some hand exercises you can do to maintain your range of motion. I can have the nurse print out a handout for you. As for the memory lapses, we’ll keep an eye on them. If they worsen, or you start experiencing other symptoms – confusion, difficulty with language, changes in personality – we’ll need to investigate further. I might refer you to a neurologist if things don’t improve. Do you have any other concerns, or questions, before we wrap up?
PATIENT: A neurologist? That sounds… serious, Doctor. I certainly don't want to be a burden, or cause anyone unnecessary trouble. Perhaps it's just… old age, as I said. I’ve always been a worrier, I suppose. Hand exercises… yes, that sounds good. I'll try anything to keep my hands moving. I still enjoy baking, you see. It’s the one thing I do well. No, I don’t believe I have any other questions at the moment. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And for… explaining things to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly with the handouts and instructions for the blood work. We'll schedule the X-rays for you as soon as possible. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Next patient! .
PATIENT: .
