DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 25 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right. Twenty-five. Um… well, it’s about some swelling, really. It’s… hard to explain precisely. It just is swelling. I don't quite recall when it started, truthfully.
DOCTOR: “Swelling,” you say. Alright. And where, specifically, is this swelling located?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. Let me think. It feels like… mostly in my face, I believe? Around my jaw, perhaps? It’s not terribly painful, just… noticeable. And a little uncomfortable, sometimes when I eat. Though, I wouldn't say it’s painful painful. I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… my memory isn’t the best.
DOCTOR: It is helpful that you can pinpoint it to the jaw area. And you said it’s been going on for… some time. Can you estimate how long?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s difficult. Weeks, I think? Perhaps a month or two? It’s truly hard to say. I wish I could be more precise. It didn’t come on suddenly, if that helps at all. It was more… gradual. Like it just sort of… appeared, one day. I’m sorry. I feel like I’m not being very useful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Tomassoni. We’ll get there. A gradual onset is useful information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me ponder that. I don’t think so, not really. Perhaps a little fatigue, but I attribute that to work. And… no, I can’t recall anything else. No fever, no pain elsewhere, no difficulty breathing… Is there anything specific I should be looking for? I’m not sure I know what would be related to the swelling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet… Not intentionally, no. Work has been rather busy, so I’ve probably been eating less… and perhaps relying on quicker things, rather than cooking. Things like sandwiches, or takeout. Nothing drastically different, just… less home-cooked meals, if that makes sense. I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. I’ll need to check your vital signs, and then I’d like to palpate your jaw and neck. Please bear with me. If you’ll have a seat.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, do whatever you need to do. I’ll remain as still as possible. I just hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 128/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. There is some slight tenderness along the jawline, and I do detect some swelling on both sides. It’s not markedly inflamed, but it is present. Your lymph nodes feel… slightly enlarged, but not significantly. Now, I’d like to take a look inside your mouth. Please open wide for me.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is there anything specific I should be doing? I apologize if I’m making this difficult. I’m just… not accustomed to this, I suppose. I hope you can see what you need to.
DOCTOR: The oral mucosa appears… normal. No visible lesions or signs of infection. Your gums aren’t particularly inflamed. Alright. Given the swelling, slight tenderness, and enlarged lymph nodes, and considering the lack of other symptoms, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation. It could be a salivary gland issue, or possibly a mild infection, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a sedimentation rate to check for signs of inflammation. We might also need to consider imaging, such as an ultrasound, to get a clearer picture of the salivary glands.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Blood work and potentially an ultrasound… alright. Whatever you think is best. I confess, I’m a little anxious, but I trust your judgment. What does this mean, approximately? Is it something serious? I do apologize for asking so directly, but my… memory, as you know, isn’t the best, and I worry about forgetting details.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tomassoni, it’s far too early to say definitively whether it’s “serious.” That’s why we’re doing the tests. The swelling could be caused by something relatively benign, like a mild infection or a blocked salivary duct. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as a more serious infection or, in rare cases, something else entirely. The blood work will help us assess for inflammation, and the ultrasound will give us a clearer view of the salivary glands. I’m going to write you a prescription for a short course of antibiotics as a precaution, while we wait for the test results. If the swelling worsens significantly—meaning it becomes intensely painful, you have difficulty breathing or swallowing, or you develop a fever—you need to go to the emergency room immediately, do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Antibiotics as a precaution, and to go to the emergency room if things worsen – intense pain, trouble breathing or swallowing, or a fever. I will remember that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for being patient with my… forgetfulness. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any specific things to avoid eating, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: For the time being, avoid acidic foods and drinks, as they can irritate the salivary glands. Also, try to avoid chewing gum or anything that requires a lot of chewing. This is a list of foods to avoid and some general instructions. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the test results. It is important that you remember this appointment, Mr. Tomassoni. And please, try to write down any questions you have before your next visit, so we can make the most of our time. I have other patients waiting. Do you have any immediate questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. A week, avoid acidic foods, and I'll try to remember to write down questions. No, I don’t believe I have any immediate questions. Perhaps I’ll need time to process everything. Thank you very much for your time, Doctor. And thank you again for your patience. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will escort you to schedule your follow-up appointment and give you the prescription. Have a good day, Mr. Tomassoni.
PATIENT: .
