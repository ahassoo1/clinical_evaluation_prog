DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor Renzi. It's lovely to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. They just won't stop! Been going on for... oh, goodness, I'd say almost a full day now. It’s quite annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a full day of hiccups, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a full day. Started yesterday afternoon, just after I had a nice cup of tea and a biscuit. Perfectly normal tea, nothing fancy. And then hic… here they started. hic It's not painful, just… persistent. And a bit embarrassing, if I’m honest!
DOCTOR: Right, persistent and not painful. That’s good to know. Now, have you tried anything to get rid of them so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes! Everything I could think of, really. Holding my breath, you know? Drinking water upside down… that made a mess, I’ll tell you! My granddaughter told me to try a spoonful of sugar. Didn't do a thing! hic I even asked old Mr. Henderson next door if he had any remedies. He suggested a pickle, but I don’t particularly like pickles, so I didn’t bother. hic Nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: You’ve certainly been thorough! It sounds frustrating. Now, let’s talk a bit more about when these hiccups started. You said after tea... was anything else unusual happening yesterday?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… hic Unusual… Well, now that you mention it, my grandson, little Kai, came over. He's a whirlwind, that boy! He was showing me some new magic tricks, very energetic. Lots of running around and shouting, mostly. We were laughing quite a bit. hic Could that have something to do with it, do you think? I mean, all the excitement?
DOCTOR: That's good information, Mirriam. Excitement can sometimes trigger hiccups. Now, have you experienced hiccups like this before, or is this a new thing for you?
PATIENT: Oh, I’ve had hiccups before, of course. But never like this. Usually, they go away after a few minutes. Maybe an hour, tops. hic But this… this is just going on and on. hic It's not the worst thing in the world, mind you, but it’s tiring. I like to have a nice, quiet evening, and this is making it hard to relax. hic I haven't been able to finish my crossword puzzle! It’s a particularly good one today, too.
DOCTOR: A good crossword is serious business! Right, let’s just do a quick check-up, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. hic I'm happy to do whatever I can to get rid of these pesky things. hic Do you need me to lie down? Or just sit? hic I hope it isn't anything serious.
DOCTOR: No need to lie down just yet. Just sit comfortably. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to make sure everything sounds okay. And I'll take a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. hic Go right ahead. My heart’s usually as strong as an ox, but it’s always good to check, isn't it? hic And I do get a bit of a tickle in my throat sometimes, so a look wouldn't hurt. hic Just try not to laugh at my hiccups, alright? They're quite embarrassing! hic
DOCTOR: I promise, no laughing! Heart sounds are regular, a bit strong as you said. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds on both sides. Ears look clear, no signs of infection. And your throat looks a little… mildly irritated, but nothing too concerning. Now, have you been having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear, Doctor. hic No, no other symptoms, really. Just the hiccups, and a little bit of that tickle in my throat, which is pretty normal for me. hic I do sometimes get a bit of indigestion, if I eat something too rich. But I haven't had anything like that recently. hic I've been mostly eating soup and biscuits, if you must know! hic Not very exciting, but it's gentle on the stomach. hic Do you think it could be something I ate?
DOCTOR: It’s possible something you ate could be contributing, although soup and biscuits are usually pretty harmless. Given everything you've told me - the hiccups lasting a long time, the slight throat irritation, and no other significant symptoms – it sounds like it could be a case of a somewhat prolonged, but benign, hiccup episode. Sometimes these things just happen. However, given your age, it's always best to be thorough. I'd like to check your oxygen saturation just to be sure everything is okay.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, Doctor. hic Thoroughness is always good, isn't it? hic Oxygen saturation… is that something serious? hic I do try to take deep breaths, you know. My granddaughter tells me it's good for everything. hic And I haven’t been feeling breathless or anything, just these… annoying hiccups! hic Do you need me to do anything special for this oxygen thing?
DOCTOR: It's a very quick and simple test, Mirriam, nothing to worry about. We'll just put a little clip on your finger, and it measures the oxygen in your blood. It’s just a precaution, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A little clip on the finger… that doesn't sound too bad. hic As long as it doesn't hurt! hic I have rather sensitive skin, you see. hic Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. hic Hopefully, this will tell us something helpful about these pesky hiccups! hic
DOCTOR: There we go. Just hold still for a moment... 95% – that's perfectly good. Reassuring. It doesn’t seem to be a lung issue. Now, sometimes hiccups can be caused by irritation of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm. It's usually nothing serious, and often resolves on its own. I think we can try a few things at home, and see if that helps.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear it’s not my lungs! hic Phrenic nerve… that sounds complicated! hic So, things at home? hic What sort of things? hic I'm willing to try anything, honestly. hic Although, I’m not sure about standing on my head. hic My balance isn’t what it used to be! hic Is there anything I can drink? hic Perhaps some more tea? hic Or maybe a biscuit? hic
DOCTOR: No standing on your head required, thankfully! Drinking tea is fine, just not too hot or too cold. And biscuits are perfectly acceptable. What I'd recommend is to sip water frequently throughout the day, try some deep, slow breaths—as your granddaughter suggests—and, if you feel comfortable, try holding your breath for a short period—ten to fifteen seconds—and then exhaling slowly. We can also try a teaspoon of sugar, even though you said it didn't work before, sometimes it just needs a little time. If these hiccups continue for more than 48 hours, or if you develop any other symptoms—like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe abdominal discomfort—please give us a call right away.
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. hic Water, deep breaths, a little sugar… and no standing on my head! hic I can definitely manage all that. hic I'll try my best. hic And I will keep an eye out for any other symptoms, don't you worry. hic I suppose 48 hours isn't too long to wait. hic Should I stop drinking tea altogether? hic Or just be careful about the temperature? hic And thank you, Doctor Renzi, for being so patient with my pesky hiccups! hic I feel a bit better just knowing what's going on. hic
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. You don't need to stop drinking tea altogether, just avoid anything extremely hot or cold, as those can sometimes irritate the esophagus. And you’re right, sometimes just knowing what’s going on can be half the battle! So, to summarise: frequent sips of water, deep breathing, a teaspoon of sugar if you like, and keep an eye out for any new symptoms. If they persist beyond 48 hours, give us a call. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. hic You’ve explained everything so clearly. hic I feel much more confident now, and I’m willing to try all your suggestions. hic I’ll go home and start sipping water right away! hic And I’ll tell my granddaughter to keep reminding me about the deep breathing. hic Thank you again for your kindness and patience. hic I appreciate it very much. hic You’ve been a great help. hic I think that’s everything. hic
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if anything changes, alright?
