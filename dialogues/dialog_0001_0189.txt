DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Rowbottom. Arbie Rowbottom. And it’s about time, frankly. Been waiting a while. What exactly are you going to do about it? It’s not pleasant, you know. Blood in my stool. Not something a man wants to discuss with just anyone.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Blood in the stool. Right. We’ll get to it. It’s… common, unfortunately. But needs looking at. Let’s start with the basics. How long has this been happening, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, “common” is it? Well, it’s not common for me. And don’t you go typing away like I’m some sort of…statistic. A few days. Maybe four, five. Hard to say exactly. Things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, you know. But it was definitely there this morning. Quite a bit, actually.
DOCTOR: Four or five days. And "quite a bit," you say. Is it bright red blood, or darker, more…tarry looking?
PATIENT: Tarry? What are you, a road worker? It’s red. Bright red. Like…well, like blood. I haven't been eating any roads, if that’s what you’re getting at. Honestly, these questions... It's not a guessing game, you know. It's blood. In my stool.
DOCTOR: Right. Bright red blood. Okay. And is it mixed in with the stool, or is it coating it?
PATIENT: Coating it, I suppose. Not mixed in, exactly. More…on top. Like someone painted a little stripe on everything. Look, is this going to take all day? I’ve got things to do, you know. Important things. Not just sitting around talking about…this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this happened before, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve…lived a long life, you know. Eighty-eight years. And I haven’t had blood in my stool before this. It's a new development. A rather unpleasant one, I might add. Don’t tell me I'm getting old, though. I know my own body.
DOCTOR: I wasn't going to. And we're going to figure this out. Any pain with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? A little discomfort, maybe. Not like a proper pain, you understand. Just…a strain. Getting older, you know. Everything takes a bit more effort. But no screaming or anything like that. It’s not that bad. Though I wouldn't want to push it, mind you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean, “changes”? I go to the bathroom when I need to, the same as always. Sometimes it's a bit looser, sometimes a bit…firmer. That’s life, isn’t it? You start asking questions like that, it’s like you’re accusing me of something! I’m a reasonable man, Doctor. Don't treat me like a child.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's move on. Any nausea, vomiting, or recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Nausea? No. I haven't been sick. And weight loss? I haven't exactly been trying to gain weight. Food doesn’t sit as well as it used to, that’s all. A few pounds, maybe, but nothing drastic. I'm a solid man, Doctor. Always have been. Not one of those frail types.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. Just a listen to your abdomen, and a quick digital rectal exam. It'll give us a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: A…what now? A digital…exam? You’re asking me to…? Look, Doctor, I appreciate you wanting to…investigate, but I think I’ve told you everything I need to. I’m not keen on anyone poking around down there. Not at my age. Surely there are other ways? A blood test, perhaps? This is ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your discomfort. But a digital rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating blood in the stool. It allows me to check for any masses or other abnormalities. Without it, it’s difficult to determine the cause of the bleeding and ensure we're not missing anything serious. I wouldn't recommend it if it wasn't necessary. It's a quick procedure, and I will be as gentle as possible. If you absolutely refuse, we can proceed with blood tests, but it will significantly limit our ability to diagnose the problem accurately. And I will strongly recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: A…gastro…whatsit? Look, I don’t like any of this. You're making me feel like an old, broken-down machine. I don’t want to go to any specialists. And I really don't want anyone poking around. Fine. Fine! Do your…exam. But be quick about it. And gentle. Very gentle. And don’t expect me to be happy about it. This is humiliating. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll need you to lie on your side, knees bent. I'll explain each step as I go. And I assure you, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. This may be uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just let me know if you feel any sharp discomfort.
PATIENT: .
