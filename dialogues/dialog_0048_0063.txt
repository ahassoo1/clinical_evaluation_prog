DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Sink. It’s my back. It’s been… really bad. Worse than usual, you know? It started a few days ago, but now it’s hard to even stand up straight. I got cancer, you remember? And this pain… feels different.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I recall the… oncology history. “Different” how, exactly?
PATIENT: Well, the other pain… it was more of a dull ache, mostly. Like a weight on my back. This one… it’s sharp. Like someone is stabbing me. And it goes down my leg sometimes. Not all the time, but… yeah. It makes me scared, if that makes sense. I don’t want it to be… something bad happening with the cancer.
DOCTOR: Right. “Sharp” pain radiating down the leg. And you’re concerned it’s related to your previous… treatment. Let's try to be specific. Where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. It's… mostly right here. And then it goes down the back of my leg, all the way to my foot sometimes. Not my whole leg, just the back part. And it’s worse when I try to bend over, or… when I sit for too long. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain, you know? Everything hurts.
DOCTOR: Right. So, localized to the lumbar region, radiating posteriorly down the leg. Exacerbated by bending and prolonged sitting. Have you noticed anything that relieves the pain?
PATIENT: Let me think… When I lie down flat, it gets a little better. And… if I walk around a bit, slowly, it doesn’t hurt as much. But if I try to do too much, it comes right back. I tried some of those heating pads, but they didn’t really do anything. Not much, anyway. It’s just… always there, even if it’s not sharp all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to clarify, this pain started several days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, about four days ago, I think. It started kinda slow, just a little ache like I said. I thought it was just a bad day, you know? But then it got worse and worse. Each day it feels a little stronger. It’s been… scary waking up each morning, wondering how bad it’s gonna be.
DOCTOR: And has there been any numbness or weakness in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. I think my foot feels a little… tingly sometimes. Not all the time, and not completely numb, just… like it's falling asleep. And maybe my leg feels a little weaker when I walk, but I don't know if that's just because it hurts so much. It's hard to tell, honestly. I try not to think about it too much, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s have you lie down on the examination table, and we’ll do a quick neurological assessment. Then I’ll take a look at your back. Just to get a better idea of what we're dealing with.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds good. Just let me know if I need help getting up there. It's a little hard to move right now.
DOCTOR: Just get yourself settled. I’ll be right there. And please, let me know if anything is particularly painful during the assessment.
PATIENT: Okay, I will. It's a little cold in here, if you don't mind. But I'm okay, I think. Just let me know what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax. Reflexes are… diminished bilaterally. Now, I'm going to test your strength. Can you lift your right leg, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Ow... that hurts a little. It's hard. It feels… weak, and it really hurts in my back when I try to lift it. Like a sharp pain shooting down my leg. Is that normal? I don't want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Right. Weakness and pain with straight leg raise. Now, the left leg. Try to do the same thing.
PATIENT: It’s still hurts, but not as bad as the other one. It’s… uncomfortable, but I can do it a little bit. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain the difference. It’s just… one side is much worse than the other. And it feels like something is… pinched in my back. If that makes sense, I mean. I don't know medical terms or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your history and the preliminary neurological exam… it appears you may be experiencing a lumbar radiculopathy, likely due to nerve compression. It's difficult to say definitively without imaging. We'll need to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to get a clearer picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: MRI? Like… a big machine? Is that gonna hurt? And what does “nerve compression” mean? Is that because of the cancer? I don't want anything to be worse. Is it serious? I’m getting scared again, Doctor. What does this mean?
DOCTOR: The MRI is a non-invasive imaging test; it uses magnets and radio waves. It shouldn't be painful, although some people find it… confining. "Nerve compression" simply means a nerve in your back is being squeezed. It could be related to your previous oncology history, or it could be a separate issue. We need the MRI to determine the cause. I'm ordering the MRI now. You'll receive a call to schedule it. In the meantime, I’m prescribing a short course of muscle relaxants and a mild pain reliever.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Muscle relaxants… will those make me sleepy? I have to take care of things at home. And what if it is the cancer? What happens then? Is there anything else I should be doing? Like… exercises or something? I just want to feel better, and I don’t want to just sit around waiting for bad news.
DOCTOR: The muscle relaxants can cause some drowsiness, so be cautious when driving or operating machinery. We'll start with a low dose. As for exercises… at this point, I wouldn’t recommend any specific exercises until we have the MRI results. We need to see what’s causing the compression before we can formulate a proper plan. I'm referring you to a specialist, a neurosurgeon, for a consultation once the MRI is completed. They will discuss your options in detail. Do you have any further questions… for now?
PATIENT: Oh. A neurosurgeon… That sounds… serious. No. I… I think that’s all for now. Just… I’ll wait for the call about the MRI. And try not to worry too much. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. The staff will assist you with scheduling. Take it easy. .
