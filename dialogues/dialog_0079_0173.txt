DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. GonzalezPerez, nice to meet you too. Well, I've been getting chills, and it's kinda worrying me. It's not like a fever chill, just… cold. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Chills, you say. And you describe them as coming and going, not associated with a fever. Hmm. Could you elaborate on that a bit?
PATIENT: Sure. It's hard to explain. Like, yesterday I was perfectly fine all day. Then, last night, sitting on the couch watching TV, I just got really cold, like a shiver went through me. It lasted maybe ten minutes, then went away. And then just now, waiting here, I felt it again. It’s not a constant thing, you know? It doesn’t feel like I’m sick sick, just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe so, Ms. Aslan. It sounds… atypical. And you’ve had this occur on more than one occasion, you indicated?
PATIENT: Yeah, it’s been happening for about a week, maybe a little longer. Not every day, but… several times. I figured maybe I was just tired, but it’s still happening, and I wanted to get it checked out, just in case. I don’t want it to be something serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you noticed anything else accompanying these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. No headache, no sore throat, no cough. I haven’t felt nauseous or anything. Just… cold. Maybe a little tired, but I’ve been a bit stressed lately with work, so I figured that was it. I guess… no, nothing else really.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: No, I’m not on anything regularly. Just sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen, but that's it. I try to avoid taking pills when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve had a lot of tests done over the years, and nothing’s ever come up. I can eat anything, thankfully! I love food too much to have allergies.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let's discuss your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had really bad asthma as a kid, but I grew out of it when I was a teenager. Other than that… no, nothing major. Just the usual stuff, like colds and flu every now and then. I've been pretty healthy overall, I think.
DOCTOR: And has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – suffered from any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom had high blood pressure, and my dad has arthritis in his knees. My grandma on my mom’s side had diabetes, but that’s about it, as far as I know. No one’s had anything really serious, you know? Nothing like heart disease or cancer or anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. And to complete the picture, could you briefly describe your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work full-time as a health education specialist, so I'm on my feet a lot. I try to eat pretty healthy, lots of vegetables and fruit, but it's hard sometimes with work. I don't smoke, and I don’t drink very often, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to get some exercise when I can, but honestly, I’m usually pretty tired after work. It’s… a normal life, I guess.
DOCTOR: “Normal,” you say. Very well. Now, Ms. Aslan, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your temperature and blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. Whatever you need to do to figure out what's going on. I’m happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Within normal limits, thus far. Now, just a quick check of your reflexes… Reflexes are also within normal limits. The findings are… unremarkable. However, given your description of these chills, and the fact that they are recurring, I believe it is prudent to order some blood work. This will help us rule out any underlying infection or inflammatory condition.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. Blood work is fine. What exactly will it be testing for? I don’t want to worry needlessly.
DOCTOR: We will be assessing your complete blood count – to check for signs of infection or anemia. We’ll also evaluate your thyroid function – as thyroid imbalances can sometimes present with similar symptoms. And finally, we'll measure your inflammatory markers – to see if there is any underlying inflammation in your body. It's a standard panel, Ms. Aslan, to ensure we haven’t overlooked anything. It’s better to be thorough. We'll need a sample from your arm. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. Do you have any questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will someone call me, or do I need to schedule another appointment? I’ve got a pretty busy schedule, so I’m trying to plan ahead. I’m hoping it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back from the laboratory. The nurse will likely contact you via telephone with the findings. If anything significant is detected, we will, of course, schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss it further. However, if the results are normal, you may not need to come back in. It’s likely nothing serious, Ms. Aslan. But as I said, it’s always best to be cautious. In the meantime, try to get adequate rest and stay hydrated. Do you have any further concerns before I conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good. Thank you, Dr. GonzalezPerez. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I guess I’ll just wait for the nurse to call.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Aslan. .
