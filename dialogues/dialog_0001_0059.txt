DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it's... it's a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I've been noticing my speech hasn’t been quite right, you see. Sort of… slurred, maybe? It's been happening for a little while now, but I thought it would just... pass.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Slurred speech, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It’s not constant, mind you. Sometimes I feel perfectly normal, and other times… well, it’s like my tongue isn’t cooperating. I don't really know how to describe it better, I'm sorry. It’s just… worrying.
DOCTOR: Right, intermittent slurring. And how long exactly is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It feels like… a few weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month? It's hard to say, honestly. Things have been… a bit busy, and I don't always notice these things right away. My husband has mentioned it a couple of times, and that’s when I really started paying attention.
DOCTOR: Okay. A month or so. And is there anything else that happens when your speech is slurred?
PATIENT: Let me see… Sometimes my words feel… mixed up, a little. Not often, but it happens. And… I feel a bit clumsy when it's bad, like I might stumble. Nothing major, just… off-balance. It's all very subtle, really. It's not like I've been falling or anything. I'm just… not quite myself.
DOCTOR: Subtle clumsiness, mixed up words… alright. Have you had any headaches, dizziness, or vision changes with this?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. I get the occasional one, like anyone, but nothing unusual. Dizziness… maybe a little, but I thought that was just from working on the site all day. It’s hot out there, you know? As for vision… I don’t think so. I wear glasses, as you can see, but my prescription hasn't changed recently. Everything looks… normal, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Just the usual, I suppose. For my blood pressure, a small dose. And… vitamins, sometimes. Nothing else, I don’t think. My husband handles most of the medicine stuff. I’m not very good at remembering those sorts of things. Would he be a good person to ask about that, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Alright. We can get that information later. What about any allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. No food allergies, no medicine allergies… nothing. I'm pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. My mother always said I had a strong constitution.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to cover the basics, any family history of… neurological issues?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a tricky one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… she had some trouble with her memory towards the end. But I don't know if that counts as… neurological, exactly? And my uncle, he had a stroke, I think. Years ago. But… that's all I can really remember. We weren’t a very close family, you see. Things were… complicated. It's a bit hazy, honestly. I hope that helps?
DOCTOR: Okay. Hazy family history. Alright. Now, I'm going to do a quick exam, just to check a few things. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. Just tell me when to start. I hope I don't mess it up. I’m a bit worried, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Follow the pen. Don't worry, just do your best. Okay, good… and now look at my nose. Now look to your left… good… and to your right. Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This won't hurt. Everything seems… normal there. Let's have you say “hello” for me.
PATIENT: H-hello. Is that… alright? It felt a bit… strange to say, actually. I'm not sure if that was the problem, or if I just… noticed the slurring more while I was talking. It's hard to tell, really.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A slight pause. Look, Ms. Swaby, it's difficult to say definitively what's going on just yet. Could be a number of things. Stress, fatigue, even a minor vitamin deficiency. However, the intermittent slurring and the slight pause, along with your family history… I’d like to be cautious. I want to rule out anything serious. We'll need to get an MRI to take a look at your brain. It’s the best way to get a clear picture.
PATIENT: An MRI…? Oh dear. Is that… is that something serious? I mean, what are we looking for, exactly? I haven't been feeling that unwell, you know. Perhaps it really is just stress. I’ve been working a lot of extra hours lately… Is it definitely necessary, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Swaby, I understand your concern. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's better to be safe than sorry. An MRI will allow us to rule out a stroke, a tumor, or other neurological conditions. It's a precautionary measure, alright?
PATIENT: I see… A stroke… oh dear. My uncle… it wasn’t very pleasant. Alright. If you think it’s necessary, then I suppose I should do it. But… will it be expensive? My insurance… Medicare, you see. It doesn't always cover everything. And my husband… he’s already worried about the extra hours I've been working.
DOCTOR: Let me check your coverage. Medicare should cover the majority of it. There might be a small co-pay, but nothing exorbitant. I'll have the scheduler contact you to set up the appointment. It’s best to do it sooner rather than later, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. That’s… good to hear. Sooner rather than later… yes, I suppose you’re right. Thank you, Doctor Pehrson. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It's… reassuring, at least. Hopefully, it’s just stress, like I said. Hopefully. I suppose I should wait for the scheduler’s call, then?
