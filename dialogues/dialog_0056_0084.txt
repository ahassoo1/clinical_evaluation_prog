DOCTOR: Hi Mystery, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is… a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. I… well, it’s been difficult to breathe lately. Not a sharp pain, just… like I can’t get enough air. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. I apologize, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's no problem at all about the memory – we'll take our time. “Difficulty breathing” and dry mouth and eyes… can you tell me a little more about when you notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… when… It seems worse when I’m… resting, perhaps? Or maybe when I’ve been… thinking hard. It's hard to say for certain. It's not connected to any specific activity, I don't believe. It just… comes and goes. It’s more noticeable in the evenings, I think? But I could be wrong. Do you need me to be more specific? I truly apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: No, that's helpful, honestly. So, more noticeable at rest and in the evenings. And not really tied to any activity. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed… Let me see. My divorce was finalized… about six months ago, I believe. That was… quite stressful. Aside from that… I haven’t moved, I haven’t started any new hobbies… I have been writing more, perhaps. But that’s nothing new, really. I’ve always written. Is that… relevant? It feels like a very long time ago, and everything is a bit… blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, the divorce six months ago – that definitely could be a factor with stress. Writing isn’t likely to be a direct cause, but stress can manifest in many ways. Do you find yourself feeling anxious or overwhelmed often?
PATIENT: Anxious… yes, I suppose so. It’s not a constant feeling, but… there are times when I feel… unsettled. Like something is missing, or… wrong. I don’t sleep very well, either. I wake up frequently. It’s not nightmares, just… restlessness. I used to enjoy quiet evenings with a book, but now… I find it difficult to concentrate. It's a bit… unsettling. Is that… typical?
DOCTOR: Okay, anxiety and difficulty sleeping… that's good information. Let's talk about your medical history quickly. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… I believe I had… bronchitis, when I was a child? And… a rather bad flu a few years ago. Nothing serious, I don't think. Oh! And… I used to have terrible migraines, but those have… lessened considerably in recent years. I was prescribed medication for them, but I stopped taking it a long time ago. Everything else… I really cannot recall. I have not been to a doctor in… quite some time, I apologize. Is there something specific you are looking for? Perhaps you have my records?
DOCTOR: Okay, bronchitis as a child, a flu a few years ago, and migraines that have improved. That’s helpful. Let me quickly check the EHR to see what's on file… Okay, I see here you were prescribed sumatriptan for migraines about five years ago. No other significant medical history listed. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Sumatriptan… yes, that sounds right. It helped, but it made me feel… strange afterwards. As for allergies… I don't believe so. I've never had a severe reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I have always been quite careful about what I eat and drink. No shellfish, no nuts… just general precautions, really. Though… my grandmother was allergic to bee stings. But that wasn't me, of course. I truly hope that isn’t relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies other than your grandmother’s bee sting allergy. That's good to know. And you discontinued the sumatriptan. Now, just a few quick questions about lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. No, absolutely not. I do not smoke. I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I… certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I find those… unsettling. I have always preferred a quiet evening with a book, as I mentioned before. I apologize for being so… straightforward, but I have never had any interest in such things. Is that… alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Thank you for being honest. Okay, last quick question before we do a brief exam. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a daily multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. And… occasionally, I take fish oil for my… joints. They ache a little sometimes, particularly in the evenings. Aside from that… no, nothing else. I prefer to take care of myself through diet and exercise, when possible. I apologize if I'm being vague; it's just that I don't take many medications. I prefer natural remedies, when available. Do you require more details about the supplements?
DOCTOR: No, that’s good. Multivitamin and fish oil. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is… perfectly alright. Please, proceed as you see fit. I apologize if I seem… apprehensive. It's just that I haven't been to a doctor in quite some time. I trust your expertise. I will do my best to remain still.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths in and out… Say "Ahhh" for me please… Okay… your lungs sound relatively clear, although a bit on the shallow side. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88, and your blood pressure is 130/80. Not drastically high, but something we'll keep an eye on. Your throat looks a little dry, some mild redness, but no obvious signs of infection. I'm going to check your oxygen saturation now. Okay, that's 96%, which is good.
PATIENT: 96%… is that… a good number? I apologize, I truly do not understand these… measurements. My throat does feel quite dry, as I mentioned before. It’s worse in the evenings, particularly after I’ve been… thinking intently. The redness… is that concerning? I understand you are busy, Doctor; please do not hesitate to be frank with me. I would prefer honesty over… politeness.
DOCTOR: 96% is good—anything above 95% is considered normal. The dryness and mild redness aren’t immediately concerning, but they could be contributing to your breathing difficulties and feeling of not getting enough air. Combined with your anxiety, stress, and sleep problems, it makes me think… this could be related to a few things. Given your history and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing some symptoms of generalized anxiety and potentially a bit of mild dehydration. The dryness could also be a symptom of something called Sjogren’s syndrome, though that's less likely at this point without further testing. To be safe, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your hydration levels, and an inflammatory marker to rule out other causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Generalized anxiety… Sjogren’s syndrome… Those are… unfamiliar terms. Dehydration… yes, I suppose I haven't been drinking as much water lately. I've been rather preoccupied. Tests… yes, of course. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. Complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, inflammatory marker… I will cooperate fully. Do you anticipate these tests will be… unpleasant? I apologize for my… apprehension. I truly do not enjoy medical procedures. Will you explain the results to me personally, when they are available?
DOCTOR: No, the blood tests are very routine, just a small sample from your arm. They shouldn't be unpleasant at all, just a quick pinch. And yes, absolutely, I will explain the results to you personally when they're available. It will likely take a couple of days for the lab results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend trying to increase your water intake, and I'm going to prescribe a mild anti-anxiety medication to help you manage your stress and sleep. It's a low dose, and we can adjust it if needed. I also want you to practice some relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises or meditation. I’m sending the lab orders to the front desk now. They'll schedule you for blood work. And here’s a prescription for sertraline, 25mg daily. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Sertraline… 25mg daily… Yes, that sounds… acceptable. I am willing to try anything that might alleviate my… discomfort. Deep breathing exercises… meditation… I suppose those are worth attempting, as well. I am not particularly adept at such things, but I can certainly… endeavor to practice them. The lab work… will that require a lengthy appointment? I am rather sensitive to… confined spaces. And is there anything I should do to prepare for the blood tests? Should I avoid certain foods or medications? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor; I simply want to be as prepared as possible. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding.
DOCTOR: No problem at all—questions are good. The blood work shouldn't take very long, maybe 15-20 minutes. You don't need to fast beforehand, but please drink plenty of water before your appointment to make it easier for the phlebotomist to draw the sample. And please bring a list of any over-the-counter medications or supplements you are taking. We can also discuss some resources for stress management and relaxation techniques when you come back to discuss the results. I'll have the front desk schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A week from today… yes, that is… quite acceptable. No fasting required… that is… reassuring. I will be certain to bring a list of my… supplements. And I would greatly appreciate any information regarding stress management. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… exceedingly kind and patient. I feel… somewhat relieved, knowing that we have a plan of action. I trust your expertise and will do my best to follow your instructions. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave? Perhaps potential side effects of the medication? Or activities I should avoid? I apologize for my… inquisitiveness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. As for sertraline, some common side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, and decreased appetite, especially in the first few days. They usually subside on their own. You might also experience some temporary changes in sleep or appetite. It's important to avoid alcohol while taking the medication. More importantly, if you experience any thoughts of self-harm or suicidal thoughts, please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Otherwise, just try to prioritize self-care, stay hydrated, and practice relaxation techniques. The front desk will give you a printed handout with more information about the medication and stress management resources. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that… covers everything. I will be certain to contact you immediately if I experience any… concerning symptoms. And I will prioritize self-care and… hydration. Thank you again, for your kindness and patience. You have been… truly helpful. I believe I will… take my leave now. I truly appreciate your time and expertise. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mystery. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week. Don't hesitate to call the office if anything comes up before then. Have a good day.
