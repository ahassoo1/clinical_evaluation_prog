DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because of my ear. There is… something coming from it. A liquid, you understand? It is not comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a liquid coming from your ear, and it's not comfortable. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It started, hmm… about three days ago, I think. It is… clear liquid. Not blood, not… pus. Just water, almost. And it smells… not good, if that makes sense. A little bit. It is from the left ear, always. I have not hit my head, or put anything in my ear. I just… woke up with it. It makes a small ringing sound sometimes, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear liquid, started about three days ago, from the left ear only, no injury or foreign objects, a bit of an odor… and some ringing. Is the ringing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Not all the time. When I am very quiet, I hear it more. When I am talking, or if the television is on… then I do not notice it. It is a high sound, like… a small bell, perhaps. Not very loud. It is difficult to explain. It is more of a feeling, than a loud noise, you understand?
DOCTOR: I do understand. A high-pitched ringing, more noticeable in quiet, and more of a sensation than a loud sound. Have you experienced any pain with this, or any dizziness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain at all. Not even a little bit. And no dizziness. I feel… normal, except for the liquid, and the ringing. My balance is good. I walk without problem. I have been a little bit… worried, that is all. It is strange to have something coming from your ear with no pain. It does not feel right, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your concern – it is unusual to have discharge without pain. Alright. I’d like to take a look in your ear. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Please, look as closely as you need. I trust your judgment. It is good to know what is happening, finally. I have been trying to ignore it, but… it is getting worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to gently insert this into your ear canal to get a better view of your eardrum. It might feel a little cool. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay… I do see some fluid in the ear canal, and the eardrum appears… slightly bulging. There's also some redness. It looks like you may have an ear infection, specifically otitis media, an infection of the middle ear. It’s a common condition.
PATIENT: An infection? Hmm. I have not had an ear infection since I was a small boy, I do not think. Is it… serious? Will I need… strong medicine? I have a meeting next week that is very important, and I cannot be unwell then. I teach students, you see. I must be clear-headed. Will it affect my hearing? I hope not.
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven't had one in a long time, but they can happen at any age. It doesn’t sound like a severe infection, but it is important to treat it to prevent it from getting worse, and yes, to protect your hearing. It can cause temporary hearing loss if left untreated. We'll want to get it cleared up before your meeting. I’m going to prescribe an antibiotic ear drop and a short course of oral antibiotics, just to be sure. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I know of. I have taken many medicines in my life, traveling as I do, and never had a reaction. My wife, she has allergies to… penicillin, I believe. But I do not. I am quite healthy, usually. I eat well, and I walk every day. Except when it rains, of course. Then I stay inside and read. Is the medicine… difficult to take? Will it make me sleepy?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the penicillin allergy in your wife. The antibiotics I'm prescribing aren't penicillin-based, so you shouldn't have any issues. The oral antibiotic is Amoxicillin, a common medication, and the ear drops are Ciprofloxacin. The Amoxicillin can sometimes cause a little stomach upset, but it's usually mild. Taking it with food can help. The ear drops shouldn’t have any significant side effects. I'm going to write out the prescriptions now. While you’re taking the medication, try to keep your ear dry, and avoid getting water in it. Also, avoid swimming or getting your head underwater. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is all very clear. Keep it dry, avoid swimming. I can do that. The rainy season is coming, though. Perhaps I will need a hat. And I will be careful in the shower. I understand. How long will it take for the medicine to work? Will I feel better before my meeting next week? That is my greatest worry. It is a very important presentation. I have prepared for many weeks.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable worry. You should start to feel some improvement within 2-3 days of starting the antibiotics. The ear drops will also help with any discomfort. By the time your meeting rolls around next week, you should be feeling significantly better, if not completely recovered. However, if you don't see any improvement after 3 days, or if your symptoms worsen – like increased pain, fever, or dizziness – please call the office immediately. Here are your prescriptions and this sheet has some extra information. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. You have answered all my questions very thoroughly. I am very grateful for your help. I have been worrying about this for days, and now I feel much better, knowing what it is and how to treat it. Thank you again, Doctor Beinborn. I wish you a good day. Perhaps I will see you again, but hopefully not for any medical reason.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. It’s always best to get these things checked out. Hopefully, the antibiotics will do the trick and you’ll be back to your normal self in no time. If you do have any concerns or if things don’t improve, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and best of luck with your presentation next week!
