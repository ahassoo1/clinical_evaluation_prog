DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, they told me it was for a… a check, a test. Something about making sure I'm okay. Honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy. I think it has to do with… things I used to do? I don't really remember all the details, if that makes sense. Medicare sent me, I believe.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s alright. Don’t worry about the specifics. Medicare sometimes sends people for preventative screenings, or to follow up on things from past medical records. Let's just try to get a good picture of how you're feeling now. So, generally speaking, are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or changes in your health that you’ve noticed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… pain… not really. Maybe a little ache in my back sometimes, but I do heavy work, you know? Paving. It’s hard on the body. Changes… well, I get tired easier than I used to, I suppose. But that could just be getting older, couldn’t it? I don't… I don't think anything's wrong wrong, if that makes sense. Everything just feels… slow, maybe? Like I'm wading through water sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely could be just getting older, or from the physical demands of your work. Fatigue and general slowing down are common. But it’s always good to investigate, just to be sure. You mentioned the fatigue... is this a new fatigue, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, gradual, definitely gradual. It hasn't just happened suddenly. It's been… over the last year or so, I'd say. Not a big change each day, just… little by little. I used to be able to work all day and still have energy for… well, things. Now, I need to sit down more. I don't… I don't really go out much anymore. Not like I used to. It's… hard to explain. I just feel worn down, you know? Like an old machine.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Worn down” is a good way to describe it. And it’s helpful to know it’s been gradual. Let me just take a look at your medical history here… Ah, I see some previous entries about… some previous bloodwork, it looks like, a few years ago. It’s a bit sparse, unfortunately. Now, just to get a full picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, I've been a little… forgetful lately. More than usual, I mean. Not like… losing my keys forgetful, more like… trouble finding the right word sometimes. Or remembering what I went to the store for. It's… frustrating. And… oh! I haven’t been sleeping as well either. Wake up a lot during the night. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, those definitely count. Forgetfulness and trouble sleeping are important to note. It sounds like you’re experiencing a few different things that could be connected. Now, just to rule out anything obvious, do you have any shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, no shortness of breath. And no chest pain, thankfully. My ankles… …sometimes they feel a little puffy at the end of the day, but I figured that was just from standing on my feet all day. It goes away when I sit down and put my feet up. Nothing major. I wouldn't say they're swollen, just… a little thicker, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… hard to remember. The doctor… the doctor a few years ago mentioned my blood pressure was a little high, I think. He put me on a little pill for it, but I don't remember much else. And… my husband, God rest his soul, he had diabetes. I think they checked me for it at some point, but… I don’t think I have it. Honestly, my memory is just… a mess. I mostly just try to keep working. I don’t really pay attention to all that doctor stuff, if you know what I mean. It just makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s perfectly alright if you don't remember specifics. We can try to piece things together. So, you were on medication for high blood pressure at one point… Do you still take that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, um… Let’s see… No, I don’t think so. I think I stopped taking it a while ago. I felt fine, and… honestly, I just forgot to refill the prescription. And then… well, then I just didn't bother. Does that sound bad? I just… I’m not good at keeping track of things like that. Everything feels so overwhelming sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't sound bad at all. Many people have trouble keeping track of medications. It's good you're telling me this. Okay. And, just to be thorough, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… I don’t think so. Nothing I can recall, anyway. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. Maybe a little itchy skin sometimes, but that could be anything, you know? I've always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Until… well, until recently, I suppose. That's why I'm here, isn't it? Trying to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Now, Ms. Hughston, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… I hope it doesn't take too long. I have to get back to work tomorrow, you see. I've got a road to pave.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll keep it as quick as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. And I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. That's a little elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Ears appear normal. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, just a quick neurological assessment… Eyes tracking normally. Gait is steady, but slightly slow.
PATIENT: Oh… is that bad, Doctor? My blood pressure being high? And… my gait being slow? I do feel a little clumsy lately, now that you mention it. I just thought it was… old age. Is something seriously wrong? I need to be strong to keep working, you see. I can’t afford to slow down.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hughston, let’s not jump to conclusions. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and the slightly slow gait is something we should investigate further. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but it does warrant some further testing to rule out any underlying causes. Given your symptoms – fatigue, forgetfulness, trouble sleeping, slightly elevated blood pressure, and a slow gait – I'd like to order some bloodwork. We’ll check your complete blood count, thyroid levels, vitamin levels, and also a basic metabolic panel. I also think it would be helpful to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Bloodwork and… an EKG? That sounds… complicated. Will it take long? And… will it be expensive? I’m on Medicare, you see, and… well, I worry about the cost. I just want to be able to work, Doctor. I don't want all this fuss if it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Hughston. Let me assure you, we’ll take things one step at a time. The bloodwork is fairly straightforward – it’s just a simple blood draw. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes. The EKG is also non-invasive – we’ll just attach some electrodes to your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. That takes about 5 minutes. As for the cost, you’re covered by Medicare, so the majority of the cost should be covered. There may be a small co-pay, depending on your plan, but we can check with the billing department to give you an estimate before we proceed. The main goal right now is to rule out any potential causes for your symptoms and get you feeling better. We'll start with these tests, and then we can discuss the results and create a plan together. Would you like me to go ahead and order those tests for you?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, alright. If it's mostly covered, then… yes, go ahead and order the tests. But please, can you explain the results to me in plain English? I don't understand all that medical jargon. And… could we maybe schedule them for tomorrow morning? I really need to get back to work as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Hughston. I promise to explain everything in plain English – no jargon, I assure you. And yes, we can schedule the tests for tomorrow morning. Let me see… How about 9:00 AM?
PATIENT: 9:00 AM is fine. That gives me time to get ready for work afterwards. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I just… I hope it's nothing serious. I really need to keep working.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. That's what I'm here for. We'll take it one step at a time, and we'll figure out what's going on together. Try not to worry too much. Now, before you go, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, I don’t think so. You've explained everything very well. Just… maybe one thing. Will these tests make me tired? I don't want to be too exhausted to work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. The blood draw itself shouldn’t make you significantly tired, but some people feel a little lightheaded afterward. We’ll make sure you sit down and have a drink and a snack afterwards. The EKG is completely non-invasive and shouldn’t cause any fatigue at all. However, it's always a good idea to listen to your body. If you do feel tired, please don’t push yourself too hard. It's okay to take a break and rest. We can also discuss adjusting your work schedule if necessary. Now, I'll have the lab schedule those tests for 9:00 AM tomorrow. Please remember to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw – that means no food or drinks, except for water. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. No food or drinks before the blood test. Water is okay. Okay. I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I guess I'll see you tomorrow morning.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember to get a good night's sleep, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. I'll see you then. Have a good evening.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: You too, Ms. Hughston. Take care. .
