DOCTOR: Hi Brando, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Uh, well, it’s about a… a checkup, I think? Something for… work. A performance thing. It's all a bit hazy, to be honest. They just said I needed to get cleared by a doctor. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Okay, a checkup for work clearance. No problem at all. We can definitely get that sorted out for you. To start, could you tell me a little more about what kind of work you do?
PATIENT: Work… right. I… mostly I work at theaters. You know, showing people to their seats, taking tickets. Sometimes in the lobby… helping folks find things. It's… not very strenuous. Been doing it a long time. A very long time. I think they call it ushering? Or… lobby attendant. Something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, ushering or lobby attendant work at the theaters – that helps. And how long have you been doing this type of work, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Let me think… … It must be… close to fifty years, now. Maybe a little more? It all blurs together after a while. I started when I was quite young, actually. Still… feels like yesterday sometimes.
DOCTOR: Wow, fifty years! That's incredible. Okay, so a long-term, relatively low-stress job. That’s good information. Now, Brando, are you experiencing any health problems right now?
PATIENT: Health problems… Not that I know of. I get a little tired, maybe. But who doesn’t get tired at my age? My knees ache a bit sometimes, especially after being on my feet all day, but that's just… getting old, I suppose. Nothing a little rest doesn't fix. I don’t have any… serious pains or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and occasional knee pain, which you attribute to age and being on your feet. That's good to know. Have you been diagnosed with anything in the past – any chronic conditions like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… I… honestly, I can’t recall. I saw a doctor years ago, when I first came to this country, but I don’t remember what they said. I’ve never really been one to go to the doctor much, if I can help it. Everything’s always felt… okay. Maybe I had something once? I truly don't remember. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, it’s very common to not remember details from past medical visits. Okay, let’s move on. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I don’t think so. Not that I recall. Maybe when I was a very small child… but that was a very long time ago. I don’t have any scars that I know of, and I haven't been hospitalized for anything. No, I'm pretty sure I haven't had any surgeries.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… That’s a bit of a complicated story. I’m divorced, haven’t seen my ex-wife in years. I have a daughter, but we’re not very close. She lives far away. As for health problems… I'm not sure. My parents… they passed away a long time ago. I don’t know much about their medical history, to be honest. It wasn’t something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s alright if you don’t have a lot of information about your family history. Let's talk about you, then. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I’m aware of. I eat pretty much everything. No reactions to any medications I've taken in the past, and I haven’t been stung by a bee or anything like that. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was a long time ago. I don’t have any problems with… rashes or anything like that. No, I don’t think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. An over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called? I don’t take it every day, just when they really bother me. And… that’s it. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I don't really feel like I need them.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for knee pain. Good to know. Now, Brando, just to get a baseline, I'd like to check your vital signs—your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration—and do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Let’s just get this over with, if you don't mind. The sooner it's done, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could sit here for me, please. Alright, your blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 76, temperature is 98.6, and your respiration rate is 16. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but we can keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Range of motion in knees is slightly limited, with some crepitus noted. You mentioned some pain in your knees, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. The knees. They ache, especially after a long shift at the theater. It’s just… getting old, I suppose. Is that what that crepitus means? Something breaking? I don't know these words, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, no, it's not necessarily something breaking. Crepitus is just the sound of the cartilage rubbing together a little – it's common as we get older and the cartilage wears down. It doesn't always mean there's a serious problem. We can talk about some ways to manage the pain if you’d like. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the knee pain, I'd like to order some basic blood work to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar. It'll give us a better picture of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… More poking and prodding, eh? Oh, alright. If it’s necessary. Just… please don’t take too much blood. I get a little lightheaded, you know. But yes, do whatever you need to do, Doctor. Let’s just get this finished.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll be as gentle as possible. I’ll write the lab order now. The lab is just down the hall; the nurse will give you the paperwork and directions. After they draw the blood, you can sit for a few minutes to make sure you’re feeling alright before you leave. While we wait for the results, I'll give you a handout on some exercises you can do to strengthen your knees. And I recommend keeping a log of your blood pressure at home for a week. We can discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. A handout and a blood pressure log. I suppose I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… are we finished here?
DOCTOR: No, we’re just about finished. I’m going to give you a copy of this work clearance form to take to your employer. It’ll just state that you’ve had a medical evaluation. Once the lab results are back—should be in a few days—we can fill out the more detailed sections of the form, if needed. The nurse will let you know when they’re available. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just… try not to take too much blood, alright? Thank you again, Doctor Condray. You've been very patient with an old man like me. I'll see you at the follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brando. And don’t worry, we’ll be gentle. Take care, and have a good day. The nurse will come get you when she’s ready.
