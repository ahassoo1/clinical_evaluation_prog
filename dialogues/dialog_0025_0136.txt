DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fogelstrom. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too. Um… it’s my… belching. It’s been happening a lot. It’s… embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Belching. Right. And how long has this… issue been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… maybe a month now? It started… after a big party. Lots of food, lots of… soda. But it hasn’t stopped. Even when I eat healthy now. It just… comes up. Sometimes really loud!
DOCTOR: A month. And you say it happens even with a healthy diet now?
PATIENT: Yes. Like, even if I have just… rice and beans, or chicken and salad. Not spicy things, you know? Just… normal food. It doesn't seem to matter. It's just… poof! I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: Hm. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this… belching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. My stomach… sometimes it feels a little full, maybe? But not pain. And… I guess I feel a little tired sometimes, but everyone is tired, right? Nothing major, definitely.
DOCTOR: “Everyone is tired” isn’t a medical diagnosis, Ms. Fogelstrom. But alright. Any nausea?
PATIENT: No, no nausea. I haven't thrown up, or even felt like I was going to. Just… the belching. And a little bit… uncomfortable sometimes, like too much air. But I don’t get sick or anything.
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up your chart here… Okay. No prior history of digestive issues noted. Allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything. I like all kinds of food! I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything. Just… vitamins sometimes, but not regularly. Nothing the doctor gave me, just… stuff I bought at the store.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like you might be swallowing too much air. You mentioned a party… are you a smoker?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Not me. I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don't chew gum either. I drink soda, sometimes, but not a lot. I like water better.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Fogelstrom, sometimes these things just happen. It’s likely just a bit of trapped gas. Try eating smaller meals, and avoiding carbonated beverages as much as possible. It’s probably nothing serious. Do you have any other concerns, or is that all?
PATIENT: So… just eat slower? And drink less soda? That’s it? But it’s been a month! I was worried it was something… bad. It just feels… so strange. But okay. No, I don't think that's all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, if it persists, or you develop any other symptoms – pain, bloating, nausea, anything – then come back, and we’ll consider further investigation. But for now, I wouldn't worry about it. Try those dietary changes, and see if that helps. Is there anything else today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you for seeing me. I was just… embarrassed to talk about it, but I'm glad I did. Hopefully, it will just go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Ms. Fogelstrom. .
PATIENT: Okay, you too. Thank you again. .
