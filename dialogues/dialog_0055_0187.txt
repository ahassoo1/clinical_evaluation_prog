DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re 86 years young. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Eighty-six, yes. Not young. Old. Very old. My chest… it feels funny. Like a bird flapping. And my head… pounding. Blood pressure, you say? Always high. Doctor before, he give pills. Not helping much anymore. Want fix now. Quick.
DOCTOR: “Funny,” is not a particularly helpful description, Mr. Sobkowicz. And “high” is similarly vague. It’s important we establish specifics. When did this “funny” feeling in your chest begin?
PATIENT: Specifics? Bah. Maybe… a week? Two? Hard to say. Old man forget things. It comes and goes. When I walk upstairs, it’s worse. And when I… watch the TV, very exciting program, it happens too. You know… action! Need to know what pill fix this. Not good to wait.
DOCTOR: So, it’s exacerbated by exertion – walking upstairs – and, shall we say, emotional stimulation. Very well. And you mentioned pills prescribed by a previous doctor. Do you recall the name of the medication, or perhaps the dosage?
PATIENT: Dosage? No. Names… even worse. Small white pill, I think. Maybe pink? Take one every… morning. With breakfast. Doctor Lee, maybe? Down on… Elm Street? Long time ago. Don't bother me with names. Just fix my chest. I have important things to do.
DOCTOR: Let me see if I can access your records from Dr. Lee’s practice… Ah, yes. It appears you were prescribed Lisinopril 20mg daily. That is a white pill. And it’s used to treat high blood pressure. Now, Mr. Sobkowicz, I'm going to need to perform a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… sounds familiar. Fine, fine. Exam. Quick, you promise? Don't poke too much. Old bones, you know. And no cold instruments. I hate cold. Get it over with. I have kimchi to check on. Very important.
DOCTOR: Very well. I assure you, I will be as efficient as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Another one. I do detect a slight crackling sound in your lower lobes. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. 160 over 90. Elevated, as you suspected. And your pulse is a bit rapid. Slight edema present. Now, I'd like to listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Abdomen? What for? My chest is the problem! Not my stomach. I eat kimchi, very healthy. No need to listen to belly. Waste of time. Is pill going to fix this or not? I don't have all day. You young doctors always poking and listening… never get straight to the point. My father, he had good doctor. No poking. Just pill.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, a thorough examination is necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms, not merely treat them. While your chest is your primary concern, changes in other areas can provide valuable insight. The crackling sound I heard suggests possible fluid in your lungs, which could be related to your blood pressure. It is prudent to assess the entirety of your condition. I will need to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to rule out any serious underlying causes. Until we have those results, I can cautiously increase your Lisinopril dosage, but this is not a long-term solution without a proper diagnosis. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: X-ray? More waiting! And EKG… more poking? Bah. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But no promises I stay all day. And if it takes too long, I’m leaving. Kimchi won’t check itself. Just… hurry. And make sure pills are strong ones. No tiny little pills. Understand? Strong. Now, get to it. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ve ordered the X-ray and EKG. The radiology technician will be in shortly to escort you. In the meantime, I will write a temporary prescription for Lisinopril 30mg daily. Please take this as directed, and avoid strenuous activity until we have the results of your tests. I understand your concerns, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I assure you we are doing everything we can to expedite the process. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Old man. I'm allergic to waiting. And young doctors who waste time. And cold instruments. That’s it. No, no food allergies. No pollen. Just… impatient. Now, get me those tests. And I need a chair. This standing is killing my feet. You young people, always so slow.
DOCTOR: Very well. A technician will be with you momentarily. I’ve noted your aversion to waiting and will speak with the radiology department to see if they can prioritize your scans. Please remain seated and try to relax. I will return as soon as the results are available. If you experience any chest pain or difficulty breathing, please alert the nursing staff immediately. .
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… hurry. And tell them no cold instruments. Kimchi is waiting. .
