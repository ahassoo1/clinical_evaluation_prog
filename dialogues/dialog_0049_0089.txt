DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, I suppose. Lower part. It’s been bothering me again, quite severely, actually. I do have… something with my system, doesn’t it say here? Something about lupus, perhaps? It’s awfully difficult to keep track of these things, you understand. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here a history of systemic lupus erythematosus. It can affect the gastrointestinal system, though it's not the most common manifestation. When you say “bothering you,” can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, lupus. That sounds right. It’s… a cramping, mostly. A very sharp cramping, and… a general ache. It feels like it’s deep inside, if that makes any sense. And… well, I’ve had a bit of nausea, but I haven’t actually been sick. It’s just… unpleasant. And it comes on rather suddenly, you see. One moment I’m fine, and the next… well, not fine. How often does that happen, you ask? Oh, goodness. I truly can’t recall. It varies, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Right. Sharp cramping and a general ache in the lower abdomen, with some nausea. Comes on suddenly, and the frequency is variable. Is there anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, to be honest. I eat… fairly normally, I think. Not much spicy food. I try to be careful. Sometimes… perhaps stress? But who doesn’t have a little stress? I find it difficult to pinpoint a definite cause, Doctor. It just… happens. Though, now that I think about it, it might be worse after I've been doing a lot of walking. I do enjoy a good stroll, you see. Perhaps that strains something? It’s truly hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay. No obvious dietary triggers, possible association with stress, and potentially worsened with walking. Do you notice any blood in your stool, or any changes in your bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it? No, no blood. Not that I've noticed, anyway. And… my, um, habits are generally… regular. Though, perhaps a little looser than usual during these episodes. Nothing terribly alarming, I assure you. Just… not quite as firm, if you understand what I mean. It doesn't last long, thankfully. It’s more the pain that’s bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright. No blood in the stool, bowel habits generally regular but slightly looser during episodes. The pain is the primary concern. And where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s… lower down, of course. Across the lower part of my stomach, really. It's not one specific spot, it kind of… spreads. More on the left side, I think, but it's hard to say for certain. It aches across, you see? And sometimes it feels… deeper, like it’s in my back, too. It’s rather difficult to pinpoint, Doctor. It’s just a general, uncomfortable ache, mostly. But when it gets bad, it’s very sharp, indeed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. I'd like to examine your abdomen, if you don't mind. Just lie down on the table and I'll take a listen and feel around. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Yes, of course. An examination sounds sensible. Though, I do hope it won’t be too unpleasant. My system is rather sensitive, you understand. Just let me know if I need to adjust. And please, do be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Take a deep breath in… and out… very good. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort as I press. Starting here… Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. A little. There. That’s… tender. Not excruciating, but… definitely noticeable. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… deep ache. And it seems to… radiate a little. Over there, perhaps? It's difficult to say precisely. It’s a rather dull ache, but it's definitely worse when you press there, Doctor. Please, do be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, and how about here?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, that’s… considerably more tender. Definitely worse on that side. It feels… almost like a cramping sensation, if that makes sense? A deep, internal cramp. And… it does seem to be radiating towards my back, a little. It's not a stabbing pain, more of a… persistent ache. Please, do be careful, Doctor. It's rather sensitive, you see. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I understand. No need to apologize. Tenderness to palpation in both lower quadrants, more pronounced on the left, with radiating pain to the back. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Your abdomen is soft, no masses palpated. Given your history of lupus, and these findings, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be a lupus flare affecting the gastrointestinal tract. It could also be diverticulitis, although you haven’t mentioned fever or chills. We should also consider irritable bowel syndrome, but your symptoms seem a bit more acute for that.
PATIENT: Oh, my. Diverti… what was it? And a flare? It's all rather overwhelming, Doctor. I do feel rather unwell, certainly, but a fever? No, I haven’t had a fever. Not that I recall, anyway. I simply feel… achy, and uncomfortable. And this pain… it’s quite debilitating when it’s bad. What do you think it is, Doctor? And what are we going to do about it? I do hope it isn't something terribly serious. I haven't the energy for a great deal of fuss, you understand.
DOCTOR: Diverticulitis is an inflammation of small pouches in the colon. It’s more common as people age. A lupus flare means the disease is becoming more active. Now, it’s unlikely to be terribly serious, but we need to rule things out. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete blood count to check for inflammation, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. I’d also like to order a stool sample to rule out infection. And a CT scan of your abdomen to get a better look at what’s going on. We need to see if this is a flare, an infection, or something else entirely. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Blood work, a stool sample… and a CT scan? That sounds… rather extensive, Doctor. I do hope it won't be too unpleasant. I'm not particularly fond of hospitals, you understand. And is all of this absolutely necessary? Perhaps a little rest and some… soothing tea would suffice? I do appreciate your concern, Doctor, but I do worry about unnecessary procedures. And how long will all of this take? I have… commitments, you see. Perhaps we could start with the blood work and see how that goes? It all sounds rather… alarming.
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, I understand your concerns. However, given your history and symptoms, these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your pain and rule out anything serious. Rest and tea are unlikely to resolve the issue if it is something more significant. A CT scan is the most accurate way to visualize your abdominal organs and identify any inflammation or abnormalities. The blood work is relatively quick and painless, and the stool sample is… well, a stool sample. It's not pleasant, but it's necessary. We can start with the blood work today. The stool sample and CT scan can be scheduled at your convenience. It’s better to be thorough and get a definitive answer than to simply hope for the best. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh… contrast dye? I… I don’t recall. I’ve had very few… procedures, you understand. I’ve always been rather healthy, until recently, of course. Perhaps I’m allergic to something… I really couldn’t say. I do tend to get a little… flushed sometimes, but that’s just my complexion, isn’t it? Oh dear. This is all rather… worrisome. If I have an allergic reaction to this dye, will it be terribly serious? Perhaps we could discuss alternative methods? I truly do appreciate your expertise, Doctor, but I'm rather… sensitive, you see. And I do dislike hospitals.
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, the contrast dye is used to enhance the images on the CT scan. It helps us see things more clearly. The risk of a severe allergic reaction is low, but it's important to rule it out. We can discuss an alternative scan – an MRI – but it's more expensive and takes longer. And it doesn't always provide the same level of detail. Before we proceed, I need you to sign this consent form acknowledging the risks and benefits of the CT scan with contrast. I’ll have the nurse explain the procedure in detail. She can also answer any questions you may have about the contrast dye and the scan itself. Are you able to sign this form now?
PATIENT: Oh… a consent form. It’s… rather long, isn’t it? And all of this legal jargon… it’s difficult to decipher, you understand. I haven’t a clue what “informed consent” entails. And what if I don’t sign it? Will I not receive treatment? I do appreciate your concern, Doctor, but I’m rather… overwhelmed, you see. Perhaps I should consult with someone else before making such a decision? I do have a friend, a rather sensible woman, who might be able to advise me. This is all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, signing the consent form simply means you understand the procedure and its risks. It does not obligate you to have the scan. However, without the scan, it will be very difficult to determine the cause of your pain. I understand you want to consult with your friend, but I need to be frank. Delaying the scan could potentially worsen your condition. I’ve explained the risks and benefits, and I believe it’s the best course of action. If you refuse to sign, I can continue to monitor your symptoms, but I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis or treatment plan. So, are you willing to sign the form, or would you prefer to proceed with a more conservative approach?
PATIENT: Oh… very well. I suppose it’s better to know, even if it’s unpleasant. I do trust your expertise, Doctor, even if I am rather… anxious. There. I’ve signed it. But please, do be gentle. And do let me know if anything goes wrong. I do hope it won’t be too painful. And can I at least have a cup of tea afterwards? I do find it soothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will come in shortly to explain the next steps and schedule the scan. I’ve ordered the blood work, and the results should be available within a few days. As for the tea… yes, you can certainly have a cup of tea afterwards. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: .
