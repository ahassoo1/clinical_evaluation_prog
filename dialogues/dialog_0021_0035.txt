DOCTOR: Hello, Mirriam. Welcome. I'm Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, it feels like forever, but my daughter says only a few days. They just won't stop. It's quite annoying, really.
DOCTOR: A few days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, a few days. My daughter, Lani, she’s very good with dates. I lose track sometimes, you know? Not forgetting things exactly, just… when they happened. It's these hiccups though, they come and go all the time. I was hoping you might have something for them.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, hiccups are… common. Usually nothing serious, thankfully. But persistent hiccups can be… a nuisance. Have you noticed anything specifically that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear it's not serious! Triggers… hmm. Not really. I've been trying to think. Eating doesn’t seem to do it, drinking water doesn’t… I was gardening yesterday, maybe that? Bending over a lot. But I garden all the time, so I wouldn’t think so. Honestly, they just start. Sometimes when I’m relaxing, sometimes when I’m doing something. It's very random.
DOCTOR: Random, alright. And how would you describe the hiccups themselves?
PATIENT: Just… normal hiccups, I suppose! You know, the little jerks, the “hic” sound. They’re not painful, just… startling. And they come in little bursts, a few in a row, then stop for a bit, then start again. It's not like one big, long series, you know? Hic! There, that’s one. See? Nothing dramatic.
DOCTOR: Right. Not dramatic, but persistent. And have you noticed anything else going on at the same time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, not really. I've been a bit tired lately, but that's just getting old, I think! And my knees ache, but that's the weather, always is. Nothing with the hiccups, no. Just the hiccups, and me trying not to jump every time they happen!
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a listen to your chest and do a quick check of your reflexes. Just to be thorough, you understand. It's probably nothing, but we should rule things out. It’s just…persistent hiccups can sometimes be a sign of something else. Not wanting to cause alarm, of course. Just being careful.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That makes sense. I understand. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Checking things is always a good idea. I'm happy to do whatever you need. I always trust the doctor knows best.
DOCTOR: Good. If you'll just lie down for me, please. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your reflexes. Do you have any trouble breathing at all, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: No trouble breathing, no. And no chest pain either. Just the hiccups! My daughter keeps telling me to drink water upside down, but that doesn't seem to do anything except make me wet.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths in… and out… again… good. Lungs sound clear. Heart rate is… regular. Reflexes are… a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Anything else you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Diminished reflexes… well, I suppose that makes sense. Everything feels a bit slower these days! No, no, nothing else. Just… these pesky hiccups. And sometimes I feel a little… fuzzy, like I can't quite remember what I was going to say, but that happens every now and then, too. Not new, just… occasional. It's not like I can't hold a conversation, you know? Just a little… blank sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given the… occasional memory lapses and the persistent hiccups, I’m going to order a basic blood panel. Just to check your electrolytes, kidney function, things like that. And I'd also like to get an EKG, just to be on the safe side. Rule out anything… cardiac. It's probably just dehydration or something simple, but it's best to be thorough. We'll start with those tests. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now. Do you have any allergies to latex, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Not to latex, not to anything. I've always been pretty lucky that way. Blood tests and an EKG… sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I appreciate you being so thorough. It puts my mind at ease. Just let me know when the nurse is ready, and I’ll be happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Good. I'll have the nurse come in shortly. After that, we’ll do the EKG right here in the room. In the meantime, try to relax. It’s likely nothing serious, truly. But it’s always best to check. The results usually take a few days, and the nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not dismissing me. It’s good to know you’re being careful. Just let me know when you’re ready, and I'll be happy to get the tests done. I’ll just try to relax, like you said. Though these hiccups might make that difficult!
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll leave you to it, then. The nurse will be in shortly. Don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new symptoms in the meantime. And try not to worry.
