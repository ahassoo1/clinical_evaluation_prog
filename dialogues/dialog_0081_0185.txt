DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ambris. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my breath. It smells…bad. Really bad, apparently. My ex-husband certainly made that clear. I just need something to fix it, quickly. I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: I see. “Bad breath,” or halitosis, is a common complaint. While I understand your… urgency, simply masking the odor isn’t always the most effective solution. We need to determine the cause of it. Has this been a recent development, or is it a long-standing issue?
PATIENT: Long-standing. Honestly, it's probably always been a little…present. But it’s gotten worse lately, I guess. And look, I brush, okay? I really do. It's not like I want it to smell like that. What does it even matter why, just give me something that works.
DOCTOR: It matters, Ms. Ambris, because the underlying cause could indicate a more serious problem. Simply giving you a mouthwash won't address potential issues like gum disease, sinus infections, or even – though less common – gastrointestinal problems. You brush, you say. How often, exactly, and with what kind of toothbrush and toothpaste?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you serious? You need to know everything? Fine. Twice a day, usually. Sometimes I forget if I'm busy, okay? It's a regular toothbrush, I don't need some fancy electric one. And... Colgate, I think? The white one. Look, I'm a highway worker, not a dentist! It gets the job done. Can we just skip to the part where you give me a fix?
DOCTOR: Highway work... that explains a few things, perhaps. And while I appreciate your… directness, Ms. Ambris, "getting the job done" isn’t always sufficient when it comes to oral hygiene. Do you floss daily?
PATIENT: Floss? Seriously? Look, I'm out in the sun all day, fixing roads, covered in dirt and grime. The last thing I'm thinking about is tiny strings between my teeth. No, I do not floss. Is that a problem? Just tell me if it is, and how much whatever solution is going to cost. I have a budget, you know.
DOCTOR: It is a problem, Ms. Ambris. Significant. Flossing removes food particles and plaque from areas your toothbrush simply cannot reach, preventing the build-up of bacteria that cause both bad breath and gum disease. To proceed with a solution, I need a more complete picture. Have you noticed any bleeding when you brush, or sensitivity to hot or cold?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Yes, sometimes my gums bleed a little, especially if I haven’t brushed for a day or two – like I said, busy. And yeah, hot stuff sometimes makes my teeth hurt. Not all the time, just…sometimes. Is that all you need to know? Seriously, how much is this going to be? I don’t want a lecture, I want a fix.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a quick look. Open wide, please. I need to examine your mouth to assess the extent of the inflammation and see if there are any obvious sources of the odor. It won’t be pleasant, but it's necessary.
PATIENT: Ugh, great. Just…get it over with. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Hmm. As I suspected. There's significant gingivitis – inflammation of the gums – and some early-stage periodontal disease beginning. The tartar buildup is also contributing to the problem. Your breath does have a rather…distinct odor. It's not simply a superficial issue, Ms. Ambris. I recommend a professional cleaning with scaling and root planing to remove the tartar and reduce the inflammation. It's a bit more involved than a standard cleaning, and will require at least two appointments.
PATIENT: Two appointments? And how much is that going to be? Look, I don’t have insurance, okay? I just need something quick and cheap. Is there anything – like, a really strong mouthwash, or something – that will just mask it enough to get me through a few days? I can’t spend a fortune on this.
DOCTOR: Masking the odor, as I’ve explained, is not a solution. It merely covers up a problem that will continue to worsen. The cost of scaling and root planing…it varies, but without insurance, you’re looking at approximately $600 to $800 total, split between the two appointments. I understand your financial concerns, Ms. Ambris. However, neglecting this could lead to tooth loss and more expensive procedures down the line. While I strongly advise the professional cleaning, I can prescribe a high-fluoride mouthwash to help control the bacteria and temporarily reduce the odor. It won’t solve the problem, but it may provide some temporary relief. It will cost approximately $25. However, you must commit to improving your oral hygiene – twice-daily brushing and daily flossing – to see any benefit. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. $25 I can manage. And I’ll try to floss, okay? But no promises. Just…write the prescription. And can we just be done here? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here's the prescription for the high-fluoride mouthwash. Use it as directed, and please, do attempt to floss daily. It’s essential. I will also give you a brochure outlining proper brushing and flossing techniques. I strongly recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to reassess your condition. I will not be able to provide additional treatment without a concrete commitment to preventative care. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…thanks. .
