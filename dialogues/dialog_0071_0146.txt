DOCTOR: Good morning, Edric. I'm Dr. Galena. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for having me. I've been having trouble with my muscles feeling… weak, I guess is the best way to put it. It's been going on for a bit now, and it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Weakness… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not like I can’t do things, it’s just… everything feels harder. Like, carrying groceries is more of a struggle than it used to be. Even just getting up from a chair takes more effort. It’s mostly in my legs and arms, I think. It doesn’t really hurt, just… tired. And weak.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. So, not pain, just… fatigue and difficulty. And it's mainly in your legs and arms. Has this come on suddenly, or has it been a gradual process?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. I didn’t wake up one day feeling completely different. It’s been… over the last few months, I'd say. Maybe six months? It started slowly, and I just figured I was getting out of shape. But it hasn’t gotten better, and if anything, it’s a little worse now.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months… that's helpful. And you said it's not improving, but worsening. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I've been a little more tired overall, but honestly, who isn't these days? I haven’t noticed any dizziness or anything like that. My appetite’s been normal, and I haven’t lost any weight that I’m aware of. No fever or anything, either. Just the weakness, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. No dizziness, no weight loss, no fever… good. Just the fatigue and weakness. Do you have any trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t fallen or anything. I walk normally, I think. It’s just… when I’m doing something that requires a bit of strength, that’s when I notice it. Like, if I’m lifting something heavy, or even just climbing stairs. I don’t feel unsteady just walking around, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. I had the flu a couple times, and I broke my wrist when I was a kid, but that’s about it. No chronic illnesses or anything like that. I haven’t had any surgeries, either. I generally don’t get sick much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major medical history. And no surgeries. What about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my mom… she had arthritis, I believe. She had trouble with her joints. Nothing else really jumps to mind. We weren’t really a family that talked a lot about health problems, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. High blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your mother… that’s helpful. And that’s alright, many families aren't open about health history. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I take over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes when I have a headache, and I’ve taken antibiotics a couple times when I was sick, but never had any problems. I eat everything, too. No food allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're currently not taking any regular medications, just occasional pain relievers. Alright, Edric, before we do a quick physical exam, let me ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never smoked a day in my life. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a beer or a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And I definitely don’t use any drugs. I try to stay pretty healthy, all things considered. Just this weakness is really worrying me.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Good. Very good. I appreciate your honesty. Now, let's just do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need. I’m ready when you are. I just… I’m hoping you can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Just relax your arm for me… Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not terribly concerning at this point. Pulse is 72, regular. Your heart sounds normal, lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Let me know if anything feels weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, good reflexes on both sides. A little diminished, actually... not alarming, but something to note. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can. It feels… a little weaker than usual, honestly. Not a lot, but I can definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I agree, grip strength feels a bit diminished on both sides, although not dramatically so. Now, let's check your muscle strength. Can you push against my hands with your arms, like you're trying to lift something heavy?
PATIENT: Okay, I’m pushing… I’m trying to push as hard as I can. It feels… harder than it should. Like I’m really straining. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, yes. I see what you mean. There's some resistance, but it's definitely less than I'd expect. And now your legs. Can you try to push your legs out against my hands, like you're trying to straighten them?
PATIENT: I'm trying… yeah, it feels weak. Like I'm having to really concentrate just to push against you. Not a lot of power there. This is… tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, there are a few things we need to investigate. Your muscle strength is diminished in both your arms and legs, and your reflexes are slightly reduced. I'm concerned about possible neuropathy, or something affecting your muscles themselves. We need to rule out vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and possibly consider some blood work to look for inflammatory markers. I’d also like to check your CK levels, which can indicate muscle damage. I want to be thorough. Do you have any objections to some blood tests?
PATIENT: No, no objections at all. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, and if there’s something I can do about it. Blood tests sound fine. I’m just… anxious to get some answers, honestly.
