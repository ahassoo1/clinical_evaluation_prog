DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Renzi. It nice to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, I been feelin’ a bit… off lately. I drinkin’ a lot more water than usual, and I always hungry. No matter what I eat, I feel like I need more. It just don’t seem right.
DOCTOR: Okay, that definitely sounds worth looking into. Increased thirst and hunger… hmm. And how long have you been feeling this way, Bianca?
PATIENT: Let me see… it start maybe… two, three months now? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little more thirsty after work, you know? But it gettin’ worse each week. And the hunger… that just constant now. Even when I just eat, I feelin’ empty. My husband sayin’ I lookin’ a little thin too, but I don't know if he just teasing me.
DOCTOR: It's good your husband is observant. It’s always helpful to have another perspective. Two to three months… alright. And besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Well… now that you ask… I been havin’ to go to the bathroom more often. Especially at night. Wakin’ me up sometimes. And I feel a little tired, you know? Not sick tired, just… worn out. Like I didn't sleep good even when I did. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Bianca. Increased urination, especially at night, and fatigue… those things can all be connected. Do you feel like you're losing weight, would you say?
PATIENT: I think so, yes. My clothes feelin’ a little loose, and like my husband say, he notice I lookin’ thinner. But I haven’t really weigh myself. We don't have one of those scales at home. I just know things ain't fittin’ like they used to. Is this somethin’ serious, Doctor? I gettin’ a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me all of this. It’s definitely worth investigating, and it's good to be proactive. The symptoms you’re describing can be associated with a number of things, and we need to rule some things out. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, Bianca?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision? Hmm… let me see. Not that I know of. I wear glasses for readin’, always have, and I get them check every year. The doctor say they still good when I went last time, back in March. Everything seem normal then. But I ain’t notice nothin’ different with my eyes, no blurry vision or anything like that. Just the normal readin’ glasses.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you experienced any unexplained bruising, or cuts that are slow to heal?
PATIENT: Bruising? No, not really. I might bump into things sometimes, like everyone does, but I don't bruise easy. And cuts heal normal, I think. I had a little scrape on my hand last week from the garden, and it was better in a few days. Not like it stay open forever, if that’s what you mean. I ain’t been sick or nothin’, so it heal quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. Just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies. I never had a problem with any medicine. My husband always say I strong as a horse! I can take anythin’ they give me. No allergies at all, that I know of. And I don't have no problems with food either. I eat everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take nothin’. I try to stay away from pills if I can. I believe in lettin’ my body heal itself, you know? I might take a little paracetamol for a headache sometimes, but that's it. Nothin’ regular, nothin’ at all. Just the paracetamol when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just tell me if it gonna hurt or anything. I ain’t afraid of a little check-up. Go ahead and do what you need to do, I'll cooperate. I just want to know what’s makin’ me feel so tired and thirsty all the time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Here I am, Doctor. Just let me know what you want me to do. I hope it don't take too long, my husband waitin' in the car.
DOCTOR: It won't take long at all, Bianca. Just relax your arm, and try to take a few deep breaths. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright, I breathin’. Everything soundin’ okay to me, but I ain’t a doctor, so you know best. It just a little warm in here, maybe that’s why I feelin’ a little funny. But I breathin’ deep, like you say. Is everything alright so far, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, which is good. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen – that means I'll press on your belly to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Ooh, that a little tender there, yes. Not painful painful, but I feel somethin’ when you push there. Just a little uncomfortable, maybe. It been feelin’ kinda achy there for a few days now, I guess. I thought it was just somethin’ I ate, but now you askin’… it been botherin’ me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And what about here, on the left side?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ there. That feelin’ fine. Just that right side, like you say. It not sharp pain, just kinda… achy and tender. It gettin’ worse when I move around too much. I been tryin’ to take it easy, but you know how it is… gotta get things done! But I feel somethin’ when you push there, yes. Like somethin’ ain’t right.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. Based on what you’ve told me, and the tenderness I’m feeling in your lower right abdomen, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a simple muscle strain, but we need to rule out other things, such as appendicitis or a problem with your gallbladder. To do that, I’m going to order some blood work and a urine test. We’ll also need to get an imaging scan, likely a CT scan of your abdomen, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan? That sound serious, Doctor. Appendicitis? Gallbladder? I ain’t never had nothin’ like that before. What does that mean? Will I have to go to the hospital? I got things to do, you know? My husband rely on me! What’s the next step? Tell me what’s happenin’, please. I gettin’ a little scared now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Bianca, and it’s perfectly normal to feel scared when you hear about tests like this. Let’s take it one step at a time. A CT scan is a very good way to see inside your abdomen and figure out what’s causing your pain. It's not invasive – you'll simply lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. As for appendicitis and gallbladder issues, they are just possibilities we need to rule out. Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, and gallbladder problems can cause pain in the abdomen as well. However, there are other things it could be, and the tests will help us narrow it down. Whether you'll need to go to the hospital depends on the results of the tests. If it's something minor, we can manage it here in the clinic. But if it's something more serious, you may need to be admitted for further treatment. I’m going to write an order for the blood work and urine test right now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be able to draw the samples for you. Then, we’ll schedule the CT scan for you as soon as possible. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: So, I gotta get blood taken and then lie in a machine? That sound… a lot. What about the blood work? Will it show if somethin’ serious wrong? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't like waitin’ when somethin’s wrong. My husband will be worryin’ sick if I take too long. And what if it is appendicitis? Do they have to take it out? Oh dear, oh dear… I gettin’ all flustered now. Maybe I shoulda just stayed home and had a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: It does sound like a lot, I understand. But getting these tests done is the best way to find out what’s going on and get you feeling better. The blood work will help us look for signs of infection or inflammation, and it can also give us clues about how your organs are functioning. It shouldn’t take too long – usually a few hours to get the results back. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. As for appendicitis, yes, usually the treatment is surgical removal of the appendix. But let’s not jump to conclusions yet. We haven’t even done the tests, and it could be something completely different. I'm going to write the order for the tests now. And I'll have the nurse come in to explain everything in more detail and answer any other questions you might have. She’s very good at calming people down. Just try to take a few deep breaths, Bianca. We’re going to figure this out together. And I’ll keep you informed every step of the way. Is there anyone you’d like me to call for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Call my husband, Samuel. His number is 555-123-4567. He been waitin’ in the car, gettin’ worried, I bet. And maybe he can come with me when I have to lie in that machine, if that’s alright. I get a little scared when I’m alone. And thank you, Doctor. You been very kind. I still feelin’ flustered, but a little better knowin’ you lookin’ after me. Just please, please don’t let nothin’ serious wrong. I got too much to do!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Bianca. I’ll have the nurse call Samuel right away and let him know what’s going on. And yes, of course, he can come with you for the CT scan. Having someone there for support is always a good idea. I understand you’re worried, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious in situations like this. We’re going to do everything we can to get you a diagnosis and a treatment plan. And remember, we haven't even done the tests yet, so let's not jump to conclusions. Nurse Ramirez, could you please come in for a moment?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I just hope it ain’t nothin’ too serious. I got a garden to tend to, you know? And Samuel depend on me for everything. I can’t be sick!
DOCTOR: Nurse Ramirez: Good morning, Bianca. Dr. Renzi has explained that we’re going to do some tests to figure out what’s going on. I’m going to call Samuel now, so he can come and be with you. Then, I’ll explain the blood work and CT scan in more detail. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Nurse. Thank you for callin’ my husband. He been worryin’, I bet. Um… let me see. How long will the blood work take? And what do they do for a CT scan? Do they have to put somethin’ in my arm? I don’t like needles, you know. And will it hurt? I just want to know what to expect, so I don’t get too scared.
DOCTOR: Nurse Ramirez: That’s perfectly understandable, Bianca. It’s good to know what to expect. The blood work will only take a few minutes – we’ll just need to draw a few vials of blood from your arm. Yes, there will be a needle involved, but I’m very good at it, and I’ll try to make it as painless as possible. It’s usually just a quick pinch, and then it’s over. As for the CT scan, you’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It’s completely painless – you won’t feel anything at all. We may give you some contrast dye through an IV line to help get a clearer picture, and that can sometimes feel a little warm as it goes in, but it’s not usually uncomfortable. The scan itself only takes a few minutes, and you’ll be able to hear the machine making some noises. We’ll be right there with you the whole time, so you won’t be alone. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Through an IV line? Oh dear. I ain’t never had an IV before. What if I have a reaction to the dye? And what if the machine… what if it do somethin’ bad? I been hearin’ stories about machines… I just want to go home and have a cup of tea. Is there somethin’ else we can do? Maybe a different test? I don’t like machines and needles and dye… It all sound very scary.
DOCTOR: Nurse Ramirez: I understand your concerns, Bianca. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical tests, especially if you’ve never had them before. Let me assure you, CT scans are very safe. We take every precaution to minimize any risks. As for a reaction to the contrast dye, it’s very rare, but we always have medications on hand to treat it if it happens. We’ll ask you some questions beforehand to make sure you’re not allergic to anything, and we’ll monitor you closely during the scan. And the machine itself is perfectly harmless. It just uses X-rays to create images of your internal organs. The radiation dose is very low, and it’s not harmful. There are other tests we could consider, but they’re not as accurate as a CT scan. For example, we could do an ultrasound, but it doesn’t provide as much detail. Or we could do more blood work, but it won’t give us a clear picture of what’s going on inside your abdomen. Ultimately, the best way to get a diagnosis is to do the CT scan. But I understand you’re feeling scared, and we’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. Do you want to talk to Dr. Renzi again?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I want to talk to the Doctor again. I just… I don’t like all this. Machines and needles and dye… It all sound so frightening. Maybe it’s just somethin’ I ate. Maybe it’ll go away on its own. I just want to go home. I feelin’ so scared and flustered. Maybe I shoulda just stayed home and had a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Bianca, it’s okay to be scared. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed, and that's completely understandable. You’re not alone in this, and we’re going to get through this together. I hear you saying you don’t like the idea of machines, needles, and dye. And I respect that. But we need to figure out what’s causing your symptoms, and the CT scan is the best way to do that. Let’s talk about your concerns. What specifically about the CT scan is frightening you the most?
PATIENT: It just… everything! Lying in a machine… what if it get stuck? What if it do somethin’ bad to me? And the dye… what if I have a reaction and I… I don’t know! And the needles… I hate needles! I always faint when they try to take my blood. And I feelin’ so weak already, what if I faint in the machine? And I just… I just want to go home and have a cup of tea and forget about all this! It all sound so scary, Doctor. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Bianca, it’s okay. Take a few deep breaths. We're going to slow down. You are safe here, and we are not going to do anything you are not comfortable with. It sounds like you have a lot of anxiety about needles and enclosed spaces, and that’s perfectly valid. We can definitely address that. First, we can talk to the radiology technician about your fear of enclosed spaces. They can explain the machine in detail and make sure you feel comfortable. They can even keep the machine open if that helps. As for the needles, we can use a topical numbing cream to help reduce the pain. And we’ll have you lie down and relax during the blood draw. We can also have the nurse stay with you the whole time to provide support. If you’re worried about fainting, we can have you lie down flat beforehand and monitor your blood pressure. We don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with. We can discuss other options, even if they're not as accurate. But let's try to address your fears first. Would you be willing to talk to the radiology technician and see how you feel?
PATIENT: Maybe… maybe I can talk to the technician. But I don’t want to lie in a machine that’s all closed up. And I don’t want to have a reaction to the dye. And I really don’t want a needle. It all sound so scary, Doctor. I just want to know it’s safe. And I want my husband. Can Samuel come with me? He always calms me down. And maybe… maybe he can hold my hand during the scan? If that’s allowed?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Bianca. That’s perfectly reasonable. We will absolutely do everything we can to make you feel safe and comfortable. Yes, Samuel can absolutely come with you during the scan. He can hold your hand the entire time, and he can be right there next to you. And we will make sure the machine is as open as possible, so you don’t feel enclosed. We can even have the technician explain everything step-by-step before we start, so you know exactly what to expect. As for the dye, we'll ask you some questions beforehand to make sure you’re not allergic to anything. And we’ll monitor you closely during the scan, so we can immediately address any concerns. Let me talk to the radiology technician and let them know about your fears. Then, we can have them come in and talk to you and Samuel. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be good. Talking to the technician… and having Samuel with me… that would make me feel a little better. Maybe… maybe I can do this. But I still don’t like the idea of a needle. And I want to know everything that’s happenin’ before it happens. No surprises, please. Thank you, Doctor. You been very kind. I just want to get this over with and go home.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Bianca. That’s what I’m here for. And absolutely, no surprises. We will explain everything step-by-step, and you can ask as many questions as you like. You are in control here. Let me call the radiology technician now. Samuel can come with you and listen to everything as well. I'll be right back, and we will get through this together. Nurse Ramirez, could you please get the radiology technician to come in and speak with Bianca and her husband, Samuel?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Technician: Hi Bianca, hi Samuel. I'm Mark, one of the radiology technicians here. Dr. Renzi asked me to come in and talk to you about the CT scan. I understand you're a little anxious about it, and that's perfectly normal. We'll go through everything step-by-step, so you know exactly what to expect. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good. I'm very scared of machines and needles. And I don't like being closed in. Can you tell me everything that's going to happen? And how long will it take? And will it hurt? And what does the machine look like? Is it big and scary? And what about the dye? What does it feel like? And what if I have a reaction? I have so many questions…
DOCTOR: Technician: Absolutely, Bianca. That’s perfectly fine. You ask as many questions as you need to. Let’s start with the machine. It’s a large, donut-shaped machine. It’s not closed in completely, there’s a large opening in the middle. You’ll lie on a table that slides into the opening. It’s a bit like lying in a large tunnel. The scan itself takes about 5-10 minutes. You’ll need to lie very still during the scan, so we get clear images. It doesn’t hurt at all. You won't feel anything during the scan itself. Now, about the dye. It’s a liquid that we inject into your arm through a small needle. It helps us get better images of your organs. You might feel a warm sensation when the dye goes in, and you might taste a metallic taste in your mouth. That’s normal. As for a reaction to the dye, it’s very rare. We always ask you some questions beforehand to make sure you’re not allergic to anything. And we’ll monitor you closely during the scan, so we can immediately address any concerns. We have medications on hand to treat any reactions if they happen, but it's very unlikely. Does that help answer some of your questions?
PATIENT: It sounds a little better, but I'm still scared of the needle. And I don’t like being closed in, even if it’s not completely closed. Can the machine be open more? And what if I start to panic during the scan? Can I tell you to stop? And what if I need to go to the bathroom during the scan? I have a small bladder, you know. And what if the dye makes me sick? I just have so many worries…
DOCTOR: Technician: Absolutely, Bianca. You have every right to be worried, and it’s good you’re asking these questions. Yes, we can definitely keep the machine more open. We can adjust it so you feel more comfortable. You won’t be enclosed at all. And yes, you can absolutely tell me to stop at any time. If you start to feel panicked or uncomfortable, just let me know, and we’ll stop the scan immediately. We’re here to make you comfortable, and we won’t do anything you’re not comfortable with. As for needing to go to the bathroom, it’s best to empty your bladder before the scan. And if you start to feel like you need to go during the scan, just let me know, and we’ll stop and let you go. As for the dye making you sick, it’s very rare. Some people might feel a little warm sensation or a metallic taste in their mouth, but it doesn't usually cause any sickness. We'll monitor you closely during the scan and have medications on hand if you do feel unwell. Does that help ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: It’s a little better, yes. Knowing I can stop at any time… that makes me feel a little bit better. And knowing I can go to the bathroom… that’s good. But I’m still scared of the needle. Is it a big needle? And will it hurt a lot? And what if you miss and you have to poke me again? I don’t like needles at all.
DOCTOR: Technician: I understand your fear of needles, Bianca. It’s very common. It’s not a big needle, it’s a small needle, similar to the ones they use to draw blood. And we’re very skilled at inserting it, so it usually doesn’t hurt much. It’s usually just a quick pinch, and then it’s over. We always aim carefully, so we rarely miss. But if we do, we’ll try again immediately. We’ll be very gentle and careful. And we can use a numbing cream before the injection to help reduce any discomfort. Would you like me to get some numbing cream for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Numbing cream would be good. Anything to make it less scary. And can you tell me exactly what you're going to do before you do it? I don't like surprises. And can Samuel hold my hand during the injection? He always calms me down. And can you be very gentle? I bruise easily, you know. And can you talk to me during the injection? Distract me? I just want it to be over quickly.
DOCTOR: Technician: Absolutely, Bianca. We can do all of that. I’ll get the numbing cream right away. It will take a few minutes to work, so we’ll apply it first. And yes, Samuel can definitely hold your hand during the injection. He can be right there with you, and he can talk to you and distract you if you like. I'll also tell you exactly what I'm going to do before I do it, so there are no surprises. I’ll be very gentle, and I'll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the entire process. I can also talk to you during the injection to distract you. We’ll take it slow, and we won't rush anything. Let's get the numbing cream applied first, and then we can go from there. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you. I just want it to be over quickly.
DOCTOR: Technician: Alright, I’m applying the numbing cream now. It will take a few minutes to work, so just relax. I’ll let you know when it’s ready. In the meantime, Samuel can hold your hand, and we can talk if you like. Just take a few deep breaths, and try to relax. It will be over before you know it. Do you want to talk about anything?
PATIENT: Thank you, Samuel. Um… let me see. I like gardening, you know. I grow tomatoes and peppers and flowers. It's very relaxing. But lately, I haven't been feeling well enough to tend to my garden. I miss it very much. And I worry about my plants. They need water and care. And the weeds… they grow so quickly!
DOCTOR: Technician: That sounds lovely, Bianca. Gardening is a wonderful hobby. It's very rewarding to grow your own food and flowers. I bet your garden looks beautiful. And I can understand why you'd miss it when you're not feeling well. It's good to have something you enjoy. The cream is starting to work now. Your skin should be feeling a little numb. Are you feeling anything?
PATIENT: Yes, it feels a little… tingly. Not painful, just… different. A little numb, like you said. It's strange. But not scary. Samuel's hand is very comforting. He always knows what to say to calm me down. Is it time for the needle now? I'm a little bit nervous, but I'm trying to be brave.
DOCTOR: Technician: Yes, it's time for the needle now. Just take a deep breath, and try to relax. I'll be very quick and gentle. You might feel a little pinch, but it will be over before you know it. Samuel, you can hold her hand if you like. Just focus on your breathing, and try to think about something happy. How about your beautiful garden?
PATIENT: Ouch! That was… not so bad. It's over now, right? Is the dye going in now? I just want it to be over quickly.
DOCTOR: Technician: Yes, it’s over now. The dye is going in now. You might feel a warm sensation, and you might taste a metallic taste in your mouth. That’s perfectly normal. Just relax, and try to breathe deeply. It will only take a few moments. Just focus on your breathing, and Samuel is right there with you. You’re doing great, Bianca. Do you feel anything?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel warm. And I taste… metal. It’s strange. But not terrible. Just… different. How much longer? I just want it to be over quickly.
DOCTOR: Technician: Almost done, Bianca. Just a few more seconds. You're doing great. You might feel a little pressure, but that's perfectly normal. Just focus on your breathing, and it will be over before you know it. Okay, all done! I’m removing the needle now. Just a little pressure, and then we’re finished. There you go. All done! How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness! It’s over. I feel… a little warm, and a little strange. But okay. It wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. Thank you, Samuel, for holding my hand. And thank you, Doctor, for being so gentle. Now, what happens next? Do I have to lie in the machine now?
DOCTOR: Technician: You’re very welcome, Bianca. You were very brave! And yes, now it’s time to lie in the machine. It’s just a large tunnel, and you’ll need to lie very still for a few minutes. I’ll help you onto the table, and then I’ll position you so you’re comfortable. I’ll also give you a button to press if you need anything. Just relax, and try to breathe deeply. I’ll be right here the whole time, and I’ll talk to you throughout the scan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… I guess so. A tunnel, you say? Is it… closed in? And what if I get scared? And what if I can’t lie still? And what if I need to go to the bathroom? I have a small bladder, you know. And what if I start to panic? I just want it to be over quickly.
DOCTOR: Technician: It’s not completely closed in, Bianca. It’s open at both ends, and you’ll be able to see out. And you can definitely tell me to stop at any time if you get scared or uncomfortable. We’re here to make you comfortable, and we won’t do anything you’re not comfortable with. As for lying still, just try your best. It’s okay if you move a little bit, but it’s best to stay as still as possible so we get clear images. And if you need to go to the bathroom, just let me know, and we’ll stop the scan. And if you start to panic, just press the button, and I’ll be right here. We’ll take it slow, and we won’t rush anything. Just relax, and try to breathe deeply. I’ll be right here the whole time, and I’ll talk to you throughout the scan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… I guess so. But can Samuel come with me onto the table? I want him close by. And can you tell me exactly what’s going to happen before it happens? I don’t like surprises. And can you talk to me throughout the scan? Distract me? I just want it to be over quickly.
DOCTOR: Technician: Absolutely, Bianca. Samuel can definitely come with you onto the table. And I will tell you exactly what’s going to happen before it happens. No surprises, I promise. And I will talk to you throughout the scan to distract you. We can talk about your garden, or anything else you like. Let’s get you onto the table now. I’ll help you lie down, and then I’ll position you so you’re comfortable. Just relax, and try to breathe deeply. I’ll be right here the whole time. Okay, you’re lying down now. Just relax your arms at your sides, and try to stay as still as possible. I’ll be right here, talking to you throughout the scan. Just breathe deeply, and try to think about something happy. Are you ready to begin?
PATIENT: Okay… I guess so. But can you tell me exactly what’s going to happen now? Before it starts? I don’t like surprises. And can you talk to me throughout the scan? About my garden? Or anything else? I just want it to be over quickly.
DOCTOR: Technician: Absolutely, Bianca. I will tell you exactly what’s going to happen now. The machine is going to start moving slowly, and it will make some whirring and clicking sounds. That’s perfectly normal. It will feel like you’re being tunnelled through a large tube. I will be right here, talking to you throughout the scan. We can talk about your garden, or anything else you like. Just focus on your breathing, and try to relax. I’m starting the scan now. Just breathe deeply, and try to stay as still as possible. So, tell me more about your garden. What are you growing right now?
PATIENT: Well… I’m growing tomatoes, of course. Lots of different kinds. Red ones, yellow ones, cherry tomatoes… And peppers, too. Bell peppers, jalapeños… And flowers. Lots of colorful flowers. Marigolds, petunias, zinnias… They attract the bees, you know. And the bees are important for pollinating the tomatoes and peppers. But lately, I haven’t been able to tend to my garden as much as I’d like. I’ve been feeling so tired lately.
DOCTOR: Technician: That sounds lovely, Bianca. It sounds like you have a beautiful garden. It’s wonderful that you’re growing your own food and flowers. And it’s great that you’re attracting the bees. They’re very important for pollinating the plants. It’s understandable that you’re feeling tired lately. Just try to relax, and focus on your breathing. We’re almost done now. Just a few more minutes. Do you have any other hobbies besides gardening?
PATIENT: Well… I like to cook, too. I use the tomatoes and peppers from my garden in my cooking. I make tomato sauce, pepper relish… And I like to bake. I make cakes, cookies… And I like to read. I read mystery novels mostly. And I like to spend time with my family. But lately, I haven’t been feeling well enough to do much of anything. Is it almost over? I just want it to be over quickly.
DOCTOR: Technician: Yes, it’s almost over, Bianca. Just a few more seconds. You’re doing great. I know it’s not comfortable, but you’re doing a wonderful job. Okay, we’re done! The scan is finished. You can sit up now, and take your time. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness! It’s finally over. I feel… a little tired, and a little shaken up, but okay. Thank you, Doctor, for being so gentle. And thank you, Samuel, for being here with me. What happens now? Do I have to wait for the results? How long will it take?
DOCTOR: Technician: You’re very welcome, Bianca. You were very brave! The radiologist will review the images, and then they’ll send the results to your doctor. It usually takes a few days to get the results. Your doctor will then contact you to discuss the results and any further steps. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you again. You were very kind and helpful. And thank you, Samuel. I think I just want to go home and rest now.
DOCTOR: Technician: You’re very welcome, Bianca. I’m glad I could help. Just take it easy, and get some rest. If you have any questions later on, don’t hesitate to contact your doctor’s office. Have a good day, Bianca.
PATIENT: Thank you. You too.
