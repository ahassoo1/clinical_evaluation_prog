DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I… I requested to be tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, and I thought it was finally time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub. That’s a responsible decision. It's good you're taking this step. To make sure we get all the necessary information, could you tell me a little bit about why you decided to get tested now?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Honestly, it’s… it's a bit difficult to explain. My husband and I, we’ve been married for quite some time, and… well, recently we’ve been talking more openly about… things. About our pasts, you understand. And it just felt like the right time to be sure. For both of us, really. It’s not that I expect anything to be wrong, but peace of mind is important, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shaub. It's very mature of you and your husband to have those conversations and prioritize your health and peace of mind. It’s excellent you’re doing this together. Before we proceed with the testing, I’d like to ask a few questions to get a better understanding of your risk factors. This will help us interpret the results accurately. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Please, ask whatever you need to. I want to make sure we do this properly.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: To the best of my knowledge, no, I haven't. Not that I recall, anyway. I’ve had routine check-ups, of course, but never anything requiring a transfusion. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. Though, being a parking attendant does keep me on my feet!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you ever shared needles with anyone, or used intravenous drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never… I wouldn't even know where to begin with that. My husband and I, we don’t… partake in anything like that. We are churchgoers, you see. A very respectable congregation.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Shaub. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit of a personal question, Doctor. But I suppose I can answer truthfully. Years ago, before I met my husband, I did have a… a bout with something. A minor infection, treated quickly. It was… a lesson learned, let’s just say. It’s been many years, and I’ve been with my husband exclusively ever since. We’ve always been very careful, but… I wanted to be absolutely certain.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Shaub. It’s important information. Do you remember what the infection was, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it was so long ago, my memory is a bit hazy. I think it was… chlamydia, perhaps? Or gonorrhea. Something common, easily treated, the doctor at the time assured me. I was young, and… foolish. But I made sure it was cleared up completely, and I haven't had any issues since. It’s why I’m being so thorough now, you see. I want to be certain everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Ms. Shaub. That's helpful information. And have you ever had any sexual contact with someone who you knew, or suspected, might have HIV?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband and I… we’ve always been very careful and, as I said, exclusively with each other. We've never… experimented, for lack of a better word. We've always been very respectful of each other and… well, we're both devoted Christians. It’s just… wanting to be absolutely certain, that’s all. After our conversations, I wanted to put my mind completely at ease.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub. That’s very good to know. Now, before we move on to the testing itself, do you have any allergies to any medications or latex?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything, thankfully. No medications, no food, certainly no latex. I’m quite… resilient, I suppose. Though, I do get a bit anxious at the dentist! But that’s hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that's not an allergy! Okay, good. It sounds like you’ve been very proactive about your health, which is wonderful. Now, we can proceed with the HIV test. There are a couple of different options. We can do a blood draw, which is the most accurate, or a rapid oral fluid test, which gives results in about 20-30 minutes. The oral fluid test is less accurate and may require follow-up testing. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Hmm. A blood draw sounds… more thorough, doesn't it? If accuracy is the most important thing, then I think a blood draw would be best. I don't mind needles, not at all. I’ve had plenty of vaccinations over the years. Yes, please, let’s do the blood draw.
DOCTOR: Okay, good choice, Ms. Shaub. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be back within a few business days. While we wait for the results, I want to talk to you about pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, and post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP. They’re medications that can help prevent HIV infection. Would you like me to explain those to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please do. I’m always open to learning more about staying healthy and protecting myself. I’ve heard those terms mentioned on television, but I don't really understand what they involve. If you wouldn’t mind explaining them to me, I’d appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a medication you take before you think you might be exposed to HIV to help prevent infection. It’s a daily pill, and it’s very effective when taken consistently. PEP, or post-exposure prophylaxis, is a medication you take after a potential exposure to HIV. It needs to be started within 72 hours of the exposure to be effective. It’s a 28-day course of medication. Do you have any questions about either of those options so far?
PATIENT: Hmm. So, PrEP is for… prevention, generally? Like, if someone is at higher risk, they take it regularly? And PEP is if something… unexpected happens, and you need to take something quickly? Is that right? It sounds… complicated. And I suppose, as I'm getting tested now, those aren't really relevant for me at the moment, are they? It’s good to know, but… a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You’ve got it exactly right, Ms. Shaub. PrEP is for ongoing prevention for people at higher risk, and PEP is for emergency situations. And you are right, at the moment, since you're getting tested, they're not immediately relevant. But I like to give patients all the information, so you're aware of your options. Okay, let’s get this blood draw done. The nurse will be in shortly to take your vitals and draw the sample. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’m just… a little anxious, waiting for the results, naturally. But I feel much better knowing I’m being proactive about this. Thank you for taking the time to answer all my questions. I’ll just sit here quietly and wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub. That’s perfectly understandable. Waiting for results can be stressful, but remember, you’ve done the right thing by getting tested. I'll have the nurse come in as soon as she's available. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns while you wait.
