DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. I am Dr. Pipkorn. I see you’re nineteen years of age. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my speech, I think. It’s been… a little off. Hard to explain, really. It feels like I’m not saying things clearly, sometimes. I’m not sure when it started, exactly. It just… happened.
DOCTOR: "A little off," you say. Could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Elaborate… right. It’s like… the words get jumbled, sometimes. Or… slow, maybe? People have been… looking at me funny when I talk. My husband noticed it first, I think. He said I sounded… slurred? I don’t always notice it myself, to be honest. It comes and goes. I really don’t remember when it started happening regularly, though. Sorry, I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: Slurred speech is certainly concerning. And the intermittent nature is… unusual. Let’s try to pinpoint this a bit more accurately. Has this occurred after any specific event?
PATIENT: Specific event… Hmm… not that I can recall, no. I work, you know, construction… mostly just managing things, not the physical labor. It hasn't gotten worse after a long day at work, or anything like that. Or… after a fall. I haven’t had any falls. I… honestly, Doctor, my memory’s not the best. I just… know my speech feels different sometimes. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: "Different" is not particularly helpful, Ms. Swaby. We need specifics to determine the cause. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this speech alteration?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… I… I haven’t really noticed anything else. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work long hours. I haven’t had any headaches, or dizziness, or… anything like that. Oh! Actually… now that I think about it… I have been tripping over things a little more lately. Just small things, though. Like, bumping into furniture. I thought I was just being clumsy, to be honest. Is that… related? I don't even know.
DOCTOR: Tripping and clumsiness could be relevant. Alright. Let's proceed with a basic neurological examination. I'd like to assess your reflexes, coordination, and strength. It's standard procedure given your symptoms. May I ask about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. A neurological… examination. Sounds… serious. Past medical history… Hmm. Well, I don’t really have much of one. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I guess… measles, mumps, rubella, all that. Nothing major, though. And… I have Medicare, if that’s what you need to know. I haven't been to the doctor in a while. Really. I mostly just avoid getting sick. Is my husband’s information important? He’s usually the one who worries about these things.
DOCTOR: Childhood illnesses are irrelevant at this point, Ms. Swaby. And Medicare is noted. Your husband's health is not pertinent unless there's a familial connection to neurological disorders. Now, have you had any surgical procedures or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgical procedures… No, I haven’t. Never had any surgery. And… no hospital stays, either. Nothing like that. I… I really have been very lucky, health-wise. I don't even take any regular medications, unless you count a vitamin D supplement in the winter. My husband keeps telling me to be more careful. He worries a lot. Is it… bad that I can't remember things as easily as I used to? Sometimes I think my brain is just slow.
DOCTOR: Vitamin D is negligible. Now, let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational substances?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… No, Doctor. I don't smoke. I… I don't really drink, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. And definitely no recreational substances. I… my husband and I don’t really… do any of that. We’re pretty straightforward people, if you know what I mean. We just work and… try to stay out of trouble. Is that… helpful? I’m sorry I’m not giving you clear answers.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Swaby, it is not unhelpful. It simply… doesn't provide much in the way of diagnostic clues. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My husband always asks when we go to restaurants, but I always tell him I’m fine. Sometimes I get a little sniffly in the spring, but I think that’s just the pollen. We don’t have any pets, so it’s not animal allergies. I really haven’t had any serious health problems, honestly. This speech thing is just… weird. Is there something seriously wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions, Ms. Swaby. We're simply gathering information. Alright. Now, I'm going to perform a brief physical and neurological examination. Please follow my instructions as best as you can. I will assess your cranial nerves, motor strength, reflexes, and coordination. We’ll start with your eyes. Can you follow my finger without moving your head?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, I can do that. Just follow your finger… without moving my head. Right. Is this… okay? Am I doing it right? It feels a little strange to focus so hard on one thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're doing fine. Now, can you follow my finger as I bring it closer to your nose?
PATIENT: Yes… I can see it. It’s getting closer… right there. It feels a little… blurry when it’s so close. Is that normal? I think my eyes are tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I want you to close your eyes. I’m going to test your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh! That tickled. Was that… good? It didn't feel very strong, though. My husband says I have weak reflexes. I always thought it was because I'm not very athletic. Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are indeed diminished, Ms. Swaby. And your balance is… somewhat unsteady. Now, I want you to walk a straight line for me. I need to assess your gait.
PATIENT: Okay… trying to walk straight… This is… harder than it looks. My legs feel a little weak. Is something seriously wrong with me, Doctor? I’m getting scared.
DOCTOR: Ms. Swaby, based on my preliminary examination, I’m concerned about possible neurological dysfunction. Your diminished reflexes, unsteady balance, and unsteady gait warrant further investigation. I’m going to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. I will also order blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies and other potential causes. Do you have any history of migraines or seizures?
PATIENT: An MRI…? Neurological dysfunction…? No… no migraines… and definitely no seizures… I’ve never had anything like that. I… I get headaches sometimes, like everyone does, but nothing serious. What… what does this mean, Doctor? Is it… is it serious? What if… what if there’s something really wrong with my brain? I’m so scared.
DOCTOR: Ms. Swaby, it's important not to jump to conclusions. An MRI is simply a diagnostic tool to help us determine the cause of your symptoms. Many things can cause neurological symptoms, and not all of them are serious. We need to gather more information before we can make a diagnosis. I am referring you to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. They will review your MRI results and conduct further testing to determine the best course of treatment. I will also order a referral to physical therapy, and they can help improve your balance and coordination while we await your neurology appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… and a neurologist… How long will it take to get the MRI…? And… what if they do find something wrong…? Will… will I need surgery…? And… my husband… he’s going to be so worried. He’ll want to come with me… is that alright? .
DOCTOR: The MRI appointment can typically be scheduled within a week. As for the possibility of finding something, we must remain optimistic. The neurologist will discuss all your options with you should any abnormalities be detected. As for your husband, absolutely. He is more than welcome to accompany you to all appointments, Ms. Swaby. It’s always helpful to have support during these times. Here is a referral for both a neurologist and a physical therapist, along with information on how to schedule an MRI. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as new weakness, difficulty speaking, or severe headaches – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
