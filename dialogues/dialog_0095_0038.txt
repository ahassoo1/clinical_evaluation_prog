DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Buoniconti. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It… it has to do with making sure things are in order, should… should something happen. I believe it was my solicitor who suggested I speak with a doctor about an… an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? Honestly, I don’t recall the precise name, and the details are… hazy. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, an Advance Directive and POLST form – good thinking to be proactive. Those are important documents. Essentially, they outline your wishes for medical care if you’re unable to speak for yourself. We can certainly go over both and see which is most appropriate for you. First, let’s just get a general sense of your overall health. Do you have any current medical problems – anything you’re being treated for, or have been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Medical problems… That's a difficult question. I… I used to have quite a bit of trouble with my back, from years of leaning over my work, but that was… some time ago. I haven't seen a doctor regularly in… well, I honestly can't remember the last time. No major diagnoses that I’m aware of, if that makes sense. It's difficult to recall details. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly common to not remember exact dates. Back pain from work… alright. And how about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. I… believe I had my tonsils removed as a child. A very long time ago. And perhaps… perhaps a small procedure on my hand, a few years back, related to an etching tool injury. It was quite minor, and I don’t recall the specifics. It wasn't… serious, I don't think. It certainly didn't require a lengthy hospital stay.
DOCTOR: Tonsils as a child, and a minor hand procedure. Good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. My parents are both… passed on, and I wasn’t particularly close to extended family. I know my mother had some trouble with her heart later in life, but beyond that… I’m afraid I don’t have much information. I really wasn't involved in those sorts of things. I was always very focused on my work. I apologize for the lack of detail. It feels… frustrating to not be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s common for families to not have a detailed medical history. Knowing about your mother’s heart trouble is helpful, though. And just to cover all bases, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. I don't take any prescription medications, over-the-counter remedies, or supplements. I prefer… well, I just haven’t found a need for them. I drink a lot of tea, if that counts. But nothing… medicinal. I’m rather particular about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t believe so. Nothing I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I recall a slight sensitivity to certain inks when I was learning my trade, but that was decades ago, and it wasn't a true allergy, more of an irritation. I'm quite careful about the materials I use, even now. But no, no known allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no current medical problems, no surgeries besides tonsils and a minor hand procedure, a family history of heart trouble with your mother, no medications, and no known allergies. That’s a good starting point. Now, just to get a general sense of your current health status, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, I suppose that would be sensible. Though I haven't had one in… a very long time. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If it will help to clarify things, then please, proceed. I’m… a little anxious about it, if I’m honest, but I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It'll be a fairly standard exam – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, taking a look in your ears and throat, and a quick neurological check. Nothing to worry about. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Alright. I am… trying to relax. My work often requires a great deal of focus, which can sometimes make it difficult to… unwind. I apologize if my arm is tense.
DOCTOR: 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not concerning, given your comment about focus and work. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let's take a look at your throat. Say “ahhh” for me.
PATIENT: Ahhh. Is everything alright? I sometimes have a dry throat from working with the fumes, but it's usually nothing… serious. I try to ventilate the studio as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Your throat is slightly red, but no signs of infection or significant inflammation. It could be from the fumes, as you mentioned. Ears look clear as well. Now, just a quick neurological check. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll test your reflexes. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I hope I won’t… fail. I sometimes worry about my coordination. The etching work requires a very steady hand.
DOCTOR: Good coordination, no issues with eye movement. And your reflexes are normal. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that sufficient? I pride myself on my strength. The work is… demanding. Although, sometimes my fingers ache afterwards. A minor inconvenience, really.
DOCTOR: Good strength in both hands. Slight discomfort, as you mentioned, but no significant weakness or loss of function. Okay, Ms. Buonicorta, that completes the brief physical exam. Everything appears within normal limits, though your blood pressure is a little elevated, which could be related to stress or anxiety. The discomfort in your fingers is likely from repetitive use. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. It all sounds… reassuring, in a way. Though I am still rather confused about the Advance Directive and the POLST form. Perhaps we should return to that? I feel as though I came here specifically to discuss those documents, and I haven't… quite grasped what they entail. I apologize for my… lack of focus. It’s a habit.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Buonicorta. It's perfectly understandable. Many people find those documents confusing. Let's start with the Advance Directive. Essentially, it’s a legal document that allows you to express your wishes regarding medical treatment if you become unable to make decisions for yourself. It covers a wide range of scenarios. Do you have any thoughts on what kind of treatment you would or wouldn't want in such a situation?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I hadn't truly considered such scenarios. I suppose… I would want to be kept comfortable, above all else. I wouldn't want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery. But defining “no hope”… that’s the challenging part, isn't it? I've always believed in a… dignified end. But I don't know how to translate that into legal terms. Perhaps I should have consulted with my solicitor first. I apologize. I’m clearly not prepared for this.
DOCTOR: You're not alone in feeling that way, Ms. Buonicorta. It’s a lot to process. And it’s perfectly fine to not have all the answers right away. The POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a bit more specific. It’s a medical order that outlines your wishes regarding certain treatments – like CPR, intubation, and artificial nutrition – and it’s typically used for people with serious illnesses. Given your comments about wanting to be kept comfortable and not wanting artificial life support, it sounds like an Advance Directive might be the more appropriate starting point for you. We can go through it section by section, and you can decide what feels right. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: An Advance Directive… yes, that does sound… more manageable. Section by section… yes, please. I trust your guidance, Doctor. I just… I want to be certain that my wishes are respected, should… should the need arise. And I want to make things as easy as possible for my loved ones. Though, truthfully, I don’t have many. But still. I want to be responsible. Let’s begin, then. With the first section.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buonicorta. The first section concerns appointing a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions for you if you're unable to do so yourself. It's important to choose someone who understands your values and wishes. Do you have anyone in mind for this role?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… That’s… difficult. I don’t have any close family. My solicitor, perhaps? He’s familiar with my affairs, and I trust his judgment. But… it feels… impersonal. I don't want to burden him with such a… weighty responsibility. I honestly don’t know. I haven’t given this much thought. Is it possible to… postpone this section? Perhaps I need time to consider my options. I apologize for the inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buonicorta. It’s perfectly acceptable to postpone this section. Choosing a healthcare proxy is a significant decision, and it’s important to take your time and find someone you truly trust. We can move on to other sections of the Advance Directive and revisit this later. The next section concerns your wishes regarding specific medical treatments, such as mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and artificial nutrition. It asks you to indicate whether you would want these treatments withheld or withdrawn in certain circumstances. Would you like me to explain these options in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. I would appreciate a more detailed explanation. Mechanical ventilation… dialysis… artificial nutrition… These terms are… unfamiliar to me. I understand they relate to life-sustaining treatments, but beyond that… I'm afraid I'm rather lost. Perhaps you could explain them in… simpler terms? And describe the circumstances in which they would be considered? I want to be certain I understand the implications before making any decisions. I apologize for my… lack of medical knowledge. It's a failing on my part, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Buonicorta. It's perfectly normal to not be familiar with these terms. It's my job to explain them clearly. Mechanical ventilation is essentially breathing support using a machine. It's used when someone is unable to breathe on their own, often due to a serious illness or injury. Dialysis is a process that cleans the blood when the kidneys are failing. And artificial nutrition involves providing nourishment through a feeding tube when someone is unable to eat or drink. These treatments would typically be considered in situations where there's a severe illness or injury with a limited chance of recovery. The Advance Directive allows you to indicate whether you would want these treatments withheld if there's no reasonable hope of a meaningful recovery, or whether you would want them continued regardless. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Breathing support… cleaning the blood… nourishment through a tube… Yes, I understand the function of the treatments. But… what constitutes a “meaningful recovery”? That’s the challenging part, isn’t it? What if there’s a small chance of improvement, but the quality of life would be significantly diminished? Would I want to be kept alive in such a situation? I… I honestly don’t know. It feels… overwhelming. Perhaps I should consult with my solicitor before proceeding. He’s more familiar with legal definitions. I apologize for the inconvenience. I’m clearly not prepared for this level of detail.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to pause, Ms. Buonicorta. That is a very complex question, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to discuss it further with your solicitor. It’s important to feel comfortable and confident in your decisions. Perhaps we can schedule a follow-up appointment after you've had a chance to speak with him. We can review the Advance Directive together, and I can answer any further questions you may have. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be… immensely helpful. A follow-up appointment would allow me time to consider my options and consult with my solicitor. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I apologize for taking up so much of your time. I'm clearly not making this easy. Perhaps I should have started with a simpler document. But I am grateful for your guidance, nonetheless.
DOCTOR: You’re not taking up any time at all, Ms. Buonicorta. This is a process, and it’s important to take it at your own pace. I’m happy to help in any way I can. Let’s schedule that follow-up appointment for two weeks from today?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks from today would be perfect, Doctor. That gives me ample time to consult with my solicitor. Thank you again for your patience and understanding. I feel… much better knowing I have time to consider my options. I believe I will contact my solicitor immediately. I won’t take up any more of your time. Have a pleasant day, Doctor. And thank you, once again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buonicorta. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions before our next appointment. Have a pleasant day as well.
