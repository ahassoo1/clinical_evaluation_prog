DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know more about where my people come from. My grandkids, they ask a lot. I was thinking maybe a test, a DNA test, to see… well, to see where we really from, you know? I hear they can do that now.
DOCTOR: A DNA test, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. My niece, she told me about it. Said it can tell you what islands your ancestors come from, even. I’m Marshallese, always been, but… sometimes I wonder. Lots of boats used to come through, you know? I just want to know for sure, for the kids. It's important to them. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… understandable you’d want to know more about your heritage, Mr. Scobie. However, I'm a physician, specializing in internal medicine. While ancestry is certainly interesting, it doesn’t fall within my area of expertise. Frankly, the medical implications of simply knowing your ancestral origins are… limited. Are you experiencing any health concerns that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Oh. I didn't… I thought you could do the test here. I'm not sick, no. Just curious. My niece said a doctor could help with it. Is this clinic not… do the DNA tests? I got Medicare, is that okay? Maybe I went to the wrong place.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Scobie, this clinic does not offer genealogical testing. Medicare covers medically necessary procedures – physical examinations, treatment for illness, management of chronic conditions. Discovering your family history, while valuable on a personal level, is not a medical service. I specialize in the internal workings of the body, not its past. Perhaps you could inquire at a local historical society, or a genealogy center?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. So… you don't know anything about the tests? Not even where to go? I don't have a computer, and my niece lives far away. I just thought a doctor would know these things now. Everything is so modern. Maybe you know someone who does? Even just a place to call?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, I’m afraid I don't maintain a directory of ancestry services. My practice is dedicated to patient wellbeing through medical intervention. I would suggest contacting your local library; they often have resources and information regarding such inquiries. Now, is there anything medical I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I guess not. Just… thought I'd ask about the test. Sorry to bother you. I'll… I'll go to the library. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Scobie. Have a good day. .
