DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about time someone got around to seeing me. It’s my… well, it’s in my stool. Blood. Plain and simple. Not a pretty sight, I can tell you that. And frankly, at my age, one doesn’t need another thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rowbottom. Blood in the stool is certainly something that requires investigation, regardless of age. To help me understand the situation better, could you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It’s red, naturally. Like… blood. Is this what you doctors do? Ask silly questions about the obvious? It wasn’t bright red, if that’s what you’re getting at. More… dark. Like prune juice, almost. And there was… a good amount. Enough to make a body nervous, I’ll tell you that. Though I doubt you get nervous about anything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I assure you, I take your concerns very seriously. The color and consistency of the blood can provide valuable clues as to the source of the bleeding. Bright red blood typically indicates bleeding closer to the rectum, while darker blood suggests a potential issue further up in the digestive tract. You mentioned it resembled prune juice, and a “good amount.” Has this happened before, or is this a new occurrence?
PATIENT: New. Completely new. Never seen anything like it before. And I’ve… well, I’ve had a long life, let’s just say that. I eat pretty regular, mostly. Though I did have some… I don’t know what you call ‘em… those dried plums. For… regularity. Could be that. Though I’ve eaten those before and never had a problem. Honestly, I blame the hospital food my ex-wife made me eat when I had that hip replaced. Probably something in that muck. Though she always said I was just a fussy eater. Women.
DOCTOR: I see. The dried plums are… noteworthy, as is the recent hospital stay. While dietary changes or a temporary irritation could be the cause, given the amount of blood you describe, it's important to rule out other possibilities. Do you experience any abdominal pain, cramping, or changes in your bowel habits besides the blood?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. A bit of discomfort, maybe. Like a… a dull ache. Low down. And my bowels… well, they’ve been a bit… unpredictable lately. Not regular, if that’s what you mean. More often than usual, if you catch my drift. And not… solid. More… loose. A bit embarrassing to talk about, frankly. But I suppose that's what you're paid for, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Rowbottom, that is precisely what I am paid for. The discomfort, the change in bowel habits, and the looseness of the stool are all relevant pieces of information. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen, and a rectal exam to assess for any abnormalities. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Good heavens. At my age? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn’t you just… give me something for it? Some kind of… pill? I’ve never been one for poking and prodding. Especially… down there. Honestly, the things they make you do these days. Is it going to be… painful? I have a rather sensitive constitution, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your reluctance, and I assure you I wouldn’t suggest anything without a clinical reason. A rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating blood in the stool, and it’s the most reliable way to identify potential sources of bleeding, such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or, more importantly, to detect any masses or abnormalities that might require further investigation. While it may be uncomfortable, it is typically not painful, and I will ensure it is performed as gently and quickly as possible. However, given your concerns, we could start with some stool tests to look for hidden blood and any signs of infection. But if those are negative, we will still need to proceed with a physical examination, including a rectal exam, to rule out more serious causes. Would you prefer to start with the stool tests?
PATIENT: Stool tests, then. Yes, let’s start with those. Far less… invasive. Though I still think it’s likely those dried plums. My ex-wife always said I had a sensitive stomach. Always complaining. Just get it over with, then. The sooner I know, the sooner I can get back to my… life. What do I have to do? Do I have to collect it myself? Because frankly, that sounds… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Rowbottom, we’ll start with the stool tests. You will need to collect a small sample at home, using the kit I will provide to you. The instructions are quite straightforward, and the nurse will review them with you before you leave. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully to ensure accurate results. The kit contains a special collection container and a form to complete with your insurance information. Please bring the completed form and the sample to the lab within 72 hours. Do you have any questions about the collection process itself?
PATIENT: Insurance? Don't bother with that. I haven’t had insurance in… well, a long time. Never saw the point. Just give me the kit. And tell the nurse to be quick about it. I haven't got all day, you know. This whole thing is rather… disruptive. And make sure those instructions are very clear. I don't want to have to come back here for another lecture on how to… collect a sample. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. No insurance information is required. The nurse will be with you shortly to review the instructions in detail. She’s very thorough, and will ensure you understand the process completely. I’ll have her come in right away. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that's enough for now. Just get those tests done, and hopefully it’s just those blasted dried plums. Though I still blame my ex-wife. Always something with her. Tell the nurse to hurry, please. I have a very important afternoon planned. And don't bother calling me with any good news about… hemorrhoids or whatever. Just let me know if it's something serious. Now, if you'll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll inform the nurse immediately. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. .
