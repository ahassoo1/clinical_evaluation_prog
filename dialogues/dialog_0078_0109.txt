DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head... the back of my head, it hurts. Been hurting for maybe... three days now, I think. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A dull ache at the back of your head that comes and goes for about three days now. Okay. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm... more? Okay. It feels worse when I... when I bend over. Like when I was fixing the garden hose yesterday. And sometimes, when I'm walking, it gets a little... dizzy feeling with the ache. Not falling down dizzy, just… wobbly. Not every time, though. Mostly when I bend. I used to work with the trains, you know. Lots of bending and lifting. Maybe it’s that?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse with bending, and you've noticed some dizziness accompanying the pain when you bend over. You mentioned you used to work with the trains, involving bending and lifting. That’s helpful information. To get a clearer picture, could you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Zero to ten... hmm. When it's really bad, like when I bent really low in the garden, maybe a... six? But most of the time, it's more like a three or a four. Just annoying, you know? Not stop-you-in-your-tracks bad, usually. Does that make sense? I’m not good with numbers, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Brum. A six when bending low, and usually a three or four. Thank you for clarifying. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache and dizziness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think... I have been a little tired, maybe. But I’m ninety years old, Doctor! I think being tired comes with the age, yes? No… no blurry vision, no nausea, no… what do you call it? Ringing in the ears? No, nothing like that. Just the headache and the wobble when I bend. And the tiredness. But I always been a little sleepy. My wife… she used to say I could sleep standing up. But she… she passed away last year. So maybe that's why I'm more tired.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’ve noticed some fatigue, but attribute that mostly to your age and the loss of your wife last year. No blurry vision, nausea, or ringing in the ears. Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s important to understand everything that's going on. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions... hmm. Not really, Doctor. I used to have high blood pressure, a long time ago. But the doctor… a different doctor, years back… said it went down on its own. He didn't give me any pills or nothing. I haven't been to a doctor in… oh, a long time. Maybe ten years? Fifteen? I don’t really get sick, you know? Just old. And tired. I'm not insured, either. Things are… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had high blood pressure in the past that resolved on its own, and you haven't seen a doctor in 10-15 years. You also mentioned you do not have insurance. Thank you for letting me know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries... hmm. Let me think… When I was a boy, I had my tonsils out. That was a long time ago. And when I was working on the railroad, I broke my arm once. Fell off a… a flatcar. They set it in a cast. That was… maybe sixty years ago? No other surgeries. No hospital, except for that arm. Just the tonsils and the arm. Small things, really. Nothing like now, with this headache. This feels… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tonsillectomy as a child and a broken arm repaired while working on the railroad. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t take pills. I used to take something for… for my knees, maybe five years ago? But it didn't help much, so I stopped. Just stopped. My wife… she had a lot of pills. But I don't like taking them. I try to eat good, you know? That’s what my mother always said. Eat good and get some rest. But this headache… it doesn't seem to care about eating good. Just comes and goes. Like a stubborn little thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. You used to take something for your knees but discontinued it because it wasn't effective. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies... hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I eat everything. My wife used to say I ate like a horse! Never had any trouble with food. And I work in the garden, you know? Lots of flowers and plants. Never felt any… itchy or anything. I don't think I have any allergies. My mother always said I was a strong boy. Strong and stubborn, she said. Like this headache! It’s being very stubborn.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had similar headaches, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological... that’s a big word, Doctor. Headaches… hmm. My mother had headaches sometimes. But she didn't go to the doctor much. She just laid down in a dark room. My wife’s mother… she had trouble walking when she got old. But I don’t know what was wrong with her. We didn't talk about those things much. Things were different back then. You didn't ask the doctor everything like you do now. Just... tried to deal with it. But this headache… it worries me a little. It’s different than my mother's. More… persistent. Stubborn, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had headaches, and your wife’s mother had trouble walking when she got older. Now, let’s talk a little about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I live alone. My wife… she passed away last year. We lived in the same house for fifty years. It’s… quiet now. Too quiet, maybe. I have a neighbor, Mrs. Rodriguez, she checks on me sometimes. She brings me cookies. Very kind woman. But mostly, it's just me. I keep busy in the garden. That keeps my mind off things. But it’s hard, you know? Losing her. Everything feels different. This headache… it makes it harder. Just adds to the quiet.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Brum. Losing your wife must be very difficult, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling the quiet now. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be causing your headache. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. I trust you. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, okay? I’m an old man, you know. And my bones… they aren’t as strong as they used to be. I want to get this headache figured out. It’s been bothering me, and I want to be able to get back to the garden. Mrs. Rodriguez is counting on me for tomatoes!
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brum. I will be very gentle. I'm just checking for any tenderness or muscle tightness. Okay, I’m noticing some tenderness at the base of your skull, and a little bit of muscle tightness in your neck. Your range of motion is a little limited, but it doesn’t seem to cause you significant pain. Your neurological exam – checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation – is normal. I also listened to your heart and lungs, and those sound clear. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not overly concerning given your age and recent stress. Your pulse is 72 and regular.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds… complicated. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I don’t want to end up in the hospital. My wife… she didn't like hospitals. Is it the railroad? All that bending and lifting I did for so many years? Or is it just… old age? I’m worried, Doctor. Honestly, I’m very worried. And Mrs. Rodriguez is counting on those tomatoes!
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Brum, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious. Let me explain what these findings might mean. The tenderness at the base of your skull and the muscle tightness in your neck suggest you may have what we call a tension headache, or possibly some muscle strain. The limited range of motion could be related to that as well. It could be related to the years of bending and lifting you did on the railroad, or simply from general wear and tear over time. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that’s common at your age and could be due to stress or anxiety. Based on what you've told me and the exam, I don't believe this is anything immediately life-threatening. It doesn't sound like a neurological emergency that would require a hospital stay. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. Because of your age and the fact you haven’t seen a doctor in a while, I’d like to order a simple blood test to check your overall health and rule out any underlying inflammation. I also recommend an X-ray of your neck to get a better look at your vertebrae and see if there's any arthritis or other structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood test and X-ray… Okay. That sounds… a lot. But if it will figure out what’s wrong, then yes. Okay. But how much will it cost? I don’t have much money, Doctor. And I don't have insurance. I’m worried about the bill. I don’t want to be a burden. And Mrs. Rodriguez is counting on those tomatoes! Maybe I should just try some more rest? A warm bath? My wife always said a warm bath could fix anything. But this headache… it’s stubborn.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Brum, and it's completely valid to be worried about that. I'll do my best to minimize the costs as much as possible. We can discuss potential options for financial assistance or payment plans if needed. I can also ask the lab and radiology department for their most affordable rates. I completely understand the appeal of trying a warm bath and rest. That's a good starting point, and might provide some temporary relief. However, given your age and the persistent nature of the headache, it’s important to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We want to rule out anything more serious. Let’s start with the blood test and X-ray. We can schedule them for tomorrow morning. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and create a plan to get you feeling better. In the meantime, I can recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help manage the pain, and a warm compress to your neck and shoulders. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood test and X-ray tomorrow. And the pain pills… ibuprofen, you said? And the warm compress. That sounds… manageable. But what if the results are bad? What if it’s something serious? I don’t want to worry Mrs. Rodriguez. She’s counting on those tomatoes! And I… I don't want to be a burden. Just… try to figure it out, okay Doctor? That’s all. Figure it out. And maybe some more rest. My wife always knew what to do. But she's gone now. Just figure it out. And maybe, if it's not too much trouble, just tell me it's not serious. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Brum. It’s completely natural to feel anxious when facing the unknown. I promise you, we will take things one step at a time. We’ll get the results of the tests, and then we’ll discuss them thoroughly, and I will explain everything in plain language. I want you to know that I will be honest with you, but I will also do my best to provide you with hope and support. It's far more likely that this is a manageable issue, such as muscle tension or age-related changes, and we can often find ways to relieve the pain and improve your quality of life. I will schedule the blood test and X-ray for tomorrow morning, and we’ll plan a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, please try to get some rest, use the warm compress, and take the ibuprofen as directed. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. I'm here to help you, Mr. Brum, and we'll figure this out together. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that's all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being patient. And for trying to figure it out. And for not laughing at an old man worrying about tomatoes. Just… thank you. I guess I’ll see you tomorrow. And please… try not to worry Mrs. Rodriguez. She's counting on me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It’s my pleasure. And absolutely no worries about the tomatoes! They sound very important. I'll see you tomorrow morning, and we’ll take it from there. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes. And please, get some rest.
