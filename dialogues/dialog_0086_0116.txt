DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Bilstein, please have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor… M-Mur-tic, is it? Yes, thank you kindly. It’s my legs, you see. They bother me something awful at night. Cramping, mostly. Feels like a knot, tight as can be. It wakes me up, it does. I don't rightly remember when it started, just… always seems to be happening now.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Cramping, you say. And it’s mostly at night?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Sometimes it'll happen during the day if I'm standing for a long while, but it's always worse when I’m trying to sleep. It makes it hard to rest, you know? I used to be able to sleep like a log, but not anymore. It’s… unpleasant. Does that make sense, dear? I sometimes worry I don’t explain things very well.
DOCTOR: It's…adequate. Standing makes it worse, night is the primary issue. And how long would you say these cramps last when they happen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. Seems like… minutes, maybe? It’s hard to tell when you’re trying to get comfortable, you see. Sometimes it eases up quickly if I stretch, but other times… well, other times it takes a good long while. I just try to wiggle my toes and hope for the best. It’s been going on for… oh, I couldn’t say exactly. A while now, certainly. A good long while. Is that helpful? I really don’t keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Minutes, variable duration. Alright. And are these cramps in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Usually both, dear. Not always at the same time, you understand. Sometimes it’s just my right leg, and sometimes just my left. But more often than not, it's both at once. It feels… balanced, somehow, if that makes any sense. Awful, either way, mind you. But both at once is… worse. I try to rub them, but it doesn't always help.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Both legs, intermittently. Any other symptoms accompanying the cramping?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Oh, now let me think. I don’t think so… My feet get a little cold sometimes, but that’s just because I'm an old woman, I expect. And they swell a bit if I’m on them too long. But I don’t know if that has anything to do with the cramps. It’s just… what old people’s feet do, you know? I don't believe I've noticed anything else. Not that I can recall, at least. It’s been so long… Everything just sort of blurs together after a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, Mrs. Bilstein?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a good question. I… I don’t take much of anything, honestly. Just a little something for my arthritis, now and then, when it flares up. A small white pill. I can’t rightly remember the name of it. My daughter used to keep track of all that for me, but… she’s busy now, with her own family. I mostly just take it when I need to, you see? It’s not a regular thing. I try to get by without pills as much as I can. Is that alright? I hope it's not a problem.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. "A small white pill." Do you know the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I really don't. I just… take one when my hands get particularly sore. It’s a small bottle, that much I know. A little plastic thing. My daughter filled it for me, and I’ve been refilling it ever since. I'm afraid I’m not very good at remembering details like that. It's all a bit of a blur, you see? I just take it until the pain eases up, and then I stop. I don’t want to bother with too much medicine if I don’t have to. Does that help at all? Perhaps my daughter’s number is on file somewhere? She's very good at these things.
DOCTOR: It appears you were prescribed naproxen 500mg a year ago. Is that the "small white pill" you're referring to?
PATIENT: Naproxen… Now that name sounds familiar! Yes, dear, I think that’s it! Naproxen. Yes, that’s the one. I take it for my joints, you see, when they bother me. Just when they get particularly stiff. So, that’s what it was. You have a wonderful memory, Doctor! I'm afraid mine isn’t what it used to be. I'm glad you found that out. Is that… alright? Am I taking too much of it? I wouldn't want to… cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: And how often would you say you are taking the naproxen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not very often, dear. Just when my hands get particularly bad. Maybe… two or three times a week? Sometimes less. It depends on the weather, you see. Damp weather always makes my arthritis flare up. I try not to take it every day, because I don’t want to get used to it. Just when I really need to, you see? It's hard to say exactly, really. It varies. I just take one pill at a time, and then I wait to see if it helps. I really don't want to be dependent on it, you understand. I try to be independent as much as possible. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t believe so, dear. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. My daughter always said I was lucky that way. I used to eat all sorts of things as a child, and I never got sick. But I suppose it’s possible I’ve forgotten something. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. I don’t have any rashes or swelling or anything like that, not currently. But I really don't remember any serious allergies. Perhaps I should ask my daughter? She's very good at remembering things like that. Is that alright? I hope I’m not being a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your legs. Please lower your trousers slightly so I can examine them. I'll need to check your pulses and look for any swelling or discoloration.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, of course. I hope you don’t mind. I’m not very flexible, you see, so it might take me a moment. It’s just… a bit chilly today, you understand. I’ve got these old legs, and they don’t work as well as they used to. Just let me know if you need me to adjust anything. I'm a little embarrassed, but I want to help you figure out what’s wrong with them. I haven't shown my legs to anyone in a long time. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Your pulses are present, though a bit weak. I do note some swelling in your ankles, and your skin is rather dry. Everything else appears unremarkable. Now, have you noticed any changes in your feet or toes recently?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Weak pulses, you say? I suppose that’s not a good thing. And swelling, too? I hadn’t really noticed the swelling, to be honest. I just thought my shoes were a bit tight. No, I haven’t noticed any changes in my feet or toes recently. They feel… the same, I suppose. A bit cold sometimes, but that’s just because I’m an old woman, you understand. No numbness or tingling or anything like that. Just… old legs. I sometimes get a bit of a burning sensation at night, but I thought that was just the cramps. Is that something I should be worried about? I really don't want to lose my legs, you see. They’ve carried me a long way.
DOCTOR: The burning sensation is worth noting. It could be related to the cramping, or it could be something else. Now, I'm going to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel. Do you have any objections to a blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Blood work? Well… I don’t particularly like needles, you see. But if it’s going to help… I suppose I can’t object. I’ve had blood work done before, but I always get a bit nervous. It just… feels like a lot of poking and prodding. Is it going to be very painful? And will it take long? I have a bit of a schedule, you understand. Just a small one. Mostly just watching my stories on the television. Is it absolutely necessary, dear? Perhaps we could try something else first? I really don’t like needles. They remind me of… well, never mind. Just please be gentle, if you have to. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: It's necessary to rule out potential causes for your symptoms, Mrs. Bilstein. It will be a standard blood draw, and the phlebotomist is very experienced. It shouldn't be overly painful, just a brief pinch. It will take about fifteen minutes. I'll need you to fast for eight hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks other than water. I'll have the nurse explain the process in detail and schedule the appointment for you. In the meantime, I'm prescribing a topical cream for your dry skin and recommending compression stockings to help reduce the swelling in your ankles. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Eight hours… No food? Oh, dear. That will be difficult. I usually have a small biscuit with my tea in the morning. But… if it’s necessary, I suppose I can manage. Compression stockings, you say? What do those look like? Will they be uncomfortable? I don’t like feeling constricted. Topical cream… that sounds alright. As long as it doesn’t smell too strong. I’m very sensitive to smells, you see. Yes… cream and stockings. And no biscuits for eight hours. It’s a lot to take in. But if you think it’s best… then I’ll trust your judgment, dear. Just please make sure the nurse is gentle. And that the stockings aren’t too tight. Is that alright? I really don’t want to be uncomfortable.
