DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it’s a bit hard to explain. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. It runs in the family, you see. My brother, he used to get terrible ones, and… oh dear, what was I saying? It’s just… everything feels a little foggy these days.
DOCTOR: Weakness and headaches… right. And you say this has been going on for a while, and it’s similar to what your brother experienced?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, similar. Though his were… much worse, I think. Mine isn’t constant, you understand. It comes and goes. Sometimes my arm feels… heavy, like I can’t lift it properly. And the headaches… they’re not always painful, just… a pressure. Behind my eyes, mostly. It’s hard to describe. It’s been happening for… oh, goodness, a few months now, I suppose. Maybe longer? My memory… it’s not what it used to be. I do apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. A few months of intermittent weakness in your arm and these pressure-type headaches. And you’ve noticed some memory difficulties as well. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. When you say weakness, is it just your arm, or do you experience it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Mostly my right arm, yes. Though… sometimes my leg feels a little clumsy. Not often, mind you. And it’s never both at the same time. It’s… fleeting. Like when I’m walking, I might stumble a little, but then I’m fine. It’s just… unsettling, you know? I don’t want to be a bother, Doctor. It’s probably nothing, really. Old age catching up with me, I expect.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes, I understand. Okay, so intermittent weakness, primarily in the right arm, occasionally affecting the leg, and these pressure headaches. Now, Ms. Tofani, to get a better sense of things, let's go through some basics. Have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Oh! Sometimes my vision gets a little… blurry. Not all the time, just… briefly. Like looking through a fogged-up window. And… I’ve been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. But everyone gets tired, don't they? I sleep alright, though. Usually. My husband says I snore a bit, but he always says that! Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, increased fatigue… alright. Snoring isn’t necessarily relevant at the moment, but thank you for mentioning it. Now, have you noticed any changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Changes in my speech? Oh, goodness. I don't think so. My daughter would have told me, wouldn't she? She's very observant. Sometimes I have trouble finding the right word, but that's just… age, I suppose. Like when I’m telling a story, I might pause to think… but nothing drastic. I hope not! It’s hard enough remembering what I had for breakfast, let alone…
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And just to cover all bases, have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your face, arms, or legs?
PATIENT: Numbness… tingling… hmm. Let me see… No, not really. Sometimes my fingers feel a little cold, but that's just the circulation, I think. Especially in the winter. And I do have a bit of arthritis in my hands, you know. It gets worse when it rains. But nothing like… pins and needles or anything like that. No, I haven't had anything like that. Is that… bad, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Alright. No numbness or tingling. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a little pill for it every day. And… oh yes, my gallbladder, I had it taken out when I was younger. And the arthritis, of course. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major. I’ve been a pretty healthy woman, all things considered. Though lately… I haven't been feeling quite myself, as you know.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, gallbladder removal, arthritis… and you take medication for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A small white pill, every morning. My daughter fills the little container for me, so I don't have to worry about it. She's a good girl. I think it's… Lisinopril? Or something like that. It’s hard to remember the names of things these days. It’s been years since the doctor first prescribed it. Everything just… blurs together, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's just confirm that on your record. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… hmm. Let me think… Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. Penicillin, maybe? My mother always said I was sensitive to penicillin, but that was a long time ago. I haven't taken it in years. But I don’t think I’m allergic, exactly. Just… a bit of a stomach upset, maybe? It’s hard to remember now. It was so long ago.
DOCTOR: Right. Possible sensitivity to penicillin. And finally, have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And… I had a hysterectomy when I was younger. That was… necessary, the doctor said. And… I think that’s it. Just the tonsils and the hysterectomy. Nothing else that I can recall. It’s hard to keep track of things, you know? Especially when you get older.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that gives us a good starting point. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just routine things – check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes. It won't take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A physical exam sounds… sensible. As long as it doesn't take too long, I have a little bridge game this afternoon. But don't you worry about that. Take your time. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll get started. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 88. A bit elevated, but not unexpected. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly faint. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sound on the bases. Reflexes are a bit sluggish. Strength is 5 out of 5 in all extremities, though a little diminished on the right side. Now, let’s just take a look in your ears… Ears are clear. Alright. Everything seems… within normal limits, for your age. However, given your symptoms – the headaches, weakness, blurry vision, and fatigue – and the slightly diminished strength and reflexes, I think it’s prudent to order some blood work and a CT scan of your head.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh dear. Is that… serious, Doctor? What are we looking for, exactly? I do hope it’s nothing too alarming. I just want to be able to play my bridge game this afternoon, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s a precautionary measure, Ms. Tofani. We’re looking for any signs of a stroke, a tumor, or other structural abnormalities in the brain. Given your age and symptoms, it’s best to rule those things out. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Now, I understand your concern about your bridge game, but your health is the priority. We need to get to the bottom of this. The CT scan is quick and relatively painless, but it does involve some radiation exposure. We’ll schedule it for tomorrow morning. I’ll have my nurse explain the procedure in detail. And please, try not to worry too much. It’s likely nothing serious, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Radiation exposure… That doesn't sound very pleasant. Well, I suppose you’re right. Better safe than sorry, as they say. My daughter always tells me that. Alright, Doctor. If that's what you think is best. Tomorrow morning, then. Will I need to fast for the CT scan? And… will it interfere with my medication? I just want to be prepared, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least six hours before the scan. And no, it shouldn’t interfere with your blood pressure medication. Continue taking it as usual. My nurse will give you specific instructions about the fasting and the scan itself. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a referral to a neurologist for a consultation. They’ll be able to provide a more thorough evaluation and help us determine the best course of treatment. Look, Ms. Tofani, I understand your concerns, but it’s important to remember that these are just preliminary steps. We’re gathering information. We're not jumping to any conclusions. I’ll have my nurse schedule that for you as well. Now, do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Oh dear. That sounds rather… serious, doesn’t it? What exactly do they do? Will they have to… poke and prod me? I do hope it won’t be too uncomfortable. And… will I be able to drive myself to the appointment? It’s a bit of a drive, you see. My daughter is busy with her children. I just want to be prepared, you know? I do get a bit anxious when I’m not sure what to expect.
DOCTOR: A neurologist is a specialist in the brain and nervous system, Ms. Tofani. They’ll perform a more detailed neurological exam, assess your reflexes, coordination, and cognitive function. They might order additional tests, such as an MRI or EEG, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. And yes, they will likely "poke and prod" you, as you say – it's a standard part of the exam. It shouldn't be painful, but it might be a little uncomfortable. As for driving, I would advise against it. Given your symptoms, and the potential for a reaction to any medications they might prescribe, it’s best to have someone drive you, or take a taxi or ride-share service. Look, Ms. Tofani, I understand your anxiety, but you need to focus on getting the care you need. Worrying about the details isn’t going to help. Alright. I think we’ve covered everything for now. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions and schedule your appointments. Is there anything else I can assist you with before I leave?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, I suppose not. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I do appreciate your patience. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. I do have a bridge tournament next month, you see. I wouldn’t want to miss that. Alright. I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. I'll just wait for the nurse, then. .
