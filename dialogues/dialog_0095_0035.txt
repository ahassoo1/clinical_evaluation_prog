DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sucich. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Mirriam. It’s the hiccups, really. Been going on for… well, a few days now. Quite bothersome, they are! Not dangerous, are they? I just thought I’d get them checked, just in case.
DOCTOR: A few days of hiccups, okay. Not dangerous usually, but persistent hiccups can sometimes indicate something else is going on, so it’s good you came in. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Glad I came. Let’s see… They just start. No warning, really. And they come and go, you know? Not constant, thank goodness. Mostly after I eat, I think. Or when I get a little excited talking. Funny thing, really. It’s not like I’m doing anything particularly strenuous! Mostly just puttering around the garden or chatting with the girls. Do you need to know when they started exactly? I'm good with dates, but sometimes the days all blur together these days…
DOCTOR: No, an approximate is fine. Just trying to get a sense of the pattern. So, they started a few days ago, seem to be related to eating or getting excited… and they're not constant. About how many hiccups would you say you're having in a typical episode?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one! Not a whole lot at once, maybe… five or six? But they’ll come in bursts, you know? Like three or four little sets throughout the day. Not enough to, well, disrupt everything, but enough to be noticed, definitely. It’s just… tiring, more than anything, having to keep stopping and starting when I’m talking. People think I'm being rude, probably!
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent bursts of five or six hiccups, triggered by eating or excitement. And you're feeling fatigued by them. Now, have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Nothing major, no. No fever, no pain, no… dizziness or anything like that. My digestion has been a bit… off, maybe? A little gassy, if I’m honest. And I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but I put that down to just getting older, you know? Not sleeping as well as I used to. But other than that, no, nothing really stands out. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A little digestive upset, some fatigue…Okay. And have you tried anything to get rid of them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! A few things. My daughter, Leilani, she told me to hold my breath, you know? That didn’t do much. And I tried drinking water quickly. That sometimes works for a little bit, but they always come back. Old Man Hemana, he told me to swallow a teaspoon of sugar. That… well, it tasted nice, but didn’t stop them either! I’m running out of ideas! It’s quite a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, holding breath, drinking water, sugar…none of those have been consistently helpful. Alright, Mrs. Sucich. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to rule anything obvious out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever needs doing. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable, alright? Old bones aren’t as forgiving as they used to be!
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll just feel your abdomen. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. And again… Deep breath…and out. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright. Doesn’t hurt at all, Doctor. Just… a little sensitive, maybe, around my belly button. But I think that’s just… well, after all these years, things aren’t quite as firm as they used to be! It’s not pain, just… awareness, you know? Ooh, a little there, perhaps. Just a tiny bit.
DOCTOR: A little tenderness to palpation around the umbilicus, no acute pain. Alright. And just to be complete, I'll check your reflexes. Everything seems normal there as well. Okay, Mrs. Sucich. Everything seems within normal limits on the exam. Given your symptoms and the exam, it’s likely these hiccups are related to some mild irritation of the phrenic nerve—the nerve that controls your diaphragm. This can be caused by a number of things, including digestive issues, or even just excitement, as you've noted.
PATIENT: Oh, the phrenic nerve! Fancy name. So, nothing serious then? Just a bit… irritated? That's good to know. Digestive issues… well, that makes sense. I do enjoy my food, you know? What do you recommend then, Doctor? Anything I can do to calm this… irritation?
DOCTOR: No, nothing serious appears to be going on. Given your history, I suspect it’s a benign irritation. We can start with some simple things. First, let’s try avoiding carbonated beverages and large meals. Smaller, more frequent meals might help. Also, over-the-counter antacids could help settle your stomach. If that doesn't improve things within a week, we could consider a medication to help reduce stomach acid. I'll write you a prescription for antacids to start with. And try to avoid getting too excited! But seriously, managing stress can sometimes help. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds sensible, Doctor. Smaller meals, less fizz… I can do that. And I’ll try to take it easy. Although, with my grandchildren running around, that might be a challenge! No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. Just… what if they don’t go away after a week? What then? And is there anything… anything serious I should be looking out for?
DOCTOR: Good questions. If the hiccups persist for more than a week despite these measures, we'll need to investigate further. Rarely, persistent hiccups can be a sign of something more serious, such as issues with the diaphragm itself, or even problems with the central nervous system. However, given your overall health and the nature of your symptoms, that's unlikely. But if you experience any of the following, please come back immediately: shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, vomiting, or if you start coughing up blood. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Shortness of breath…chest pain…coughing up blood… That sounds dreadful! Alright, yes. I’ll be very careful and come straight back if I have any of those. Thank you for telling me, Doctor. That puts my mind at ease a little, knowing what to look out for. So, just small meals, less fizz, and antacids for now? And come back if things get serious?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Small meals, less fizz, antacids. And don’t hesitate to come back if anything changes or if you develop any of those symptoms we discussed. Here’s the prescription for the antacids. I’ll also send a summary of our visit to your primary care physician. Do you have any other concerns today, Mrs. Sucich?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and kind. Thank you so much for listening to me and taking the time to explain everything. I feel much better knowing what’s going on and what to do. I appreciate it. I think I’ll go home now and have a nice, small cup of tea!
