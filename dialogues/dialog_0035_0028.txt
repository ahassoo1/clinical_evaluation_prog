DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, this cough… it just won’t go away. It’s been bothering me for a few weeks now, and it feels… different than usual. I have a bad heart, you know. My heart isn’t strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough that’s lasted a few weeks and feels different. And you mentioned your heart isn’t strong – do you have a cardiologist you see regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Doctor Ramirez. He’s a good man. I see him every six months, usually. He’s the one who told me my heart wasn’t what it used to be, years ago now. He’s the one who keeps me going with the pills, really.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s helpful to know. And are you currently taking any medications prescribed by Dr. Ramirez, or any other medications at all?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… yes, quite a few. There’s… Lasix, that’s a water pill. And Lisinopril, for my blood pressure. Then there’s Digoxin… that’s the one for my heart, I think. And a little blue pill for cholesterol, but I forget the name. Oh, and sometimes I take something for my arthritis, if it's acting up. I have a bag at home with everything written down, if you need to know exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a good start. Lasix, Lisinopril, Digoxin, and something for cholesterol and arthritis. It’s helpful you have a list at home; we can definitely go over that more precisely later. For now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Well, I get a little breathless, especially when I walk. Not all the time, but if I try to do too much. And my ankles… they swell up sometimes, at the end of the day. It’s been worse lately, I think. And I just feel… tired. More tired than usual, even for an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath with exertion, ankle swelling, and increased fatigue. And how about fever, chills, or night sweats with this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Definitely no chills, I hate being cold. And I haven’t had night sweats, thank goodness. I sleep alright, usually. It’s just… waking up coughing keeps me from a good sleep. That’s the main problem, really. It's a dry cough mostly, doesn't bring much up.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dry cough, no fever, chills, or night sweats. Let's do a quick exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, check your ankles, and take your blood pressure. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. My ankles are probably swollen already, though. I can feel it. But go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 150/90. Your lungs sound a bit congested, with some mild wheezing on both sides. And yes, your ankles do have some swelling – pitting edema, as I suspected. Your heart sounds a bit irregular, but that’s not entirely unexpected given your history. I also notice a slightly rapid rate. Do you feel your heart racing or fluttering at all?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not all the time, but when I get really tired, or if I walk up a hill, I feel it… a little fluttering. It doesn’t last long, usually. And yes, it feels faster than it should. Like a hummingbird’s wings, almost. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re able to describe that. That “fluttering” sensation is called palpitations, and it’s definitely something we need to investigate further. Given your history of heart issues, the cough, shortness of breath, and ankle swelling, I'm concerned about possible fluid overload and potential worsening of your heart condition. I want to order a few tests. First, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. Also, an EKG to check the electrical activity of your heart, and some blood work, including a BNP to assess for heart failure and kidney function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s best, Doctor, then I trust you. An X-ray, an EKG, and blood work. Will it take long? And will I have to stay here? I have a little bird to get home to, you know.
DOCTOR: No, you won’t have to stay overnight. The X-ray and EKG can be done right here in the clinic, and it shouldn't take more than an hour or so. The blood work will also be done here, and the results usually take a couple of days. In the meantime, I want you to limit your salt intake as much as possible. That will help reduce fluid retention. And if you feel your breathing getting significantly worse, or if your chest pain develops, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the X-ray and EKG. We’ll review the results as soon as they're available and discuss a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Limit the salt, watch for trouble breathing, and come back when the tests are done. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. We'll get this figured out. I’ll have the nurse come in and get started with the blood work. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you again. It’s good to know someone is listening. It gets lonely, you know.
