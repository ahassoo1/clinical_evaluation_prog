DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been a bit bothersome, to be frank. I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and hungry, even after I’ve eaten. It’s a bit odd, really. I’d appreciate getting to the bottom of it quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Hmm, thirsty and hungry even after eating… that is worth looking into. Okay. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about this thirst?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… constant, almost. Not like after a salty meal, but just… there. I find myself drinking quite a bit more water than usual, and even then, my mouth feels dry. It's been going on for… oh, a couple of weeks, I’d say. Perhaps a little longer, truthfully, but I didn't think much of it at first.
DOCTOR: Right, constant thirst for a couple of weeks. Okay. And you said hungry even after eating?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. I’ll have a proper meal, feel quite full, and then… not long after, maybe an hour or two, I’m feeling that hunger again. It’s not a painful hunger, just… a persistent feeling of needing to eat something. I’ve found myself snacking more, which… isn't ideal.
DOCTOR: I see. And has there been any change in your weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. I suppose I haven't noticed any significant change, but I wouldn’t swear to it. I'm about the same, I think. Around 93 kilograms, if that helps. I was… heavier previously, and lost some weight, but that was some time ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay, around 93 kilograms, and no major weight changes recently. Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in how often you're urinating?
PATIENT: Actually… yes. Now that you mention it, I have been going to the bathroom rather more frequently. Especially at night, which is a bit disruptive, to be frank. I hadn't really connected it to the thirst, but… yes, more often than usual. A few times a night, which isn’t… normal for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urination, especially at night. That is helpful. Do you find yourself feeling tired or fatigued more than usual?
PATIENT: Now that you ask… yes, a bit. It’s not crippling exhaustion, but I’ve been feeling… sluggish, I suppose. More tired at the end of the day than I used to be. I just put it down to the… everything, really. Work’s been a bit demanding, and the lack of sleep from all the bathroom trips, I suppose. But yes, more tired than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst, increased urination, increased hunger, and fatigue. Let me just take a quick look at your medical history here… Hmm. Okay, I see you’ve had no major medical problems reported previously. No known allergies?
PATIENT: That’s correct, Doctor. No allergies that I’m aware of. Nothing significant, anyway. Just the usual childhood ailments, nothing that requires any… attention now. I'm generally quite healthy, or I was, before all this started.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to avoid medication if possible, to be honest. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, and that’s about it. I don't take anything regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Okay, Christen, based on what you’re telling me – the increased thirst, frequent urination, increased hunger, and fatigue – it could be a number of things. However, these are classic symptoms of diabetes. But we definitely need to run some tests to confirm. Would you be okay with a quick blood sugar check and a urine sample?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Right. Well, that’s… not what I expected. Yes, a blood sugar check and a urine sample sounds… sensible. I’d appreciate knowing what’s going on, so yes, let's get on with it. The quicker, the better, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll start with a simple finger prick for the blood sugar. It'll just be a small drop. And then, if you could just collect a urine sample for us, that would be great. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. I'll explain the process again once you're back, and we'll get the results as quickly as possible. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. A quick finger prick and a urine sample. I can manage that. I’ll be back shortly. Don’t hesitate to call if I’m… unduly delayed.
DOCTOR: Okay, take your time. I'll be right here.
