DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, it’s my side, you see. It's been giving me trouble for a little while now. A sort of pain, mostly. And... well, the waterworks haven't been right either. Seems I get infections quite a bit, down there. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but it’s been happening often enough that I thought I should come and see someone.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Espinueva. It's not always easy to discuss these things, and you’ve done the right thing by coming in. We’ll get to the bottom of it. “Trouble with your side” – could you tell me more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, well… it’s not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just a nagging feeling, other times it’s… well, it feels like a weight, you know? Like something’s pressing on me. It's on my left side, mostly. And it sometimes goes through to my back. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, but it's definitely there, reminding me.
DOCTOR: A dull ache on your left side, radiating to your back… and it comes and goes. You mentioned it feels like a weight. Does anything specific make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don't think anything makes it worse, exactly. But lying down sometimes helps. Not always, mind you, but when it’s really bothering me, a bit of a rest on my left side… or even my right, really… it seems to take the edge off. Drinking a lot of water definitely seems to help too. And… well, when I eat too much, it feels a bit more uncomfortable. Though that might just be old age catching up with me, Doctor!
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know lying down and hydration provide some relief, and that it’s exacerbated by eating. It doesn’t sound like something that is immediately alarming. Now, you also mentioned frequent infections with your “waterworks.” Could you describe those for me?
PATIENT: Yes, well… it’s a burning feeling, when I go to the toilet. And… a bit of a discomfort, really. I have to go quite often, even when I don’t really need to. And sometimes, well, there’s a bit of blood. Not a lot, thankfully. It comes and goes, like the pain, but it’s been happening more and more lately. I try to drink a lot of water to flush it all out, but it doesn’t always seem to do the trick. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Burning sensation, increased frequency, and occasional blood… I understand your concern, Mr. Espinueva. These symptoms are important to investigate. Do you have a fever, chills, nausea, or any pain in your lower back, aside from the ache you described?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Not at all. No nausea either. And the pain in my lower back… it’s not a sharp pain, like I said. It’s more of a… a dull ache, that comes and goes with the side pain. It doesn't stop me from getting about, but it's there, a constant reminder. I do feel a bit tired sometimes, but I put that down to my age, to be honest with you!
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Espinueva. It’s good to know there are no fever, chills, or nausea. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, a few years back, the doctor told me I have something with the kidneys. Polycystic, he called it. Said it runs in the family, apparently. My mother had it, and her sister too. It doesn’t really bother me most of the time, but I suppose it could be connected to this pain. I've seen a specialist before, but it was a long time ago. He said to just keep an eye on things. High blood pressure, yes, I have that too. I take tablets for it, every day. And… I don’t think anything else, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease, and hypertension… Thank you. I see your primary care physician has documented both. And you take medication for your blood pressure – could you please tell me the name of the medication and the dosage?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it here in my wallet. It’s called… Amlodipine. 5 milligrams, once a day. Every morning, with my breakfast. I’ve been taking it for… oh, I’d say about five years now. The doctor keeps checking my blood pressure, and it seems to be keeping it under control.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Amlodipine 5mg daily. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had the need for them, thankfully. Just the usual childhood illnesses, like measles and chickenpox. But nothing major. I’ve been a pretty healthy man, all things considered. It’s just this kidney trouble, and the blood pressure, that’s been bothering me lately. And now this pain, of course.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, just childhood illnesses. Now, let’s discuss your family history a bit further. You mentioned your mother and aunt had polycystic kidney disease. Were there any other medical conditions that ran in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father… he had diabetes, I believe. And he had some trouble with his heart in his later years. My sister… she had high blood pressure, like me. And… well, my brother… he didn't live a long life, sadly. He had some sort of… trouble with his lungs, I think. But I don't know much about it, to be honest. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Diabetes in your father, hypertension in your sister, and lung trouble in your brother. Thank you for sharing that. Now, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle? Well, I'm retired now, so I don't do much heavy lifting. I used to work as a receptionist, mostly just answering phones and greeting people. I enjoy gardening, when the weather is nice. And I like to read, mostly history books. I don’t smoke, never have. And I only drink a little bit of alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables. Nothing too exciting, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No smoking, limited alcohol, and a healthy diet are all positives. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with medications, food, or anything like that. I can eat just about anything, thankfully. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor. Not much bothers me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. That was very helpful. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. I will listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen to check for tenderness, and take your blood pressure again. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back on the examination table. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs noted. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. A little bit sensitive, maybe, on my left side, but nothing too bad. It's the same sort of ache I was describing earlier, really. Not sharp, just… a dull pressure.
DOCTOR: I’m noting some mild tenderness in your left flank. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Based on your history and this brief examination, your symptoms could be related to a few different things, including a kidney infection, a kidney stone, or a flare-up of your polycystic kidney disease. The mild tenderness in your left flank is concerning, and the recurrent urinary tract infections warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Tests are a good idea. I’d like to know what’s going on, and put my mind at ease. What sort of tests are you thinking of?
DOCTOR: I’d like to order a urine analysis and a urine culture to check for infection. We’ll also need a complete blood count to assess your overall health, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function. Finally, I think a kidney ultrasound would be beneficial to visualize your kidneys and look for any stones or abnormalities. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and guide our treatment plan. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… thorough, Doctor. I suppose it's best to be sure. What about the ultrasound… is that painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bit of a garden party next week that I’d rather not miss.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound is not painful at all, Mr. Espinueva. A gel will be applied to your abdomen, and a handheld device will be moved across your skin. It may feel a little cool, but it shouldn’t cause any discomfort. As for the results, the blood work and urine tests typically take 24-48 hours. The ultrasound may take a little longer, perhaps 3-5 business days, as it needs to be reviewed by a radiologist. I will call you as soon as the results are available. We'll schedule the tests at the lab here at the clinic. I’ll also write you a referral for the ultrasound facility. If the results are concerning, we may need to discuss further investigation with a nephrologist, a kidney specialist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. A few days is fine. And if I need to see a specialist, then so be it. I trust your judgment. So, the lab is here at the clinic, you say? That’s convenient.
DOCTOR: Yes, the lab is just down the hall. I’ll have the nurse, Maria, come in and give you the necessary paperwork and instructions. She'll also schedule you for the ultrasound. In the meantime, continue to drink plenty of fluids, and if you experience any fever, chills, or worsening pain, please contact the clinic immediately. I will also write you a prescription for a short course of antibiotics to cover the possibility of a urinary tract infection, while we await the test results. It’s always best to err on the side of caution. Do you have any further questions for me today, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time and your attention. You’ve put my mind at ease, and I appreciate you being so thorough. I’ll see Maria, then, and get the paperwork.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It was my pleasure. Remember, don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. I'll see you back in the clinic once the results are available. Have a good day, and enjoy your garden party!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. .
