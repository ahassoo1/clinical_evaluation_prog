DOCTOR: Right, well, Mr. Trendler, please have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about… lookin’ in the mirror, Doctor. Ain’t pleased with what I see. Not pleased at all. Skin all… hangin’ and such. Waste of good money, this body is.
DOCTOR: Hangin’… alright. And how long have you been noticing this “hangin’,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Noticin’? Since I turned sixty, probably. Maybe before. Long time. A long time. Ain’t gettin’ any younger, are ya? It’s just… worse now. More noticeable. And it bothers my wife… bothered my wife, I should say. She liked things… tidier.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it’s a cosmetic concern, primarily. And it’s been gradually worsening over the years. Is it just the appearance, or are you experiencing any discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort? No. Just… ugly. It’s unsightly, that’s what it is. Don't need no aches and pains added to the list. I worked hard my whole life, buildin’ things. Pile drivin’ ain’t exactly a beauty pageant, ya know? And for what? To look like… this?
DOCTOR: Pile drivin’… Yes, well. Many professions aren’t known for their aesthetic benefits. So, you’re concerned about loose skin. Is it all over, or just certain areas?
PATIENT: Certain areas. Mostly… the belly, you understand. And… well, the arms a bit. Used to be muscle there, proper muscle. Now it just… jiggles. And the neck. Don't like the look of the neck. Makes me look like a turkey, I reckon.
DOCTOR: A turkey… Right. So, abdominal skin, arms, and neck. Have you tried anything to address this already?
PATIENT: Tried? What you mean, tried? I ain't one for fancy creams and potions, Doctor. Waste of money, that’s what that is. I ate good food, worked hard, that’s what I did. Never sat around doin’ nothin’. Ain't about to start slatherin’ stuff on myself now.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let me just pull up your records here… Hmm. It says you’ve been a patient here for a few years. No mention of any cosmetic procedures, as I suspected. Any significant weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, nothin’ major. Maybe a pound or two here and there. Gets harder to keep weight on as you get older, you know? Bones feelin’ lighter every year. Just… things droopin’, that’s all. It’s gravity, I tell ya. Gravity and bad luck.
DOCTOR: Gravity… Yes, well. It affects us all eventually. Your BMI is… within the normal range, albeit on the lower end. And your recent blood work appears to be unremarkable. No thyroid issues, which can sometimes contribute to weight changes or skin elasticity.
PATIENT: Elasticity? What’s that got to do with anythin’? Look, Doctor, I don't need fancy words. I want somethin’ done. Can you fix it, or can’t ya? I ain’t got all day to be sittin’ here listenin’ to talk about… elasticity.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, “fix” is a rather… simplistic term. What you’re describing is the natural process of aging and loss of collagen. There are procedures – surgical and non-surgical – that can improve the appearance, but they come with risks, costs, and aren't guaranteed. We’re talking about options like a tummy tuck, arm lift, or neck lift. Or, less invasive treatments like radiofrequency or ultrasound.
PATIENT: Radio… what now? Ultrasound? Sounds like somethin’ you do to babies! I want the stuff that… tightens things up. The real stuff. I ain’t lookin’ for no miracle cream or baby treatments. I want it fixed proper. And how much we talkin’ here? Don’t beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: "Proper," as you say, will be expensive. A tummy tuck alone can run anywhere from $8,000 to $12,000, depending on the extent of the work. An arm lift is typically around $6,000 to $8,000, and a neck lift can be $7,000 to $10,000. And those prices don't include anesthesia, facility fees, or post-operative care. These are elective procedures, Mr. Trendler, not covered by most insurance plans.
PATIENT: Eight thousand dollars?! For a belly?! You're havin' a laugh, Doctor. That’s daylight robbery, that is. I could build a small shed for that money. A proper shed. I think I need to think on this. A long, long time. Waste of good money, this whole thing.
DOCTOR: That’s entirely your prerogative, Mr. Trendler. Just be aware that these prices are estimates, and they can vary. I can provide you with a referral to a board-certified plastic surgeon if you’d like to get a more detailed consultation. Otherwise… well, you’ve had your physical, and everything appears to be medically sound. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s enough. Enough talk about droopin’ bits and expensive surgeries. Waste of time, this whole thing. Just wanted to see if somethin’ could be done. Seems like nothin’ can be done without robbin’ a bank. .
DOCTOR: Alright then. Have a good day, Mr. Trendler. And don't hesitate to schedule an appointment if anything else comes up. .
