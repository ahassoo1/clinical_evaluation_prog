DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... well, it's my joints, mostly. They just feel… stiff, you know? Especially in the mornings. It's not a bad pain, just… hard to get going. I don't really remember when it started, to be honest. It's been a while, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Stiffness in the joints, mostly in the mornings." And you say this has been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Yes, a while. Longer than… well, since my husband passed, I guess. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days, you know? I don't really keep track of things like that. It's just… harder to do things when I first wake up. Like getting dressed, or making coffee. Not impossible, just… slow.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the stiffness seems to be worse in the morning and improves as the day goes on. And it's impacting your daily activities, specifically getting dressed and making coffee. Are you experiencing this stiffness in all your joints, or just specific ones?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… It's mostly my hands and knees, I think. And maybe my back a little? It's hard to say for sure. They all ache a bit, but those are the worst, I guess. I don't really pay much attention to it 'til it bothers me, you know? It's not like a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. “Dull ache, primarily in hands, knees, and possibly the back, worse in the morning.” Do you notice any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don't think so. Maybe a little sometimes, in my hands, but I just figured it was from… well, from doing things. I do a bit of gardening, and I'm sure that doesn't help. I haven't really noticed any redness, no. It's just… puffy sometimes, I guess. Mostly just stiff. Is that bad? I don't want to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: "Possible mild puffiness in hands, no redness noted." It’s not about making a fuss, Ms. Voner. It's about figuring out what's going on so we can manage it appropriately. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this stiffness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Oh, sometimes I feel tired. Very tired. But I figured that was just getting older, you know? And… well, my appetite isn't what it used to be. But I haven't been cooking much lately, so maybe that's why. I don't really know. Everything feels a bit… off, but I'm not sure what's normal anymore. Does that help? I don't want to bother you with silly things.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and decreased appetite. Okay. And how long have you been feeling fatigued?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now, too. Probably… around the same time as the stiffness? It's hard to say for sure. Some days are better than others, but mostly I just feel… drained. Like I don't have much energy to do anything. I used to love gardening, but even that feels like a lot of work now. I don't think it's a bad tiredness, just… constant. You know? I'm sorry I can't be more specific. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll try to get to the bottom of this. Now, have you had any fevers, unexplained weight loss, or any skin rashes that you've noticed?
PATIENT: Fevers… no, not that I remember. I haven’t felt sick with a fever in… well, I can’t remember the last time, to be honest. Weight loss… maybe a little? My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven't been weighing myself. And no rashes, no. My skin is just… old, you know? A bit dry, but no rashes. I really don’t think I’ve been sick with anything serious. Mostly just tired and achy. Is that enough information? I feel bad taking up your time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Before we do a physical exam, let's go over some medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Let me think... I had high blood pressure, I think. Years ago. My doctor put me on some pills, but I stopped taking them when… well, when my husband got sick. I don’t really go to the doctor much anymore. And… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Other than that… not really. I used to be pretty healthy, but things have been… different lately. I don't think I have anything major, though. Mostly just old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of hypertension, discontinued medication. Cholecystectomy in the past. And any family history of arthritis, autoimmune diseases, or other joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. My mother had some problems with her hands, I think. She always complained about them being stiff and achy, but I don’t know what it was. Arthritis, maybe? And my aunt had something… an illness that made her very tired all the time. I don’t remember the name of it. It was something… serious. But other than that, not really. My family mostly just… got old and passed away. It’s a long time ago, so I don’t remember much. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to ask you a few questions about your current medications and allergies, then I'd like to do a physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… not really. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but I stopped, like I said. I take a little vitamin D sometimes, in the winter. But that’s about it. I try not to take too many pills. And… no allergies, that I know of. I can eat anything. I don’t really have a sensitive stomach or anything like that. I'm pretty simple, really. Is that okay? I hope I’m not making this too difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay. No current medications, Vitamin D occasionally. No known allergies. Now, let's move on to a physical exam. If you don't mind, I'm going to check your joints for tenderness, swelling, and range of motion. I'll also listen to your heart and lungs and check your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle, okay? My joints are a bit… sensitive, you know? And I don't really like doctors poking and prodding, but I understand you have to do what you have to do. Just… take your time. Is that alright? I’m just a bit nervous, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Voner. We’ll take it slow and be as gentle as possible. Please sit here on the table, and we’ll start with your hands. First, I’m going to gently feel around each of your knuckles and the base of your fingers to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. How does this feel?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Okay… Yes, that’s a little… tender. Right there, on that knuckle. And… maybe a little on this one, too. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. Is that what you’re looking for? I hope I’m not making this difficult. It’s hard to say exactly where it hurts, everything just feels… sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Tenderness on the dorsal knuckles of both hands. And any pain with gripping, like making a fist?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. There's a bit of a pain when I do that. Not terrible, but… noticeable. Like a squeeze. And… it's harder to open my hand again. It feels a little… stiff. I used to be able to do anything with my hands, but now… well, it's not the same. I hope I'm not complaining too much. Is this what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited range of motion and pain with gripping. Now, let’s check your knees. Could you bend your knees for me, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh alright. Oh… there's a bit of a pain when I do that. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a creak. And… it's harder to bend them all the way. They feel a bit… stiff. I used to be able to kneel down in the garden, but now… well, it's not the same. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some crepitus and mild tenderness in both knees. No significant swelling or warmth. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. In… and out… in… and out… Is that alright? I hope I’m not breathing too loud. I get a bit… nervous when doctors listen to my chest. It reminds me of… well, never mind. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear. Alright, Ms. Voner, that completes the physical exam. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing osteoarthritis. The stiffness, pain with gripping and bending, and crepitus in your joints are all consistent with that diagnosis. However, to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. We’ll also get some X-rays of your hands and knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Osteo… arthritis? That sounds… serious. Blood tests and X-rays… that sounds like a lot. But… if that's what you think is best, Doctor, then alright. I trust you. I just… hope it's not too bad. Is it something I can… fix? Or is it just something I have to live with? I just want to be able to do things again… like gardening. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Voner. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease, meaning it involves the breakdown of cartilage in the joints. It’s very common, especially as we age. While there's no cure, there are many things we can do to manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. The blood tests will help rule out other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, and the X-rays will show us the extent of the cartilage damage in your joints. Once we have those results, we can discuss treatment options, which may include pain relievers, physical therapy, weight management if applicable, and assistive devices like braces or walking aids. It’s unlikely we can completely reverse the damage, but we can certainly work to slow its progression and help you manage your pain so you can continue to enjoy activities like gardening. Would you like me to explain how we'll get those tests done?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… a little better, knowing there are things we can do. Pain relievers and… therapy, that sounds good. I don't want to be in pain all the time. And… I suppose I could lose a little weight. I haven't been very active lately. Yes, please, tell me about the tests. How will they do them? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to get this sorted out as soon as possible. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Voner. Getting this sorted out quickly is a perfectly reasonable goal. For the blood tests, we’ll just need a small sample from a vein in your arm. It’s a quick procedure, and there’s minimal discomfort. The lab will analyze the sample for inflammation markers and other indicators. For the X-rays, you’ll simply stand or sit in front of the X-ray machine while the technician takes images of your hands and knees. Again, it’s a painless procedure, but you will be exposed to a small amount of radiation. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan tailored to your needs. In the meantime, I'll give you a prescription for a mild pain reliever to help manage your symptoms. It's important not to exceed the recommended dosage, and if you experience any side effects, please let me know immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh alright. That doesn't sound too bad. A little prick and some pictures… I can handle that. 3-5 days… that's not too long to wait. And… a pain reliever, yes, that would be good. My hands are aching a little right now. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. I just… hope it doesn't hurt too much. And I hope I can still garden. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Voner. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to continue doing the things you enjoy. We’ll do everything we can to help you manage your pain so you can continue to garden. The pain reliever should provide some relief, and once we have the test results, we can explore other options like physical therapy and assistive devices. We can even talk about adapting your gardening techniques to minimize strain on your joints. Here’s the prescription for the pain reliever. Please take it as directed, and don't hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns. Also, the lab order and X-ray request are being sent electronically to the lab and radiology center. They’ll contact you to schedule your appointments. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh alright. Thank you, Doctor. That sounds… reassuring. Adapting my techniques… yes, that might be a good idea. I suppose I could use a little help lifting things. No, I don't think that's all. You've been very helpful. Thank you for listening. I appreciate it. I think I'll just go home now and try to rest. And maybe… maybe I'll try to do a little gardening tomorrow. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Voner. Listen to your body, and don’t push yourself too hard. It’s important to pace yourself and prioritize your comfort. If you experience any increased pain or discomfort, please stop and rest. And don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. Here's a handout with some helpful information about osteoarthritis, including some gentle exercises you can try. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Please call the office to schedule it once you have the test results. Have a good day, and try to enjoy your gardening! .
