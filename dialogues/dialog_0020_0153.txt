DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Beinborn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, you said? Yes, yes... It’s about… a check-up, I think? Something to do with… performing? Honestly, things are a little fuzzy these days. They sent me a letter, said I needed to come in. Just trying to get it over with, if you don’t mind. I don’t like to take up people’s time.
DOCTOR: No trouble at all, Mr. Krahn. It sounds like this might be a follow-up appointment, but don't worry about the details. We'll figure everything out together. "Performing"... can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Performing… well, I… I work at the theater. Have for… a long time. Ushering, mostly. Sometimes I help with tickets. And… greeting people. I don’t actually perform perform, if that makes sense. I used to, a long, long time ago, but that was… another life, really. It's all a bit of a blur. They just need me to be… cleared, I guess, to keep doing what I'm doing. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is related to your continued employment at the theater. I understand. Just routine clearance, you think?
PATIENT: Routine, yes. That’s what I’m hoping. Honestly, I’ve got… things to do. Not important things, mind you. Just… things. So the quicker we can get this over with, the better. I appreciate your help, Doctor. Is there a form I need to fill out? I always forget where to sign things these days.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with a quick review of your medical history. I see here that you're 69 years old, and your race is Chinese. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. 69… feels older some days. And yes, I am Chinese. My family… came over a long time ago. I don't remember much about it, honestly. It's all… faded. What sort of history are you looking for? I’ve always been… pretty healthy, I think. A few aches and pains, what you’d expect at my age. But nothing serious.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Just to be thorough, let's go through some questions. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned something once, a long time ago. He put me on a little pill… for a while. Stopped taking it, though. Didn't feel… necessary. Everything else… I don’t think so. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Never really been one for doctors, if I'm honest. A little forgetful, as you can tell, but otherwise… pretty good. I really don’t remember any specific diagnoses. Is that bad? I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s common for details to be forgotten, especially over time. We can work with what you remember. So, high blood pressure in the past... Do you currently take any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, not currently. Like I said, I stopped taking the pill for the blood pressure a long time ago. I don't take anything. Just… a lot of water. And maybe a little ginger tea when my stomach feels funny. But that’s it. No prescriptions, no vitamins… nothing fancy. I try to keep things simple, you know? Less to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, I don’t think so. Nothing comes to mind. I've always been able to eat… pretty much anything. A few spicy things give me heartburn, but that's not an allergy, is it? I don't break out in rashes or anything. Never had a problem with bee stings or pollen or anything like that. I think I’m pretty allergy-free, thankfully. Another thing I’ve been lucky with, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Now that's a good question. Let me think… When I was a little boy, I had my tonsils out. That's about it, I think. Nothing since. A few overnight stays in the hospital when I was younger, for… colds, maybe? Just to be safe. But no major surgeries, no. Nothing like a hip replacement or anything. Just the tonsils, a long, long time ago. I don’t remember much about it, honestly. It was a different time, you know? They didn't have all the fancy pain medicine they have now.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… oh dear. That’s another hard one. My parents… they both lived long lives, thankfully. But they passed away a long time ago. And I didn't… I wasn't really the one to ask about medical things. They didn't talk much about it. I think my father had… something with his heart, maybe? But I’m not sure. And my mother… she just… got old, I suppose. No major illnesses, as far as I know. I really wish I could be more helpful. It's just… it's been so long. And I wasn’t paying much attention back then, I suppose. I was more interested in… other things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. It's very common for these details to be unclear. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My parents didn’t smoke, and I just… never took it up. Always seemed… unhealthy. And smelly, to be honest. I prefer a nice cup of tea, if you don't mind. Much better for you. I do enjoy a little ginger tea when my stomach is upset, but that’s it. No cigarettes, no cigars, nothing like that. I'm quite proud of that, actually. It's one good habit I've always kept.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… hmm. I used to, back when I was younger. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. A little champagne on special occasions. But I haven’t… really touched it in years. Not since my… divorce, I suppose. It just didn’t seem… appealing anymore. A bit sad, really. So no, I don’t drink anymore. Just tea, as I said. And water. Lots of water. It's much better for you, you know. Keeps you… regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, tell me a bit about what you do at the theatre. What does your work involve on a typical day?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly… greeting people. Making sure they have their tickets. Showing them to their seats. Keeping things… orderly. It's not glamorous work, I'll tell you that. Mostly standing, and smiling. And trying to remember people’s names, which is… difficult. Sometimes I help with the tickets, if we're busy. And occasionally… I have to… well, I have to help with… lost things. People leave their gloves, or their scarves, or their… umbrellas. It's mostly… being helpful, I suppose. And trying to stay out of the way. I'm getting a bit old for running around, you know? I'm mostly just a face, a friendly face, at the theatre. It keeps me busy, though. And I like seeing the shows, when I have time.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very important role, Mr. Krahn. Ensuring a smooth experience for everyone. Now, just one more general question before we move on to a physical exam. Are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or unusual symptoms at all right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my knees ache a bit, especially when it's cold. And my back… well, my back always feels a little stiff, to be honest. But that's just… getting old, I suppose. Nothing major. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little… foggy. Like I'm not quite thinking straight. But that's probably just… my age, too. I forget things, as you’ve probably noticed. But no… no real pain, no. Nothing that's bothering me terribly. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting old. I try to ignore it as much as possible. It's better that way, you know? Don’t want to dwell on things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some knee and back discomfort, and some occasional fogginess. We’ll take a look at those. All right, Mr. Krahn, would you mind if I performed a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: No, no, go ahead. The quicker it's done, the better, really. I just hope it doesn't take too long. And please, don’t ask me to do anything… too strenuous. I’m not as nimble as I used to be. Just… get it over with, if you don’t mind. I appreciate your help, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll keep it brief and gentle. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 82. And your pulse is 78, regular. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. There's some mild tenderness on both knees, and a slightly reduced range of motion. No significant swelling. And finally, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. All right, that's all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Diminished reflexes… is that bad? See, this is what I worry about. I told you I wasn't remembering things clearly. Is the blood pressure… high? Should I be worried about that too? I always forget what the numbers mean. I just want to be able to keep working at the theater, you know? That's all. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krahn, let’s go over the findings. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, as I mentioned, and it's something we should monitor. It's not necessarily an immediate emergency, but it's good to be aware of. We can discuss some lifestyle changes, and potentially medication if needed, to help bring it down. As for the diminished reflexes, that can be a normal part of aging. It doesn't automatically indicate a serious problem, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. The important thing is, your symptoms seem relatively mild right now. And you're able to continue working at the theater, which is great. I'd like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. It will help us rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms and ensure there are no underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… oh dear. More tests. Honestly, I just want to be left alone. But… if it’s important, I suppose. You think it’s worth it? I just don’t like needles. And I always worry about what they’ll find. But… if it will help me keep my job… then yes, I suppose. What kind of blood work are we talking about? And will it take long? I have to be at the theater by… well, I have to be there. I just hope it’s not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Krahn. It’s never fun dealing with tests. We’ll keep it as streamlined as possible. The blood work will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. It will also include a TSH test to check your thyroid function, given the occasional fogginess you mentioned. This will give us a good overview of your overall health. It should take about 30-45 minutes at the lab, and they’re very good at making it as comfortable as possible. I’ll give you a requisition form, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to address any concerns. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: 30-45 minutes… yes, that’s… manageable, I suppose. As long as it doesn't involve too much waiting. I hate waiting. And no… no needles, right? Or… just a little prick? I really don’t like needles. But… if it’s just a little prick, I can handle it. And you’ll call me when the results are back? You won’t forget? I always worry about things getting lost. But… okay. Yes, I’ll go to the lab. And I’ll bring the form. And you’ll call me. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I just… I just want to keep working at the theater. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Krahn, that's absolutely not too much to ask. Keeping your job and continuing to enjoy your work is important. And rest assured, I won't forget. I'll personally call you as soon as the results are back. The blood draw will be a quick prick, as you said, and it's usually over before you know it. I'll write down my direct number for you, just in case. Here you go. And I'll give you the requisition form for the lab. Just take this to the lab at your convenience, and they'll take care of everything. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very patient with me, Doctor. I know I’m not the easiest patient. And I keep forgetting things. But… thank you. Thank you for listening. And for not making me feel… foolish. I just… I hope the tests don’t show anything too bad. But… if they do, I trust you to… to take care of it. I think that’s all. I should probably get going now. I have to… prepare for the evening show. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. It's my job to listen and help, and you're not difficult at all. Remember, we'll take things one step at a time. And don't worry too much about the tests. We'll discuss the results thoroughly and come up with a plan together. Please, take care, and enjoy the evening show. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Don't hesitate to call my number if you have any questions or concerns before then.
