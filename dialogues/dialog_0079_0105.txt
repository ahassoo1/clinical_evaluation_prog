DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Yeah, it’s… about the surgery. The weight loss surgery. I think my wife set all this up. Honestly, I don’t really remember why exactly, just that we talked about it a while back. Something about getting healthier, I guess? It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Right. A fuzzy recollection of the reason for bariatric surgery consultation. It’s not uncommon for patients to have… varying degrees of recall when initiating such a significant undertaking. Perhaps we can clarify your current goals and concerns, then. To begin, can you tell me about your weight history?
PATIENT: My weight… hmm. I’ve always been… bigger, I think. Since I was a kid. It’s gone up and down, but mostly up, you know? I don't really keep track of numbers or anything. It’s just… been this way for a long time. I used to be able to do more… things. Walk longer, play with my kids when they were little… Now it’s harder. Is that what you mean? I don’t know what I weighed last year, or even a month ago, to be honest. Sorry.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Kochubey. We can work with that. It sounds as though your current weight is impacting your quality of life. Let’s try to get a better understanding of where things stand now. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. My wife usually handles all the doctor stuff. I think… the doctor said my blood sugar was a little high last time. And I get tired really easily. Sometimes my chest feels… tight. But it comes and goes. Honestly, I don't want to worry her too much, so I don’t always tell her everything. I don’t think it’s anything serious. Does that make sense? I'm probably just out of shape.
DOCTOR: Alright. Elevated blood sugar and reports of chest tightness, potentially underreported. We will need to investigate that further. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… just a multivitamin, I think. My wife gets it for me. Sometimes I take something for heartburn, like Tums or something. It’s… whatever’s on sale at the store, really. I don't really pay attention to the names. And, uh… I used to take something for my back, but I stopped. It didn’t really help, and it made me feel weird. I think that’s it. Honestly, I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, PRN antacids, and a discontinued back medication. Now, regarding allergies – are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I’m outside, but that’s probably just bugs or something. I don’t think my wife has ever told me I have any serious allergies. I've eaten pretty much everything, I guess. I'm not picky. Does that help? I’m really drawing a blank here. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, Mr. Kochubey, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. Uh… no, no smoking. Never really liked it. I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, on the weekends. But I stopped a few years ago. My wife asked me to. And… no, definitely no drugs. Never touched them. I don’t really go out much, to be honest. Mostly just work and then home with the family. Is that what you needed to know? It’s all pretty boring, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no tobacco, limited past alcohol use, no recreational drug use. Now, a quick question regarding your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or obesity?
PATIENT: Oh boy. Family history… That’s a tough one. My dad… he had heart problems. I think he had a stroke, maybe? And my mom… she had diabetes, for sure. It was bad. And a couple of my aunts… they were pretty heavy. Like, really heavy. I think that’s about all I remember. It’s been a long time, and we don't really talk about it much. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It's all a bit foggy in my memory.
DOCTOR: Alright, family history of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. We will make a note to review any available records if possible. Now, Mr. Kochubey, before we proceed, I would like to conduct a brief physical exam. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try not to poke too much, okay? I'm not good with needles. And… it makes me a little nervous, all this poking and prodding. But I understand you need to check things out. Just let me know what you’re doing as you go, okay? That would be great.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kochubey. I will explain everything as I go. We’ll start with your height and weight. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen. Please remove your shoes and have a seat on the examination table when you’re ready. Alright, your height is 155 centimeters and your weight is 139 kilograms. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out… Heart sounds are regular, but slightly muffled. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though there is some diminished airflow in the bases. Blood pressure is 150/90. Abdomen is soft, but there is some tenderness in the upper right quadrant. No masses palpated. Now, I will check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… a lot of numbers. I don't really understand them. Muffled heart sounds? What does that mean? And my blood pressure is high? My wife always says I eat too much salt. Should I stop eating so much salt? And my stomach… it does hurt sometimes, especially after dinner. But I just thought it was indigestion. Is it something serious? I’m starting to get a little worried now. Maybe this surgery isn’t such a good idea.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel worried, Mr. Kochubey. The findings I've noted are not immediately alarming, but they warrant further investigation. The muffled heart sounds could be due to a number of factors, including fluid around the heart or a thickened chest wall. Elevated blood pressure is also a concern, and dietary modifications, such as reducing salt intake, are certainly advisable. The tenderness in your upper right quadrant could be due to indigestion, as you mentioned, but we should rule out any other potential causes. Before we discuss the surgery further, I would like to order some blood tests to assess your blood sugar levels, kidney function, liver function, and cholesterol levels. I also recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to evaluate your heart rhythm. And finally, I would like to order an abdominal ultrasound to further investigate the tenderness in your upper right quadrant. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Whoa… that’s a lot of tests. Blood tests, an… electro-what? And an… ultra-sound? I hate needles, Doctor. And I don't like being poked and prodded. Is all this really necessary? I just wanted to talk about the surgery. My wife said it would make me healthier. She said it would be easier to… move around. But this sounds… complicated. And expensive. I don't even have insurance. Maybe… maybe I should just stick to trying to eat healthier. It sounds a lot less scary than all this. Can we… can we just skip the tests?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, I understand your apprehension, and I assure you I wouldn’t order these tests unnecessarily. However, bariatric surgery is a significant procedure with potential risks, and it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of your overall health status before proceeding. These tests are not merely about identifying problems; they are about ensuring your safety and optimizing your outcome. To proceed with the surgery without these investigations would be… imprudent. Regarding the cost, I can direct you to resources that may offer financial assistance or reduced-cost testing options. We can also discuss non-surgical alternatives, but those would likely require significant lifestyle modifications and ongoing medical management. I strongly advise against skipping the tests, Mr. Kochubey. Let us proceed with these investigations, and then we can have a more informed discussion about your options. Do you consent to the blood tests, EKG, and abdominal ultrasound?
PATIENT: …Okay. Okay, fine. You’re right. I guess… I guess it’s better to know, even if it’s scary. I just… I don’t like the idea of needles. But… okay. Yes. Yes, I consent. Do what you need to do. But… please be quick. And… tell me what’s happening as you go, okay? And… how much is all this going to cost? My wife’s going to kill me if it's too expensive. She said we’re already stretching things thin as it is. And… can we at least talk about the non-surgical options after the tests? Just so I have something to compare it to? It’s just… a lot to take in. A lot.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kochubey. I will ensure the process is as efficient and comfortable as possible, and I will explain each step as we go. I will have the nurse draw the blood now. The EKG and ultrasound can be scheduled for later this week. Regarding the cost, I will have the billing department provide you with an estimate after the tests are ordered. We can discuss payment options at that time. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the tests and explore non-surgical alternatives in detail. For now, let us proceed with the blood draw. The nurse will be with you shortly. Do you have any further questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… please hurry. And… be gentle. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well.
