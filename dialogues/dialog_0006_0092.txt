DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds, good to see you. Or… good to meet you. Time slips away, you know?
PATIENT: Huh. Good to meet you too, I guess. Been comin’ here a long time… or maybe not. Hard to say these days. What’s… what’s this about again? My daughter, she made the appointment. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Your daughter… she mentioned some concerns. Let’s see… she said you’ve been… feeling generally unwell?
PATIENT: Unwell? Yeah, that sounds right. Feels like… like the air’s too thin sometimes. And my mouth… always dry. Like a desert in here. And my eyes… scratchy. Nothin’ a little water can fix, though. Used to be able to fix everything with a little water. Used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, thin air… dry mouth, scratchy eyes. And this has been going on… how long would you say?
PATIENT: Long enough. Weeks, maybe? Months? Everything kinda… blurs together. It’s worse when I’m… outside. Workin’, you know? Traffic lights and stuff. Hot out there these days. Always hot. Used to be cooler, I think. Though, who remembers?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what kind of work do you do, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Traffic lights. I… fix ‘em. Or, I used to. Traffic Technician. Been doin’ it… a long time. Now they got all these… newfangled lights. Computers inside ‘em. Makes things complicated. Used to be simple. A wire here, a bulb there. Now it's all… blinking. And hot. Lots of hot blinking.
DOCTOR: Okay, Traffic Technician… working with traffic lights. And you said it's worse when you're outside, especially with the heat. Any dizziness or lightheadedness when you’re working on them?
PATIENT: Dizzy? Sometimes. Not… fallin’ over dizzy, but… woozy. Like the world’s swayin’ a little. Happens mostly when I’m climbin’ the pole. Makes me nervous. Used to be able to climb those poles like a monkey. Now… Now it’s harder. A lot harder. And hotter. Everything's hotter.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a quick check of your eyes. And I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just routine stuff, okay?
PATIENT: Routine, huh? Always poking and proddin’. Never used to be this much proddin’. Fine, go ahead. But don’t shine that light in my eyes too long. Makes things worse. My eyes are sensitive, you know. Always have been. Especially when it’s hot.
DOCTOR: Okay, just look straight ahead. And now follow my finger… good. Pupils are a little… sluggish, but not drastically. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Guilds. Breathing sounds are a little… diminished on the lower lobes, but nothing alarming. Heart rate is a bit elevated, but that could be from the heat.
PATIENT: Elevated? Everything's elevated these days. My blood pressure, my worries… even the temperature. Diminished, huh? What does that mean? Sounds bad. Is somethin' wrong? My daughter, she said I should ask about… about my chest. She worries about my chest. It feels… tight sometimes. But that's probably just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness in the chest… and your daughter mentioned it as well. Can you describe the tightness?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Like somethin' squeezin'. Not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Like a band around my chest. Happens when I… when I walk uphill. Or when it's really hot. And when I'm worried. Which is… often. Used to be able to walk anywhere without thinkin' about it. Now… everything's a thinkin' process. Even breathin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Given your symptoms – the dizziness, the shortness of breath, the chest tightness, especially with exertion and heat – and your age… we need to rule out a few things. I'm going to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. We'll also do some blood work to check your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: EKG? X-Ray? Blood work? Sounds… complicated. And expensive. Medicare cover that? My daughter handles the money, you know. She’ll be askin’ questions. Is it… serious? Is somethin’ really wrong? I just thought it was the heat. Everything's the heat these days.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Guilds, and yes, Medicare should cover it. It’s just to be thorough, to make sure everything is alright. We’re not necessarily looking for something serious, just getting a baseline and ruling things out. We'll get the tests done right here in the clinic. It won’t take long. And I’ll explain everything to your daughter as well. Sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Reasonable… I guess so. If you say so. But don't poke too much, alright? And tell my daughter it's not my fault if it costs too much. She gets… upset easily. And if it’s somethin’ serious… well. I’ve had a long life, you know. A long, hot life. But I’d like to keep havin' it, if that's alright. Just… don't poke too much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. We’ll be as gentle as possible. And we’ll do everything we can to help you keep having it. Let's get these tests ordered, and we'll take it one step at a time. I'll have the nurse come in and get you set up. .
