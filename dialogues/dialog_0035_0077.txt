DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm. Well, the company sent me. Said I need to be checked, even though I feel alright. Been working down in that mine a long time, you see. They worry too much, these young folks.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good your company is proactive with your health. Even if you feel alright, routine check-ups are important. Just to make sure everything is functioning as it should be. So, how long have you been working in the mine, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Long time. Fifty years, maybe more. Lost track after a while. Started when I was a young man, strong as an ox. Now… well, now I just am. It’s just a job, you know? Always digging, always moving rocks. Not much to tell.
DOCTOR: Fifty years is a very long time. That’s a lot of physical work. Have you noticed any changes in your body over those years?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? Old age changes, you mean? Of course! Back gets stiff, knees ache a little… that’s just getting old, Doctor. Not from the mine. Everybody gets like that. I ain't made of steel, you know? What kind of changes are you talking about?
DOCTOR: You're right, those are common changes with age. I just want to be thorough. I mean, have you noticed any new aches or pains besides the stiffness and knee pain?
PATIENT: New aches? Hmmm… let me think. There was that time my shoulder bothered me a bit, lifting those heavy bags… but that was last year, and it went away. And sometimes I get a bit… breathless, walking up the stairs. But I always been a bit out of shape. Not much exercise these days, you see. Is that what you’re looking for? Because everyone gets breathless sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, shoulder pain last year that resolved, and some shortness of breath with stairs. That's helpful. Has the shortness of breath been getting worse recently, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Worse? No, not really. I haven’t even noticed it getting worse. It’s just… stairs, you know? Always hard. I don't run up and down stairs like a young man, never did. It's always been a bit of a struggle. You worry too much, Doctor. I feel fine. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any coughing, wheezing, or chest pain along with the breathlessness?
PATIENT: Coughing… sometimes. A little bit in the mornings, clearing my throat. Old man cough, you know? Nothing serious. Wheezing? No, I don’t think so. Never been a wheezer. Chest pain? No. Never had chest pain. I'd know if I had chest pain, believe me. Is this all about the mine? All these questions! They sent me here to make sure I ain’t got black lung or something, didn't they?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Bigger. Your company is being thorough, and we want to rule out anything concerning. Black lung is definitely something we'd consider given your line of work. To get a better picture, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Listen to my lungs? Oxygen levels? Now you're getting fancy. Fine, fine, do what you need to do. But I'm telling you, I feel perfectly alright. Don't go making me sick with all your machines and worrying! Just get it over with. The sooner I'm out of here, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up on the table for me, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. It'll only take a moment. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good.
PATIENT: Deep breath, deep breath... always telling me to take a deep breath. Used to breathing dusty air down there, you know. Not much fresh air. . Hurry up, will you? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bigger. Your heart sounds regular, but I am hearing some crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. That doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it could indicate some fluid buildup. To be certain, I’d like to get a chest X-ray. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Crackles? Fluid buildup? Now you’re scaring an old man! What kind of fluid? Is it… bad? Look, I told you, I feel fine. I don’t need no X-rays. I just want to go home. What did the company tell you? Are they trying to get rid of me? They always did think I was getting too old...No X-rays, Doctor. No X-rays. I'm leaving now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, please, just sit for a moment. I understand your concerns, and I’m not trying to scare you. An X-ray is a simple, painless test. It's just to rule things out. The crackles could be due to many things, not necessarily something serious. But given your history of working in the mine, we need to be thorough. It’s better to be safe, and I want to make sure you're healthy. Let’s just get the X-ray, and then we can talk about the results. I promise, we’ll take it one step at a time. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But you promise me, just one step at a time. And you explain everything to me, alright? No fancy doctor talk. Just… tell me what it means. If it’s bad, I want to know. I’m an old man, Doctor. I can handle it. But no surprises. Where do I go for this… X-ray? And how long will it take? I got dinner plans… well, not plans, exactly. But I was hoping to watch the news. Just get it over with quickly, will you?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bigger. I promise to explain everything in plain language, no fancy doctor talk. And we'll take it one step at a time. The X-ray machine is just down the hall. It’ll only take a few minutes. A technician will take the pictures, and then the radiologist will read them. It may take a little while to get the results, perhaps an hour or two. I'll have someone come get you when they’re ready. In the meantime, why don’t I get you a glass of water?
PATIENT: Water would be nice, thank you. An old man gets thirsty, you know. Just… try not to keep me waiting all day. And please, no scary news while I'm waiting. Just tell me what's what when you get the results. I've lived a long life, Doctor. I don't need any extra worries.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. I'll let the technician know to be quick. I’ll be right back with that water, and I’ll check in with you as soon as the results are available. Just relax, and if you need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to let the nurse know.
PATIENT: Relax, she says. Easy for her to say. Sitting around waiting for bad news… Just another thing to worry about. Fifty years down a hole… what good is a fancy X-ray now?
DOCTOR: .
