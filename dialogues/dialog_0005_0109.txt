DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… a headache. Back of my head. Been happening for… oh, maybe three days now. Not… not a bad one always, but it's there. Like a weight, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. A headache, alright. And you said it’s been going on for about three days?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Three days, I think. Maybe four. Time… time gets away from me sometimes. It's mostly in the back. Not… not like a pounding, just… there. Makes it hard to focus on things. I used to be very good with details, working with the trains, but this… this makes it fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Right, "fuzzy" is good to know. And you mentioned you used to work with trains… was that recently?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not recently. Oh, goodness, no. I retired… let me think… twenty years ago, maybe more? Rail yard work. Lots of moving trains, checking things, making sure everything was safe. Dinkey operator, hostler… all sorts of things. Good work, but hard on the body. This headache… it's new. Not from the trains, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… my wife, Elena… she passed away six months ago. That was… a big change. Everything feels different since then. Quiet. I mostly keep to myself now. Don't have much family left, either. Just a niece, but she lives far away.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s… significant, Mr. Brum. And you said the headache started around six months ago, coincidentally with your wife's passing?
PATIENT: No, no. Not right after. It was… a few months after. I was… busy with things then, you know? Arrangements and… and sadness. This headache started more recently. Three or four weeks ago, maybe. Not six months. Six months was… when Elena left us. The headache is… newer than that.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's try to be precise. So, three to four weeks with the headache, and six months since your wife’s passing. Do you feel any other symptoms with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… sometimes I feel a little dizzy. Not falling down dizzy, just… lightheaded. And… sometimes I forget things. More than usual, I mean. Like… I’ll go to the kitchen and forget what I went there for. Small things. And… I haven't been sleeping very well. Just… lying awake.
DOCTOR: Okay. So dizziness, some memory issues, and trouble sleeping. Any nausea or vomiting with the headache?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. Not like that. No throwing up or… feeling like I will. Just… the headache. And the fuzziness. Like looking through a dirty window, you know? Everything seems… dull.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision…? I don't think so. Everything looks… normal. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I always needed glasses, you know? I have them right here. I wear them all the time. It’s not… different different. Not darker or spots or anything. Just… old man eyes, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I don't take many pills, though. Just a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor gave it to me a few years ago. But that's it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medication is that for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it's a little white pill. I keep it in the kitchen, in a little jar. Um… Lisinopril, I think. That's what the label said, anyway. I take it every morning, with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. Good. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I'm not as young as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Just relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is… 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given the headache. Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Okay, balance is a little unsteady, reflexes are slightly diminished, but nothing alarming. I’m noting some mild cognitive impairment, consistent with your reported memory issues. I’m going to check your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. This won’t hurt, I just need to shine a light in them.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds alright. Light in the eyes… I don’t mind. Just tell me if it's too bright, you know? My eyes aren’t what they used to be, so I might squint. Just let me know if anything feels strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m seeing some mild drusen in the retinas, which is common for someone your age. No acute changes. Alright, Mr. Brum. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you are experiencing headaches possibly related to a combination of factors – your age, your blood pressure, and the recent loss of your wife. The mild cognitive impairment is also something we need to keep an eye on. It's difficult to pinpoint one exact cause without further testing.
PATIENT: That… makes sense, Doctor. Sadness… it can do strange things to a person. And I haven't been taking care of myself like I should, to be honest. I understand about further testing. What kind of tests? Will they be painful?
DOCTOR: We'll start with a simple blood test to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We can also consider a CT scan of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities, but I don’t think that’s necessary at this time. I’d like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your memory issues. They can perform more detailed cognitive testing and determine if further investigation is needed. As for pain, the blood test will just be a small prick of a needle, nothing major. The CT scan is painless, but you will need to lie still for a short period of time. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t mind a little prick. And lying still… I can do that. A neurologist, you say? To check my memory? That sounds… wise. I forget things so easily these days. Is it… bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad”, Mr. Brum. Memory issues can be caused by many things, and it's important to get a proper diagnosis so we can determine the best course of action. It’s better to be proactive and investigate further. We need to rule out anything serious, and the neurologist is the best person to do that. For now, I’m going to increase your Lisinopril dosage slightly to help better control your blood pressure. I’m also going to recommend you start a low-impact exercise routine, like walking, and focus on getting enough sleep. We also need to address the emotional aspect of things. Have you considered joining a support group or talking to a therapist?
PATIENT: Walking… yes, I can manage that. I used to walk a lot with Elena. And more sleep… that would be good. I toss and turn all night, thinking about… everything. A support group… I don’t know… I’m not much for talking about my feelings. But maybe… maybe it wouldn’t hurt. What kind of therapist? Will they ask me a lot of personal questions? I don't want to bother anyone with my troubles.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright if you’re not comfortable with a support group right away. And as for a therapist, I can refer you to a geriatric specialist – someone who understands the unique challenges that older adults face. They won’t “bother” anyone, that's their job. They will simply provide a safe space for you to process your grief and develop coping mechanisms. They're trained to handle sensitive information with confidentiality. I'm going to write you a referral to both a neurologist and a geriatric therapist. I'll also give you a list of local support groups, should you decide to explore that option. Do you have any questions about the medications, referrals, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, sir. I think you've covered everything. Medications, neurologist, therapist… I'll try my best to follow your instructions. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man ramble, Doctor. You’ve given me… a little hope. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. And please, don't think of yourself as “just” an old man. You've lived a long life and you deserve the best possible care. I'm here to help in any way I can. I’m printing out the referrals and medication list now. Also, I will have the nurse come in and take your blood pressure before you leave. Take care of yourself, Mr. Brum. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. I appreciate your kindness.
