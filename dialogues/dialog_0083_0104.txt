DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have much time. My throat… it hurts. Been hurting for a few days now. I just need something for it, if you please. Is that possible? I really don't have the patience for a long… examination.
DOCTOR: I understand you're short on time, and we will try to be as efficient as possible. However, even for a sore throat, I need to ask a few questions to ensure we get you the right treatment. It's important to rule out anything more serious, just to be safe. First, can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, it hurts. What more is there to tell you? It’s scratchy… like sandpaper. And swallowing is… difficult. I haven’t been sleeping well because of it. Honestly, I’m a very busy woman. I separate, filter, clarify, precipitate… it's a whole thing. Not much time for… illnesses. Is that sufficient information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. “Scratchy” and “difficult swallowing” give me a better idea. And I appreciate you explaining your busy schedule. Just to clarify, has the pain been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. Mostly it’s worse in the mornings. And when I try to… talk a lot. Like right now, explaining myself. It feels… tighter then. Honestly, I don't spend a lot of time analyzing my throat pain, Doctor. It just is. Can we please hurry this up? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Let me quickly check your throat, and listen to your lungs, just to rule out anything else. It will only take a few moments. Then we can discuss potential treatment options. Could you please open your mouth and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: Really? Must you? Fine. Ah… There. Is that… enough? Honestly, I don't enjoy having strangers look down my throat. It’s… uncouth. And probably germy.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Your lungs sound clear. Your throat is a bit red and swollen. I don't see any white patches, which is good. Now, have you had a fever, any cough, or any body aches accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? I… I don't know. I haven't taken my temperature. And a cough? Not really. Maybe a little tickle now and then, but that’s just dust from the… the separating. Body aches? Well, I always ache. From the work. From standing all day. From… life, I suppose. It’s hardly something I’d notice on top of this throat business.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any difficulty breathing or trouble swallowing fluids?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. I can breathe just fine, thank you very much. As for swallowing fluids… it’s a little difficult, yes. Like I said before. Water goes down, but it’s… uncomfortable. It’s not painful exactly, just… not pleasant. Is this taking much longer? Because I really…
DOCTOR: Just a few more quick questions, Ms. Ottaviani, and then we can formulate a plan. Have you been around anyone recently who has been sick, perhaps with a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Sick people are everywhere, Doctor. I work with a lot of… people. They come and go. Honestly, I can’t recall who specifically has been under the weather. It’s not something I monitor. They cough, they sneeze… it’s part of the job. And I have more important things to think about. Like… clarifying.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to confirm, do you have any allergies to medications, specifically any pain relievers or antibiotics?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I don’t take many medications, Doctor. I prefer to… tough things out. I’m a strong woman. I haven’t had a need for… all that nonsense. Now, can we please get to the part where I get something for this wretched throat? This is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you likely have a viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat. Most viral sore throats resolve on their own within a week. Given your lack of fever and the absence of any white patches in your throat, I don't believe antibiotics are necessary at this time. However, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as directed on the label. Gargling with warm salt water can also provide some relief. It's also important to stay hydrated and rest as much as possible, which I understand may be challenging with your busy schedule. Would you like me to write you a prescription for a throat lozenge?
PATIENT: A lozenge? Fine. Anything to make this… less awful. But I don’t need a long lecture on rest, Doctor. I know what I need to do. And I really do need to get back to… clarifying. Is that all? Can I just… go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ottaviani, this is all for now. Here's your prescription. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or trouble swallowing, please come back immediately or seek urgent care. I also recommend maintaining good hygiene – washing your hands frequently – to prevent the spread of any potential infection. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Thank you. Honestly, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Ms. Ottaviani. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if your condition changes. .
PATIENT: Clarifying… precipitating… honestly. .
