DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s just a routine check-up, really. Gotta keep up with my shots, you know? My husband always reminds me. He’s good about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That’s very responsible of both of you. And it’s excellent you’re prioritizing preventative care. While we’re certainly happy to ensure you’re up-to-date on your vaccinations, a routine check-up allows us to assess your overall health as well. To get a better picture, could you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any particular symptoms or changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… not really, no. Nothing major, anyway. I get a little achy sometimes after a long day on the construction site – you know, bending and lifting and all that. But that’s pretty normal for my job, I guess. Nothing I haven’t dealt with before. My energy levels are good, I think. I'm still pretty active, even outside of work. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It's good to hear you remain active. The physical demands of construction work can certainly contribute to aches and pains. To clarify, when you say “achy,” can you describe where specifically you’re feeling the discomfort?
PATIENT: Mostly in my back, lower back mostly. And sometimes in my shoulders. It usually eases up with a good night's sleep and some stretching, but it’s just… there. It hasn’t gotten worse lately, just… consistent, you know? I’ve always been pretty tough, so I don’t usually bother anyone about it. Is that something I should be talking to a doctor about, even if it's not really bothering me that much?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re being proactive, and yes, even consistent discomfort, especially with a physically demanding job, is worth discussing. We want to ensure there isn’t anything underlying that needs attention. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about the pain?
PATIENT: Sure. It's not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, really. It comes and goes throughout the day, but it's usually worse after I've been on my feet all day or lifting heavy stuff. It doesn’t shoot down my legs or anything, and it doesn't feel numb. Just… sore. And it feels a little better when I'm sitting or lying down. Does that help? I'm not very good at describing things, I apologize.
DOCTOR: You’re describing it perfectly well, Ms. Fornes. That’s very helpful. A dull ache localized to the lower back, worsened by activity and relieved by rest… that gives us a good starting point. Now, to get a broader picture of your health, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you might have?
PATIENT: Well, let's see… I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but I haven't had any trouble with that since. And I've got a little bit of high blood pressure, but it's pretty well controlled with diet and exercise. My doctor keeps an eye on it, and I try to eat healthy. Other than that, I’m pretty lucky. I haven’t been seriously sick in ages. I try to stay active, you know? Keeps the old bones movin'. Do you need to know about allergies, too? I don't think I have any major ones.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And yes, please tell me about any allergies you may have, whether to medications, food, or anything else. And then we can talk about any medications you’re currently taking.
PATIENT: Okay, allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Nothing I’ve ever noticed, anyway. My husband's allergic to cats, but thankfully I’m not! As for medications… just a low-dose aspirin every day, my doctor recommended it a while back. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if my back is really bothering me, but not very often. Other than that, nothing. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can, you know? I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Do you want to know about vitamins or anything like that? I take a multivitamin sometimes, but not every day.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Fornes. We appreciate your honesty. The aspirin is helpful information. And thank you for mentioning the occasional ibuprofen and the multivitamin. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tough one. My mom had some heart trouble when she got older, and my dad had diabetes. Both of them lived to be pretty old, though, so I guess they weren't too bad off. My brother has high cholesterol, I think, but I haven’t really kept up with it. And on my husband’s side… his mom had arthritis, I believe. Does that help? It's not a very detailed history, I apologize. We weren’t really big on keeping track of that sort of thing when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Fornes. Any information you can provide is helpful. Knowing about the heart trouble, diabetes, and arthritis in your family gives us a better understanding of your potential risk factors. Now, just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I work pretty hard, as I mentioned. Construction is physical work, so I'm on my feet a lot. I try to eat healthy - lots of fish, vegetables, and fruits. My husband and I enjoy gardening, so we grow a lot of our own food. We don’t smoke, and we only drink socially – a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to get enough sleep, but it can be hard when I’m sore. And I don't really have any major hobbies besides gardening, but I enjoy spending time with my family. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: No, that’s a very thorough overview, Ms. Fornes. It sounds like you maintain a very healthy lifestyle, which is excellent. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will help me assess your overall condition and pinpoint the source of your back discomfort. We'll start with checking your blood pressure and pulse, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I'll examine your back and assess your range of motion. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. I'm not too worried, but it's good to get things checked out. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay? I’m a little ticklish, just a warning!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fornes. I will be gentle, and I’ll definitely avoid the ticklish spots. Your blood pressure is 132 over 78, which is well within a healthy range. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your back. I’m feeling some mild tenderness upon palpation of the lumbar spine, particularly around L4-L5. There is some muscle spasm present as well. Do you feel any pain with this?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… that's where it usually hurts. Right around there. Not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, like you said. It feels a little worse when you press on it, but it’s not unbearable. It’s been like that for a while, so I guess I’m used to it. But yes, that’s definitely where the problem is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And it's good to identify the specific location. Now, I’m going to assess your range of motion. Could you please bend forward and touch your toes, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, here I go… I can't quite reach my toes, but I can get pretty close. It feels a little tight in my back, but not too painful. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. And thank you for letting me know. Your range of motion is slightly limited, particularly with forward flexion. There's some discomfort noted with the movement. Now, could you gently bend to each side, and then lean back as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, bending to the side… And now the other side… Leaning back… it feels a little tighter in my lower back when I lean back. It's not a sharp pain, but it's definitely noticeable. Is that what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. And thank you for your cooperation. Based on the physical exam findings—mild tenderness and muscle spasm in the lumbar region, slightly limited range of motion, and discomfort with flexion and extension—it appears you’re experiencing a lumbar strain. This is likely due to the physical demands of your work. Now, to rule out any other potential causes, I’d like to order a few simple lab tests, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. These will help assess your overall health and rule out any underlying inflammation or other issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. If it'll help figure things out, then absolutely. I don't mind getting some blood work done. I'd rather be safe than sorry, you know? Is there anything special I need to do to prepare for the tests? Or can I just come in whenever?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Ms. Fornes. No special preparation is needed for these tests. You can come in any weekday morning after 8 am and have them drawn. It'll only take a few minutes. While we're waiting for the lab results, I recommend you continue with over-the-counter pain relief, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed, and apply heat or ice to your lower back. It is also important to avoid any strenuous activities that aggravate your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds manageable. Heat or ice… I’ll try both and see which one feels better. And I'll definitely be careful about lifting things at work. Hmm… let me think. Will this likely go away on its own, or is this something I might need to see a specialist about if it doesn’t improve? I’m not one for going to lots of doctors if I can avoid it, you know. I’d rather just tough it out if it's not too serious.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Ms. Fornes. In most cases, a lumbar strain will resolve on its own with conservative management—rest, pain relief, and avoiding aggravating activities—within a few weeks. However, if your symptoms don’t improve after two to three weeks, or if they worsen despite these measures, then we may need to consider further investigation, such as an X-ray or MRI, and potentially a referral to a specialist—either an orthopedist or a physiatrist. But let’s start with the basics and see how you respond to the initial treatment plan. I will review the lab results as soon as they are available, and we can discuss the next steps at that time. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and explained everything clearly. I appreciate you not jumping to conclusions and suggesting more tests right away. I'll take it easy and see how it goes. I'll call the office if things don’t improve, okay?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. It was my pleasure. And you are absolutely right to start with conservative management. Please do call the office if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a few weeks. We’re here to help. Here’s a written summary of our discussion and the lab orders. I wish you a speedy recovery. Take care, and have a good day. .
