DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, frankly, I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for… well, let’s just say my daughter insisted. She’s always going on about “alternative treatments.” I understand you can… certify one for this marijuana, is that right? For medical purposes, of course. Not that I approve, but she's quite insistent.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. We can discuss medical marijuana certification here at the clinic. It's becoming a more common request, and I'm happy to evaluate whether it might be appropriate for you. Before we get into that specifically, though, could you tell me a little more about why your daughter thinks medical marijuana might be helpful?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest. She mumbles something about my “discomfort” and “better sleep.” I’m seventy-four years old! A little discomfort comes with the territory, don’t you think? And as for sleep… well, I sleep fine. Perhaps not as soundly as I once did, but who does at my age? It’s simply… a nuisance, really. She reads too many articles on the internet, that girl. Always looking for a quick fix.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your daughter is concerned and trying to find ways to help, even if it’s something you’re not entirely convinced about. To get a better picture of things, and to determine if medical marijuana could be a suitable option, let’s talk a little more about what you’re experiencing. You mentioned some discomfort... could you tell me where you're feeling that, and how often it occurs?
PATIENT: Well… it’s mostly in my joints. Knees, hips, you know… the usual places. It’s not constant, mind you. It flares up, particularly in damp weather. And after I’ve been on my feet for too long. I do a bit of gardening, you see. Though, I’ve had to cut back lately. It's not what it used to be, naturally. But a little discomfort is hardly a reason for… this. It’s just… old age, Doctor. Plain and simple. I’ve lived a long life, and things wear down. It's the natural order.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're still active with gardening, that's wonderful. And you're right, some joint discomfort is common with age. However, it’s still important to understand the extent of it. On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain you can imagine, what would you say your discomfort is on a typical day when it’s flared up?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A scale? I don't know about scales. Honestly, I’ve never been one for quantifying things. But… let me think. When it’s bad… it’s not excruciating, mind you. But it's… bothersome. Perhaps a… 4? Yes, a 4. It doesn't stop me from doing things, but it’s definitely… there. And sometimes it keeps me up at night. Not every night, but… often enough to be irritating. Though, as I said, I do sleep. Just not as deeply as I once did. It's just… a general sense of… unease. Do you understand? Not pain, precisely, but… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. A 4, with some associated difficulty sleeping and a general sense of unease. That gives me a much better picture. Now, aside from your joints and the sleep disturbance, have you noticed any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Well, my appetite hasn’t been what it used to be, I suppose. I don’t eat as much as I once did. But that could just be… getting older, couldn’t it? And… my daughter keeps telling me I seem more… “irritable.” Honestly, I think she’s the irritable one! But perhaps I am a bit quicker to… express my opinion these days. It’s frustrating when things don’t go the way they should, you know? And there are a lot of things that don’t go the way they should these days. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been noticing some changes in your appetite and perhaps a bit more frustration lately. Those can be symptoms of various things, but they’re also common with age, as you said. We'll take everything into account. Now, just to get a broader picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… That's a long story. Let me see… I had a bout of pneumonia when I was quite young, but I recovered fully. And I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. Other than that… not much, really. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I ate well, exercised… or, well, used to exercise. And I’ve always been a firm believer in a good night’s rest. No serious illnesses, no chronic conditions. Just… the usual aches and pains that come with a long life. My husband, God rest his soul, he had high blood pressure, but that was about it. I don’t take any medications regularly. Perhaps a pain reliever now and then for a bad headache, but that’s it. Do you need specifics? I don't recall exact dates for everything. It was all a very long time ago, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. Pneumonia as a child, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, otherwise generally healthy. No regular medications. And you mentioned your husband had high blood pressure. Now, thinking about your family history, were there any significant illnesses that ran in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had arthritis, quite badly, when she got older. It crippled her hands, poor woman. And my father… he had heart trouble, I believe. He died relatively young, actually, from a heart attack. And my sister… she had diabetes, but that was later in life. Other than that… not that I recall. We weren’t really a family that… talked about illnesses, you know? It wasn't considered polite. We just… dealt with things. And hoped for the best. So, I’m not entirely sure what ran in the family, to be honest. It's all a bit hazy. Perhaps my daughter would know better. She's always been very interested in genealogy, that girl. But me? Not so much.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and diabetes in your sister. That gives me a good starting point. Now, just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not! I have never touched a cigarette in my life, and my husband and I… well, we enjoyed a glass of sherry with dinner occasionally, but that was it. Very rarely, mind you. And recreational drugs? The very idea! I was raised properly, Doctor. We didn't partake in such… things. No, no, I assure you. I'm a perfectly respectable woman. This whole conversation is rather… unsettling, frankly. All these questions about illnesses and… habits. It's not how I envisioned my morning, I can tell you that.
DOCTOR: I understand. I apologize if the questions are a bit intrusive, but it’s important to get a complete picture of your health. And I appreciate your honesty. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to eat everything, and I still do, within reason, of course. I’m not one for fancy foods, mind you. Just good, wholesome cooking. And as for medications… I rarely take them, so I haven't had much opportunity to be allergic to anything. Honestly, I consider myself quite lucky. I’ve always been a healthy woman. Well, relatively healthy. A few aches and pains, but nothing serious. I think my mother’s good cooking is the secret. She always said a good diet was the key to a long life. And I suppose she was right. Still… this whole conversation is rather unnerving. I must admit.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know. No known allergies. Alright, Ellan, that gives me a good overall picture of your health history. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick examination of your joints to assess the discomfort you're experiencing. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. I haven’t had a proper physical in years. I always said I felt fine, and my doctor never insisted. But if you think it’s necessary… alright. Just be gentle, please. My joints are a bit sensitive, you know. And I don't like surprises. Explain everything before you do it, alright? I'm an old woman, Doctor. I get easily flustered. And please, no poking and prodding! Just a quick look, alright? I don't want to spend the whole day here.
DOCTOR: Of course, absolutely. I promise to be gentle and explain everything before I do it. It will be a quick exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. It just involves tightening this cuff around your arm for a moment. It will feel a bit snug, but shouldn’t be painful. Your blood pressure is 140 over 85. That’s a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. This will just help me check for any unusual sounds. Take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Alright… deep breath… and… again. It feels rather strange, you know? I haven't had anyone listen to my heart and lungs in years. Is everything alright? You’re awfully quiet. Don’t tell me there’s something wrong? I knew I shouldn’t have come here. My daughter is always exaggerating things. She probably thinks I’m on my deathbed! Honestly, she’s a worrier. Is everything alright, Doctor? Please tell me. Don’t keep me in suspense!
DOCTOR: Everything sounds good, Ellan. Your heart and lungs sound clear. There are no unusual sounds. It was just a routine check, and everything appears normal so far. Now, I'd like to take a quick look at your joints – your knees and hips specifically, as you mentioned discomfort there. I’ll just gently move them through their range of motion to see how they feel. Can you bend your knees for me, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s a bit uncomfortable, you know. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a stiffness. It’s worse in the mornings, you see. And after I’ve been sitting for a while. It feels… creaky. Like an old door that hasn’t been oiled in years. There… that’s better. But it doesn’t feel right, you know? It’s not as smooth as it used to be. My daughter keeps telling me it’s arthritis, but I don’t know. I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything. And frankly, I don't want to be labeled with something. It feels… depressing. Is it bad, Doctor? Be honest with me. Please don't sugarcoat anything. I can handle the truth. I’m an old woman, after all. I've lived a long life.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ellan. There is some mild tenderness and a slightly limited range of motion in both knees and hips. It doesn't feel like severe arthritis, but there is definitely some evidence of joint wear and tear, which is common with age and activity. Based on my examination, it appears you have some osteoarthritis, likely due to years of use and perhaps some minor inflammation. It’s not severe, but it's contributing to the discomfort and stiffness you're experiencing. This is quite common and manageable. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Osteo…arthritis. That sounds… serious. Is it going to get worse? Will I end up crippled like my mother? She couldn’t even hold a teacup in her later years. And will I need surgery? My neighbor had a knee replacement, and it sounded… dreadful. All that pain and recovery. Oh dear… This is not good, is it? I knew I shouldn’t have come here. My daughter is always making mountains out of molehills. Is there anything I can do about it? Besides… surgery, that is. I absolutely refuse to have surgery. There must be something else. Pain pills? Injections? What are my options, Doctor? Please tell me there’s something I can do. I don't want to end up like my mother. This is all very upsetting. Very upsetting indeed.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ellan. It’s natural to be worried, especially with your mother’s experience. However, it’s important to remember that everyone is different, and osteoarthritis progresses at different rates. It doesn't necessarily mean you’ll end up with the same outcome as your mother. Fortunately, there are several things we can do to manage your discomfort and slow down the progression of the arthritis without resorting to surgery. First, we can start with some conservative measures. This includes physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knees and hips, weight management if applicable, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen for occasional discomfort. We can also discuss some topical creams or gels to help with inflammation. If these measures aren't enough, we can consider corticosteroid injections to provide temporary relief. However, these are not a long-term solution. As for medical marijuana, that could be an option to help with pain and sleep disturbance. It's something we can discuss further. What are your thoughts on these options?
PATIENT: Well… physical therapy sounds dreadful. I’m not very athletic, you see. And I don’t think I have the stamina for all that exercise. And I’m already quite thin, so weight management is hardly an issue. As for pain pills… I don’t like taking medication, as I said. It makes me feel… sluggish. And injections sound… painful. So… that leaves the marijuana, doesn’t it? I still don’t approve, mind you. But if it’s the only option left… perhaps it’s worth considering. But I’m not sure… What exactly does it do? Will it make me… dizzy? Or forgetful? Or… addicted? My daughter keeps saying it’s harmless, but I don’t trust her. She reads too many articles on the internet, as I said. Honestly, it all sounds very… unconventional. Is it even legal? And what form does it take? Do I have to… smoke it? Because I absolutely refuse to smoke! Oh dear… This is all very confusing. And unsettling. Very unsettling indeed.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation and your concerns about the marijuana, Ellan. It’s perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about something unfamiliar. Let me address your concerns one by one. First, regarding the effects, medical marijuana comes in various forms, including pills, oils, edibles, and vaporizers. We wouldn't start with anything that involves smoking. Pills and oils are good options to avoid that. As for side effects, some people experience mild dizziness or drowsiness, but these are usually temporary and manageable. Addiction is rare with medical use, especially when used as directed under a doctor's supervision. Medical marijuana is legal here in [Clinic Location], but you do need a certification from a doctor to purchase it from a licensed dispensary. I can provide you with the certification if you're interested. We can start with a very low dose and gradually increase it if needed. It's all about finding the right balance that provides relief without causing unwanted side effects. We'll monitor you closely and adjust the dosage as necessary. Would you like to explore the possibility of medical marijuana certification further?
PATIENT: Well… a low dose, you say? And no smoking? And you’ll monitor me closely? And it's legal? Oh dear… alright. Alright, Doctor. I suppose… I suppose I’m willing to try. Just to get some relief from this discomfort. But if I feel any dizziness, or forgetfulness, or… anything untoward, I want to stop immediately. And I want you to be available to answer my questions. Lots of questions, I suspect. And what does this… certification entail? Do I have to fill out lots of paperwork? And what about the dispensary? Is it a reputable establishment? I don't want to end up in some shady back alley! Honestly, it all sounds very… complicated. But if it's the only option left… alright. Let's proceed. But slowly, Doctor. Very slowly. And with lots of reassurance. And lots of paperwork, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ellan. I’m glad you’re willing to explore this option. I understand your concerns, and I promise to guide you through the process every step of the way. The certification process is quite straightforward. I’ll just need to complete a short form documenting your medical history and your reasons for seeking medical marijuana. It’s mostly a formality to ensure you meet the criteria for certification. It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes. As for the dispensary, I can recommend a few reputable establishments in the area that I trust. They’re all licensed and regulated, so you don't have to worry about ending up in a shady place. They have trained professionals who can answer your questions and help you choose the right product. Let’s start with the form. We'll go through it together, and I'll answer any questions you have along the way. Don’t hesitate to ask anything, no matter how small it may seem. We’ll take it one step at a time, Ellan. And I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Now, let’s start with your date of birth…
PATIENT: .
