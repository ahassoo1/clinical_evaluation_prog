DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having a bit of trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s not easy, you see. Not easy at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, trouble with your waterworks… difficulty urinating. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it takes me a good while to start. And when I do start, it’s… weak. Not a strong stream, like it used to be. It’s been going on for… oh, I’d say maybe three weeks now? Hard to say exactly, time just slips away these days. And I feel like I don't empty everything, you know? Like there's still some left in there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Kandy. So, it’s taking longer to start, the stream is weaker than usual, and you don’t feel like you’re completely emptying your bladder. Has this been a gradual change over the three weeks, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. It didn't just happen one day. It was… a little slower each day, a little weaker. I didn't pay much attention at first, to be honest. Just figured it was… getting old. But then it started bothering me, having to go back again so soon. That’s when I thought maybe I should see a doctor. It’s just… inconvenient, you know? I like my routines.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Routines are important. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not a bit. No burning either. It's just… difficult. And like I said, not emptying completely. Sometimes I have to go back almost right away. It doesn’t hurt, just… frustrating. Is it something serious, Doctor? I do worry sometimes. My sister, God rest her soul, she had troubles with her kidneys…
DOCTOR: It's good to know there's no pain. And it’s understandable to be worried, especially with a family history. While it could be a number of things, Kandy, we need to investigate to find out what's going on. It could be something relatively simple, like an enlarged prostate – which is common as we age – or it could be something else. Before we go any further, let's go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, well. Let me think. I had a bit of high blood pressure, years ago. They put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. The doctor said I could, said it was under control with diet and exercise. And I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now. Other than that… nothing much. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I do have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension managed with diet and exercise, and a cholecystectomy twenty years ago. Medicare is good to know, thank you. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. It’s called… hmm, let me see… Aleve. Just when I need it, though. Not every day. And sometimes a little vitamin D in the winter, because it’s so dark here. Other than that, no. I try to stay away from pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Aleve as needed for arthritis and occasional vitamin D. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. I eat just about everything. I used to help my mother with the garden, and I was around all sorts of flowers and plants. Never bothered me a bit. I think I’m pretty lucky, all things considered. Although, I do get a bit of a sniffle when the dust is bad. But that’s just a seasonal thing, I think. Not a real allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, like I mentioned earlier, my sister had some trouble with her kidneys. She was on dialysis for a long time. And my father, he had diabetes. He lost a leg because of it. And my mother, she had… oh, what was it? Something with her heart, I think. She was pretty frail in her later years. It’s just… a lot of sickness in the family, if you think about it. It does worry me, sometimes. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Kandy. Knowing your family history helps us understand your risk factors. It sounds like there’s a history of kidney disease, diabetes, and heart problems. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked. My husband, God rest his soul, he tried it once or twice, but I wouldn't let him in the house! Always told him it was a terrible habit. I always said fresh air was the best medicine. I do enjoy a little wine with dinner sometimes, though. A glass or two. Nothing excessive. And I walk when the weather's nice. Not as much in the winter, of course, it gets too slippery. But I try to stay active. I like to keep busy. It keeps my mind sharp, you know?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. So, no smoking, occasional wine, and you try to stay active. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, you know? It's just… embarrassing, having to bother you with all this. But I figured it was best to get it checked out. Just do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: You're not bothering me at all, Kandy. It's my job to help. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll gently examine your abdomen. And finally, I’d like to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. We'll also do a digital rectal exam, which is a standard part of the exam for urinary problems in men and women. It allows me to feel the size and shape of your prostate and check for any abnormalities. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a rectal exam? Well. That is a bit… daunting. I haven’t had one of those in… well, ever. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, I understand you have to do what you have to do, but… is there another way? It just… feels very personal, you know? I’m an old woman, but… still.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Kandy. It is a sensitive exam, and I wouldn’t suggest it if it weren’t important. The digital rectal exam allows me to feel the size and shape of your prostate, which can give us clues about what’s causing your urinary symptoms. It also allows me to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. While it's not the most comfortable exam, it's quick, and I will explain everything as I go. We can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. It’s a standard part of evaluating urinary problems, and it’s often crucial for making an accurate diagnosis. However, if you are absolutely against it at this time, we can proceed without it, but it might limit our ability to determine the cause of your symptoms and may require additional testing. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well. That's... a lot to think about. If it really is important, and you say it helps with the diagnosis… I suppose I can grit my teeth and get it over with. But you have to promise to be very gentle, Doctor. And explain everything, like you said. I just… I don’t like surprises. And I don't want to feel rushed. It’s just… a little embarrassing, you know? Being an old woman and all. But if it helps, then I suppose I can do it. But gentle, please. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kandy. I promise to be very gentle and explain every step as I go. We will take our time, and I will be as respectful and discreet as possible. You can let me know at any time if you need to stop. First, I'll have you lie on your side with your knees bent. I’ll lubricate my gloved finger and gently insert it into your rectum to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It might cause a slight pressure sensation, but it shouldn't be painful. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright. I suppose so. Just… be quick about it, Doctor. And remember what I said… gentle. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kandy. Just relaxing your muscles as best as you can. This will only take a moment. I’m feeling your prostate now… it feels slightly enlarged, but smooth. There are no obvious nodules or tenderness. Okay, all done. That wasn’t so bad, was it?
PATIENT: Well. It wasn't pleasant, let's just say that. But it wasn't as terrible as I imagined, I suppose. Enlarged, you say? What does that mean? Is that why I can’t go properly? Is it something serious, Doctor? I do worry, you know. Old age is… not for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Kandy. An enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is very common as men age, and it can cause urinary symptoms like difficulty starting, weak stream, and incomplete emptying. It's rarely a sign of anything serious, like cancer, but it can be bothersome. Now, we need to confirm this with some additional tests. I'd like to order a urine analysis to check for infection or blood, and a prostate-specific antigen blood test to screen for prostate cancer. I'd also like to do a bladder scan to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Those tests… those sound sensible. Infection, cancer… better to be sure, I suppose. Bladder scan… is that painful? More… poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like a pincushion! But if it helps, then alright. Urine analysis, PSA test, bladder scan… just try to be gentle, if you can. And explain everything, like you’ve been doing. I do appreciate that. It helps to know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kandy. I understand your concerns, and I promise to be as gentle and informative as possible. The bladder scan is completely painless. It uses ultrasound waves to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. It doesn't involve any needles or poking. I’ll write the orders for the urine analysis, PSA test, and bladder scan now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Then, we’ll do the bladder scan right here in the examination room. It will only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, let’s talk about some things you can do at home to manage your symptoms. Do you drink a lot of fluids?
PATIENT: Okay. No needles, that's good. I do drink quite a bit, actually. I like my tea. And water, of course. Helps keep everything… flowing, I suppose. But maybe that’s the problem? Too much fluid? I always thought it was important to stay hydrated, especially in this heat. But maybe I should cut back a bit? Is that what you’re going to say, Doctor? Less tea? Oh dear. That's not good news at all.
DOCTOR: It’s a good point, Kandy. While staying hydrated is important, drinking too much fluid, especially before bedtime, can worsen urinary symptoms. It’s all about finding the right balance. I recommend limiting your fluid intake in the evening and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. We'll also look at your diet and medications. Do you consume anything with artificial sweeteners?
PATIENT: Artificial sweeteners… hmm. I do have a little diet soda sometimes, when I’m feeling fancy. And those little sugar-free candies, to keep my mouth busy. But not a lot, honestly. Mostly tea. And the occasional glass of wine with dinner. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and lean meat. My mother always said a good diet was the best medicine. But these candies… maybe they're the problem? Is that what you're thinking, Doctor? Are those little sugar-free things causing all this trouble? Oh dear, I do love my little candies.
DOCTOR: Artificial sweeteners can sometimes irritate the bladder and worsen urinary symptoms in some people, so it's worth trying to reduce your intake and see if that makes a difference. It’s good you mentioned the wine too. Alcohol can also be a bladder irritant. So, to summarize: we’ll get those tests done, and in the meantime, let’s try limiting fluids in the evening, reducing caffeine, alcohol, and artificial sweeteners, and see if your symptoms improve. Do you have any questions for me right now, Kandy?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a lot to remember. No tea in the evening, less wine, no little candies… it's going to be a sad life. But alright, I’ll try. For my health, I suppose. Hmm… let me think. Yes, I do have a question. If it is an enlarged prostate… what happens then? Is there a treatment? Do they… operate? It all sounds rather frightening, Doctor. I'm an old woman, I don't want to be undergoing surgery.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Kandy. If it is an enlarged prostate, there are several treatment options available. Many men can manage their symptoms with lifestyle changes, like the ones we discussed, and medications. Medications can help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, or reduce the size of the prostate. Surgery is usually reserved for more severe cases that don’t respond to other treatments. There are several different surgical procedures available, some are minimally invasive and require a shorter recovery time. We won't jump to any conclusions until we have the test results, and we’ll discuss all your options in detail if necessary. Right now, let’s focus on getting those tests done and see what they show. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Tests first, then talk about options. No rushing, that’s what I like to hear. You’re a good doctor, Doctor Bombara. You explain things very well. Alright. Let’s get these tests done. Where do we start? The nurse, you said? And what do I have to do for these tests? I do get a little nervous about these things, you know. Old age and all.
DOCTOR: You’re very kind, Kandy. I’m glad I could reassure you. The nurse will be in shortly to draw a blood sample for the PSA test. It’s a standard blood draw, just like at any other doctor’s appointment. She'll also give you a container to collect a urine sample. Just try to collect a sample mid-stream, and she'll explain how to do that properly. Then, we’ll do the bladder scan right here in the examination room. It's completely painless, I promise. It just involves a small device that we gently move over your abdomen. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Blood draw, urine sample, bladder scan… nothing too frightening, I suppose. Just a bit of a bother, that’s all. Alright. I'll just sit here and wait for the nurse, then. Thank you, Doctor Bombara. You've been very helpful. And patient, which is much appreciated. I do hope they don’t take too long. I have my tea time to think about, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Kandy. I'll let the nurse know you're ready when she arrives. And we'll try to make it as quick as possible. Just relax, and we’ll get through it together.
