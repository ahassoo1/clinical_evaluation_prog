DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Norval. Well, it’s like this... I just don’t seem to be able to eat much anymore. I get full awful quick, even if I haven't had a proper plateful. It’s been going on for a bit now, maybe a month or so. Not sure exactly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Norval. It’s good to meet you as well. I understand you've been experiencing a decreased appetite and feeling full quickly, even after eating only a small amount. You mentioned this has been occurring for about a month. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe a typical meal for me?
PATIENT: Hmm, a typical meal... Well, my wife, Elsie, does most of the cooking. She makes a lovely salmon chowder, usually. Or maybe some roasted chicken with potatoes and veggies. I used to enjoy a good-sized portion, you know? But now... I might have a couple of bites, and that's it. Just feel stuffed right away. It's strange. Even a little bit of toast feels like too much sometimes. I don't really crave much either, which isn't like me.
DOCTOR: I see. So, even with foods you previously enjoyed, like Elsie’s salmon chowder or roasted chicken, you’re finding it difficult to eat a satisfying amount, and you’re not experiencing the usual cravings. And this is affecting a variety of foods, even something simple like toast. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this decreased appetite and early fullness?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I’ve been a bit tired, I suppose. Not all the time, but some days I just feel… worn out. And Elsie says I’ve been a bit quiet, more than usual. I haven’t really been sick sick, no fever or anything. My stomach… sometimes it feels a little unsettled, but not painful, just… off. Hard to explain. Oh, and I’ve had a bit of heartburn now and then, but I get that sometimes anyway. I’m an old man, you know. Things ache.
DOCTOR: I understand, Norval. It sounds like you’re experiencing fatigue, increased quietness, occasional stomach discomfort, and some heartburn in addition to the decreased appetite and early fullness. It’s helpful to have a complete picture. You’re right, some aches and pains are common with age, but we want to investigate what might be causing these other symptoms. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Elsie’s been saying I’m looking a bit thinner, yes. I haven’t weighed myself, haven’t got one of those fancy scales. But my pants feel a bit looser, if that makes sense. I haven't been trying to lose weight, that's for sure. It’s just… happened, I guess. Not a lot, I don’t think, but enough for Elsie to notice. She worries.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you have experienced some unintentional weight loss, enough for Elsie to notice a change in your pants fit. That's definitely something we need to take into consideration. Now, thinking about your medical history, do you have any existing medical conditions that Elsie is aware of, or that you've been previously diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, let's see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be thirty years or more. And the doctor told me a while back my blood pressure was a little high, so I take a small pill for that every day. Nothing major, really. I’ve been pretty healthy for an old fella, I always thought. Elsie keeps track of the pills, she’s got a chart and everything. I couldn’t tell you the names of them, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Norval. You've had your gallbladder removed some time ago, and you're currently taking medication for high blood pressure. That’s helpful information. Elsie keeping track of the medications is excellent. And have you had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Nothing else that I recall. I broke my wrist when I was a young man, falling off a ladder while fixing the roof, but that just needed a cast. That was a long time ago. No other operations, as far as I know. Elsie would know for sure, she remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Norval. So, no surgeries aside from the gallbladder removal and the cast for your wrist many years ago. Now, thinking about your family... Is there anyone in your family who has experienced similar symptoms, such as difficulty eating, unexplained weight loss, or stomach problems?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother... she had some trouble with her digestion when she got older. Lots of stomach aches, she said. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had cancer, stomach cancer, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t know much about it. It wasn’t something we talked about much. Elsie might know more, she’s got a better memory for family history. She does a lot of genealogy, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Norval. It's helpful to know about your mother’s digestive issues and your uncle’s history of stomach cancer. That family history is something we’ll want to keep in mind. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… What does that mean exactly? Do you mean, like, what I do with my time? Well, I’m retired now. Used to be a… a communications worker, mostly writing and editing things for the local news. I mostly stay home now. Read a lot, watch some TV. I used to go fishing a lot, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. Elsie and I go to the community centre sometimes, for bingo and things like that. Not much excitement, but it keeps us busy. We have a few friends we see now and then. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Norval. That gives me a good picture of your daily life. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Elsie always checks when the doctor prescribes something, and she's never found anything. I eat most things. I’m not a fussy eater, never have been. Maybe a bit sensitive to shellfish sometimes, but that’s just a mild upset stomach, nothing serious. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Excellent, no known allergies. Now, just to confirm, you mentioned you take medication for high blood pressure. Do you know the dosage, or could Elsie perhaps tell us when she has a moment?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. I honestly have no idea. Elsie manages all that. She keeps a list, you know. I think it's a small white pill, but that doesn’t tell you much, does it? I’ll ask her when she gets back from the store. She’ll know exactly. I just take what she gives me, when she tells me to. I’m not much good with details like that.
DOCTOR: Understood, Norval. We can certainly obtain that information from Elsie later. Now, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking a few other things. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I've got nothing to hide. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual. I’m an old man, everything creaks a bit, you know? But I’ll tell you if something really bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. If you could just take a few deep breaths for me, that would be great. Your heart rate is a little slow, but that’s not necessarily a cause for concern given your age. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackling that I can detect at this time. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness or discomfort. Hmm... I'm noticing some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, on your right side. It's not severe, but it's worth noting. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit. Not sharp, more of a… dull ache. I’ve felt it off and on for a while now, to be honest. I just figured it was old age. But yes, that’s a bit tender. It doesn’t hurt all the time, just when you push on it. Elsie says I should see a doctor about it, and I suppose she was right. It’s something, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s good you brought that to my attention, Norval, and Elsie was right to encourage you to come in. The tenderness in your upper right abdomen warrants further investigation. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Your bowel sounds are present, though a bit quiet. Alright, Norval. Based on your symptoms and the physical examination, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The decreased appetite, early fullness, weight loss, and tenderness in your upper right abdomen are concerning. I'd like to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your abdomen to get a better look at what’s going on. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. The CT scan will allow us to visualize your liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and other organs in more detail. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests and a scan… yes, that sounds… thorough. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. Elsie would want me to get it checked out properly. Yes, go ahead with the tests and the scan. When can I get them done? And will they be… uncomfortable? I’m not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. They always smell funny.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Norval. Hospitals can be unsettling, and I’ll do everything I can to make this process as comfortable as possible for you. The blood tests can be done right here in the clinic today. It's just a simple blood draw, and it shouldn’t take long. As for the CT scan, we can schedule that at the imaging center across town. It’s a relatively quick scan, and you’ll just need to lie still for a few minutes. You may be asked to drink a contrast solution beforehand to help improve the image quality. It's not painful, but some people experience a slight metallic taste. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule the CT scan for you before you leave. She will also explain the process in more detail and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, I’m going to order some dietary recommendations to help manage your appetite and weight loss. I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day and focusing on nutrient-rich foods. I'll also suggest continuing to drink plenty of fluids. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Smaller meals and more fluids… yes, I think I can do that. Elsie's always telling me to eat healthier anyway. She's a good woman. Smaller meals… that sounds a lot easier than trying to force down a big plateful when I'm not hungry. And I suppose drinking more water wouldn't hurt. So, blood tests today, scan later… and I’ll see Sarah about scheduling the scan? Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a little, knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. It’s just… getting old isn’t easy, you know? Everything seems to be falling apart.
DOCTOR: I understand, Norval. Getting older certainly presents its challenges. It’s perfectly normal to feel concerned when things aren’t quite right. I want to assure you that we're here to support you every step of the way. We’ll work together to figure out what’s going on and develop a plan to help you feel your best. Sarah will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule your CT scan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me before Sarah arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. You've been very helpful, Doctor. And I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. But Elsie always says it’s best to know, whatever the news. Thank you again. I'll see Sarah when she's ready.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Norval. It was my pleasure. And you’re right, knowing what we’re dealing with is always the best course of action. I’ll be here to discuss the results with you as soon as they’re available. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. .
PATIENT: .
