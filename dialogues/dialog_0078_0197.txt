DOCTOR: Good morning, San Sciarotta. It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me San. I’m here for… let’s see… a card. A driving card, for ride-sharing. You know, like for Uber or… those other services. I need to be able to drive people around, legally. Is that what you need to do here? It’s all a bit confusing, honestly. I just want to make sure I have the right paperwork.
DOCTOR: Yes, San, I understand. Many patients come to us for medical clearances required for commercial driving, including ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft. It can be confusing. We'll make sure you have everything you need. To get started, I’ll need to gather some information about your health history and perform a brief physical exam to ensure you meet the necessary medical standards. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need. I try to keep pretty healthy, but… well, I'm seventy, you know? Things start to creak a little. I mostly just want to be sure I’m safe driving, and that everyone else is too. Go ahead, ask whatever you need to.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, San. Your awareness of your health is excellent. Let's begin with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else that requires ongoing medical care?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure, yes, a few years back. But the doctor got it under control with medication. I take a small pill every morning. And… oh! My knees. Arthritis, pretty bad in the winter. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, but they ache. Other than that… no, I don't think so. I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, but I recovered fully. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a great start, San. Thank you. So, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and arthritis in your knees. Could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, if you happen to know it?
PATIENT: Let me see… Here it is. Lisinopril. That’s it, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for… oh, goodness, maybe five years now? It seems to keep things stable, the doctor says.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril, ten milligrams daily. And do you experience any side effects from the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Not really. Sometimes a little bit of a cough, but it’s not too bad. It goes away pretty quickly. And… oh! My ankles swell up a little sometimes, if I’m on my feet all day. But honestly, I don’t stand for very long, so it’s not a big problem. It's nothing serious, I don't think. Is that what you were asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, San. The cough and occasional ankle swelling. Those can sometimes be related to the Lisinopril. Now, regarding your knees – how would you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Well, it's a dull ache, mostly. Worse in the cold weather, like I said. It gets stiff, you know? It takes a while to get moving in the morning. I can still walk, and I do, quite a bit actually. I walk the dog every day. But it’s not like it used to be. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for it, if it’s really bothering me. It’s just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re managing it well, San, and staying active is fantastic. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia we discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No surgeries, not ever. Just the usual things, you know? Flu shots, that sort of thing. As for hospitalizations… well, I was in the hospital when I had my son, many years ago. But that was a normal delivery, nothing complicated. And… oh! I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago. I healed up just fine. That’s all I can think of, really. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, hospitalization for childbirth and a broken wrist many years ago. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. My mother had… heart trouble, I think. She passed away when I was quite young. And my father had diabetes, but he didn’t take care of himself very well. He smoked, you know? A lot. I have a brother, he’s still alive, and he has high cholesterol, I think. But that’s about all I know. We weren’t a very close family, if I’m honest. Is that enough information? I don’t remember much about their health, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, San. It's common to not have a complete family history. Knowing what you do know is very helpful. So, a history of heart trouble in your mother, diabetes in your father, and high cholesterol in your brother. Now, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. Not a heavy drinker, I assure you. Just one or two glasses. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, San, that’s not a problem at all. One or two glasses of wine with dinner is perfectly acceptable. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. And I've never had a bad reaction to any medication. I did get stung by a bee once when I was a little girl, but that was just a local reaction. It swelled up a bit, but it went away quickly. I think I'm pretty lucky, health-wise, all things considered. Though I do creak a bit these days, as I said.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, San. It sounds like you’ve lived a very healthy life, and I appreciate you sharing all of this information with me. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to get a more complete picture of your health. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your knees. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Could you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little uncomfortable. It’s always a bit stiff, you know? It clicks a little when I bend them. And… yes, there’s some swelling on the right knee, I can feel it. It’s worse on cold days. Is that bad? I told you I creak a bit!
DOCTOR: Yes, I can feel some swelling on the right knee, and there is some crepitus – that clicking sound you mentioned – which is common with arthritis. Your range of motion is slightly limited, but not severely. It doesn't appear to be acutely inflamed. Alright, San. Based on the information you’ve provided and the brief physical exam, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you have some mild arthritis in your knees, particularly the right one. You are otherwise in good health, based on this initial assessment. To proceed with the medical clearance for ride-sharing, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests to assess your overall health and ensure there are no underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood tests are fine. I don’t mind at all. It’s good to be thorough, you know? Just tell me what I need to do. Do I need to fast before the tests? And where do I go? I don't want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Yes, I agree – it’s best to be thorough. We’ll need a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. You will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw – meaning no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. The lab is right across the hall, room 203. The lab technician will explain the process to you when you get there. They’ll just need a small sample of blood. Once the results are back – usually within a few business days – we can review them and determine if you meet the medical requirements for the ride-sharing clearance. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all pretty clear. Fast for eight hours, go to room 203… and wait for the results. That’s good. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It makes me feel much better. I guess… that’s all for now, then? I can go to the lab? Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now, San. You can head over to the lab whenever you're ready. The results will be sent directly to me, and my office will contact you once they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, San. Have a good day, and please be careful on your way to the lab.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. You’ve been very helpful. I will. And you have a good day too.
