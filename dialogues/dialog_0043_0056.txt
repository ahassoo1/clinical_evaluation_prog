DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Schlatterer, yes. It’s… well, frankly, I haven’t much time for this. A waste of a perfectly good morning, if you ask me. But my… someone insisted I come. Something about… stress. Burnout, they said. Honestly, I’ve been a teacher for… a very long time. It’s just… work.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like someone is concerned about you, and it’s good you’re here. Even a brief conversation can be helpful. When you say “work,” could you elaborate a little on what aspects of your teaching are causing you the most difficulty currently?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Honestly, the students. They simply don't appreciate… rigor anymore. And the administration… paperwork, endless paperwork! It’s all… fluff. Not serious scholarship. I used to run a very tight ship, proper Latin grammar, meticulous research… now it’s all group projects and “feelings.” It’s… degrading. I’ve been teaching library science, you know. Proper cataloging is an art form! It’s all gone to pot, I tell you.
DOCTOR: It sounds as though you’re experiencing a significant amount of frustration with changes at your workplace, Mr. Schlatterer. And that the standards you’ve always valued aren’t being upheld as you see fit. That can certainly be a source of stress. Beyond the changes at work, have you noticed any physical symptoms accompanying these feelings – perhaps changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Well, I… sleep is… adequate. Though I do wake up rather early. And my appetite… it comes and goes. I haven’t been enjoying my meals as much lately. The cook at the senior center isn't what she used to be, frankly. Everything is rather bland. But I suppose that's just old age. I wouldn't necessarily call it a symptom. It's just… things aren’t as good as they were. Is that what you’re asking? Honestly, Doctor, I don't see what this has to do with anything.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Schlatterer. It's helpful to get a complete picture. Changes in appetite, even if attributed to external factors, can sometimes be indicative of underlying stress or other issues. And waking early, while not necessarily problematic in itself, can be a sign of disrupted sleep patterns. Let's explore this a bit further. Have you noticed any feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or a loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Hopelessness? Doctor, I’ve seen two world wars and the fall of communism. Hopelessness is a luxury I can’t afford. As for enjoying things… well, my library is meticulously organized, thank you very much. That’s quite enjoyable. I used to enjoy a good debate, but nobody understands proper rhetoric anymore. It’s all… sound bites and social media. Honestly, Doctor, this is getting rather tedious. Are we almost finished? I have a very important cataloging project I need to attend to.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer, and I respect your perspective. It sounds as though you find a great deal of fulfillment in your work, particularly in maintaining order and precision. Given your history and current presentation, and considering the concerns that prompted this visit, I'd like to briefly review your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, Doctor, I’m eighty-seven years old! I’ve had the usual aches and pains. A touch of arthritis, nothing serious. I saw a doctor occasionally, when it was absolutely necessary. But I’ve always prided myself on my constitution. I’ve never been one to complain. And I certainly don’t need a list of ailments read back to me. It's all rather… undignified. Is this going to take much longer? I really must be going. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It seems you are quite healthy for your age, and I respect your desire to maintain your independence. Given the concerns expressed by those who brought you in, and based on our conversation, it appears you're experiencing significant stress related to changes at work and perhaps some mild disruption in appetite. While you report being generally healthy, it's important to address these stressors to prevent them from impacting your well-being. I'm not detecting any immediate medical emergencies. However, I would recommend a few things. First, perhaps exploring some relaxation techniques—simple deep breathing exercises or mindfulness—could be helpful. Second, ensuring you have a supportive social network is crucial. And third, if these feelings of frustration and stress persist or worsen, I would encourage you to consider speaking with a therapist. I can provide you with some referrals if you're interested. Would you like me to write down those recommendations for you?
