DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my coloring, I suppose. It’s gotten quite yellow, and someone suggested I come see a doctor about it. It’s rather bothersome, and I’d like to get it sorted out if possible. It feels… urgent, somehow.
DOCTOR: “Urgent,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, urgent. Not that I recall why exactly, but the feeling is… persistent. It’s not a comfortable sensation, and frankly, I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately. Is yellowing a bad thing? I apologize, I don’t remember much these days.
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, with all due respect, “not feeling yourself” is rather vague. Yellowing of the skin – which, I presume, is what you’re referring to – can indicate a number of things, none of which are particularly pleasant. Let’s start with a proper history. When did you first notice this… coloring?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A proper history… well. That’s difficult. It feels like… weeks, perhaps? Months? It’s all a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. I truly can’t pinpoint an exact date. I do recall feeling more tired than usual around that time, but that could be anything, couldn’t it? Is it terribly serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, “around that time” is not helpful. We need specifics. Fatigue is, as you say, ubiquitous. Now, has this yellowing – and please, try to be precise – is it all over, or in specific areas?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Precise… let me see. It seems to be mostly in my skin, yes. And… my eyes, perhaps? I believe my daughter mentioned my eyes looking a bit… off-color. It’s not all over, no. More… noticeable in my face, and hands, I think. I apologize for being so unhelpful. It's simply difficult to recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes in… Well, that’s a rather personal question, isn’t it? I… I suppose it’s a little paler than usual. Yes. Though, honestly, I don’t pay much attention to such things. I eat, it… goes through. Is that relevant, Doctor? It feels rather indelicate to discuss.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Durig. Everything is relevant. Now, any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Abdominal… A little, perhaps. A dull ache, mostly. It comes and goes, and I assumed it was just… old age, you know? Things ache when you get to be my age. It’s not a sharp pain, if that makes any difference. More of a… discomfort. Is this all sounding terribly alarming, Doctor? I do hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, I need you to understand that I cannot offer assurances without a thorough examination. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history… That’s… difficult. I’ve seen doctors, of course, over the years. But what I’ve been diagnosed with… that’s a good question. I believe… something with the liver, perhaps? Years ago. My daughter used to handle all those things. She said something about… hepatitis? But it was a long time ago, and I don't recall the details. It was treated, I think. I truly am very sorry I can’t be of more assistance. It's all so foggy.
DOCTOR: Hepatitis… Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, medications… Let me see… just this one, I believe. A small, white pill. My doctor prescribed it for… well, I can’t recall what for, precisely. Something for my… nerves, perhaps? It doesn't seem to be doing much good, if I'm honest. I take it every evening, religiously. It’s a habit, more than anything at this point. Is that all the questions you have, Doctor? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with abdominal palpation. And Ms. Durig, please try to remain still. I need to assess the size and tenderness of your liver and spleen.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Abdominal… palpation? Is that going to be… uncomfortable, Doctor? Oh, dear. That is a bit tender, isn’t it? Especially… right here. It feels… swollen, somehow. I hope it’s nothing too serious. It’s rather difficult to lie still, you know. My bones ache.
DOCTOR: I detect mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, with slight hepatomegaly. No rebound tenderness noted. Bowel sounds are present, though somewhat diminished. Percussion reveals some dullness in the right upper quadrant. Alright, Ms. Durig, that's sufficient for now. Let's examine your sclera. Yes… definite jaundice noted. Sclera are markedly yellow. Skin also exhibits a yellowish hue.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That sounds… ominous, Doctor. Ominous. Is it… is it serious? You're making notes, and… and you used the word "marked." It doesn't sound good, does it? I truly hoped it was just a little tiredness. Is there anything you can do about it? I'm rather frightened, you know. My daughter always said I was a hypochondriac, but this feels… different. What do you think it is, Doctor? Please, tell me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, based on my examination, your symptoms and history – though admittedly incomplete – are suggestive of possible cholestasis. Given the reported history of hepatitis and the presence of jaundice, hepatomegaly, and changes in stool color, further investigation is absolutely necessary. I am ordering a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a liver function test. We also need to perform an abdominal ultrasound to assess the structure of your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. I will also need a stool sample to rule out any obstruction. Until we have the results of these tests, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis. However, it is imperative that you follow up with a gastroenterologist as soon as possible. I will provide you with a referral. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Chol… cholestasis? Gastroenterologist? It’s all so many words… I don’t… I don’t think I understand. Tests and specialists… it’s rather overwhelming. My daughter… she would have known what to do. She handled all of this. Are you saying… it could be serious? Is it… is it something I caught? I haven’t been anywhere… not recently. I just want to feel better, Doctor. Is there anything… anything at all… I can do in the meantime? I think… I think I need to sit down. This is all a bit much. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, I have explained the necessary steps. Avoid alcohol, maintain a healthy diet – though, frankly, at your age, what difference it makes is debatable – and schedule your appointments immediately. And please, try to recall any other relevant medical history; it would greatly assist in your care. The nurse will assist you with scheduling and provide further instructions. I have other patients waiting. .
