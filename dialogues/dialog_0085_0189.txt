DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Lahn, you say? Sounds…foreign. Anyway, it’s this business with the, well, the toilet. Been seeing some red in there, and frankly, a man my age doesn’t need that kind of worry. Not a pleasant sight, I’ll tell you.
DOCTOR: I understand. Seeing blood can certainly be concerning, especially as you said, at any age. "Foreign" is quite alright, Arbie – my family has roots in Mongolia. But let’s focus on what's going on with you. When you say "red in there," could you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a cut, you understand. Not bright red, gushing. It’s…streaked. Like someone took a brush and just dabbed a little paint in there. And it’s not every time, mind you. A few times this past week. I mostly eat… well, I eat what my daughter brings over. She worries too much, always trying to get me to eat more fiber. Honestly, at my age, a man should be allowed to eat what he wants.
DOCTOR: I understand. Streaked, not a large amount, and happening a few times this week. And it sounds like your diet is pretty consistent with what your daughter provides. Fiber is good, but you’re right, you should be comfortable with what you eat. To get a better understanding, can you tell me if you’ve noticed any pain or discomfort with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not exactly pain. It’s… a bit of a strain, sometimes. Getting things moving isn't as easy as it used to be, if you catch my drift. But not pain. Just… effort. And a bit of a mess, frankly. A man shouldn’t have to deal with this sort of thing. My father never had these problems, and he lived to be 92.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no sharp pain, but some straining and difficulty with bowel movements. That’s helpful to know. And it’s understandable to compare to your father’s experience. Now, have you noticed any changes in your stool consistency besides the blood?
PATIENT: Consistency? What do you mean? It's… well, it's stool, alright? Sometimes it’s a bit hard, sometimes a bit…softer. It varies, like the weather. I don’t sit around analyzing it, if that’s what you’re asking. A man’s got better things to do than inspect his… output. Honestly, this whole conversation is a bit ridiculous.
DOCTOR: You're right, it can feel a bit awkward discussing these things, and I appreciate you being open with me. It's important for me to ask these questions to get a complete picture. So, to clarify, it does vary between harder and softer stools. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well, now that you mention it… my daughter keeps saying I’m getting too thin. But I haven't been trying to lose weight. Haven't changed my habits. Just… not as much appetite lately, I suppose. Everything tastes a bit…bland. And she keeps bringing over these tasteless salads. Honestly, a man needs a good steak now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite and some unintentional weight loss. And a preference for a good steak, I hear you! Now, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain at all?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? No. Not really. Sometimes a bit of a rumble, you know? Old man’s stomach. But no pain. Vomiting? Goodness no. A man doesn’t vomit unless he’s really sick, and I haven’t been sick. Now, are you going to poke around in there? Because I’m not keen on that.
DOCTOR: No, I haven’t forgotten that you’re not keen on poking around, Arbie. We’ll take things at your pace. I was just trying to rule out some other possibilities. Given what you've told me – the blood in the stool, the straining, the changes in stool consistency, decreased appetite, and some unintentional weight loss – it would be best to do a quick physical exam. It'll mainly involve listening to your abdomen and a brief external exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Listening? That's... acceptable. I still don't like the idea of a thorough examination. But listening, I suppose. As long as you're not going to start prodding. And don't expect me to take my trousers all the way down. Just… listen to the belly, alright? A man has his dignity, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Arbie. Your dignity is very important, and I will be as quick and respectful as possible. I just need to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please lie down on the examination table when you're ready. Alright, I’m just going to listen in a few different spots. It won't take long. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. I also note some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen upon gentle palpation, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Okay, everything seems relatively normal, but the diminished bowel sounds and some mild tenderness warrant further investigation. Given your age and the presence of blood in the stool, I recommend a stool test to check for any bleeding or infection. We should also consider a colonoscopy to visualize the colon and rule out any polyps or other abnormalities.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Now you're talking! That sounds… unpleasant. Is it absolutely necessary? I’d rather not have anything poked around in there if you can avoid it. I’m an old man, you know. I’ve lived a long life. And frankly, all this fuss over a little bit of red in the toilet seems… excessive.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Arbie. A colonoscopy doesn’t sound pleasant, and it’s reasonable to question if it's necessary. However, given your age, the blood in your stool, and the other symptoms you've described, it’s the safest way to rule out any serious underlying conditions, such as colon cancer. It’s important to remember that early detection is key with colon cancer, and it's often very treatable when found early. We can discuss the preparation process and what to expect beforehand to make it as comfortable as possible. Alternatively, we could start with a fecal immunochemical test – it’s a less invasive stool test that checks for hidden blood. If that comes back positive, then a colonoscopy would still be recommended. Would you be more comfortable starting with the FIT test?
PATIENT: A… FIT test? Less poking, you say? Alright, that sounds… acceptable. I’ll try that first. But don’t expect me to enjoy collecting samples. A man’s got his pride, you know. And if that test leads to the other one… well, I’m holding you personally responsible.
DOCTOR: I understand, Arbie. No enjoyment is expected! We’ll make it as easy and discreet as possible. The FIT test is a simple stool sample you can collect at home. We’ll provide you with clear instructions and a kit. I will personally follow up with you to discuss the results and what the next steps are. And I assure you, we'll only proceed with a colonoscopy if it’s absolutely necessary and in your best interest. Let me write you a requisition for the FIT test and provide you with the collection kit and instructions. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. That gives a man some time to prepare himself. And make sure your daughter doesn’t find out. She’ll fuss over me if she knows I’m having tests done. She already thinks I’m too thin. Just write up the paperwork and get this over with. And please, no lectures about fiber.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no lectures about fiber, I promise. I’ll make a note of your daughter's potential fussiness. Here’s the requisition for the FIT test, the collection kit, and these are detailed instructions on how to complete the sample and where to drop it off. I’ve scheduled a follow-up appointment for you on August 16th at 10:00 AM. We'll review the results then. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Arbie?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just… try not to poke around too much if I do have to come back for that other test. A man deserves some peace and quiet in his old age. And tell your daughter to lay off the salads. Right then. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Arbie. I’ll do my best to ensure your comfort if a colonoscopy is needed. And I'll pass along your message about the salads—though I suspect she won't heed it! Thank you for coming in today. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Arbie.
