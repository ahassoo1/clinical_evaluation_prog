DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Paes. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s nice to meet you too. I’ve just been feeling…off, lately. Mostly really tired, and my skin seems to be getting darker. It’s hard to explain, but it's not like a sunburn or anything. It's just…changed color, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, "feeling off" and a change in skin color. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: It’s just…all the time, really. Even after a full night’s sleep, I wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all. And it’s not just physical, you know? Like, I have trouble focusing, and I feel…down, sometimes. Not really sad, just…blah. It's been going on for a few months now, I'd say. Maybe three or four? I don't keep very good track, honestly.
DOCTOR: Three or four months… alright. And this “blah” feeling, does anything seem to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really, I don't think. It’s pretty consistent. Maybe it’s a little worse when I’m really busy at work, but honestly, work is always busy. It's a chemical plant, you know? There’s always something needing attention. I don’t really have hobbies or anything that make it better, so… it’s just always there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A consistent feeling, even with activity… Okay. And about this skin change – can you show me where you’ve noticed it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s mostly on my arms and face, I think. And… maybe my chest a little? It's hard to see, but I noticed it when I was putting on sunscreen the other day. It's not patchy or anything, just…overall darker. Do you see it? It’s probably not very noticeable.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a slight hyperpigmentation. It's subtle, but definitely present. Alright. Now, let’s go through some other questions, just to get a full picture. Do you have any other symptoms – things like changes in your appetite, weight loss or gain, or any unusual bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, not really. My appetite is normal, I think. I haven't lost or gained any weight, at least not that I’ve noticed. And everything’s… regular, you know? With the…bowel habits. Is this something serious, Doctor? I've been worrying about it a lot lately.
DOCTOR: It's good that your appetite and bowel habits are normal. We're just trying to rule things out, Ms. Paes. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, have you noticed any problems with your memory or concentration, beyond the trouble focusing you mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been forgetting things more lately. Little things, mostly. Like, where I put my keys, or what I was going to buy at the store. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely more frequent than it used to be. And sometimes… sometimes I have trouble finding the right words, like they're on the tip of my tongue but I just can't get them out. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. That's helpful to know. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't really been to the doctor much over the years. Just for check-ups, really. And those were always fine. I do take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, because my sister told me I might be low on it. But that's about it. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything, if that makes sense. My mother had some heart trouble when she was older, but that’s the only thing I can think of.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major medical conditions, just the vitamin D. And your mother had heart trouble… good to know. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, take any medication they give me. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. I've never had to worry about carrying an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. Now, Ms. Paes, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your skin a little more closely. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90… a little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Lungs sound clear, heart sounds regular, but slightly fast. Now, let me take a closer look at your skin. The hyperpigmentation is more pronounced than I initially thought, and there is some subtle thickening. I'm also noting some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you experience any pain or discomfort in your ankles?
PATIENT: No, not really. They just feel…a little puffy sometimes, I guess. I hadn't really noticed it until you pointed it out. I thought it was just from standing on my feet all day at work. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Paes, based on your symptoms – the fatigue, hyperpigmentation, ankle swelling, slightly elevated blood pressure, and difficulty with memory – there are a few possibilities. One that comes to mind is Addison’s disease, also known as adrenal insufficiency. It's relatively rare, but it fits the clinical picture. However, it’s important to remember this is just a preliminary assessment. To confirm or rule out this diagnosis, we need to run some blood tests. We’ll check your cortisol levels, electrolyte balance, and thyroid function. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Addison’s disease? I’ve never even heard of that. Is it…bad? What happens if it is that? Yes, of course, I'll do the blood tests. Whatever it takes to find out what's wrong. But… what does it mean?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Paes. Addison’s disease happens when your adrenal glands don’t produce enough cortisol. Cortisol is essential for many bodily functions. If left untreated, it can cause weakness, fatigue, weight loss, and other serious complications. However, it is manageable with medication. We would prescribe cortisol replacement therapy. The blood tests will give us a definitive answer. I’m going to order those now, and the lab technician will draw the samples. They’ll need about two vials. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend you stay hydrated and try to get as much rest as possible. Here’s the form for the lab. They are located just down the hall. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Okay… cortisol replacement therapy. That sounds…complicated. So, it's not necessarily a death sentence? And staying hydrated and resting… that sounds manageable. No, I don’t think so. Just… I’m a little overwhelmed, honestly. It’s a lot to take in. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. I'll go get the blood tests done right away.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, Ms. Paes. It’s a lot of information. And no, it’s definitely not a death sentence. With proper treatment, most people with Addison’s disease live full and active lives. I want to reassure you we'll work through this together, step by step. If you have any questions or concerns at all, don't hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Take care, Ms. Paes.
