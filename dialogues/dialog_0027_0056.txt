DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Or… is it Erle?
PATIENT: Yes, Erle is quite sufficient, Doctor… Fazzina, is it? Honestly, all these appointments… it’s all a bit of a blur these days. Let's get this over with, shall we? I have papers to grade, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Schlatterer. Fazzina is fine. Papers to grade… I understand. Time is precious. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, frankly, it's this… job. This teaching, this… library business. It's simply exhausting. All these… young people, not reading properly, not appreciating the classics. It’s… draining. I suppose you'd call it stress. Though, in my day, we just got on with it. But my… associate suggested I come. A waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Stress… yes, I see. It can manifest in many ways. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms along with this feeling of being drained, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Goodness. Let me think. My back aches, certainly. Always has. Old war wound, you know. And I… I do seem to be rather tired all the time. But that’s just age, isn’t it? I wouldn't bother you with trivialities. Really, I just need someone to tell me to… toughen up.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound trivial at all, Mr. Schlatterer. Back pain and fatigue… those can be connected to a number of things. Even if it is just age, it's worth checking. Do you notice the back pain at certain times of day, or with specific activities?
PATIENT: Specific activities? Heavens, yes. Grading papers, mostly. Sitting for long periods. Though, standing is no better. Honestly, it’s just… back pain. Like an old friend, unfortunately. And the fatigue… it’s constant. I used to be able to work all night, fueled by coffee and a love of knowledge. Now? I’m in bed by nine. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I see. Constant back pain and fatigue… and it’s impacting your sleep. Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better understanding of what we're dealing with. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure it will accomplish much. I assure you, I'm perfectly… functional. But, if you insist. Just get it over with quickly, please. I have a syllabus to revise.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. I'll be as quick as possible. If you could just lie down on the table, please. We'll start with your back. Now, if you could tell me where exactly does it hurt the most?
PATIENT: It’s… everywhere, really. But, if I had to pinpoint it… it's right along the spine, lower back. And it radiates. Down the legs, sometimes. A dull ache, mostly. Not sharp. It’s been like this for years, as I said. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect it's just… old age catching up.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m feeling some tenderness along your spine here, yes. And you mentioned the pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Not constantly, mind you. Just… occasionally. Especially after a long day of… student papers. Though, I suspect they’re just exaggerating the discomfort with their atrocious writing. It’s a distraction, I tell you! A deliberate attempt to… never mind. The pain radiates. Down the back of the legs, mostly. It’s… irritating.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Can you stand up slowly for me, please?
PATIENT: There. See? It’s… uncomfortable. I told you. It's just age. And bad students. A combination of the two, I suspect. Now, can we please move this along? I have deadlines, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see. I’m going to have you sit back down for a moment. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Do you usually monitor your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: Elevated? Goodness. No, I do not. I find all these… machines unnecessary. In my day, we relied on a good pulse and a strong constitution. I've never bothered with such things. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect it’s the stress. All these… demands. Students, administration, the endless stream of… mediocrity. It’s enough to raise anyone’s blood pressure.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It could be stress, but elevated blood pressure is something we should look into. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any other potential causes, and an X-ray of your lower back to get a clearer picture of what's going on there. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? X-rays? Really, Doctor? It seems… excessive. But… fine. If you insist. Though, I assure you, it will reveal nothing. Just… old age. But, do get it over with quickly, please. I have a syllabus to revise, and frankly, this is taking up valuable time. Just… send me the bill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I'll have the lab draw the blood now, and we can schedule the X-ray for tomorrow. It shouldn’t take long. In the meantime, I recommend trying some gentle stretching exercises for your back, and perhaps a warm compress to ease the pain. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully find a way to make you more comfortable. .
PATIENT: Very well. Stretching, you say? I suppose it can't hurt. Though I doubt it will help. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not expecting miracles. Just… get it over with. And please, send me the bill. I have papers to grade. .
