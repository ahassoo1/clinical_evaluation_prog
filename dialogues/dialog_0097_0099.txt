DOCTOR: Hi Denis, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor Georgiou. Well, it concerns a test I had done recently… a GI endoscopy. The results came back… not quite right, they said. That is what prompted me to schedule this visit. It has me a bit worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's always unsettling when test results are unclear or don't seem quite right. It's good you came in to discuss them. So, you had a GI endoscopy... and what exactly did the report say, as best as you understand it?
PATIENT: Well… the technician, a very nice young man, explained some things, but I confess, medical language isn't my strongest suit. He mentioned… inflammation, I believe? And something about… a small area that needed further attention. He used terms like “biopsy” and “follow-up”, but the specifics… they weren't terribly clear. He said the doctor would explain it better, of course. I just remember feeling a little… anxious afterwards. It wasn’t a comfortable procedure, you see. And knowing something wasn’t right… it’s concerning.
DOCTOR: Absolutely understandable. Inflammation is a common finding, and biopsies are often done to get a clearer picture of what’s causing it. It’s good we’re talking through this. Just to be clear, do you happen to have a copy of the report with you, or do you know where it was sent?
PATIENT: Yes, thankfully, the clinic was kind enough to provide me with a copy. I always like to have something in writing, if you don't mind. It helps me process things better, you see. My memory is quite good, but written details… they are reassuring. I believe everything is in there, including the technician's notes.
DOCTOR: Excellent, thank you. This is very helpful. Okay, I see here the endoscopy was performed on July 15th… and yes, the technician did note some mild inflammation in the antrum of the stomach, and a small polyp was identified. They took biopsies from both areas. The report does say "pending pathology results". So, we're still waiting on the official results from the lab to determine exactly what’s going on. Now, let’s talk a bit more about you. Have you been experiencing any symptoms – anything at all – that prompted you to get the endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Yes, that is good to know about the pathology results. I was hoping to hear something definitive today, but waiting is understandable, I suppose. As for symptoms… well, for several months, I have been having some… discomfort in my stomach. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… burning sensation, and a feeling of fullness very quickly after eating. I also find myself… a bit tired lately, although I attributed that to my age, to be honest. And… occasionally, some nausea, particularly after meals. It hasn’t been severe, but noticeable. I thought it might be something simple, perhaps a bit of indigestion. But then my doctor suggested the endoscopy, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning sensation, early fullness, fatigue, and occasional nausea after meals... that gives us a good starting point. And how long would you say you've been experiencing these symptoms, overall?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I believe it started… around November, perhaps? It was very mild at first, easily dismissed. It gradually worsened over the winter months, becoming more persistent. So, about eight or nine months now, I would say. It fluctuates, of course. Some days are better than others. But it hasn’t truly gone away completely. It’s been a constant companion, if you will. A rather unwelcome one, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Eight to nine months… alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this – anything related to your digestive system or otherwise?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, I have noticed a slight change in my… stool, if you don’t mind me saying. It's been… darker than usual, on occasion. Not black, mind you, just… a deeper shade of brown. And sometimes… a bit loose. It hasn't been a major issue, thankfully, but noticeable. And… I’ve lost a little bit of weight, perhaps five or six pounds, over the last few months. I hadn’t paid much attention to it initially, as I’ve never been one for a large appetite, but it is something I’ve observed. I’m not actively trying to lose weight, if that’s what you’re thinking. It’s just… gone, slowly, over time.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker stools, some looseness, and unintentional weight loss… That’s helpful information. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My medical history is… relatively uneventful, thankfully. I’ve always been quite healthy, for the most part. As a child, I had the usual illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, perhaps ten years old. And… several years ago, I was diagnosed with mild hypertension, high blood pressure. It’s been well-controlled with medication for many years now. Otherwise… no major surgeries, no chronic illnesses. My late husband, God rest his soul, had some heart trouble, but that was his issue, not mine. I’ve always tried to eat a healthy diet and stay active, as much as my age allows. I do enjoy a good walk in the garden, when the weather permits.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood illnesses, appendectomy, and well-controlled hypertension. That’s good to know. And what medications are you currently taking, specifically for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… I take Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once daily. And Hydrochlorothiazide, 25 milligrams, also once daily. I have been taking these medications for approximately five years now, and they seem to be doing their job quite well. My doctor monitors my blood pressure regularly, and it’s always within a normal range. I take them every morning, with a glass of water, as instructed. I'm quite diligent about my medications, as I understand their importance. I also take a daily multivitamin, but that’s just for general health, not a prescribed medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide, both once daily. Good. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else, as far as you know?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I do not have any known allergies. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I’ve never experienced an allergic reaction to any medication, food, or environmental factor, as far as I can recall. I’ve eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, and never had any issues. I've been stung by a bee once, as a child, but only experienced localized swelling, not a severe reaction. So, no, I don't have any known allergies. I'm quite grateful for that, as allergies can be quite troublesome.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let’s briefly talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as cancer, heart disease, or digestive problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had some heart trouble in her later years, similar to my late husband. She passed away from heart failure, I believe. And my grandfather, on my father’s side… he had stomach cancer, many years ago. It was quite aggressive, I recall my father telling me. And… my aunt, my mother’s sister, she had some digestive problems, irritable bowel syndrome, I believe. She suffered with it for many years. Otherwise… not many other significant medical conditions that I can recall. My father lived to a good age, quite healthy for the most part. And my siblings are all relatively healthy as well, thankfully. So, heart trouble, stomach cancer, and some irritable bowel syndrome… those are the main things that come to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble, stomach cancer, and irritable bowel syndrome. That’s helpful. Now, just a couple more questions, and then we can proceed with a physical exam. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. I have never smoked a cigarette in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I have always believed in a healthy lifestyle, and those things simply don’t fit into that. I find pleasure in simple things – a good book, a walk in the garden, spending time with my friends… those are my indulgences, not harmful substances. I've always been quite careful about what I put into my body, both physically and mentally. So, no, I do not smoke, drink excessively, or use any recreational drugs.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s all very helpful. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to proceed with a physical examination. We'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then I’ll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It’s a fairly standard exam, and it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright. I understand it is a standard procedure, and I trust your expertise, Doctor Georgiou. I am prepared for the examination. Please, proceed at your own pace. I am here to address my health concerns, and I am willing to cooperate in any way that will help you determine the cause of my discomfort. I appreciate your thoroughness and your gentle approach. Let us begin, whenever you are ready.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Denis. I appreciate your cooperation. Alright, let’s begin. Please lie back on the examination table, and I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. I’ll start here on the left side. Hmm… do you feel any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. It's not painful, exactly. More of… a dull ache. A slight discomfort when you press. But it's not sharp or sudden. It's been like that for some time now, as I mentioned. It's a subtle sensation, not easily noticeable unless someone is specifically pressing on it. But yes, there is a slight discomfort there. It’s more noticeable on the upper left side, as you've observed. Is that concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I see. That’s helpful to know. And here?
PATIENT: No, not there. That feels quite normal. No discomfort whatsoever. It's really only in the upper left quadrant that I feel anything. The rest of my abdomen feels perfectly fine. It’s not radiating pain, just localized in that one spot. It's been a consistent sensation, not fluctuating or changing. It's a subtle discomfort, but definitely present. I hope that helps you understand what I am experiencing.
DOCTOR: Alright. No tenderness in the lower abdomen. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now... Bowel sounds are present, though somewhat diminished. That could be normal, or it could be related to your discomfort. Okay, Denis. Based on the physical examination, you have mild tenderness in the upper left quadrant of your abdomen, and somewhat diminished bowel sounds. Considering your symptoms – the burning sensation, early fullness, nausea, weight loss, darker stools – and your family history, I think it's important to investigate this further. While it could be something relatively benign, like gastritis or irritable bowel syndrome, we need to rule out more serious possibilities.
PATIENT: That sounds… prudent, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your cautious approach. I understand that you need to rule out all possibilities, and I am willing to cooperate fully in any investigations you deem necessary. What sort of tests are you considering, if I may ask? I confess, I am a little anxious about what they might reveal, but I trust your expertise to guide me through this process. I would appreciate any information you can provide about what to expect. What are the next steps, Doctor Georgiou?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious, and I want to assure you, we’ll proceed at a pace you’re comfortable with. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, I’m recommending a few tests. First, I want to order a complete blood count, or CBC, to check for anemia and signs of inflammation. We'll also do a comprehensive metabolic panel, or CMP, to assess your liver and kidney function. And, given your report of darker stools, I want to order a fecal occult blood test, or FOBT, to check for any blood in your stool. In addition, I’d like to order an upper endoscopy with biopsy, repeating the one you had, but this time, we’ll collect more tissue samples to get a more definitive diagnosis. We can send those samples to pathology to determine the cause of the inflammation and to rule out any cancerous or precancerous changes. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… comprehensive, Doctor. A thorough approach is what I would expect, and I am grateful for your attention to detail. Repeat endoscopy… I confess, that is a little unsettling, but I understand its necessity. The other tests – blood work, stool sample – those seem relatively straightforward. I do have one question, if I may. Regarding the biopsy… will I be sedated for the procedure? And what is the recovery process like? I would appreciate knowing what to expect beforehand and afterwards. It’s the uncertainty that causes me the most anxiety, you see. I want to be prepared, both physically and mentally. What is the timeline for these tests, Doctor? When can I expect the results?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Those are excellent questions, and it’s important you feel comfortable and informed. Yes, you will be sedated for the upper endoscopy. We typically use a mild sedative, like Propofol, to help you relax and minimize any discomfort during the procedure. A nurse will monitor your vital signs throughout the entire process. The procedure itself usually takes about 20-30 minutes. After the endoscopy, you’ll be monitored in the recovery area for about an hour or two until the sedation wears off. You may experience some mild bloating, cramping, and a sore throat, but those symptoms usually resolve within a day or two. We'll give you specific instructions on what to eat and drink after the procedure. As for the timeline, I can order the blood work and stool sample today. You can get those done at the lab across the street. The results should be available within a few days. Scheduling the repeat endoscopy will take a little longer, as we need to coordinate with the gastroenterologist. I’ll have my assistant contact you to schedule that appointment as soon as possible. Once we have the results from the endoscopy, we can discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. It usually takes about a week or two to get the pathology results back. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is very helpful. Knowing about the sedation, the recovery process, and the timeline… it eases my anxiety considerably. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I do have one final question, if you don’t mind. Regarding the cost of these tests… are they covered by insurance? I confess, I do not have insurance coverage at present, and I am concerned about the financial burden. Would it be possible to get an estimate of the costs beforehand? I want to be prepared, not just physically and mentally, but financially as well.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, and I completely understand your concerns about the cost, especially without insurance coverage. I don’t have access to specific insurance details or current pricing for all procedures, unfortunately. However, my assistant is very knowledgeable about financial assistance programs and payment options. She can provide you with an estimate of the costs for each test and explore any available discounts or payment plans. She can also check for any charitable organizations that may be able to help with the costs. I’ll have her contact you after this appointment to discuss the financial aspects in more detail. She can also provide you with a written estimate of the costs. In the meantime, I can assure you that we will do everything we can to help you get the care you need, regardless of your financial situation. We’ll work with you to find a solution that is affordable and manageable. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Georgiou, that is very kind of you. I appreciate your compassion and your willingness to help. Knowing that your assistant can provide me with a cost estimate and explore payment options… it eases my mind considerably. I believe that is all my questions for now. Thank you for your time, your expertise, and your understanding. I am confident that we can work together to address my health concerns. I look forward to hearing from your assistant to schedule the tests and discuss the financial aspects. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Denis. I’m glad I could address your concerns. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. My assistant will be in touch shortly. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
