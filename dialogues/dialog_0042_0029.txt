DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Vodzak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this...feeling full really quick, you know? I don't eat much to begin with, being an old man and all, but now I barely get a few bites down before I feel like I could burst. It's been happening for a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling full very quickly after eating, even with small portions, and that's been going on for a few weeks. That's good information to start with. Could you tell me a little more about that feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it's not pain, exactly. More like…pressure, I guess. Right here, under my ribs. Not all the time, just when I'm eating, or shortly after. And it doesn't matter what I'm eating, really. Soup, a little bit of fish, even just a few crackers…it’s all the same. It just feels like…there’s no room. Even when there is room, I feel like. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Obarr. Pressure under the ribs when and shortly after eating, regardless of what you’ve consumed, and a feeling of fullness despite not eating much. Let's try to get a clearer picture of this. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. I've been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. But I'm 88, Doctor! Tired is kinda my default setting these days, you know? Oh… and maybe a little bit of…well, a bit of trouble keeping things down sometimes. Not often, but a couple of times I’ve had to… excuse me… rush to the bathroom. It’s not full-blown throwing up, just…a bit unsettled.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and some nausea with occasional episodes of feeling unsettled – not full vomiting, but a tendency to feel like you might need to get to the bathroom quickly. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Obarr. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you may have?
PATIENT: Well, my knees are shot, naturally. Old age, mostly. And the doctor back in town – Dr. Stevens, lovely woman – she says my blood pressure runs a little high, but it's usually alright if I just take it easy. She’s got me on some pills for that, though. Small white ones. Can't remember the name of ‘em, sorry. Otherwise, I’m pretty good for an old fella. No diabetes, no heart trouble that I know of. Just the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, some knee problems and high blood pressure managed with medication – small white pills, you said. We’ll try to get the name of those later. And no diabetes or known heart trouble. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, way back in ‘58, I think it was. And…oh, I had a bit of work done on my eye a few years back, a cataract. But other than that…no, I haven’t been under the knife much. I’ve always been a lucky fella, mostly. Well, except for these knees, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in 1958 and cataract surgery. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother, she lived to be 92, and she was pretty healthy all her life. My father…he had trouble with his heart, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details. My sister, bless her soul, she had some problems with her stomach when she was older, but I don’t know what exactly. Nothing major that I can think of, really. We weren’t a family that talked much about illnesses, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant family history of illness that you're aware of. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live with my wife, Elsie. We’ve been married 65 years, can you believe it? We keep pretty quiet. I used to be a fisherman, but I retired years ago. Now, I mostly just potter around the house, read the newspaper, and watch a bit of television. I don’t smoke, never have. I used to drink a little bit of beer with my supper, but I’ve cut back on that lately. Elsie does most of the cooking now. She makes a lovely salmon chowder. I walk a bit, when my knees allow it. Nothing strenuous, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live with your wife, Elsie, retired fisherman, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and light activity when your knees permit. That gives me a good picture. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. Elsie always says I'm a tough old bird. I can eat just about anything, and I've never had any trouble with bee stings or poison ivy, either. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. Nothing to worry about allergy-wise, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Mr. Obarr, that was very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and gently feel your abdomen to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. Elsie always says I need a good poking and prodding every now and then to make sure I’m still ticking. Just be gentle with my knees, alright? They're a bit sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a little elevated at 82, but that can be normal with some anxiety, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable. Hmm… I do note some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, right here, under your ribs. It doesn't seem to be any acute inflammation, but it does correspond with where you mentioned feeling the pressure. Your abdomen is also a bit soft, but not distended. No obvious masses or guarding.
PATIENT: Okay…that felt alright, Doctor. A little bit of pressure when you poked right there, but nothing too bad. It’s the same feeling I get when I'm eating, I guess. So, what do you think it is? Is it serious? I’m not wanting to worry Elsie unduly. She worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Obarr, and wanting to avoid worrying your wife. Based on what you've told me, and the mild tenderness I found during the exam, there are a few possibilities. It could be something relatively minor, like gastritis – inflammation of the stomach lining – or perhaps some early signs of a gallbladder issue, though we need further investigation to be sure. The fatigue and occasional nausea could be related. Because of your age and the lack of other severe symptoms, I’m not immediately concerned about anything terribly serious, but we do need to rule out more significant causes. To help us determine the exact cause, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will check your liver function, gallbladder function, and rule out any signs of infection. I’d also like to order an abdominal ultrasound. This is a painless imaging test that will allow us to visualize your gallbladder, liver, and other abdominal organs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and an ultrasound, alright. I don't mind a bit of poking and prodding if it gets to the bottom of things. And if it eases Elsie’s mind, even better. What about the blood tests? Do I need to fast beforehand? And will I have to go back to Dr. Stevens to get those done, or can I do them here?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests, so we’ll schedule those first thing in the morning. And we can do them right here in the clinic. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood, and we'll send it off to the lab. The ultrasound, we'll schedule for you with the radiology department in town. I’ll have my assistant book that for you as well, and we’ll find a time that works with your schedule. While we wait for the results, I’d recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding overly fatty or spicy foods, and staying well hydrated. Does that all sound manageable, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly manageable, Doctor. Smaller meals, no fatty foods, drink plenty of water… Elsie will be pleased. She's always telling me to eat better anyway. And having it all arranged for me is a great help. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. So, should I just schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results come back? How long do you think that will take?
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Elsie sounds like a wonderful support. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today. That will give us time to review the results and discuss the next steps. I will have my assistant schedule that for you before you leave. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, high fever, vomiting, or yellowing of your skin or eyes – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. And thank you again for listening and taking my worries seriously. It's good to know someone is looking into this. I’ll let Elsie know about the appointments. She’ll be relieved.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It’s my pleasure to help. I understand your concerns, and we'll work together to get to the bottom of this. Please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if anything changes or if you have any further questions. My assistant, Sarah, will come in shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment and book the ultrasound. Have a good day, and try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. You have a good day too. And thank you again.
