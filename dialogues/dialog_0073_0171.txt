DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good mornin'. My… nails. They look funny. Not good funny, just… funny. I dunno what's happenin' with 'em. Been a bit since I checked, so I just figured I'd get it looked at.
DOCTOR: Your nails, alright. And how long have they been… “funny,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Time… Time gets away from ya, don't it? Maybe… a couple months? I don't really look at my hands much, to be honest. Just noticed they weren't… normal lookin' the other day when I was washin' dishes. It's hard to say exactly. They ain't fallin' off or nothin', just… different.
DOCTOR: A couple of months. Alright. And can you describe what’s different about them?
PATIENT: Well… they're kinda… thick? And a bit yellowed. Not bright yellow, just… not pink like they used to be. And one of 'em has a little line goin' down the middle, like a stripe. It's on the big toe, I think. Honestly, I ain’t a nail expert, ya know? They just look… off. I don’t do those fancy nail things, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Thickened, yellowish discoloration, and a line on the big toe… no nail treatments, alright. Has there been any pain, swelling, or redness around the nails?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not a bit. And no, they ain't swollen, or red, or nothin'. Just… weird lookin'. I don't understand why somethin' would be wrong if it don't hurt, ya know? Seems silly comin' to a doctor for nails, but my sister always says it's best to check things out. She's a worrier, that one.
DOCTOR: It’s good your sister encourages preventative care. Many things don't present with pain initially. Alright, Ms. Thut, if you’ll permit me, I’d like to take a closer look. Could you please sit up and place your feet flat on the floor?
PATIENT: Sure, sure. No problem. Just… don't mind the socks. They got holes, I think. My eyesight ain't what it used to be, ya know? There ya go. Be gentle, now. I don't like bein' poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see what you mean about the thickening, and yes, a slight yellow discoloration is present. The line on the big toe nail is longitudinal, running the length of the nail bed. It does appear somewhat irregular. The nail texture is also slightly brittle. No signs of active infection – no redness, swelling, or pus. Capillary refill is normal in all digits. Have you noticed any changes to your skin elsewhere?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm… not that I know of. I mean, I get dry skin in the winter, like everyone does, but nothin’ different. I lotion sometimes. Why, is somethin’ wrong with my skin? I ain’t been payin’ much attention, to be honest. I mostly just worry 'bout my arthritis. That's what usually brings me to the doctor. Not nails.
DOCTOR: It's simply a matter of gathering information, Ms. Thut. Your arthritis is noted in your chart. These nail changes could be related to a number of things – fungal infection, psoriasis, even nutritional deficiencies. It’s often difficult to determine the cause with a visual exam alone. I’d like to order a nail fungus culture and a basic blood panel to check for any underlying deficiencies. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood panel? Oh, geez. I hate needles. Is it gonna be a lot of blood? I get faint easy, ya know. And what's a "fungus culture?" Sounds… scary. Can't ya just tell me what it is from lookin' at 'em? This all seems like a lot for a nail problem.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I understand your apprehension. The blood panel is routine – a small amount is needed. And the fungus culture involves gently scraping a small sample from the nail to be analyzed in a lab. It’s not painful, and it’s the most reliable way to determine if a fungal infection is present. While I can suspect a cause based on appearance, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without further testing. We need to rule out other possibilities. It’s better to be thorough. I want to get to the bottom of this for you, but accurate testing is vital. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But if I faint, I’m holdin' you responsible. And make sure whoever does the blood work is good with needles, alright? I had a bad experience once… Really bad. And… what about my arthritis? Can we talk about that too? I'm gettin' a little achey lately. It's in my hands, mostly.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Thut. I will ensure the phlebotomist is experienced, and we will take all necessary precautions to ensure your comfort. The lab work will be ordered, and a nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. And yes, of course, we can discuss your arthritis. That's why you're here as well. So, tell me about this recent increase in aching… where specifically are you feeling the pain, and what makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my knuckles. These ones, here. And the one right at the base of my thumb. It hurts to twist 'em, like when I'm openin' jars. Or… buttonin' my coat. It's worse in the mornin', when I first get up. And if it rains… oh, boy, don't even get me started on the rain. It feels like the bones are… swollin' up, ya know? It's just achy. Not sharp, just… achy and stiff. I've been takin' that medicine the doctor gave me, but it don't seem to be helpin' much lately.
DOCTOR: Knuckle pain, worse in the mornings and with rain, affecting function… medication is proving less effective. That's useful information. Based on your symptoms, this sounds like a flare-up of your osteoarthritis, possibly with some contribution from the weather. However, to rule out other possibilities – like rheumatoid arthritis, which can also affect the knuckles – I’d like to order some blood work in addition to the nail tests. We'll check your inflammatory markers and rheumatoid factor. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Inflammatory… markers? Rheumatoid…? Oh, jeez. More blood work? It's like a vampire convention in here! Look, can't ya just give me somethin' stronger for my hands? This is gettin' ridiculous. I just wanna feel better, ya know? I don't wanna be a science project. Is this gonna cost me a fortune? My Medicare don't cover everything.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I understand your frustration. And believe me, I wish we could simply prescribe something and be done with it. But it’s important to determine the cause of your pain to ensure we’re giving you the most appropriate treatment. The additional blood work will help us differentiate between osteoarthritis – which is wear and tear – and rheumatoid arthritis, which requires a different approach. As for costs, I can assure you we will bill your Medicare. If there are any charges not covered, our billing department will contact you beforehand. I wouldn't want to incur unexpected expenses for you. For now, let's proceed with the blood work. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more targeted treatment plan. We can revisit your arthritis medication options if needed. Does that sound like a reasonable course of action?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But I’m tellin' ya, it's probably just the rain. Always makes my bones ache. And hurry it up, alright? I got a bingo game to get to later. And I don't wanna miss it. When will I get the results? And can I at least get somethin' for the pain in the meantime? Like a cream or somethin'? .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Thut. I understand your concerns, and we will certainly keep your bingo game in mind. The lab should have the results back within five to seven business days. In the meantime, for pain relief, I can prescribe a topical cream containing capsaicin. It may provide some temporary relief for your knuckles. It works by desensitizing the pain receptors. However, it can cause a burning sensation initially, so it's important to follow the instructions carefully. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide you with the prescription. Do you have any other questions for me before she arrives?
