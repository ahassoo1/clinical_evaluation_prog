DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, hello. It’s… my ear. Feels blocked, you know? Full. Like something’s… there. It's been on and off for a bit now, I think. Honestly, the dates slip my mind these days. Sorry about that. Just… full.
DOCTOR: Right, “full.” On and off… hmm. Okay. And is it painful at all?
PATIENT: Painful… not exactly painful. More… annoying? Like when you’re on a plane and your ears pop, but it doesn't pop, if that makes sense. Just… pressure. And it makes it hard to hear sometimes. Mostly muffled sounds, I’d say. It's… difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure, muffled sounds… not pain. So it's been happening for… some time now. Can you recall when it started, even roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… oh dear. I… I really can’t say. Maybe… spring? Or was it summer last year? I was helping out with the… the fields, you know, the inspections… a lot of driving then. Could have been then, I suppose. It's all a bit blurry. My wife… she always remembered things.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, sometime last year. And were you exposed to any loud noises during these "inspections?
PATIENT: Loud noises… Hmm. Tractors, yes. And sometimes the… the harvesters. They're quite loud, those machines. We have to… well, we had to wear ear protection, but… I sometimes forgot. It was hot, you know? Uncomfortable. It’s probably nothing, honestly. Just a bit of… blockage.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And have you noticed any discharge from the ear?
PATIENT: Discharge? No… no, I don’t think so. I haven’t… noticed anything coming out of it. I’d remember that, wouldn’t I? Just the fullness. And a bit of… ringing, sometimes. Very faint. It’s hard to tell if it’s even there.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ringing, muffled sounds, fullness… no discharge. Let's take a quick look at your ear, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this sorted, if possible. I have inspections to do, you know. They're building up.
DOCTOR: Okay… hmm. Yes, there’s some cerumen buildup. Quite a bit, actually. It's obscuring the view of the eardrum. And the eardrum itself looks… slightly dull. Right ear is similar. A fair amount of wax and a slightly… congested appearance to the eardrum. It looks like you have a significant wax impaction in both ears. This could be contributing to your symptoms.
PATIENT: Wax? Oh. Right. Well, that makes sense, I suppose. I never really thought of that. Will it… come out easily? I don't like the idea of… anything poking around in there.
DOCTOR: We can try a simple wax removal procedure. It usually involves using a special solution to soften the wax, and then gently irrigating the ear to flush it out. It's fairly straightforward. However, given the congestion I observed, and the length of time you’ve been experiencing these symptoms, I’d like to rule out other possibilities first. We could do a quick hearing test to assess the extent of any hearing loss, and just to be safe, I’d recommend a referral to an audiologist for a more thorough evaluation.
PATIENT: A hearing test… and a specialist? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Is it… necessary? I just thought it was wax. I really need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, while it could be just wax, the prolonged nature of your symptoms and the appearance of your eardrums warrants a little more investigation. It’s better to be thorough, rule out anything more serious – like an infection or fluid buildup – and ensure we’re treating the root cause. The hearing test is quick, non-invasive, and will give us a clearer picture. The audiologist can determine if there’s any permanent damage and recommend appropriate treatment. Ignoring it could potentially lead to more significant hearing loss down the line. It’s not about creating complications, it’s about ensuring your long-term ear health.
