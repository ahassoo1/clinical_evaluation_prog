DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor… Mrtic, right? Yeah, it’s… about getting surgery. For my weight. I think it's a check-up before that happens? Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. My wife mostly set it up.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kochubey, Dr. Mrtic. And it is good your wife is involved. It often helps to have someone else keeping track of things. Surgery is… a significant step. Let's clarify. You're considering weight loss surgery, and this is a pre-operative assessment. To get started, tell me a bit about why you're looking into this now. What’s been going on that’s made you decide this is the right path?
PATIENT: Right, right. Okay. Um… well, it's been getting harder to… do things. Just everyday stuff. Walking, mostly. And I get tired really easily. My wife says my health numbers aren’t good, and… honestly, I just want to feel better. I don't really remember exactly when it got so bad, just that it has. Does that make sense? I get a little lost in the details sometimes.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Kochubey. "Getting tired easily" and difficulty with walking… those are broad symptoms. We’ll narrow it down. You said your wife mentioned your health numbers. Do you happen to know what specifically she was referring to?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. She showed me some papers, with lots of numbers and… lines? I think it had something to do with sugar, and… maybe cholesterol? I honestly just glazed over. She said it was important, and I trust her. I’m not very good with remembering medical stuff. She does all that.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, fortunately, we have your records here. It appears your wife is correct. Your A1c is elevated – indicating pre-diabetes, likely progressing to diabetes – and your cholesterol is significantly high. Your BMI is… substantial, to put it mildly. We also see some indications of early hypertension. It’s… good you’re addressing this now, before it becomes truly serious. Now, besides the fatigue and walking difficulties, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh… wow. That’s… a lot of big words. Um… symptoms? Let me think. Sometimes I get… short of breath, just doing little things. And my knees really ache. Especially when I go up stairs. Other than that… I don’t really know. I guess I just figured it was from being… bigger. Is that… helpful? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Short of breath and knee pain… yes, that aligns with what I’m seeing. It’s not helpful to just “figure” things, Mr. Kochubey. That’s why you’re here. Now, let's go through some basics. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. Not that I remember. I had… the flu, a couple of times. And I broke my arm when I was a kid. But nothing serious, I don't think. My wife would probably know better. She keeps track of all that. Is it okay if I just say that a lot? I really rely on her memory.
DOCTOR: It’s… preferable if you provide the information, Mr. Kochubey. While your wife’s input is valuable, this assessment is for you. And repeatedly deferring to her isn’t particularly useful. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I understand. No, I haven't had any surgeries before. This would be my first. I’m… a little nervous about that, if I’m honest. Especially if it’s… a big one. Does this surgery involve… a lot of cutting?
DOCTOR: It depends on the specific procedure, Mr. Kochubey, which we’ll discuss shortly. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Um… my dad had… heart problems, I think. And my mom… she had diabetes, too. Yes, definitely diabetes. She struggled with it for a long time. I don’t know much more than that, honestly. My family doesn’t really… talk about health stuff. It’s kind of… private.
DOCTOR: Diabetes and heart problems… that’s relevant. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink – maybe a beer with dinner once in a while – and I definitely don’t use any… recreational drugs. I don't like those things. My wife wouldn’t approve.
DOCTOR: And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. No, not really. I take… a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. Just the… little chewy ones. My wife buys them.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. Now that we have a basic understanding of your history, let’s proceed with a physical exam. It’s important to assess your overall condition before discussing surgical options. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Hopefully, it won't be… too bad. Just let me know if it’s going to hurt, okay?
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be painful, Mr. Kochubey, but please inform me if you experience any discomfort. Now, if you could just lie flat on your back, arms at your sides. Take a few deep breaths... and another one... Good. Heart sounds are slightly muffled, some irregularity noted. Lung sounds are diminished bilaterally, some crackles present in the lower lobes. Respiration is labored. Blood pressure is 160/95, pulse is 88 and irregular. Abdomen is soft, but enlarged. Some tenderness noted in the upper right quadrant. Weight is 139 kilograms, height is 155 centimeters, resulting in a BMI of 58.3, classified as morbidly obese. Edema present in lower extremities. Reflexes are normal. The examination confirms significant health concerns. We need to address these before proceeding with any surgical intervention.
PATIENT: Wow. That’s… a lot. Morbidly obese? That sounds… bad. And all those other things… irregular, diminished, edema… what does all that mean? Will surgery even be possible?
DOCTOR: It means, Mr. Kochubey, that your current health status presents significant risks for surgery. The irregularity in your heartbeat, the diminished lung sounds, the edema… these all indicate underlying conditions that need to be managed before we can even consider a surgical procedure. Surgery is not a simple fix. It requires a healthy body to withstand the stress. Right now, your body is… compromised. We need to focus on reducing your blood pressure, improving your heart function, and addressing the fluid retention. This will likely involve a combination of medication and lifestyle changes – specifically, a carefully planned diet and exercise program. I will order a comprehensive blood workup, including a lipid panel, glucose levels, and kidney function tests. We also need to get an electrocardiogram to assess your heart rhythm and a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. I will also refer you to a cardiologist for a thorough evaluation. It is crucial to understand the extent of your cardiovascular risk before we proceed. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Wow. That’s… a lot to take in. A cardiologist? More tests? I… I guess not. It sounds… scary. I just wanted to get surgery and… feel better. I didn’t realize there was so much involved. Will I… will I even be able to have the surgery? Or is it too late?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, it’s not too late. However, it is more complicated than simply scheduling a surgery. Your body needs to be prepared. We need to address these underlying health issues to minimize the risks and ensure a successful outcome. Think of it this way: surgery is the destination, but these tests and treatments are the necessary steps to get there safely. The cardiologist will assess your heart function and determine if you're a suitable candidate for surgery. The blood work will help us understand the extent of your diabetes and kidney function. The chest X-ray will reveal any underlying lung problems. I understand your frustration, and your desire to feel better quickly. However, rushing into surgery without addressing these issues would be irresponsible. We need to be methodical, and prioritize your overall health. We will work together, step by step, to get you to your goal. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay. Step by step. I… I can do that. I guess. It just… it’s a lot to think about. The cardiologist, the tests, changing everything… What kind of changes are we talking about? The diet… the exercise… Will it be really hard? I haven’t really… taken care of myself very well.
DOCTOR: It will require commitment, Mr. Kochubey, there’s no denying that. The diet will involve reducing your calorie intake, focusing on whole, unprocessed foods – fruits, vegetables, lean proteins. We’ll have a nutritionist work with you to create a meal plan tailored to your needs and preferences. The exercise will start slowly, with low-impact activities like walking. We'll gradually increase the intensity and duration as your fitness level improves. The goal is not to become a marathon runner, but to improve your cardiovascular health and overall well-being. It will be challenging, especially at first. But it’s not insurmountable. We will provide you with the resources and support you need to succeed. We have a support group for patients undergoing similar treatment, and I encourage you to attend. We’re not asking you to do this alone. We're a team, and we'll work together every step of the way. Do you have any immediate concerns about the diet or exercise plan?
PATIENT: I… I don’t really know how to cook. My wife does all the cooking. And… I get really tired, really easily. Even just walking around the house sometimes. I’m not sure how I’m going to… exercise. It sounds… impossible. I guess… maybe I’m just not strong enough to do this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and doubt your ability to make these changes. We're not expecting you to become a fitness expert overnight. And we understand you rely on your wife for cooking. That's not a problem. We’ll work with you to find realistic solutions. The nutritionist can provide you with simple, easy-to-prepare recipes that even you can manage. We can also explore ways to incorporate exercise into your daily routine without overexerting yourself. Perhaps starting with short walks around the house, or chair exercises. The fatigue is also a concern, and we need to address that. We’ll run some tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your tiredness. Once we have a better understanding of the cause, we can develop a plan to manage your energy levels. This isn’t about being “strong enough” right now. It’s about building strength, gradually, with support and guidance. And frankly, many of my patients feel the same way initially. It takes time and effort, but it is possible. I will write referrals for the nutritionist and cardiologist. I also want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the test results and develop a comprehensive treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay. Two weeks. And the nutritionist… and the cardiologist. I guess… I can try. My wife will be happy to hear that. She's been really worried about me. So… is that all for today? I think my head is starting to hurt a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kochubey, that is all for today. I'll have my nurse print out the referrals and a summary of our discussion. I understand your head is starting to hurt – it’s a lot to process. Remember, this is a journey, not a race. We'll take it one step at a time. And please, don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I will see you in two weeks. In the meantime, focus on getting some rest and taking care of yourself. .
