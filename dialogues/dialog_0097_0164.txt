DOCTOR: Hi Mande, welcome. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Dr. Georgiou. Well, it’s a bit… strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really weak and tired lately, and my skin and eyes have gotten kind of yellow. It started after I ate some fava beans, which I usually love, but now… I don’t know, something just feels off.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness, tiredness, and yellowing of the skin and eyes… and this started after eating fava beans. That’s helpful to know. Just to clarify, when you say “lately”, how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it’s been about a week now, maybe a little more. It started maybe eight or nine days ago. I had the beans on… July 25th, I think? And I started feeling unwell a day or two after that. It’s been getting worse steadily since then. I hadn’t eaten them in a while before that, so it really seemed to coincide with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around July 25th with the fava beans, then symptoms starting a day or two later, and progressively worsening over the past week or so. That's good detail. Now, has this weakness been all over, or is it more in certain muscles?
PATIENT: It’s mostly just… general, I think. Like, I get tired just walking up the stairs, or even doing simple things around the house. It's not like a specific muscle feels weaker, just everything feels… heavy, you know? It's hard to explain. I just don't have the energy I used to. And honestly, I've been a bit dizzy too, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, general weakness and fatigue, dizziness as well. And it’s been impacting your daily activities. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside those?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My pee has been… darker than usual. A really dark yellow, almost brown sometimes. And… oh, and my stomach has been a bit upset. Not like a full-blown stomach bug, but just feeling queasy and not wanting to eat much. I thought maybe it was just from feeling unwell generally, but now that you mention it… it’s probably worth saying.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark urine and nausea, along with the weakness, fatigue, dizziness and yellowing… That’s quite a bit of information. Just to be thorough, have you had any fever, chills, or pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And no pain, not really. Maybe just a little bit of discomfort in my stomach, but nothing sharp or intense. It's just… off, like I said. It all feels a little bit 'off'. Honestly, I was a little scared when I started looking yellow, so I thought I should come and see someone. I’ve never experienced anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or pain. It sounds like you've been understandably worried about the yellowing, and it's good you came in. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life actually. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I haven't had any major surgeries or anything like that. My doctor always said I had a strong constitution. And I don’t take any regular medications, just over-the-counter things for a headache occasionally. I don’t have any allergies that I know of either.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know – generally healthy, no chronic conditions, no surgeries, no medications or allergies. Now, thinking about your family... is there anyone in your family with a history of liver problems, anemia, or any blood disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mother had some trouble with her stomach when she was older, but I don't think it was liver related, more like indigestion. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, I think he had… some kind of anemia, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I was quite young, so I don't remember the details. He was always very pale, I remember that. But I don't know what kind, or if it was even anemia for sure. It was never talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, some potential stomach issues in your mother, and possible anemia in your grandfather, but no clear history of liver problems. Now, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't drink alcohol at all. Never really liked it, to be honest. I've tried it a few times at parties, but it didn't agree with me. I prefer tea. And I don't smoke either, never have. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables, though I've been off my appetite lately, as I mentioned. I do enjoy cooking, when I have the energy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no alcohol or smoking, healthy diet, though appetite has been reduced lately. That's all very helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check for any signs of jaundice or swelling. It’ll only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Please go ahead. I’m a bit nervous, but I’m glad you’re checking me out. I'll just sit here, won't I? Do you need me to do anything special?
DOCTOR: Just sit comfortably and breathe normally. Okay, a little tender here on the right side, but no major guarding. And as you mentioned, there is definite jaundice present. Your sclera – the whites of your eyes – are quite yellow, and your skin tone has a noticeable yellowish hue. No visible swelling in your legs or abdomen. I’m also going to check your reflexes and strength. Could you squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I’m squeezing as hard as I’m able. Is that okay? It feels a little strange, all these checks, but I’m trusting your judgement. I’m a little worried, if I’m honest. Could this be serious?
DOCTOR: Good, good strength in both hands. It's good to be honest about your worries, and it’s entirely reasonable to be concerned. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings – the jaundice, the fatigue, the nausea, dark urine, and the tenderness in your abdomen – I'm concerned about a few possibilities. The timing with the fava beans is particularly noteworthy. One possibility is hemolytic anemia, where red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be made. Certain people have a genetic predisposition to this, and it can be triggered by things like fava beans. We call this Favism. Another possibility is some sort of liver issue, but we'll need to run some tests to determine that. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, bilirubin levels, and a Coombs test, which can help us determine if it's an autoimmune issue. I also want to check your reticulocyte count, to see if your body is trying to make new red blood cells. We might also consider an abdominal ultrasound, depending on what the blood tests show. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds… thorough, which is good. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Blood tests and an ultrasound… yes, let's do whatever we need to do to figure out what’s wrong. I trust your judgement. When can we get these tests done? And will they be able to tell us definitively what’s going on? I’m really worried about this Favism you mentioned… is that serious? I've never even heard of it before.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad you feel comfortable with that plan. I’ll have the lab draw the blood samples right away. We can usually get those results back within 24-48 hours. The ultrasound can be scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. As for Favism, it can be serious, depending on the severity. In mild cases, it causes temporary anemia and jaundice, which resolve on their own once you stop eating fava beans. However, in more severe cases, it can lead to more serious complications, like kidney damage. We need to determine the severity of your case before we can say for sure. The blood tests will help us assess the severity of the anemia, how well your liver is functioning, and whether or not it's an autoimmune issue. I'll also check for any signs of kidney damage. Once we have those results, we can develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I would strongly advise you to avoid eating any fava beans or anything that might contain them. Also, try to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, avoid fava beans, stay hydrated, and rest. That sounds… manageable. So, it's good that I haven't been eating them since I started feeling unwell. I think I'm less worried about them now I know what's happening. Actually… yes, I do have a question. If it is Favism, is it something I’ll have for the rest of my life? And is it… hereditary? Should my family be tested as well? I have a brother and a sister, and I'd hate for them to be worried too.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Favism is caused by a genetic deficiency of an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, or G6PD. If you are diagnosed with Favism, it is a lifelong condition. However, it's usually not something that causes problems unless you're exposed to triggers like fava beans, certain medications, or infections. As for whether your family should be tested, yes, that's a good idea. If you have a G6PD deficiency, there's a 50% chance that your siblings will also have it. Testing is a simple blood test, and it’s important to know so they can avoid triggers. I can write a referral for them, or they can speak to their own doctors. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done and figuring out what's going on with you. We'll address your family's testing after we have your results. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That explains a lot, actually. Thank you for being so thorough and explaining everything so clearly. It’s a little scary, but I feel much better knowing what we're looking for. So, just avoid fava beans and rest, and we'll get the tests done and figure out what to do next. I think that's everything for now. Thank you again, Dr. Georgiou. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. It’s my job to help you understand what’s going on and get you the care you need. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. I'll have the lab send the results directly to me, and my nurse will contact you as soon as they're available. Get some rest, and I’ll see you soon.
