DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's good to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Just… my ear. Feels blocked, you know? Like there's something… full in there. It’s been… a while, I think. Honestly, dates are a bit fuzzy these days. It just… bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A feeling of fullness in your ear, and it’s been going on for a bit. That’s a good place to start. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. Well, it’s not painful, exactly. More… annoying. Like when you go up in an airplane, that pressure? It’s a bit like that, but… constant. And I don't remember when it started, truthfully. I just noticed it was… there. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Guerrerolopez. No need to apologize at all. It’s helpful that you compare it to the pressure you feel on an airplane – that gives me a good idea of what you’re experiencing. And it’s alright that you can’t pinpoint exactly when it began. So, just to clarify, it's a constant feeling of fullness, not pain, in your ear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Constant fullness. No pain, thankfully. It doesn’t… hurt. Just… there. And sometimes… maybe a little muffled hearing? I mostly notice it when my wife… when someone was talking. It’s hard to explain. Sorry. I… I really just want it gone.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It sounds very frustrating to have something persistent like that, especially when it affects your hearing. Let's try to get a better picture of things. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness and muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No dizziness, not that I recall. And no… discharge, no. Just… the ear. I haven’t been sick recently, not that I remember. I… I used to go swimming a lot, but that was a while ago. Before… everything. Honestly, I’m not sure. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mr. Guerrerolopez. This is all very helpful. No dizziness or discharge is good to know. And the information about the swimming is useful as well. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever had any problems with your ears before – perhaps ear infections as a child, or any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that you mention it… maybe? A slight… hum, sometimes. It’s very faint. I just put it down to… old age, I suppose. As for infections… I think so, when I was a little boy. But it was so long ago, I can’t really remember. My mother used to… well, that's not important. I really don't know, Doctor. Sorry. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: No, you are being helpful, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It's perfectly alright that memories aren't always clear. The slight hum is good to know, and the possibility of ear infections as a child is noted. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ear, if that’s alright with you. I'll use an otoscope to look inside and see if I can identify anything obvious. It doesn’t hurt. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: An examination… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… quick if possible, please? I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things. Yes, go ahead. Whatever you need to look at. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay. I'm seeing a bit of cerumen – that’s earwax – in both ears, but nothing that immediately stands out as causing the blockage you're describing. The eardrum appears intact, but slightly… dull. It’s hard to say definitively without further testing. I don't see any signs of infection at this time. I'm going to listen to your ears with my stethoscope now. This will just help me rule out anything else that might be going on. Your hearing seems a bit reduced in both ears, but it's subtle. It's consistent with some fluid in the middle ear, possibly, or simply age-related changes.
PATIENT: Fluid… in the middle ear? Is that… serious? And age-related… well, I am getting on a bit, I suppose. But it’s just… annoying. Is there anything you can do about it, Doctor? I really just want it to go away. I’ve got… appointments to make, and I can’t hear properly on the phone. It's a nuisance, honestly.
DOCTOR: It's good you brought up the appointments and the phone. Those are important considerations. Fluid in the middle ear isn’t necessarily serious, Mr. Guerrerolopez, but it can certainly be bothersome and affect your hearing, as you’ve described. It often happens with minor congestion or changes in pressure. Sometimes it clears up on its own. However, given the persistence of your symptoms and the reduced hearing I detected, I think it would be best to investigate a bit further. I’d like to order a tympanometry test. It’s a simple, painless test that measures how well your eardrum moves and can help me determine if there's fluid behind it. We can do that here in the clinic. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A test… yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And it doesn’t hurt? I really don’t have much patience for… things. Just… quickly, if possible. And will it tell you what’s causing it? That’s the main thing, isn’t it? Knowing what’s wrong. Then, hopefully, you can fix it. Yes, let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It won’t take long at all, Mr. Guerrerolopez, and it’s completely painless. It involves placing a small probe into your ear – similar to a cotton swab – and it measures how your eardrum responds to changes in air pressure. Okay, the results are back. It does appear there’s some fluid in the middle ear on both sides. It's not a large amount, but enough to be causing the blockage and muffled hearing you’ve been experiencing. Given the fluid and your symptoms, I suspect it may be Eustachian tube dysfunction – that’s when the tube that connects the middle ear to the back of your throat isn’t opening and closing properly, leading to fluid buildup. It's quite common. We can try a conservative approach initially, to see if it resolves on its own. I’m going to recommend a nasal steroid spray, to help reduce any inflammation in the nasal passages and hopefully open up the Eustachian tubes. I’ll write you a prescription for fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Would you like me to explain how to use it?
PATIENT: Fluti… what now? A spray? Into my nose? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not good with… medications. My wife usually handles all that. But… she’s not here anymore. So, yes, please. Explain it slowly. And will it actually work? I really don't want to be spraying things into my nose if it's not going to help. And is there anything else I can do? Besides spraying. Just… something. Anything. This is all rather… a lot.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Mr. Guerrerolopez, and it is a lot to take in. It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. Fluticasone propionate is a nasal steroid spray. It’s commonly used to reduce inflammation in the nasal passages, which can help open up the Eustachian tubes and allow the fluid in your middle ear to drain. It doesn't have strong side effects. To use it: you’ll shake the bottle gently, then prime the pump by spraying it into the air a few times. Then, with your head slightly tilted forward, you’ll insert the nozzle into one nostril, and spray once. Repeat in the other nostril. It’s best to do this once a day for two weeks. I’ll write down clear instructions for you. As for other things you can do, besides the spray: staying well hydrated can help thin the mucus, and chewing gum can sometimes help open up the Eustachian tubes as well. Saline nasal rinses can also be helpful, but some people don't like them. We can see how you respond to the spray first. If your symptoms don't improve after two weeks, we can consider other options, such as a referral to an ENT specialist, or further testing. Would that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. I can manage two weeks. Chewing gum… yes, I can do that. And staying hydrated… well, I do enjoy a cup of tea. A referral… no, thank you. Not yet, at least. I’d rather not bother with specialists if I can avoid it. Yes, let’s try the spray and the chewing gum. And… the tea. Write down the instructions, please. Clear instructions. I’m not good at remembering things. And… is there a cost for the spray? I need to… well, it’s complicated. But I need to know. Yes, just the cost. And then I’d like to get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I understand completely. It's good to start with the least invasive options first. Here you are. These instructions detail exactly how to use the spray, how often, and potential side effects. As for the cost, the spray is $28.50 with your insurance. I can write a prescription to your preferred pharmacy, and they can verify the exact cost. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
