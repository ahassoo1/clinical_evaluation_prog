DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Yeah, well, I'm trying out for a team... a sports team. Need to get checked out, make sure I’m still in good enough shape. It’s... important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark. That's good you're being proactive about this. Important is good. Which sport are you trying out for, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Mongolian wrestling. It's... physical. A lot of grappling, you know? I haven’t done it seriously in a few years, so they want a checkup. Just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Mongolian wrestling… excellent. Very demanding, as you say. A few years is enough time for things to change. We'll definitely want to get a good baseline. So, to start with the history – have you had any injuries in the past, specifically related to wrestling or any other sports, or even just from everyday life?
PATIENT: Hmm… injuries. Let me think. A few sprains, mostly ankles, back in my younger days. Nothing major. Oh, and I think I dislocated a shoulder once, but that was a long time ago. Fixed itself, I think. Honestly, I don't remember a lot of the details. It was... a while ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankles and a shoulder... and it sounds like the shoulder resolved on its own. That’s good to know. It's not uncommon for memories to fade over time, so don't worry about the details. Do you currently experience any pain anywhere—joints, muscles, back, anywhere at all?
PATIENT: Not really pain, no. Maybe a little stiffness in my knees sometimes, especially in the morning. But it goes away pretty quick. Old age, I guess. Nothing I really complain about.
DOCTOR: Alright, some morning stiffness in the knees… that’s fairly common. We’ll take a closer look at those. Just to get a full picture, have you noticed any swelling in your joints, any redness, or warmth?
PATIENT: No, no swelling or redness. Just... feels a bit creaky, like an old door. Nothing visible. I don't think so, anyway. My wife would probably notice if there was. She tells me everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you have a keen observer at home. Alright, no visible swelling, just stiffness. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your energy levels lately?
PATIENT: Energy levels… hmm. I get tired, of course. I’m 62, not 20. But nothing… dramatic. I sleep okay, mostly. Wake up a few times, but who doesn’t? It’s probably just normal getting older stuff. I don't feel weak, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Normal age-related changes are very common. And it’s good to know you’re not feeling weak. Now, thinking about your medical history generally - do you have any chronic health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. Never been a big fan of doctors, so I don’t go unless I absolutely have to. Mostly just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. Never been hospitalized for anything, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Staying healthy is the most important thing. And it's perfectly fine to only come when you need to. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. Maybe some vitamin C when I feel a cold coming on, but that's it. Mostly just try to eat right and get enough sleep. Old habits, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications or supplements. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always checks, though. She’s very careful. I think I'd remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You certainly would, and it's good you have someone to double-check. Alright, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father lived to be 85, pretty healthy for his age. My mother, she had some heart trouble towards the end, I think. Nothing else really stands out. Most of my family… they’re all back in Mongolia. I don’t see them much, so I don’t know a lot about their health.
DOCTOR: Okay, father lived to 85, mother had some heart trouble. That's good to know. And it’s understandable you don’t have a lot of information about your family back in Mongolia. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never liked it. My wife doesn't either, so that helped. Always been a pretty clean liver, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little bit sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing heavy. Never been a big drinker. More of a tea man, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol use, mostly tea. And finally, do you have any physically demanding job or hobbies, aside from wrestling?
PATIENT: Not really. I used to work in… media, communications. Mostly desk work. Now I'm retired, mostly just garden a bit, walk the dog. Nothing too strenuous. The wrestling is really the only thing that pushes me physically these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your heart, lungs, joints, and overall strength and flexibility. It won't take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Get it over with. I got things to do, you know? But go ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course. If you could just have a seat here, we'll start with your heart and lungs. It might be a little cool, let me know if you want a blanket. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, breathing normally. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Strength is good bilaterally. Okay, range of motion is good, but I do notice some mild stiffness in your knees, as you mentioned. Slight discomfort when bending fully. Ankles appear normal, no swelling or signs of previous injury. Overall, your exam is fairly normal for your age. I do note the mild stiffness in your knees. It doesn't seem to be anything severe, but we can discuss some options to manage that, if it bothers you.
PATIENT: Yeah, the knees are just… old. Like I said. Is it gonna stop me from wrestling? That's the important thing. I don't need a fancy diagnosis or anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. Based on my exam, I don’t believe the stiffness in your knees will necessarily prevent you from wrestling, but it's something we should be mindful of. It could increase your risk of injury if you push yourself too hard, or don't warm up properly. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a simple X-ray of your knees, just to rule out any arthritis or other structural issues. It's a quick and painless procedure. Would you be open to getting that done?
PATIENT: X-ray… Ugh. More time wasted. Look, Doctor, I'm an old wrestler. I know my body. If it hurts, I stop. I don’t need a machine to tell me that. Can I just… sign a waiver or something and be done with it?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and I respect your experience. However, as your physician, my priority is to ensure your safety and help you make informed decisions. An X-ray isn’t about telling you what you already know, it’s about establishing a baseline, so we can properly monitor any changes. Given that you’re starting a physically demanding activity after a break, it’s the most responsible course of action. It would also document your pre-existing condition, should anything arise later. The clinic does require a signed waiver for any activity, and the X-ray would contribute to that documentation. It is a relatively inexpensive procedure, and peace of mind can be valuable. And unfortunately, I'm not comfortable clearing you for wrestling without it. It's a matter of professional responsibility. Would you like me to arrange for the X-ray?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And make it quick, I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. I'll have the nurse schedule you for an X-ray right away. It should only take a few minutes. In the meantime, I recommend gentle stretching and warm-up exercises before any wrestling practice. And listen to your body – don't push through pain. Once we have the X-ray results, we can discuss a plan to manage the stiffness and help you stay safe. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Just… where do I go for the X-ray? And how long will it take?
DOCTOR: The X-ray machine is just down the hall, third door on the left. The technician, Sarah, is expecting you. It should only take about 10-15 minutes, including the preparation and the actual scan. Once it’s done, the images will be sent to me, and I'll review them as soon as possible. The nurse will let you know when I've had a chance to look at them, usually within a day or two. Do you have any other concerns before you head down there?
PATIENT: No. Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions. .
