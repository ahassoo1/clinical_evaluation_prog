DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I'm Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. I… need check for travel, yeah? My wife… she wanted me to get something before… before we go. She made the appointment. I don’t remember much about where we’re going, just… hot place. Lots of bugs, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, a travel check-up. That’s perfectly reasonable. It’s good your wife thought ahead. Just to clarify, you said a “hot place” with lots of bugs... Do you know where specifically you're traveling to?
PATIENT: Ugh. She told me. It was… Nepal. Back to Nepal. I… I am from Nepal. Why would I need a check-up to go back to Nepal? It doesn't make sense. Is this some kind of mistake?
DOCTOR: Okay, Nepal. That's helpful. And you're right to question it, Odell. It's not uncommon to need vaccinations or preventative medications even when returning to your country of origin, especially if you’ve been away for a while, or if there have been outbreaks of certain diseases. We want to make sure you're protected. Do you know when you left Nepal, and approximately when you plan to return?
PATIENT: Left… a long time ago. Maybe five years? Before… before my wife. I don't really keep track. Going back… next week, I think. She booked everything. Everything is… complicated now. She always did all the planning. I just… go where she tells me.
DOCTOR: Okay, five years ago, returning next week. That gives us a little time, though it is a bit tight. And since you've been away for five years, your immunity to some common Nepalese illnesses may have waned. We'll want to review that. First, let's talk about your health generally. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I work. I build airplanes. Strong arms, strong back. Healthy. Always been healthy. Except… after she passed… not so much, but that’s… different. That's not a medical problem. I just… sleep a lot. And don't eat much. But I'm fine for work. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, work as an airplane builder. I appreciate you telling me that. It's good to know you're active. And it's perfectly alright to share personal details if you feel they're relevant. The loss you experienced… I understand that can have a significant impact on health, even if it doesn't fit neatly into a medical diagnosis. Let's focus on your physical health for now, and then we can circle back to anything else if needed. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold, the flu, or anything more serious?
PATIENT: Ugh, flu last winter. Bad one. Lots of fever. But I worked through it. Had to. No time to be sick when building airplanes. And… stomach problems sometimes. Bad food, maybe. It happens. Nothing I ever went to the doctor for. Just… took some pills and it went away. My wife always has pills for everything. She said I should keep a small bottle in my bag.
DOCTOR: Okay, flu last winter, and occasional stomach problems. That’s helpful. And your wife provides some over-the-counter medications. Do you remember what those pills are for, or what their names are?
PATIENT: Ugh, names? No. Little white ones, for my stomach. And some red ones when I have a headache. She has a whole bag. She labels them. I just… take what she gives me. I don't ask questions. She knows best. She always did. It's… hard to remember everything now. Even the pills.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like your wife manages most of your healthcare needs. That’s… good. But for the travel check-up, it’s important for me to have a clear picture of everything you’re taking, even if it’s just over-the-counter. Do you have the bag with you today?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, I think so. In my backpack. She always says to keep it with me. Just in case. It’s… a big bag. Lots of little bottles. And… creams. She worries about sunburn. I don't really like all the bottles. Makes me feel… old. Like a sick person.
DOCTOR: Okay. Would you mind getting it for me?
PATIENT: Here. It’s… a mess. She likes to be prepared for everything. And she always gets the biggest size. Don't know what half of this is for, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's see... Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, loperamide... Ah, here's an antibiotic – ciprofloxacin. And a topical antifungal, clotrimazole. And yes, a very good sunscreen. Do you know why your wife prescribed the ciprofloxacin?
PATIENT: Ugh, cip… what? The white pills? She said… she said for the stomach problems. When I eat bad food. She said I get… infection. Bad bugs in my stomach. She said… she said Nepal has a lot of bugs. Is that it? I don't remember much. It was a long time ago now. She always said I needed to be careful with the food. She worried about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good to know she's thinking ahead. However, using antibiotics preventatively, or for conditions that may not require them, can contribute to antibiotic resistance, making them less effective when you truly need them. Now, let’s move on to vaccinations. Do you know if you've had any vaccinations recently, or in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, vaccines? No. Not that I remember. I… maybe when I was a kid? In Nepal? But I don't have any cards or anything. She always took care of that too. Everything. I just… showed up wherever she told me to go. She said I was protected. She always said I was protected. Is there something wrong? Is Nepal… dangerous?
DOCTOR: No, Nepal isn't inherently dangerous, but there are certain illnesses that are more common there, and it's important to be protected. Without knowing your vaccination history, it's difficult to say for sure. I can check the CDC travel guidelines for Nepal and see what vaccinations are recommended. We may need to administer a few boosters to ensure you’re fully protected. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. But… needles. I don't like needles. She always… she always held my hand when I got shots. She said it wouldn't hurt if she held my hand. She always made everything better. But… she’s not here now. Can… can you hold my hand?
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. I can absolutely hold your hand. That's no problem at all. We'll take things slowly, and I’ll do everything I can to make you comfortable. According to the CDC, the recommended vaccinations for Nepal include Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and a Tetanus booster. It's also advisable to be up-to-date on your routine vaccinations, like MMR and Varicella. We will also want to discuss malaria prevention. But we can start with a physical exam first to get a baseline. Does that sound okay with you?
PATIENT: Ugh… so many things. Okay. Physical exam. Okay. Anything to… get it over with. But… malaria? What is malaria? Is it… bad? She never said anything about malaria. Is Nepal… different now?
DOCTOR: It's alright to feel overwhelmed, Odell. We'll take this one step at a time. Malaria is a mosquito-borne illness that's common in some parts of Nepal, particularly in the lower-altitude regions. It can be serious, but it’s preventable with medication and by taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites. The fact that your wife didn’t mention it doesn’t necessarily mean anything has changed – it’s possible she just didn’t deem it necessary based on your travel plans. We’ll discuss the risks and benefits of malaria prevention medication and determine what's best for you. Before we get to that though, let’s do a quick physical exam – just to check your overall health. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh… fine. Just… get it over with. The quicker, the better. But… please, be gentle. I… I bruise easily. She always said so. She always knew everything.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. I will be very gentle. I will take extra care. Okay, just relax your arm for me. Deep breath in... and out... That's good. Your heart sounds strong and steady. Lungs are clear. Throat looks a little dry, but nothing concerning. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, but that could be due to anxiety. Everything seems normal so far. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Do you have any pain or discomfort in your stomach?
PATIENT: Ugh… my stomach? Sometimes. When I eat… bad food. Like she said. She always said I have a sensitive stomach. It bubbles. And… sometimes cramps. But it goes away. Usually. Just… takes some pills. Is something wrong? Is it bad? She always knew what to do. I… I miss her.
DOCTOR: It's alright to miss her, Odell. It sounds like you were very close. As for your stomach, occasional discomfort after eating is common, especially with a sensitive stomach. The bubbling and cramps could be due to gas or mild indigestion. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it’s something we should investigate further. Do you know what triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Ugh… triggers? Spicy food, mostly. And… street food. She always warned me about street food. She said it was full of… bugs. And… rich food. Like… fried things. It feels… heavy afterwards. Like a stone in my stomach. I used to eat everything when I was younger. She… she made me be careful. She always wanted me to be healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so spicy food, street food, and rich foods seem to be the triggers. That’s helpful. It sounds like you may have some sensitivity to certain foods, and it’s good that you’re aware of what causes your discomfort. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a couple of tests. A stool sample to check for any infections, and a blood test to rule out any underlying conditions like celiac disease or lactose intolerance. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh… tests? More tests? Is it bad? She always… she always knew what to do. She would have known what tests to order. She would have taken care of it. I don't like tests. They make me nervous. What if something is… wrong? What if it's serious?
DOCTOR: It's alright to feel nervous, Odell. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about tests. But these tests are just to get a clearer picture of what's going on, and to rule out anything serious. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something wrong. The stool sample is a simple test – you’ll just collect a small sample at home and bring it to the lab. The blood test is also routine, and we can get the results back quickly. It’s better to be safe and get everything checked out, so we can determine the best course of action. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Ugh… okay. If you think it’s necessary. But… please, be quick. I don't want to be here all day. And… can I have the instructions in writing? I forget things easily. She… she always remembered everything for me. She would have explained it all. Can… can you just tell me what happens? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. Here are the instructions for both tests. The stool sample is very straightforward – you’ll just collect a small sample in the container provided and bring it to the lab within 24 hours. The blood draw is also quick and relatively painless – the phlebotomist will just insert a needle into your vein to collect a small amount of blood. You may feel a slight pinch when the needle is inserted, but it shouldn’t hurt. And the entire process shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. The lab results will typically be available within a few days, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding spicy food, street food, and rich foods, and staying well-hydrated. And if you experience any worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions about the tests, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: Ugh… okay. I think… I think I understand. But… what if it’s something bad? What if I need… surgery? She always… she always took care of everything. She would have known what to do. I don't want to be alone. Is there… is there anything else I should know? Before I leave?
DOCTOR: It's alright to be scared, Odell. It's perfectly natural to worry about the unknown. But let's not jump to conclusions. The tests are just to gather information, and most of the time, they don't reveal anything serious. If, by chance, something does require further investigation, we'll discuss all your options and create a plan together. You won't be alone. Before you leave, I want to remind you to stay well-hydrated, avoid your trigger foods, and contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms. And if you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious, please don't hesitate to reach out to a trusted friend or family member, or consider speaking with a mental health professional. I also want to reassure you that I'm here to support you every step of the way. I know losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it's okay to lean on others for help. Do you have any other questions, or is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Ugh… No. I think… I think that's all. Thank you. For… for everything. I just want to go home. And… and sleep. Can… can I just leave now?
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. You can absolutely leave now. Take your time. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Take care of yourself, and get some rest. And if you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to reach out. I wish you all the best.
