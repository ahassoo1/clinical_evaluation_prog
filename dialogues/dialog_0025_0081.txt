DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia, good to meet you. So, you’re 18 years old… and quite tall, I see. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Fourney. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. My husband scheduled this appointment. I’ve been feeling rather… depleted lately, and experiencing excessive perspiration during the night. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, unbecoming. I would like to address it with some… efficiency.
DOCTOR: “Pleasure” is… a strong word, but we’ll work with it. Depleted and night sweats, you say. And you want to get to the bottom of this quickly. I appreciate directness. Now, when you say “depleted,” can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Well, it’s rather straightforward, Doctor. I simply lack… vigor. I used to be able to complete tasks with a certain… alacrity, and now I find myself requiring frequent rest. It’s impacting my ability to maintain my professional commitments, naturally. As a graphic designer, deadlines are rather… inflexible. It’s not as if I’m accustomed to being inefficient. It's quite a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: “Alacrity,” interesting choice of words. So, fatigue impacting your work. And it’s a new fatigue, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely new. It wasn’t… pervasive before. Perhaps the last three months, it’s become… noticeable. I certainly wasn’t requiring naps previously. My husband has commented on it as well; he says I’m… less vibrant. Though, naturally, his observations are… less precise than my own. He doesn’t possess the same… analytical capabilities.
DOCTOR: Three months… and your husband’s noticed a decline in your “vibrancy.” Right. And has anything changed in the last three months?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me consider… No, not significantly. My diet remains consistent; I prioritize lean proteins and a moderate intake of carbohydrates. I maintain a rigorous schedule, as I mentioned, and my workload hasn't decreased, merely… become more challenging due to this… lethargy. We did redecorate the bedroom, but I fail to see how that would be relevant. My husband insisted on a rather… garish floral wallpaper, but that is a matter of aesthetics, not physiology.
DOCTOR: Garish wallpaper...Of course. Alright. Let’s move past the décor. Any fever, chills, unintentional weight loss, changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven’t been feeling feverish. Chills, occasionally, but nothing consistent. Unintentional weight loss… That is a rather impertinent question, Doctor. I maintain a strict regimen, as I’ve stated, and my weight is quite stable. Perhaps a negligible fluctuation, but certainly not… significant. As for appetite, it remains… adequate. Though, I confess, I lack the same enthusiasm for culinary pursuits as I once did. It’s… less enjoyable, naturally, when one is feeling depleted.
DOCTOR: “Impertinent?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, I believe a straightforward inquiry about my health is perfectly acceptable. However, suggesting a lack of control over my weight is… somewhat presumptuous. I am a professional woman who values discipline and self-regulation. To imply otherwise is… frankly, a bit insulting. I assure you, I am perfectly aware of my physical state and maintain it to a… satisfactory standard.
DOCTOR: Very well. I simply ask questions to gather information, Jailia. It's my job. Let's try this. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Doctor, are you… seriously inquiring about my… elimination schedule? I find this line of questioning rather… undignified. I assure you, my bodily functions are operating within… acceptable parameters. This is hardly relevant to my fatigue and night sweats. I’m beginning to question the efficacy of this consultation. Perhaps I should seek a second opinion.
DOCTOR: Look, Jailia. Sometimes seemingly unrelated symptoms are related. I’m trying to get a complete picture. But if you're unwilling to provide basic information, it’s going to be difficult. I'm not trying to be… undignified. I'm trying to help you. Now, one last time. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns, besides the night sweats?
PATIENT: Doctor, I am perfectly willing to cooperate… within reasonable boundaries. My sleep patterns… well, they are frequently disrupted, naturally, by the excessive perspiration. I find myself waking multiple times throughout the night, requiring adjustments to my bedding. And I often struggle to fall asleep initially; my mind tends to… race. I maintain a rigorous schedule, as I’ve mentioned, and it’s often difficult to… unwind. Though, I assure you, this is a result of my professional commitments, not some… underlying ailment. I find it rather… illogical to attribute my fatigue to a mere lack of… relaxation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam then. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your temperature. Please lie back on the exam table. And please, try to refrain from… elaborating on your schedule. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Temperature is 98.7. Blood pressure is 118 over 72. Reflexes are normal. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No pain. I maintain excellent posture, Doctor, and I am rather particular about my physical well-being. I assure you, any discomfort would be immediately… addressed. It's… illogical to assume I would neglect such matters. Though, I must confess, this examination is proving… rather perfunctory. Are you intending to order any… diagnostic tests? Perhaps a blood analysis to ascertain the underlying cause of my fatigue? I believe that would be a more… productive course of action than merely… listening to my heartbeat.
DOCTOR: Perfunctory?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, I expected a more… comprehensive assessment. I am a professional woman with discerning standards, and I believe my concerns warrant a thorough investigation. I’m not accustomed to being dismissed with mere… auscultation and palpation. I’m quite certain there’s an underlying physiological explanation for my fatigue and night sweats, and I trust you possess the expertise to… identify it. Perhaps a consultation with a specialist would be… beneficial?
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailia. We will order some tests. Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, and vitamin D levels. We'll also check your iron levels. And to be thorough, I'm going to order a urine analysis. I'll get the orders sent to the lab. You'll need to schedule an appointment for blood draw. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and decide on a course of action. Does that… satisfy your standards?
PATIENT: That is… acceptable, Doctor. A comprehensive analysis is precisely what I expected. I trust the laboratory is… reputable? I wouldn’t want inaccurate results skewing the diagnosis. And if you wouldn’t mind, I would appreciate a copy of the test results for my… personal records. I prefer to maintain a… detailed understanding of my own physiology. I trust that is not an unreasonable request?
DOCTOR: The lab is certified, yes. And you will, of course, receive a copy of the results. It takes about three to five business days for them to come back. In the meantime, try to get some rest, Jailia. And perhaps… reconsider the garish wallpaper. Stress can exacerbate these symptoms. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that concludes our… consultation. I appreciate you accommodating my… requests. As for the wallpaper… I shall convey your… suggestion to my husband. Though I doubt it will be… well-received. Good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Good day to you as well, Jailia.
