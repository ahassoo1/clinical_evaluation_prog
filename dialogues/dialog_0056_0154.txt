DOCTOR: Hi Claudene, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… the waterworks, really. Been a bother. A real bother, it has. I don’t… I don’t quite recall when it started, exactly. Just… frequently, I have to go. And it… burns.
DOCTOR: Okay, the waterworks… frequent urination and burning. I understand. It is bothersome. Let's try to get a little more specific, if you don't mind. When you say “frequently,” about how often are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specifics… that’s… difficult. More than usual, certainly. I used to be able to… well, I don’t remember how often, truthfully. Perhaps… every couple of hours? Maybe less? It's hard to say. I just know it’s… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, more than usual and disruptive. And you mentioned burning – is that with every urination, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… most times. Not always, but… usually. It’s a stinging, you see. Not a terrible pain, but… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I don't recall it not happening for very long, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly with urination, a stinging sensation. And it's been happening consistently for a while now. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Blood? No, I don’t think so. I haven’t… looked, if I’m honest. I just feel the stinging. And back pain… well, my back always aches, you know, being my age. But not… specifically with this. No, I don’t think so. It’s just… the waterworks and the stinging.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. And have you been having any fever, chills, or nausea?
PATIENT: Fever…? Oh goodness. I haven't taken my temperature in… well, a very long time. No, I don’t feel feverish. And no, not nauseous either. Just… tired, generally. But that could be anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or nausea, just general tiredness. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear, medical history… That’s… a long time ago. I was divorced, you know. My husband… he handled all that. I… I think the doctor told me something, once. About my water? But I don’t recall what it was. No, I don’t think I have anything… serious. Just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. We can try to figure things out. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized…? Oh, yes. A long time ago. When I was younger. For… my appendix, I think. And… something else. But it was so long ago, I truly don’t recall the details. It wasn’t serious, I don’t believe. Just… a routine thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I don’t take anything. I try to stay natural, you see. Just a bit of chamomile tea sometimes, for sleeping. But nothing… regular. Nothing the doctor prescribed, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, just chamomile tea occasionally. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Perhaps a bit of a sniffle with pollen, but that’s all. No serious allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? Oh, dear. That was… a long time ago. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. And my father… he smoked, terribly. But I don't recall… anything specific about water problems, if that’s what you mean. It was a long time ago, you see. And we didn’t talk much about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright. We'll proceed as best we can. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. It'll just involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a quick urine sample to check for infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a sample? Yes, I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do, you see. And listening… yes, alright. But gently, please. My back isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's get the urine sample. I'll give you a cup and instructions. Please try to collect a midstream sample - that means you start urinating, then collect a little bit in the cup, and finish urinating. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Midstream… oh dear. Is that difficult? I’m not very good at instructions, you see. Just… go in the cup? Is that all? And… how long will this take?
DOCTOR: No, don't worry, it's not difficult. It just means letting a little bit of urine out first, then collecting the sample. It helps to make sure we get a cleaner sample. Here’s a cup and some instructions. hands Claudene a cup and a printed instruction sheet. There's a restroom just down the hall. Take your time. I’ll be right here when you're finished. Let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: Oh… very well. Thank you, Doctor. She takes the cup and instructions hesitantly, looking confused. Down the hall, you say? She slowly turns and shuffles toward the restroom, clutching the cup.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s see what we can find. Hopefully, the sample will give us a starting point.
PATIENT: .
