DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It's… a pleasure, I suppose. I've been experiencing an awful lot of thirst lately, and… well, hunger too. More than usual, certainly. It's rather bothersome, to be frank. I'm hoping you can shed some light on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Increased thirst and hunger can be quite disruptive. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It's been… perhaps the last month or so? It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual increase. At first, I just noticed I was refilling my water glass more often. Then the hunger started, and… well, it's just been building from there, I suppose. It’s difficult to pinpoint an exact date, if that’s what you're asking. Sorry, I'm not very precise with these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Erxleben. A gradual onset is helpful information nonetheless. And no need to apologize for not being precise; we’ll get to the bottom of this together. Now, regarding the thirst and hunger, is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, I’d say. The thirst is pretty much there all day, though it does seem worse after… exertion, perhaps? Like if I’ve been doing a bit of work around the house. The hunger… that’s more of a nagging feeling, constantly reminding me. It’s not like sudden cravings, just… emptiness. Does that make any sense? I feel rather foolish trying to explain it.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Erxleben, and you’re not foolish at all for trying to explain it. It’s helpful to hear the nuances of how you're experiencing these symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination…? Let me think again. I… believe I've been going to the bathroom more often, yes. Especially at night. It's a bit disruptive, to be honest. I didn’t think it was worth mentioning before, as I… well, I assumed it was just a side effect of the increased fluids. But yes, more frequent trips to the lavatory, particularly when I should be sleeping. Is that significant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is significant, Mr. Erxleben. Increased urination, especially at night – what we call nocturia – along with increased thirst and hunger, are all symptoms that can point us in a certain direction. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Let me see… I've been feeling rather tired lately, more so than usual. And… perhaps a bit more irritable, if I’m being honest. My ex-wife would certainly agree with that last point, I imagine. No, that’s about it, I think. Nothing major. Just generally feeling a bit run down. I haven't noticed any weight loss or anything like that, if that’s what you're wondering.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s all very helpful. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing of the sort. I've always been fairly healthy, to be frank. A bit of a cold now and then, of course, but nothing serious. My family history… well, my father had high blood pressure, I believe. But aside from that, nothing particularly noteworthy. I try to eat reasonably well and get a bit of exercise when I can. Nothing strenuous, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible, if I’m being honest. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about it. I prefer to deal with things naturally, if I can. I've got a rather sensitive stomach, so I'm wary of putting anything too artificial into it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years without issue. I suppose I could be allergic to something I haven't encountered yet, but I haven't had any adverse reactions to anything thus far. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Now, Mr. Erxleben, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’d also like to do a quick neurological exam and check your feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I suppose it's all part of the process. I'm not particularly fond of examinations, but I understand it’s important. Just… please be gentle with my feet. I’ve always had sensitive soles. Go ahead when you’re ready. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Erxleben. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Alright, that doesn't sound too terrible, I suppose. There you are. Is that alright? I did have a rather strenuous morning unloading some crates, so perhaps my blood pressure is a little higher than usual. I wouldn’t normally be so… vigorous. It’s a rather tiresome job, you see. Do you need me to do anything else?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Grip strength is normal. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let’s take a look at your feet. Your feet appear healthy, but I do notice some decreased sensation in your toes. It's subtle, but present. This, along with your symptoms of increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue, raises a concern for possible diabetes. I would like to order a blood glucose test and a Hemoglobin A1c test to get a better understanding of your blood sugar levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Good heavens. That’s… rather concerning, isn’t it? My mother had some issues with her sugar levels towards the end, I believe. Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever tests you deem necessary. I’d like to know what’s going on, regardless of the outcome. Perhaps early detection is the best course of action, if that’s the case. So, yes, please go ahead with the tests. What does this involve, exactly? A simple blood draw, I presume?
DOCTOR: Yes, it will involve a simple blood draw. We’ll need to draw a small amount of blood to check your current glucose level, and another sample to measure your A1c, which gives us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll write you a requisition form. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend trying to drink plenty of water, but avoid sugary drinks, and continue to eat a balanced diet. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything quite clearly, Doctor. Just… when should I expect the results? And is there anything I should be particularly watchful for in the meantime, aside from the things you mentioned? I must admit, I'm rather anxious about this whole business. It’s not the sort of news one hopes to receive, is it? I suppose I’ll just try to remain calm and await your call. Thank you for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Erxleben. I understand your anxiety, and it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The lab typically takes 24 to 48 hours to process the results, so I anticipate having them by August 4th. I will call you directly with the findings as soon as I have them. In the meantime, besides staying hydrated and maintaining a healthy diet, be mindful of any unusual symptoms like blurred vision, unexplained weight loss, frequent infections, or slow-healing sores. These could be indicative of elevated blood sugar levels, but please don’t panic. We'll address everything once we have the results. Here's my direct number, should you have any questions or concerns before then. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s all. Thank you again for your thoroughness and your kindness. It’s… reassuring to know someone is taking this seriously. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I suppose I'll just head down to the lab now and get this over with. Have a good day. And thank you once more.
DOCTOR: You as well, Mr. Erxleben. Please don't hesitate to reach out if anything concerns you. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day.
