DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Don't like it.
DOCTOR: I see. Dry eyes can certainly be bothersome. Could you tell me a little more about when this dryness started?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start… not sure exactly. Maybe… a couple months now? Hard to say for sure. Old man, forget things. It’s just… always a little scratchy. Worse some days than others.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult to pinpoint the exact start date. A couple of months is helpful. And you mentioned it's a scratchy sensation—is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly worse when it's windy. I work outside, you see. Cement work. Lots of dust. Wind blows it right in your face. Makes it bad. Other times, it's okay. Not great, but… livable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be exacerbated by your work environment, which is very helpful information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the dryness and scratchiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes my eyes feel like there’s something in them. Like a little piece of grit. I blink a lot to try and get it out, but it doesn’t always work. And… I guess they get a little red sometimes. Not always though.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gritty sensation and occasional redness. Have you tried anything to alleviate the dryness or discomfort?
PATIENT: Not really. I tried… some drops once. My neighbor gave me some. Didn’t seem to do much. Just stung a little. Didn’t use ‘em again. I mostly just… deal with it. Old man tough, you know? But it’s getting… annoying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you tried something, even if it wasn't helpful. It sounds like those drops may not have been the right fit for you. Now, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… old age. Knees ache, back aches. Normal stuff for a guy my age. Never been to the hospital for much. Nothing serious. No… diabetes or anything like that. I don't think. I mean, the doctor told me something a long time ago… but I don’t remember what.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Too scared of hospitals. Always been healthy enough to avoid ‘em, I guess. Just a few broken bones when I was younger, working construction. But they just set ‘em and put a cast on. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family… my mother, she had… something with her heart. I think. She was sick for a long time. And my brother… he had trouble with his eyes when he got older. Couldn’t see very well. But… that’s about all I know. We didn't talk much about it. Not a family that talks about feelings, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s helpful information nonetheless. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had allergies. Eat anything. Take anything. Never bothered me none. Dust bothers my eyes, but that ain’t an allergy, is it? Just… dust. Makes ‘em dry.
DOCTOR: No, dust isn’t an allergy, it's an irritant. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take nothin'. Don’t like pills. Makes me feel… funny. Just a little aspirin sometimes for my knees, but not even regular. Maybe once a month. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your eyes, if that's alright with you. I'll check your vision, look at the surface of your eyes, and assess the dryness. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. I got things to do. Don't want to be here all day. Let's go.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I understand. Okay, please cover your left eye with your hand. Can you read the smallest line you can see on this chart?
PATIENT: Umm… let me see… that one… the one with the letters… it's blurry. Can't make out much. I think… maybe that one? The bigger one? It’s hard to say. My eyes ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We’ll work with that. Now, let’s switch eyes. Cover your right eye with your hand and try to read the chart with your left eye.
PATIENT: Worse. This one’s worse. Can’t see nothin’ much at all. Just… blurry shapes. This ain’t going to work, is it? Always had trouble seeing good. That’s why I always wore glasses when I was younger. But I lost ‘em… years ago. Don’t bother with ‘em anymore. Too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your vision has changed over time. Now, I'm going to take a closer look at the surface of your eyes. This won't hurt, I just need to shine a light in your eyes. Please try to look straight ahead. Hmm… I do notice some dryness and a little bit of redness in both eyes. There's some mild inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is the clear membrane that covers the white part of your eyes. I don't see any foreign bodies at the moment. Your pupils are also a bit sluggish in their reaction to light, which could be related to your age and overall health.
PATIENT: Sluggish? What does that mean? Is that bad? I don’t like hearing “sluggish.” Sounds… old. Just tell me what this means. Am I going blind?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Pipolo, it doesn’t mean you’re going blind. “Sluggish” simply means your pupils don’t react as quickly as they used to when I shine the light in your eyes. This is not uncommon with age and can be caused by a variety of factors. It doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem. Based on my examination, it appears you have moderate dry eye disease, likely exacerbated by your outdoor work environment and exposure to dust and wind. The redness and inflammation are consistent with that diagnosis. Now, we can discuss some treatment options to help alleviate your symptoms. Would you like to hear about those?
PATIENT: Treatment options… alright. Sure. I guess. But keep it simple. I don't want to be putting drops in my eyes all day. And I don't want to spend a lot of money. Just tell me what's simple and cheap. And quick. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I will keep it simple and focus on affordable options. The mainstay of treatment for dry eye is artificial tears. There are many different brands available, and some are more effective than others. We can start with a basic, preservative-free artificial tear to see if that provides relief. You would use these several times a day, as needed, to lubricate your eyes. Another simple option is to use a warm compress on your eyes for 5-10 minutes each day. This can help to stimulate tear production and reduce inflammation. A warm, damp washcloth works perfectly fine. For your work environment, I strongly recommend wearing wraparound sunglasses or safety glasses to protect your eyes from dust and wind. These are the first steps we can take. If these don’t provide sufficient relief, we can consider other options, such as prescription eye drops or a referral to an ophthalmologist. Does this sound manageable?
PATIENT: Sunglasses I got. Always wear ‘em workin’. Washcloth… can do that. Drops… alright. I guess. But what kind? And how much do they cost? Don't want to spend a fortune on somethin’ that won’t work. And how often? You said ‘several times a day’. How several? This is gettin’ complicated. Just tell me the cheapest, easiest thing to start with. And don’t make it a long list.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask for clarity. Let's keep it as simple as possible. For the artificial tears, I recommend starting with Systane Ultra Preservative-Free. They’re readily available at most pharmacies and generally cost around $12-$15 for a bottle. As for how often to use them, start by putting 1-2 drops in each eye 4 times a day – once in the morning, before lunch, before dinner, and before bed. If your eyes feel dry in between, you can use them as needed. Don’t be afraid to use them more frequently if you’re working outdoors in dusty conditions. The key is to find what works best for you. We can adjust the frequency as needed. So, to summarize: continue wearing your sunglasses, start using a warm compress daily, and try Systane Ultra Preservative-Free 1-2 drops in each eye 4 times a day, or more if needed. We can reassess in a month to see how you’re doing. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Alright. That… that I can do. Sunglasses, washcloth, drops. I'll try it. A month, you said? And then what? Come back and you poke my eyes again? Look, I’m an old man. I don’t want to be comin’ back here every month for nothin’. If this don’t work, just tell me straight. I’ll live with dry eyes. Now, is that all? Can I go now? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Pipolo, that is all for now. And no, you won’t necessarily need to come back every month. If after a month of consistent use, you don't notice any significant improvement, or if your symptoms worsen, then we can discuss other options, such as a referral to an ophthalmologist who can perform more specialized testing. If you do experience relief, we can continue with the current regimen and schedule a follow-up appointment in six months to ensure your symptoms remain controlled. I understand your concerns about frequent visits, and I assure you, I will not push unnecessary appointments. My goal is to help you find a solution that works for you and allows you to live comfortably. Thank you for your time, Mr. Pipolo. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office. Now, you go and have a good day. And please, protect your eyes.
PATIENT: Alright. Thanks. I'll try it. And I will. Protect ‘em. .
