DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my heart, it feels funny sometimes. Like, it beats too fast, but not always. It’s hard to explain. It’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Funny” is a good way to describe it when it’s hard to pinpoint. So, it sounds like you're experiencing palpitations – that is, a feeling of your heart beating faster or irregularly. You said “sometimes.” Can you tell me more about when these episodes happen?
PATIENT: Episodes? You mean when it happens? Okay. Not when I work, never when I work. Mostly… when I’m resting. Like, sitting and watching TV with my wife. Or… before I go to sleep. Sometimes just… when I’m doing nothing. It doesn't last long, maybe a few seconds, then it stops. It's just... makes me worry.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it happens primarily at rest – watching TV, before bed, or just generally when you're not active. A few seconds in duration, and then it resolves on its own. That’s helpful information. And you’re right to get it checked out if it’s causing you worry. Now, do you notice anything else happening when this occurs?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. I don't feel dizzy. No pain, not in my chest, not anywhere. I don't get short of breath. Just… the fast beating. Sometimes… maybe a little tired after, but that could be anything, right? I work hard.
DOCTOR: Yes, that could certainly be from working hard. No dizziness, no pain, no shortness of breath – those are all good things to know. Just the palpitations and a little fatigue afterward. Now, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Yes. A few times, maybe last year. Not very often, though. I thought it was just stress, you know? Work was busy. But it's happening more now, so I thought I should see a doctor. I don’t want it to be something bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it happened sporadically last year, and you attributed it to stress, which is reasonable. It's good you’re getting it checked out now that it's becoming more frequent. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of – high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m usually healthy. I eat okay, I think. I don't smoke, don't drink much. My wife always tells me I need to relax more, but… work is work. I’ve never been to the hospital for anything serious. Just… cuts and scrapes when I was a kid. Nothing like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. No pre-existing medical conditions, you don’t smoke or drink heavily, and no significant medical history. That's helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. I’m… lucky, I guess. I try to be careful. I work with… machines, so you have to be. No surgeries, no… big illnesses. Just this heart thing now. It’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s good. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Um… my father, he had… problems with his stomach, I think. He died when I was young. My mother, she was okay, mostly. She had… high blood pressure, maybe? She took pills for it. But… no one in my family had… heart problems that I know of. Not really. It’s just… my wife worries a lot, so now I worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had stomach problems, and your mother had high blood pressure. No known family history of heart problems. And I understand your wife’s worry is contributing to yours. That’s very common. Now, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. I try to stay away from them. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache, but that’s it. Nothing regular. No pills for my heart, nothing at all. I prefer to… just deal with things. But this… this feels different.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. My wife makes me try new foods all the time. No problems with anything. No rashes, no… trouble breathing. Nothing. I’m pretty lucky, I think. But this heart thing… I don't feel lucky about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. That’s good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and just do a general assessment. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I want to know what’s going on. Listen to my heart, check my… pulse. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I just… want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Your heart rhythm is regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s faint, so it may not be significant, but it’s worth investigating further. Your lungs are clear. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute and regular. I don't feel any swelling in your extremities. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be comfortable with an EKG – that’s an electrocardiogram, it measures your heart's electrical activity – and a basic blood panel to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and thyroid levels?
PATIENT: EKG… and blood tests? Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to know what’s wrong. My wife will be happy I’m getting it checked out. She worries a lot. Electrical activity… sounds complicated. But if it will help… yes, do the tests. When can I do them?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can do the EKG and blood draw right here in the clinic today. It will take about 30 minutes for the EKG and a few minutes for the blood draw. The blood results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. While we're waiting for the results, are there any other symptoms you've noticed that we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just the fast beating… and a little tired after. Sometimes it feels like… a flutter, you know? Like a bird flapping its wings in my chest. But it doesn’t last long. Just a few seconds. I don’t… I don’t think there’s anything else. I’m pretty sure. It just makes me… anxious, you know? Worrying about it. My wife says I need to relax. But… it’s hard. I have work.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fluttering sensation, and anxiety related to the episodes. I understand. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when experiencing these symptoms. Let’s get those tests done, and then we’ll discuss the results when they come back. In the meantime, I’ll give you a pamphlet on managing anxiety – some simple breathing exercises and relaxation techniques. And I would like you to keep a log of when these episodes occur—what you were doing, how long they lasted, and any other symptoms you experienced. This will be helpful for us to understand the pattern. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A log… I can do that. Write down when it happens. And… breathing exercises. My wife will be happy about that. She always tells me to breathe. I’ll write everything down. How long should I… log it for? A week? A month? I don’t want to… bother you too much. I just want this fixed.
DOCTOR: A week should be sufficient to start. If the episodes are infrequent, a week will give us a good baseline. If they happen more often, we can extend it. Don’t worry about bothering me – that’s what I’m here for. Alright. I’ll have the nurse come in to get you started with the EKG and blood draw. We'll take it one step at a time, Mr. Puder. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Just… one step at a time. I like that. Thank you. I’m ready when you are. I trust you’ll figure it out. I just… want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. I will let the nurse know you are ready. We will do our best to get you back to feeling normal. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
