DOCTOR: Bula! And good day to you, Moshe. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you, Doctor Kimm. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here because… well, even with the machine, I’m still feeling awfully tired during the day. I was hoping you could take a look at it. It’s just… draining, you know? Makes it hard to get things done.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling tired even with the machine… that’s definitely something we need to investigate. Just to be clear, you're referring to a CPAP machine, for sleep apnea, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s the one. CPAP. My doctor – Dr. Ramirez, lovely woman – she diagnosed me about… oh, five years ago now, I believe. And the machine does help, I can't deny that. I used to be much worse. But it hasn't completely solved the problem, and lately, it feels like it’s been less effective. I still find myself nodding off in the afternoon, sometimes even while reading. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, five years on CPAP, still feeling tired despite using it… and noticing a recent decrease in its effectiveness. That gives us a good starting point. Let’s try to get a better picture of what's going on. First, can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like falling-over-exhausted tired, you understand. It's more… a heavy feeling. Like wading through mud, all the time. And it's hard to concentrate. I used to be able to read for hours, research things… now, I’ll read a page and realize I haven’t absorbed a thing. And I just don't have the energy to do much, even things I enjoy. I used to volunteer at the library, but I had to stop. Just didn't have the pep for it. It’s… sad, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds really draining, Moshe – wading through mud is a good way to describe it. And it’s completely understandable that it's upsetting to have to give up things you enjoy. Okay, let’s go through some more details. When you say “lately,” how long have you been feeling this increased tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… gradual, you see. But I'd say the last three or four months, it's definitely gotten worse. I thought maybe it was just the summer heat, you know? Everyone feels sluggish in this weather. But it hasn’t improved, even with cooler evenings. It’s… persistent, is the word. And it's starting to worry me. I don't want to end up completely useless, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months of worsening symptoms despite the change in weather. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your sleep besides the tiredness. Are you having trouble falling asleep?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can usually drift off alright. It’s staying asleep that’s sometimes a problem. I wake up a few times a night, usually to go to the bathroom, but sometimes just… because. It takes me a little while to get back to sleep then, sometimes quite a while. And I don't always feel rested when I wake up, even if I’ve been in bed for a good eight hours. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, you fall asleep okay, but have some awakenings during the night, and don’t always wake feeling refreshed. Okay. Now, let's move on to other things. Do you snore, Moshe?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes. My wife… well, ex-wife, now… she used to complain about it constantly. Said it sounded like a freight train. Even with the machine on, I think I still snore a bit. Not as bad, of course, but she could still hear it. I try to sleep on my side, which helps a little, but I often end up on my back during the night. It’s… a habit, I suppose. A bad habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, you still snore despite using the CPAP machine, and tend to sleep on your back. That’s good information. Now, aside from the tiredness and the sleep issues, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that you mention it, I have been a bit… forgetful lately. More so than usual, I mean. I always had a good memory, could remember details from years ago. But now I misplace things, forget appointments… little things, mostly. And sometimes I just struggle to find the right words. It's… frustrating, and a bit worrying, to be honest. It makes me wonder… is it just getting old?
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased forgetfulness and difficulty finding words. Those are important things to mention, Moshe. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, besides the sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I have mild arthritis in my knees, which flares up now and then. And I had my prostate removed about fifteen years ago. Other than that… not much. I used to have high blood pressure, but it's been well-controlled with medication for years now. And… oh, I had a bout of pneumonia about five years ago, but I recovered fully. I’m generally a pretty healthy man, all things considered. I always ate a good diet and tried to stay active. Before this tiredness started, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mild arthritis, prostate removal fifteen years ago, a history of high blood pressure that's well-controlled, and a bout of pneumonia five years ago. And just to clarify, are you currently taking any medications for any of those conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take a low dose of ibuprofen for the arthritis, when needed. And I take a medication called amlodipine for the blood pressure, ten milligrams every morning. And… that’s it. Just the two. And, of course, I use the CPAP machine every night. Religiously, you might say. I know how important it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, amlodipine 10mg daily for blood pressure, and consistent CPAP use. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My doctor – Dr. Ramirez, she always asked, and I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medication without any problems. I'm pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. Though, you know, I try to be careful. Don’t go eating anything strange, that sort of thing. But no known allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and looking in your ears and throat. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Go ahead. I'm used to doctor's visits, you know. Spent enough time in hospitals and clinics over the years, even if I'm generally healthy. Don't worry, I won't bite. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/72, which is a little elevated, but not terribly concerning given you were just talking. Your heart sounds regular, and lungs are clear to auscultation. I'm going to listen to your heart again, and then I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears look normal. Throat is clear, no obvious signs of infection. Your reflexes are normal, and strength is good in all your extremities. Overall, your physical exam is pretty unremarkable. Now, based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like your tiredness could be caused by a number of things. We need to do some further investigation.
PATIENT: That makes sense. I figured it wouldn’t be a simple answer. What sort of investigation are we talking about? I’m not afraid of a few tests, I just… I'd like to know what to expect, you know? And if there’s anything I need to do to prepare for them.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. First, I'd like to order a complete blood count, or CBC, to check for anemia or any other blood disorders. And I’d like to check your thyroid function, as an underactive thyroid can cause tiredness and forgetfulness. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels, as deficiency is common and can contribute to fatigue. Then, given your history of sleep apnea and ongoing tiredness despite CPAP use, I think it's important to repeat a sleep study, even if it’s just a home sleep apnea test. Sometimes the pressure settings on the CPAP machine need to be adjusted, or other sleep disorders may be present. Finally, because of the forgetfulness, I’d like to consider a cognitive screening test, just as a baseline. It's a quick, simple test that can help us monitor any changes in your memory and thinking skills over time. Do all those tests sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very thorough, Doctor Kimm. I appreciate you taking the time to look into everything so carefully. All those tests sound fine to me. A blood count, thyroid check, vitamin D… sleep study again… and the memory test. Yes, let’s do them all. The more information, the better, I always say. When can we get these done? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for any of them? Like, should I stop taking anything beforehand?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’ll write you out a requisition for the blood work. You can get that done at the lab just down the street - they don’t need an appointment. It's best to fast for eight hours beforehand, meaning no food or drink except water. For the sleep study, the nurse will give you instructions on how to set up the home sleep apnea test. It’s fairly straightforward, but it’s important to follow the instructions carefully. The cognitive screening test we can do right here in the office today, if you’re up to it. It’ll take about ten minutes. As for medications, just continue taking everything as usual unless I specifically tell you otherwise. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly clear. Fast for eight hours for the blood work, instructions from the nurse for the sleep study, and we can do the memory test today. And keep taking my regular medications. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease already just by being so thorough. It's good to know someone is taking this seriously. Let’s get that blood work done first, then. And I’m happy to do the memory test whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Here's the requisition for the blood work. And let's go ahead and do the cognitive screening test now. It’s just a few simple questions and tasks. It won’t be painful, I promise. The nurse will get you set up for that right away. She’ll be in shortly. In the meantime, let me document everything we’ve discussed today…
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm. I’ll go and wait for the nurse.
