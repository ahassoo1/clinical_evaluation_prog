DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. Or… is it Jeannemarie?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Galena. Jeannemarie is fine, please. It’s nice to meet you.
DOCTOR: Good morning to you as well, Jeannemarie. Nice to meet you too. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… a little embarrassing to talk about, but I’ve been coughing up some blood. Not a lot, but enough to worry me. It started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood… right. Okay. Noted. And when you say a few days ago, can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. I woke up and there it was. It hasn’t happened every time I cough, but it’s been… three times now, I think.
DOCTOR: Three times since Tuesday. Okay. And is it bright red blood, or more… darker?
PATIENT: It’s… bright red, Doctor. Not dark at all. And it’s not a huge amount, like I said. More like… streaks, mixed in with the mucus. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Streaks of bright red blood with the mucus. Alright. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. Maybe… when I lie down flat? It seems to happen more easily then. But I’m not sure. I haven't been doing anything different lately.
DOCTOR: Lying flat seems to exacerbate it… okay. And any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Well, I've been a little tired, I suppose. But I thought that was just… getting older. And maybe a little bit of a chest discomfort, but nothing really bad. Like a… a dull ache, sometimes. Not sharp, you know?
DOCTOR: Tiredness and a dull chest ache… alright. Now, have you had a fever, chills, or any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And… no, I don’t think I’ve lost any weight. Maybe a little, but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. It’s hard to say, honestly. I eat pretty normally.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I was… my husband, he passed away last year. He had some heart trouble, but that was him, not me. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. I don't have any allergies I know of.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. Alright, so generally healthy, no known allergies… Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no hospital stays. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago, but that’s it. And… nothing else. I really try to avoid doctors, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, it sounds like you've been quite fortunate so far. Now, just to be thorough, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband smoked, unfortunately, but I always told him to stop. I've always been very careful about my health. I don’t drink much alcohol either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, non-smoker, occasional alcohol… Good. And are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother… she had something with her lungs, maybe pneumonia? It was a long time ago, and I wasn't very close to her. I don’t really know much beyond that, to be honest. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, and then I’d like to take a look in your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up a little straighter for me… Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs with this stethoscope. Try to breathe normally. Deep breaths in and out… Good. … Okay. A few crackles on the lower right side, but nothing too concerning at this point. Now, let’s take a look at your throat… … Hmm… a little bit of redness, but no obvious signs of infection. Alright. It is difficult to see clearly with just this examination. I think we should do a chest X-ray just to be on the safe side.
PATIENT: An X-ray? Oh… is that serious, Doctor? I’m a little worried now. Is it something bad? I just… I’ve never had one before.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be worried, Jeannemarie. It's a standard precaution, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your lungs. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. The crackles I heard and the small amount of blood you are coughing warrants investigation. We need to rule out any potential issues like pneumonia, bronchitis, or… less common things. The X-ray is quick and painless, and will give us a much better idea of what we’re dealing with. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know? But if it will help find out what’s wrong, then please, go ahead. Where will the X-ray be done? And will I have to wait long? I have a small appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your apprehension. The X-ray is just a quick image, no poking or prodding involved. It’s done right here in the clinic. The technician is very efficient; it should only take about fifteen to twenty minutes, including the wait time. And it shouldn’t interfere with your afternoon appointment at all. Let me write you a referral, and I'll have the nurse schedule you right away. In the meantime, if you cough up any significant amount of blood – more than just streaks – or develop a fever or shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. And… what about after the X-ray? Will you tell me the results right away? I'm a little anxious, I must admit. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety completely. I will review the results as soon as they are available, and I’ll let you know as soon as possible. Usually, it takes an hour or two, but the nurse will let you know. If there are any urgent findings, we'll contact you immediately, of course. If it’s nothing serious, I’ll explain the results to you here in the clinic, and we can discuss a plan. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re just being thorough. Let me write this referral now.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor Galena. I appreciate your patience. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jeannemarie. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. The nurse will come in shortly to schedule your X-ray and answer any further questions you might have. Don’t hesitate to ask her anything at all. And please, if anything changes – any change – don’t hesitate to call the clinic, even if it seems minor. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll go speak with the nurse now. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care now, Jeannemarie. And don’t worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
