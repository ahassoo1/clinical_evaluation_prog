DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, I see here you’re 88 years young. To start, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Eighty-eight, that’s right. Seems like yesterday I was a young man, eh? What brings me in... hmm. It's just… I get full awful quick these days. I haven’t really changed what I eat, but I don’t seem to be able to finish a plate anymore. It's a bit of a bother, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Full quickly, even without changes to your diet. A bothersome development, certainly. Could you describe what you mean by "full"?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like pain, or anything. Just… after a few bites, I just don’t want any more. Like my stomach’s telling my brain to stop, even though there’s still food on the plate. It's not a bad feeling, exactly, just… unsatisfying. And it happens pretty fast now. Not like it used to be, where I could put a good plate away. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Obarr. A sense of early satiety, as we call it – feeling full sooner than expected. And this has been a recent change, you say?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, quite recent. Maybe the last… six months or so? Hard to say exactly, time slips away when you get to be my age, you know? But definitely not something I used to deal with. I used to have a pretty good appetite, always did. My wife says I could eat a horse! But now… not so much. It’s just… different.
DOCTOR: Different, yes. And has this change in appetite been accompanied by any other symptoms, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I’ve noticed, really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s just getting old, isn’t it? No stomach pain, no… well, no changes in how things go, if you know what I mean. Just the getting full quick, mostly. And maybe a bit less energy, but I chalked that up to the summer heat, to be honest. It's been a warm one.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, no change in bowel habits. Fatigue, but attributed to the weather. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My wife does say my pants feel a little looser, now that you mention it. But I hadn’t really paid much attention. Maybe a couple of pounds? Nothing drastic. I wouldn't say I've been trying to lose weight, if that's what you mean. Just… things fit a bit differently, that’s all. It could just be the heat, making me sweat more, you know?
DOCTOR: A subtle weight loss, perhaps. We’ll certainly keep that in mind. Now, Mr. Obarr, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that was a long time ago. And I had a bit of trouble with my heart, maybe twenty years back, but they fixed it with a little… a little thing, a stent I think they called it? Been alright since then, mostly. I see my wife’s doctor for check-ups, she keeps a better track of these things than I do. I’m not on any regular medications, if that matters. Just a little something for my arthritis now and then, when it flares up.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy in childhood, heart stent placement approximately 20 years ago, and occasional medication for arthritis. And are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. My mother lived to be ninety-two, very healthy woman. Father… he had something with his lungs, I think. Emphysema or something like that, from working in the logging camps. And my sister… she had diabetes, later in life. Nothing too serious on my side of the family, as far as I know. Mostly just… old age getting to folks, you know? It's hard to keep track after a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. Maternal longevity, paternal lung condition, and a sister with diabetes. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re amenable. That includes listening to your heart and lungs, and gently feeling your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Been to doctors plenty in my eighty-eight years, so I'm used to poking and prodding. Go right ahead. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. My bones aren't what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Obarr. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are regular, though I do detect a slight murmur, consistent with your previous stent placement. Your lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished bilaterally, which is not uncommon at your age. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Do you experience any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. Not really. Feels… normal, I suppose. A little soft, maybe. I haven’t been as active this summer, so probably just a bit of… flabbiness. It doesn’t hurt or anything, just… soft. I used to have a six-pack, you know, back in my younger days. But those days are long gone.
DOCTOR: Alright, no tenderness to palpation, slightly soft abdomen. Given your history of early satiety, unintentional weight loss, and the findings of a slight murmur and diminished lung sounds, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests to start. These will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. Specifically, I’d like a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests, eh? Can’t argue with that. If it helps figure out what’s going on, then yes, absolutely. I don’t mind a little poke, as long as it gets me back to enjoying my meals again. Just tell me where to go, and when to expect the results. My wife usually handles these things, but I can certainly try to remember.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They will draw a small amount of blood. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. I will have my nurse, Sarah, contact your wife with the results once they are available. In the meantime, I’d also like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. Two weeks, that gives me time to… well, to think about what I’m going to eat when I can finally enjoy a full meal again! And having Sarah call my wife is a great idea, she’s much better at remembering these appointments than I am. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. It’s good to know someone is looking into it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It’s my pleasure. We'll get to the bottom of this together. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime – such as abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, or significant fatigue – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Now, Sarah will be in shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day, and please, try not to worry too much.
