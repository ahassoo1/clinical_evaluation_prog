DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about my…well, my stool. It's black. Been happening for a bit now, and my daughter, bless her heart, she insisted I come. I take those pills, you know, for the arthritis. The red ones. Been taking them for years, probably. Don't see what the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Black stool, you say. And you've noticed this for…how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe a month? Could be a little less. Hard to say, really. I don't spend that much time looking at it, if you get my meaning. It's just…darker than usual. And my daughter, Carol, she gets so worked up over everything. She read something on the internet, naturally. Always something with these kids and the internet.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And you mentioned arthritis medication. Those "red pills," as you call them. Do you happen to know the name of the medication, or perhaps the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. Names aren’t my strong suit. Let me see… Here it is. Naproxen. Yes, that’s it. Two a day, usually. Sometimes three if my joints are really acting up. Don’t go giving me a lecture about too much, though. They’re the only thing that keeps me moving, you know. Otherwise, I’d be stuck in a chair all day.
DOCTOR: Naproxen, two to three times daily. Alright. And aside from the change in stool color, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, my stomach's been a little… unsettled. Not bad, just… not right. And I'm tired. But honestly, at my age, who isn't tired? I thought it was just getting older, you know? My daughter says it could be… something serious. Honestly, she worries too much.
DOCTOR: Unsettled stomach and fatigue. Alright. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No vomiting, thank goodness. Appetite's fine, eat like a bird, always have. Maybe a little less than usual, but that’s just because… well, smaller portions these days. And the pain… sometimes a little ache, low down, but nothing to write home about. Just… discomfort, really. Like I said, nothing serious. Honestly, I think it’s just my age catching up with me. Doctors always blame everything on your age when you get old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool, besides the black color?
PATIENT: Blood? Good heavens, no. If there was blood, I’d know. Black is one thing, blood is…well, it's blood. I'm not completely oblivious, you know. I know what blood looks like. It's just…the color bothers me, that's all. Carol made a huge deal out of it. She said it could be… internal bleeding. Honestly, these kids and the internet.
DOCTOR: No visible blood in the stool. And you've been taking the Naproxen for years, with no prior issues?
PATIENT: Years! Oh, ages, I tell you. Since… well, since my knees started giving me trouble. No problems before, not until recently. Honestly, I think I just need a new bottle of the pills. Maybe they're old? Does medication go bad? My daughter never thought of that, always jumping to the worst conclusions. Are we almost done here? I have a garden to tend to, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical examination, Ms. Hatchard. Just a quick listen to your abdomen and check your vitals. It’s standard procedure. Then we can discuss next steps. It's important to rule out anything serious, even if you think it's "just your age."
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Must we? I hate doctors poking and prodding. But… fine. Just get it over with, then. The quicker we’re done, the quicker I can get back to my tomatoes. But don't expect me to lie down or anything. My back isn't what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll start by listening to your abdomen. Breathing sounds are normal. Palpating now… Tenderness in the lower quadrants… mild. No guarding. Do you experience pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little, yes. Not terrible, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, really. I told you, it's probably just gas. Or something I ate. Honestly, you doctors always make such a fuss over nothing. It's not like I’m doubled over in pain, you know? Are we nearly done? I have a prize-winning zucchini to check on. It’s very sensitive, you know. Needs constant attention.
DOCTOR: Mild tenderness, as you say. And your vital signs are… blood pressure 130/80, pulse 72, temperature normal. Ms. Hatchard, while it may be “just gas,” the black stool is concerning. Naproxen can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, even without overt symptoms. It’s important to investigate this further. We need to run some blood tests to check your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. We'll also need a stool sample to rule out other causes. I'm ordering a Complete Blood Count and a Fecal Occult Blood Test .
PATIENT: Blood tests? A stool sample? Honestly, this is ridiculous! All this fuss over a little black stool. I told you, it's probably just something I ate. Or the pills being old! Look, I don't have time for all this. I have a garden to tend to, and frankly, I feel perfectly fine. I think I'll just stick to my own remedies, thank you very much. I've wasted enough of my day here already. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, with all due respect, dismissing this could be detrimental to your health. The black stool is a significant finding. I understand you're busy, but these tests are crucial. I strongly advise you to reconsider. If you refuse the tests, I must document your refusal in your chart. And I strongly recommend you consult with another physician if you are unwilling to follow medical advice. I cannot be responsible for your health if you refuse a basic workup for a potentially serious condition. Will you allow me to order the blood tests and collect a stool sample?
