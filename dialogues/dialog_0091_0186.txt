DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Yeah, well, I'm trying out for a team… a sports team. Need to get checked out, make sure I’m still good to go, you know? Getting older, gotta be sure.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lamark. That’s a very sensible approach. It's always wise to ensure you're in good health before starting or resuming any physical activity, especially as we get older. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a bit more about the team you’re trying out for and the type of activity it involves?
PATIENT: It's… well, it's a bit of a long story. It's a… a wrestling team. Not professional or anything, more of a local thing. Keeps me active, keeps me… focused. It's mostly grappling, some lifting, the usual wrestling stuff. I haven't done it seriously in a few years though, that's why I'm here. Don't wanna pull a muscle or something.
DOCTOR: I see. Wrestling – that’s quite a physically demanding sport. Good on you for recognizing the importance of a check-up before getting back into it. A few years is enough time for things to change. To start, could you describe any specific concerns you have?
PATIENT: Specific concerns? Hmm. Not really concerns, exactly. Just… getting a little stiff in the mornings, you know? Back feels it mostly. And sometimes my knees ache a bit after… after I've been on them for a while. Nothing major, honestly. It's just… old age creeping in, I guess. I haven't had any injuries or anything, though. Not recently.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stiffness in the mornings and occasional knee discomfort are common as we age, but it’s important to investigate the cause, even if you haven’t experienced any acute injuries. To get a clearer picture, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as arthritis, or any other chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: No, not really. Never been diagnosed with anything. I've been pretty lucky, honestly. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox… but nothing serious. No arthritis, no… chronic anything. I try to eat alright, stay active… mostly. And I haven't been to the doctor much, if that makes sense. Just for check-ups now and then. I’m not insured, so… I try to avoid it if I can.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Lamark. It's good you've generally been healthy, and I understand your concerns about insurance. We'll do our best to be efficient and focus on what’s most important. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Nope. And haven't been in the hospital since I was a kid, when I broke my arm falling out of a tree. Stupid tree. Other than that, nothing. I try to avoid those places, if I can. Too many germs, you know? And… expensive.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. A clean medical and surgical history is very helpful. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My… my mother had some trouble with her heart when she got older. Had to take pills for it, I think. And my father… he had bad knees, always complaining about them. But other than that, not really. We weren’t really a family that talked much about health stuff, if I'm honest. Lots of stoicism in my family, I guess. Just tough it out. I don’t know much beyond that, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s helpful to know about your mother’s heart condition and your father’s knees. Family history can sometimes give us clues, even if the information is limited. Now, let's talk about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Never touched the stuff. Tried it once when I was a teenager, hated it. Makes me cough just thinking about it. I drink… sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe a glass of wine on the weekend. Nothing excessive. I don’t need any bad habits, if you know what I mean. Keeps me focused, keeps me… fit. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never. Waste of time and money, if you ask me. And bad for you. I like being clear-headed, thank you very much. I need to be sharp for… for things. For wrestling, mostly. And just… life. I don’t need any of that stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Lamark. I appreciate your honesty. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. Taken some antibiotics now and then, nothing bad ever happened. I haven't had any reactions to anything. I'm pretty lucky, honestly. I think my grandmother had some trouble with shellfish when she was younger, but that's it. Definitely not me. I'm good. Can move on, if you like. I’d like to get this over with, if that's okay.
DOCTOR: Certainly. That’s a very helpful overview, Lamark. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your current condition. We'll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your range of motion and any areas of discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Sounds good. Just… try to be quick, alright? I got… things to do. Wrestling practice and all that. But yeah, go ahead. Whatever you need to do. Just… let me know if I need to… move or anything.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as efficient as possible. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. First, let’s start with your vital signs. Could you please sit here on the table?
PATIENT: Alright. Let's just get it over with, yeah?
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark. Just relax your arm for me. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep that in mind. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me… Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your range of motion. Can you please raise both of your arms above your head for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That's… a little stiff. Always is in the mornings. Feels a bit… tight. Old age, I tell ya. Just tight.
DOCTOR: I see. There's a slight limitation in range of motion, and I notice some discomfort with elevation. Now, can you please bend over and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Oof. Nope. That's about it. Lower back's not what it used to be. Can't quite reach 'em anymore. Feels a bit… tight. Not painful, just… stiff.
DOCTOR: I see. There's limited flexibility, and you’re experiencing some stiffness in your lower back. Now, let's check your knees. Can you please bend each knee, one at a time, and let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: That one’s okay. Bit of a creak, but nothing major. That one's a little worse. Feels a bit… achy. Not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Especially on the inside. Like something's rubbing. Been like that for a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. There is some tenderness on the medial aspect of your left knee, and I can feel some crepitus with movement. No significant swelling at this time. Alright, Lamark. That completes the physical exam. Now, based on what you've told me and what I've observed, you appear to have some mild age-related stiffness in your lower back and some crepitus and tenderness in your left knee, likely indicative of some early osteoarthritis. However, we'll need to confirm this with some imaging.
PATIENT: Imaging? You mean… X-rays? I was hoping to avoid all that, if I'm honest. Expensive and all that. Is it really necessary? I just need to know if I can wrestle, not… what's wrong with my knees.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost, Lamark. It’s a valid point. However, an X-ray of your left knee would help us rule out any other underlying issues and determine the extent of the osteoarthritis, if present. Knowing the severity will help us create a safe plan for resuming your wrestling activities. While it may not be definitive, it will give us a clearer picture. Alternatively, we could pursue a conservative approach initially – physical therapy and over-the-counter pain relievers – but without imaging, we’re operating with less information, and there's a risk of exacerbating the condition. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Okay. X-rays. But just one. Just the knee. And can we do it quickly? I got practice later, you know. And… can you recommend somewhere affordable? I don’t want to get ripped off. This is already a headache.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lamark. Just the left knee, as you requested. We'll get the order sent over to the radiology department, and I can recommend a few facilities nearby that offer competitive pricing. I’ll have my assistant, Sarah, provide you with a list before you leave. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity that causes pain. Over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage discomfort, and applying ice packs to your knee for 15-20 minutes at a time can also be beneficial. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I got that. Ice and ibuprofen. Avoid pain. Okay. Sounds… reasonable. So, what do I do after the X-rays? How long will it take to get the results? And then… what? More expensive stuff? I just need to know if I can wrestle, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: The X-rays should be completed fairly quickly – typically within 30-45 minutes. The results will be sent back to me, usually within 24-48 hours. I will contact you as soon as I have them. Once I’ve reviewed the images, we can discuss the best course of action. Depending on the severity of the findings, this could range from continuing with conservative management – physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers, and modifying your training – to considering a referral to an orthopedist for further evaluation and potential treatment options, such as injections or, in rare cases, surgery. However, let's not jump ahead. We'll start with the X-rays and see what they reveal. I want to assure you that we'll work together to create a safe and effective plan that allows you to continue enjoying your wrestling activities if possible. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Just… get the X-ray order done. And tell Sarah about the cheap places, okay? I appreciate you not… pushing me into a bunch of stuff right away. That’s… good. I should probably get going. Practice, you know. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lamark. I understand. I’ll have Sarah send over the list of affordable radiology facilities immediately, and I’ll get the X-ray order sent over as well. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before I contact you with the results. And remember, take it easy and avoid any activities that cause pain. Thank you for coming in today. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
PATIENT: Thanks. Hopefully it’s not too bad. Gotta go. .
DOCTOR: Take care, Lamark. I’ll be in touch. .
