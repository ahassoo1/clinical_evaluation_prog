DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. I see you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s been… difficult to breathe, lately. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. I don’t… I don’t really know when it started, exactly. It just… gradually got worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Gradual onset of difficulty breathing and dry mouth and eyes. Can you tell me more about the difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… not like I can’t breathe at all, Doctor. It’s just… I have to work harder to get air. Like… when I walk, or even sometimes when I’m just sitting. It feels like my lungs aren't… filling up all the way? I hope that makes sense. And it feels… tight, sometimes. A little bit like… being out of shape, perhaps. Though I do try to stay active.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, exertion makes it worse, and you describe a sensation of tightness and not being able to fully expand your lungs. Is this tightness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I believe. It’s not… always there. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and others… others it’s quite bothersome. It seems… worse in the evenings, perhaps? Though that could just be… my imagination. I don’t… I’m not very good at remembering details, Doctor. It's frustrating. I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Kobler, we'll work through it together. The fact that it's intermittent and possibly worse in the evenings is helpful information. Do you notice anything that improves the breathing, like resting, or changing positions?
PATIENT: Hmm… resting does help, yes. If I sit down and… focus on breathing slowly, it does get a little bit easier. And… sometimes, if I drink water, it feels better for a little while. But it doesn’t last long. I don’t… I haven’t noticed anything else, really. I wish I had a better answer for you, Doctor. I feel like I'm not being very useful.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Ms. Kobler. Every detail is useful. The relief with rest and water is good to know. Now, you mentioned dry mouth and eyes. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside those, like a cough, fever, or any skin rashes?
PATIENT: No, no cough or fever. And… no rashes. Just the dryness. My eyes… they feel gritty, even when I close them. And my mouth… it’s just constantly thirsty, no matter how much I drink. It’s… uncomfortable. It doesn't hurt, exactly, just… persistently dry. I suppose… maybe a little bit of fatigue? But I attribute that to… everything, really. I don't… sleep very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dry mouth and eyes, a sensation of grittiness in the eyes, and some fatigue. Let's briefly discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Um… that’s… a difficult question, Doctor. I was divorced a few years ago, if that counts. And I… I had a bad flu once, a long time ago. But I don’t… I don’t really recall any formal diagnoses. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in… quite a while, honestly. It’s… embarrassing to admit. I’ve always been… relatively healthy, I thought. Just this… this new thing with the breathing.
DOCTOR: I understand. No prior medical diagnoses to note. And you haven't been to a doctor regularly recently. That's alright; we're here now. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries or hospitalizations. I’ve been very fortunate, I suppose. Just… this. And a broken arm when I was a child, but that healed perfectly. I truly don’t… I don’t have much medical history to offer, it seems. I apologize for being so unhelpful. Perhaps… perhaps there’s something I’m forgetting? It’s so frustrating.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Kobler. It's perfectly fine. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family—anything like asthma, allergies, autoimmune diseases, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s… a good question. My mother… she had some sort of arthritis, I believe. And my grandfather… he had a heart condition, I think. He passed away when I was very young, so I don’t… I don’t know much about it. My father was… very healthy, as far as I know. And I don't… I don’t have much contact with that side of the family, so I wouldn’t know about their medical history. It’s… difficult to say, really. I wish I could provide more information.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of arthritis in your mother and a heart condition in your grandfather. We'll make a note of those. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. I… I find it quite unpleasant, actually. And I… I try to avoid being around people who do. It… it makes it difficult to breathe, even just being nearby.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Only… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, once or twice a month. Nothing… excessive. I wouldn't say I drink regularly, Doctor. It's more of a… social thing, really. I don't… rely on it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications. Not even vitamins, usually. I… I try to eat a healthy diet, and I get plenty of… well, I try to get plenty of sleep. Though, as I mentioned, that’s been difficult lately. I don’t… I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. It… it makes me feel anxious, somehow.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Thank you for answering those questions, Ms. Kobler. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs and check your vital signs, and perhaps take a look at your eyes and mouth. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I… I trust your judgment. I just want to… figure out what’s going on, if that’s possible. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’m… a little nervous, but I suppose that’s to be expected.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please sit up straight and take a few deep breaths for me, that would be great. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… again… okay. Your breathing sounds are a little… diminished in the lower lobes, bilaterally. Not significantly, but noticeable. Blood pressure is 120 over 80. Pulse is 72, regular. Your eyes appear normal. Some mild dryness of the conjunctiva, but no significant inflammation. Your oral mucosa is also dry, with no visible lesions. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with this probe on your finger. Your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is within normal limits.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… a little concerning, about the breathing sounds. Though I don’t… I don’t understand what diminished means, exactly. Is that… bad? And the dryness… is that related to the breathing problems, perhaps? I just… I’m a little confused, Doctor. Perhaps you could explain it in simpler terms, if that’s not too much trouble. I… I apologize for asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Kobler, please ask any questions you have. It’s my job to explain things clearly. "Diminished" breathing sounds mean they're a bit quieter than expected when I listen to your lungs with the stethoscope. It can indicate some narrowing or obstruction in the airways, or sometimes just shallow breathing. It’s not necessarily an emergency, but it does warrant further investigation. As for the dryness, it could be related to several things. Dry mouth and eyes can sometimes occur together, and can be a symptom of certain underlying conditions, or can be caused by medications, or even just dehydration. It could be connected to the breathing issues, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Based on what you've told me, and my initial exam, I'm considering a few possibilities. One is something called Sjögren’s syndrome, which can cause dryness of the eyes and mouth, as well as fatigue and breathing difficulties. Another is asthma, although your symptoms don't quite fit the classic presentation. And finally, it’s possible this is related to allergies or a mild respiratory infection. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order a few blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your inflammatory markers, your thyroid function, and perform a test for Sjögren's antibodies. I also recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That… that sounds like a lot, Doctor. Sjögren’s syndrome… I’ve never heard of that before. And a chest X-ray… that sounds a little… intimidating. I suppose… if it’s necessary. I just… I’m worried about what it might reveal. Are these tests… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I… I apologize for being so anxious. It's just… I don't like being unwell, and I don’t like not knowing what’s going on. Perhaps… perhaps we could start with the blood tests, and see what those show? I’m not sure I’m ready for the X-ray just yet.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety completely, Ms. Kobler. It’s perfectly normal to feel worried when you’re unwell and facing uncertainty. The blood tests are very straightforward—a simple draw of blood from your arm. They’re not painful, just a brief pinch. As for the chest X-ray, it’s also a non-invasive procedure. You’ll stand in front of a machine, and it takes a quick image of your lungs. It doesn’t involve any radiation exposure that’s harmful. We can absolutely start with the blood tests first, as you suggest. That will give us some valuable information and help us decide if further imaging is needed. I’ll write you a requisition for the tests now. It should take about a week to get the results back, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, avoiding irritants like smoke, and getting plenty of rest. If your symptoms worsen—especially if you develop a fever, severe cough, or shortness of breath—please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so, Doctor. A week… that sounds like a long time, but I suppose it's necessary. And I will… I will try to stay hydrated and avoid irritants. Thank you… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for being so patient with me. I… I appreciate it very much. Perhaps… perhaps a glass of water would be a good idea right now. And I’ll schedule the follow-up appointment as soon as I can. I just hope… I hope it’s nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kobler. It's my job. And it's perfectly normal to feel anxious while waiting for results. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. A glass of water is an excellent idea. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I'll have the nurse give you the requisition for the blood tests and some information about Sjögren’s syndrome. Take care, and we’ll talk soon.
