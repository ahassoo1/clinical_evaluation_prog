DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, it’s…family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. A lot of heart trouble. And cancer. Not trying to be dramatic, but it feels like everyone just…drops dead before their time. I just want to know I’m not going to, you know? I guess I want some reassurance. Is that even possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Family history is definitely important, and it's good you're being proactive about it. It is possible to get a better understanding of your risk, and we can talk about what steps we can take. Let me pull up your information here… Twenty-four years old, and you’re insured with Medicare. Alright. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me a bit more about the heart trouble and cancer on your mother’s side?
PATIENT: Medicare because of…well, it’s a long story. Doesn’t matter. Okay, so, my grandmother – my mom’s mother – she had…I think it was congestive heart failure? She was always tired, always swelling up. Then, my aunt – my mom’s sister – she had breast cancer. Stage…Stage three, I think. Had a mastectomy and everything. And my uncle, on that side, he had lung cancer. Smoker, though. Doesn’t really count, does it? I try not to worry about the smoking thing. I don't smoke. It's just…a lot. And my mom has high blood pressure, always has. She’s on medication for it. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that's very helpful, thank you. It’s good you’re giving me this information. It does matter, even the smoking. It helps us understand the overall pattern. So, to clarify, that’s your maternal grandmother with congestive heart failure, your maternal aunt with breast cancer, your maternal uncle with lung cancer, and your mother with hypertension. Just to get a complete picture, has anyone else on either side of the family – your father’s side, or other relatives – had significant health problems, particularly heart disease or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My dad’s side… my grandfather, he had diabetes, but that was…old age, I think. He lived a pretty long life, actually. And my dad himself is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. No cancer that I’m aware of. My aunt on his side had…arthritis, really bad arthritis. Not exactly a life-threatening thing. Honestly, that's about it. Everything serious is on my mom’s side. That’s why I’m worried. It feels like a ticking time bomb, you know? Sorry. I get anxious about this stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Theriot. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way given your family history. It sounds like the majority of the concerning health issues are indeed concentrated on your mother’s side, which is good to know. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall health. Nothing too extensive right now. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds…fine. As long as it’s not too involved. I’m not really a fan of doctors, if you know what I mean. Not that you’re bad or anything. It’s just…the whole thing. I guess. Go ahead. Just…be quick, if you could? Thanks.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as efficient as possible. It won't take long. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 120/80, which is good. Pulse is 72. Everything sounds normal so far. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. Sometimes I get a little…palpitations, maybe? Like my heart skips a beat. But it doesn't happen often. And it goes away on its own. Probably just stress, I figured. I drink a lot of coffee. Is that bad? I know I should probably cut back, but…
DOCTOR: Occasional palpitations, potentially related to caffeine intake. That's good information. Caffeine can contribute to palpitations, so cutting back might be helpful. Given your family history, though, I’d like to order a few tests just to be on the safe side. An EKG – that's a simple heart tracing – to check your heart rhythm. And a basic metabolic panel – that's a blood test – to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. We can also check your cholesterol levels while we're at it. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Blood tests. I really hate needles. But…I guess if you think it’s necessary. Fine. Whatever it takes to…not end up like my mom and grandmother. So, an EKG and blood work. Are these going to be expensive? My Medicare…it doesn’t always cover everything. And I’m still paying off some bills. I really don’t want a huge medical bill right now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Theriot. Let me check your Medicare coverage here… Okay, good news. Both the EKG and the basic metabolic panel should be fully covered under your plan. There might be a small copay, depending on your specific plan details, but it shouldn't be substantial. I can have the billing department confirm the exact amount for you before you leave. We also should check for a BRCA gene mutation, given your aunt's breast cancer diagnosis. We can do a simple blood draw for that as well. Would you like to do that?
PATIENT: A…a what? A BRCA…mutation? Is that serious? Like, cancer serious? I don’t even know what that is. My aunt didn’t…she didn’t have any of those tests. She just…had the surgery and took the medication. Is this something I need to do? Because if it's going to be another expensive test… I'm starting to feel overwhelmed, honestly.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. BRCA stands for BReast Cancer gene. It's a gene that, when mutated, can significantly increase your risk of developing breast cancer, and sometimes other cancers as well. Your aunt’s diagnosis does warrant testing. It doesn’t necessarily mean you will get cancer, but knowing your genetic risk allows us to be proactive with screening and preventative measures. The test itself is a simple blood draw, and Medicare does cover BRCA testing for individuals with a family history of breast cancer. I highly recommend it. We can discuss the results and what they mean for you. If the test is positive, we can explore options like increased monitoring, preventative medication, or even prophylactic surgery, if that's something you'd consider. I can get the lab orders for all three tests – EKG, basic metabolic panel, and BRCA – and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about two weeks?
PATIENT: Two weeks? That feels like a long time to wait. But…I guess it is what it is. And knowing…knowing is better than not knowing, I suppose. Even if it’s bad news. Okay. Fine. Get the orders. All three tests. And schedule the follow-up. Two weeks. Just…please, no surprises? And can you make sure someone explains the results to me in…plain English? I don't want a bunch of medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will personally explain the results to you, and I promise to use plain English. No jargon. And I’ll make sure you have time to ask any questions you have. Here are the lab orders. The front desk will schedule the appointments for you. They can also answer any questions you have about the process. The lab is just down the hall. I know this is a lot to take in, Mr. Theriot. But you're doing the right thing by being proactive about your health. And I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me right now, before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just…getting the tests done. That’s all. I really appreciate you explaining everything, though. It’s…less scary when someone actually tells you what’s going on. Thank you. I guess I'll go schedule those appointments.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Theriot. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We're here to help. Have a good day.
