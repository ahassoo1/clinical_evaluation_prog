DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my breathing. It’s been bothering me. Specifically when I try to lie flat. It feels…difficult. Like there’s a weight on my chest. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A weight on your chest, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s the best way I can describe it. It’s not a pain, exactly. More…pressure. And it makes it hard to get a good breath when I’m lying down. I’ve noticed it for…oh, about a month now, I suppose. Maybe a little longer. It’s quite bothersome when I try to sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this gotten progressively worse over that month?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. At first, I just needed an extra pillow. Now…now I’m using two, and even then it’s not much help. It wakes me up at night, you see. I haven’t been getting a proper rest. It’s…inconvenient, to say the least. I'd like to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient. Right. And do you experience any other symptoms alongside this difficulty breathing when lying flat?
PATIENT: Well…let me think. My ankles have been a little swollen lately. Not terribly, but noticeable. And I feel a bit more tired than usual, even with the interrupted sleep. I haven't coughed, though. And no chest pain, like I said before. Just…the weight, and the swelling, and the tiredness. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Swelling in the ankles… alright. And have you noticed any palpitations or irregular heartbeats?
PATIENT: Palpitations? No, I don’t think so. My heart feels…normal, as far as I can tell. It beats, of course. But I haven’t felt it fluttering or racing, or anything like that. I wouldn’t know what that feels like exactly, but I haven’t experienced anything unusual. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, that's clear enough. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart conditions?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I know of. I've had the usual things, a bit of arthritis in my knees, a touch of the flu now and again, but nothing serious. I’ve always been a reasonably healthy woman, all things considered. I saw Dr. Abernathy for years, before he retired. He always said I had a strong heart. I had a routine checkup every year, until…well, until he left.
DOCTOR: Arthritis… alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just my gallbladder, many years ago. Oh, and I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago. They hardly count, do they? It was before television, even. Everything was so different then. Is that relevant, Doctor? I do try to be concise, but I sometimes get…carried away.
DOCTOR: The gallbladder removal is noted. And family history?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, towards the end of her life. And my father…well, he had a stroke, I believe. It was a long time ago, and I don’t recall the specifics. Neither of them lived a particularly long life, unfortunately. They both smoked, you see. It was a different time. Is that the sort of thing you need to know? I’m not sure what’s relevant, exactly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've taken a variety of things over the years, for various ailments, and never had a reaction. Nothing, that I can recall. I used to take something for the arthritis, but I stopped a while back. It didn’t seem to be doing much good, and Dr. Abernathy said it was alright to stop. I'm generally very careful about what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, prescriptions or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if my knees are particularly sore, I’ll take some ibuprofen, but that’s only occasionally. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible, you see. They never seem to do much good anyway. I prefer a cup of chamomile tea, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll need to examine your ankles. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. Though I must say, this table looks rather…cold. Is it always this cold?
DOCTOR: There’s paper there to cover it. Now, please lie flat for me. Take a deep breath…and exhale. Another one… Good. Heart sounds are…normal. Murmur is absent. Lungs are…slightly diminished at the bases bilaterally. Yes, there is some pitting edema. Two plus pitting edema bilaterally. Alright. Now, I’m going to order some blood work and a chest X-ray. This will help us determine the cause of your symptoms.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Blood work and an X-ray. I suppose that’s sensible. Will I need to make an appointment for those? And will you be able to explain the results to me when they’re back? I do hope it’s nothing too serious. I’m rather fond of my sleep, you see. And I'd like to avoid any unnecessary…complications, if possible.
DOCTOR: The nurse will draw your blood now, and schedule the X-ray for later this week. As for explaining the results… yes, I will. However, it’s difficult to say what they will show at this point. We need the results first. It could be a number of things. Fluid retention, a mild infection, even just…your age. But we’ll know more once we have the tests back. In the meantime, I recommend you limit your salt intake and elevate your legs when you're resting. Any questions?
PATIENT: Limit salt and elevate my legs. Very well. I suppose I understand. No, Doctor, I don’t believe I have any questions at the moment. I just…I hope it's not anything too debilitating. I have a great-niece's birthday coming up, and I promised I’d bake her a cake. It’s a rather important occasion. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I shall see the nurse now, I presume?
DOCTOR: Yes. The nurse will be with you shortly. Try not to worry unduly, and do try to limit the salt. And please, try to get some rest. .
PATIENT: .
