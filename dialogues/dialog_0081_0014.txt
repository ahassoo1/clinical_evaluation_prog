DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Hmm… let me see. My wife, bless her heart, she said I need some… papers. Something about time off work? I’m not quite sure what for, to be honest. Something about needing documentation... for… well, for being unable to work, I think. It’s a bit fuzzy. It has to do with my job, I believe. Religious activities… and education. That's what I do.
DOCTOR: Right. Papers… for time off. And related to religious activities and education. Very well. To clarify, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty performing your work due to these activities, or is this a request for leave to participate in them?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question, Doctor. You know, I... I don’t rightly remember. I’ve been feeling… not quite myself lately. A bit tired, I suppose. And things… they just don’t come to me as easily. I still do the work, yes, but it takes… longer. More effort. I’m not sure if that's what my wife meant. She’s usually pretty clear, but… well, we've been married a long time, and sometimes things get lost, you know? Is that… does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Limtiaco. Fatigue and cognitive slowing… those are certainly things we should explore. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… let me think. Now, I’ve had a bit of trouble with my… joints, over the years. Old age, I suppose. Nothing too serious. The usual aches and pains. And… I think I had the flu, maybe two years ago? Nothing major, thankfully. My wife handles most of the doctor stuff, so I don’t always remember the details. She keeps all the records. I'm usually the one visiting people, offering support... not being the patient, if you catch my drift. Does that help at all? I truly apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We’ll piece it together. Joint pain and a history of the flu. And you say your wife manages your medical records. Very well. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… I don’t think so. No, I’m fairly certain I haven’t had any surgeries. Nothing I remember, at least. And hospitalized… not recently. Years and years ago, when my son was born, I was there with my wife, of course, but that wasn't for me. Just… supporting her. I remember a bit of a scare, but that was a long time ago. Nothing major. Honestly, Doctor, I'm just not a medical person. I'm more comfortable offering guidance and… and prayer, if you understand. This whole thing feels a bit strange, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. No surgeries, no hospitalizations to speak of. And you've established that your wife generally handles these matters. Let’s move on to your family history then. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s… tricky. My mother, she lived a long life, thankfully. But she… well, she had a bit of trouble remembering things towards the end. Nothing the doctors could really pinpoint, I don't think. Just… old age, they said. And my father… he was a strong man, but he passed away fairly young from… I believe it was a heart problem. A sudden thing. It happened quite a while ago, though. And my brother… he had some trouble with his sugar levels, I think. Diabetes, maybe? I really wish my wife was here; she remembers all this much better than I do. I feel terrible for putting you through this.
DOCTOR: Right. Maternal history of memory issues, paternal history of heart disease, and a brother with diabetes. It appears there is a family predisposition to several relevant conditions. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… well, I’ve been married to my wonderful wife, Leilani, for… oh, goodness, almost fifty years now. We have three grown children, and several grandchildren. I'm very involved in our religious community, that’s a big part of my life. I spend a lot of time visiting people, offering support and guidance. I don’t drink, and I don't smoke. I used to be very active, enjoyed gardening and walking, but lately… I haven't had the energy for much of that. I mostly spend my days… thinking and praying, and trying to help where I can. Does that cover it? I'm not much of a social butterfly, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's sufficient. A stable marriage, religious involvement, and a decrease in physical activity. One final question before we proceed to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I'm aware of, no. I've never really had any trouble with food or medications. I haven't taken many medications over the years, thankfully. Just the usual things for a cold or a headache. My wife always checks everything before I take it, of course. She's very careful. I remember one time, years ago, I thought I had a reaction to some sort of… pollen, maybe? But it wasn’t too serious, just a bit of a sniffle. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pretty simple man. I don’t have many allergies, and I don’t take many medications. I'm just… tired, and forgetful. Is that something you can help with?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Limtiaco. It appears you have no known allergies. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your current state. This will include checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. I haven't had a proper check-up in a long time. And… don’t mind if I ramble a bit. Sometimes the words just… don’t come as easily as they used to. And if I forget something, please just remind me. I truly appreciate you taking the time to see me, and for your patience. My wife will be so grateful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/92. A bit elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Alright… breathing deeply. It feels… funny, letting someone listen to my insides. It’s not something I’m used to. I’m usually the one offering comfort, not receiving it. But… I suppose it’s necessary. Is everything alright so far, Doctor? I feel a bit… self-conscious, if I'm honest. Just let me know if you need me to do anything different.
DOCTOR: Your heart rhythm is regular, but there’s a slight murmur. It's not particularly concerning at this point, but we'll need to monitor it. Your lungs are clear, though your breathing sounds a little shallow. Now, I’m going to perform a brief neurological assessment. I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes and then perform some simple memory tests. Please just do your best. Follow my finger with your eyes… don't move your head.
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I’m following it. It’s a bit… blurry, I think. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. It’s harder to concentrate, too. Everything feels… distant. But I’m trying, Doctor, I truly am. Just… go slowly, please? And don’t mind if I blink a lot. My eyes feel… dry. And… what was I doing again? Oh, yes… following your finger.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, I'm going to ask you to recall three words. I’ll say them, and then I'll ask you to repeat them back to me after a short delay. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Three words… yes, alright. I think so. My memory… it’s not what it used to be, as you’ve probably noticed. But I'll try my best. Go ahead, Doctor. Say the words. I’m ready… I think. It’s just… a little difficult to concentrate, everything feels… fuzzy around the edges.
DOCTOR: The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat those back to me when you are ready.
PATIENT: Apple… hmm. That one I remember. Apple… yes. And… something about furniture? A place to put things… a… table, yes! Table. But the third one… oh dear. It’s on the tip of my tongue… something shiny… small… used for… buying things? No… it’s gone. It just slipped away. Apple… table… I’m sorry, Doctor. I can’t remember the third word. It’s… frustrating. It was there just a moment ago.
DOCTOR: That is alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We will proceed with the remainder of the assessment. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh! That startled me a bit. My legs… they aren’t as strong as they used to be. Is everything alright? I always worry about things like that, you know… losing control… falling. It’s a silly worry, I suppose, but… Did I do alright? Was that a good reaction? I'm trying my best, Doctor, I really am. My wife will be so worried if I've lost my reflexes.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are slightly diminished, Mr. Limtiaco, but within an acceptable range for your age. It does not necessarily indicate a cause for immediate concern. Based on the limited assessment, and your reported symptoms of fatigue, memory loss, and the family history of cognitive decline, I believe further investigation is warranted. I recommend a comprehensive neurological evaluation and a series of blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A… a comprehensive evaluation? Blood tests? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor… then yes. Yes, alright. I trust your judgment. I just… I don’t want to worry my wife. She’s already been so worried about me lately. But… if it’s for the best… then I’ll do whatever you think is right. What kind of blood tests? Will they be painful? And… how long will it take? I just… I’m not a very strong man anymore, Doctor. This whole thing is… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: The blood tests are fairly standard, Mr. Limtiaco. They will check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid abnormalities, and signs of inflammation. There will be a minor sting when the blood is drawn, but it’s brief. The results typically take a few days to come back. I will write you a referral to Dr. Anya Petrova, a neurologist at St. Jude’s Hospital. She is highly respected in the field and will conduct a thorough examination. In the meantime, I recommend getting adequate rest, maintaining a healthy diet, and avoiding any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions before I finalize the referral?
PATIENT: Dr. Petrova… at St. Jude’s… hmm. I’ve heard good things, I think. Adequate rest… a healthy diet… yes, that sounds… sensible. My wife always tells me to eat more vegetables. But… what if it’s something… serious, Doctor? What if it’s… like my mother? I don’t want to… lose myself. And… will I be able to drive to St. Jude’s? It’s quite a distance. And… will I need someone to accompany me? This is all… a bit much. Will it be alright?
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it is far too early to speculate on the cause of your symptoms. The purpose of the referral is to determine the underlying cause, not to jump to conclusions. It is unlikely to be anything untreatable. Regarding your ability to drive, I recommend that you refrain from driving until after you have been evaluated by Dr. Petrova. It would be prudent to have someone accompany you to the appointment. I will also provide you with a list of resources for support groups and cognitive rehabilitation programs. Please remember that you are not alone in this. Do you have any further questions, or shall we conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: Support groups… cognitive rehabilitation… No… no, I think that’s alright, Doctor. I appreciate your… thoroughness. And your… patience. I’ll… I’ll make an appointment with Dr. Petrova. And I’ll ask my wife to accompany me. I just… I hope it’s not too bad. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. .
