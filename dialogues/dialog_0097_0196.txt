DOCTOR: Hi Janie, welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you too, I guess. Um, well, honestly? I just…feel tired. Really tired. All the time. It’s been going on for…a while now. I don’t really keep track of dates much anymore. It's just...exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, “really tired” for a while now. I understand. That sounds frustrating. When you say “a while,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, a rough estimate… Honestly? Months, I think. Maybe even a year? It all kinda blends together, you know? It’s just…always being tired. It’s hard to say when it started, exactly. It just…is.
DOCTOR: I do understand, it can be hard to pinpoint sometimes. Months to a year of persistent fatigue. Okay. And when you say tired, is this just feeling sleepy, or is it more like…a lack of energy, difficulty getting things done?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely not just sleepy. Sleep doesn't help much, if that makes sense. It’s…like trying to wade through mud, all the time. Everything takes so much effort. Even just getting out of bed…or making a sandwich. I just…don’t have the oomph, you know? It's… draining.
DOCTOR: "Wading through mud" – that’s a good way to describe it. It sounds incredibly difficult. And it’s not helped by getting enough sleep, which is good to know. Okay. Besides the fatigue and lack of energy, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Hmm…let me think. My memory isn't what it used to be, that's for sure. I forget things constantly. And…I get headaches sometimes. Not terrible, but…there. I don’t know…just generally feeling…off. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so memory issues and headaches along with the fatigue. That gives us a little more to work with. When you say memory issues, can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do I begin? Just…little things. Like… I went to the store yesterday, and I completely forgot what I went there for. Had to go back home and check my list. And sometimes…I struggle to remember people’s names, even people I've known for a long time. It’s… embarrassing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, forgetting errands and struggling with names. That can definitely be concerning. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… Not really, I don’t think. I eat… when I feel up to it. Sometimes I don't have much of an appetite, other times I’m fine. I haven’t really been paying attention, to be honest. Weight…probably lost a little, but nothing major. I’m not one to worry about that much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… It's… fitful. I wake up a lot during the night. I don't necessarily feel rested when I wake up. Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep, other times I'm out like a light, but then I’m up again an hour later. It’s just… not good sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, fitful sleep, waking up frequently, not feeling rested. That paints a clearer picture. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Honestly, Doctor, I don't really like talking about that. It's… just a normal thing. Sometimes things are a little off, sometimes they're not. I haven't really paid much attention, and I don’t want to get into details. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, that’s perfectly okay. We don't have to discuss anything you're not comfortable with. Let’s move on then. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, thank goodness. My shoulders and back get a little stiff sometimes, but nothing awful. Just old age, I guess. Not like, pain pain. Just… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in your shoulders and back. Good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… No, not that I’ve noticed. I haven't been feeling sick, exactly. Just… tired. Really, really tired. No fever, no chills, no night sweats. Just… this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. My… husband used to take care of all of that. I… I know I’ve had the usual things, you know? High blood pressure, maybe? I take a pill for it. But I can't really remember what else. It’s been a while since I went to the doctor regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure and are taking medication for it. Do you know the name of that medication, by any chance?
PATIENT: Um… no. I don’t. It’s a little white pill. I take it every morning. My husband… he filled the prescription for me. I just… take it. I don’t really pay attention to the names.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little white pill for high blood pressure. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Um… I think so. A long time ago. When I was younger. Something with my… appendix, maybe? Or my gallbladder? It was a long time ago, and I don’t really remember the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, possibly an appendix or gallbladder surgery in the past. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. My husband always said I was lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? Oh, goodness. That’s another thing my husband… My mother… she had some heart problems, I think. And my father… he had diabetes. But… I don't really know much beyond that. They're both gone now. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems and diabetes. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never! My husband… he didn’t approve. I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, and I certainly don’t do drugs. Never have. Never will.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. And how would you describe your current living situation?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… quiet. I live alone now, since my husband passed. I have a small house… it’s manageable. I keep myself busy… mostly with gardening. I try to stay active, but… it’s hard sometimes, with being so tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, living alone, gardening to stay active. It sounds like you're doing your best. Just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… I think I take something for my… joints sometimes. When they're really bothering me. It’s an over-the-counter thing, I think. A little orange pill. But I don’t take it every day, only when I need to. I can’t remember the name of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a little orange pill for your joints when needed. Okay. I think I have a good understanding of your history now. Do you mind if I do a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam…? Oh… I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. I’m just… not a big fan of doctors. But… if it will help, then yes. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but your rhythm is regular. I’m hearing some mild crackles in your lungs, which could be due to a variety of things. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little high, 140/90. That's why I wanted to double-check. Let's check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. And finally, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam. Your neurological function appears normal. Okay, everything seems within reasonable limits, but your fatigue, memory issues, and elevated blood pressure are concerning. I think we need to do some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that crackling doesn’t sound good, does it? And high blood pressure…I knew I should’ve been better about taking my pills. Blood work… yes, I suppose. If it’s necessary. I just… don’t like needles. But… if it will help me figure out what’s wrong, then yes. Do what you need to do. Just… please be quick?
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll make sure it’s as quick and comfortable as possible. We’ll check your complete blood count, your thyroid levels, vitamin D, and some basic metabolic panels. We’ll also check your kidney and liver function. And I’d like to order a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. That should give us a good starting point. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll give you this requisition and you can take it to the phlebotomist. They’ll draw a few vials of blood. It’ll take about 10-15 minutes. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So many things… That sounds like a lot. Ten to fifteen minutes…I can manage that. As long as it gets me closer to figuring out why I’m so tired all the time. Okay. Follow-up appointment… yes. Let’s just get it over with. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janie. I understand it’s a lot, but we’ll take it one step at a time. And we will figure this out together. While we wait for the blood work results, I recommend trying to get a little more rest if you can, even though I know it’s difficult. And if you're able, gentle exercise like walking can sometimes help with fatigue. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No… I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. I just… want to feel normal again. No questions, thank you. I’ll go to the lab now. I appreciate your help, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janie. I sincerely hope we can get you feeling better soon. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and she’ll take good care of you. Don’t hesitate to let her know if you’re feeling uncomfortable during the blood draw. Once you’ve had the blood work done, just let the receptionist know and they’ll schedule your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before then.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. I will. I’ll go now.
