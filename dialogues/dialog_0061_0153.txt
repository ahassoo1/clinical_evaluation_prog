DOCTOR: Bula and good afternoon, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Krahn is fine. Yes, well… something about a check-up? For… acting, I think. They said I needed something done before I could… perform. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I get asked to do things sometimes, and then I just… show up. Is this right?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krahn, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like this check-up is related to a role you're preparing for. We'll get everything sorted out. To start, could you tell me a little more about the type of “performance” you’re preparing for?
PATIENT: Performance… hmm. It’s… stage work, I believe. Lots of walking around, maybe some talking. Not much heavy lifting, I hope. I used to do more, but my knees aren't what they used to be. Honestly, I don't remember the specifics. They just said it was a “physical clearance.” Does that mean blood work? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, stage work. That helps. A “physical clearance” is a good way to put it. It just means we want to make sure you’re healthy enough to handle the demands of the role. It might include some blood work, but we’ll talk about that in a moment. First, let's just get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else a doctor has told you about?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a lot to remember. Let me think. I had a bit of trouble with my back a few years ago, but that cleared up with some stretching. And my doctor did mention something about my cholesterol, I think. High… something? I don't really pay attention to those things. Honestly, I've been pretty healthy for my age, considering. Used to walk a lot with my wife… before things changed. Do you need a list? I doubt I’d remember everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, back trouble a few years ago and some mention of high cholesterol. That’s a good start. We can definitely look up some records if you're comfortable. Do you know where your previous doctor was located?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a long time ago. Dr. Lee, I think her name was. She had a practice… somewhere downtown, I believe. Near the old marketplace? It was a small office. Before… everything. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in years. It’s hard to keep track of these things when… well, never mind. I doubt they'd still have my records. Don't bother looking, really. It's probably just easier to start fresh.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn, no problem at all. We can definitely start fresh. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I take a little something for my joints, sometimes. Just when they really bother me. It’s… a cream, I think. Rub it on. And I used to take a vitamin D supplement, but I ran out months ago and haven't bothered to get more. Honestly, I forget half the time. Just the cream, if that counts. It's a little bottle. Blue label, I think?
DOCTOR: Okay, a cream for your joints, possibly with a blue label. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Maybe a little sensitive to shellfish, but that’s just a mild stomach ache. Nothing serious. I don’t recall ever having a full-blown allergic reaction. My wife used to make a lovely seafood stew… before… well, you know. Is that the kind of thing you need to know? I’m probably fine, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild sensitivity to shellfish, no serious allergies. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s a tough one. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my brother… he had some trouble with his lungs. Smoked too much, I believe. My wife’s side of the family was healthier, mostly. I don’t really remember much detail, honestly. We didn't talk about these things much. Is this important? I’m not sure I can be much help.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Krahn. Any information you can remember is helpful, but it’s okay if you’re unsure. We'll move on. Before we do a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. Well, I try to stay active, but it’s not easy these days. I walk when I can, mostly around the neighborhood. I enjoy reading, watching old movies. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I used to smoke, but I quit years ago. And… I used to be married. Does that count? It’s been a quiet life, mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing, Mr. Krahn. That gives me a good sense of things. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just the basics—check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and take a look at your joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try not to poke too much. My knees aren’t what they used to be. And I get a little lightheaded sometimes. Go slowly, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. We'll take it very slowly and gently. Please have a seat on the examination table when you’re ready. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. That's slightly elevated. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not alarming, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear, good air movement. Okay, and your knees do show some creaking and mild swelling, with a limited range of motion. Do you experience pain with walking or bending?
PATIENT: Yes, the knees… they bother me, especially when it’s cold. And walking uphill is… difficult. A lot of creaking, like you said. Sometimes a sharp pain, but it usually goes away after I rest. I try to avoid stairs whenever possible. It's just… old age, I suppose. Is there anything you can do about it? Some kind of cream, perhaps? Or a pill? I just want to be able to walk comfortably again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krahn. It sounds like you likely have some osteoarthritis in your knees. The creaking, the pain with activity, and the swelling all point in that direction. There are several things we can try. We could start with some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with the pain and inflammation. We can also discuss some physical therapy exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knees. A stronger support system can help take some of the pressure off of the joints. There are also topical creams we can try, but they're generally less effective than oral medications. We could also consider a cortisone injection, but that's something we'd discuss further down the line. Before we proceed with treatment, I would like to order some bloodwork to rule out any other underlying causes for your knee pain, and to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Bloodwork… oh dear. I really don’t like needles. But… if it will help my knees, I suppose I can manage it. What exactly will they be looking for? And how much blood do they take? Please tell me it’s not a lot. I get faint easily, you know. And… will it take long? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. We'll take it very slowly, and I'll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. It won’t take long at all. We'll just need a small sample of blood—about two or three vials worth. The tests will help us check your inflammation levels, your kidney function, and your cholesterol, among other things. It's a standard panel to get a good baseline. The phlebotomist is very experienced and gentle, and they'll be sure to keep you comfortable. We can have you lie down during the procedure if you prefer, and I'll be right here with you. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes, start to finish. Would you like me to order that for you now?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. Just… please tell the person doing it to be very careful. And let me lie down. And… maybe have a cool cloth handy? I always feel a bit… warm when I have blood taken. Is there anything I need to do beforehand? Fasting, perhaps? Or should I drink something? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. I'll make a note of everything. I'll have the phlebotomist come in with a cool cloth and let you lie down. You don't need to fast beforehand, but it's a good idea to drink some water beforehand to make it easier for them to draw the blood. I’ll also have the nurse come in and get your medical history while we wait. She'll ask about any previous hospitalizations, surgeries, allergies, and medications. That will give us a more complete picture of your health. Okay, let's get that ordered for you. It shouldn't be too long before the nurse comes in. Please just relax and try not to worry. We'll take very good care of you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I appreciate that. It's just… I don’t do well with these things. I always feel like I’m a bother. But if you think the bloodwork is necessary… then I suppose I can manage it. Just… let me know when it’s time, alright?
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Mr. Krahn. We’re here to help you, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about these things. I’ll let you know as soon as the nurse is ready. In the meantime, just relax, and I'll be right here if you need anything.
