DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Hartness, it says here you're 51. And…quite thin, aren’t you?
PATIENT: Yeah, well, I stay active. Always been a worker, you know? Not much for… sitting around. This exam is for the military, right? Gotta make sure I'm fit enough. Don't see what the big deal is, I feel fine.
DOCTOR: "Fit enough," you say. Right. The military has standards, Mr. Hartness, and we need to document everything thoroughly. It’s not about you feeling fine, it's about meeting requirements. Now, let’s start with why you're here today. Is there anything specific bringing you in for this exam?
PATIENT: Specific? No, not really. They just… want me to get checked. Standard stuff, I guess. Before they let me sign anything. Honestly, seems like a waste of time, but you gotta do what you gotta do. Is this gonna take long? I got things to be getting on with.
DOCTOR: “Standard stuff” rarely means nothing, Mr. Hartness. And yes, it will take some time. We need to go through a complete history and physical. You say you feel fine, which is good. But we still need details. Let’s start with this… have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Recent? Hmm… nothin' serious. Had a bit of a cold back in… February, I think. Just a sniffle, really. Took some pills, felt better in a few days. Nothing worth botherin' a doctor about, usually. You really need to know about every little cold? Seems a bit much.
DOCTOR: "Every little cold" is how we build a picture, Mr. Hartness. It’s not about you thinking it's worth bothering a doctor about, it's about what I need to know. February… alright. Any fever with that cold?
PATIENT: Fever? Maybe a little warm, but nothin' bad. Didn’t take my temperature or nothin’. Just felt a bit… off. Like I said, a normal cold. I work outside a lot, get a bit of everything. You know, sniffles, coughs, aches… regular working man stuff. Is this gonna be on a form somewhere? People might think I'm always sick.
DOCTOR: "Regular working man stuff"... yes, it will be documented. Everything is documented, Mr. Hartness. It's for legal reasons, and for the military's records. We need specifics. Beyond the cold in February, have you had any other illnesses in the past year?
PATIENT: Past year… let me think. Nope. Nothin’ else. Just the cold. Maybe a bit of back pain now and then, from lifting things at work. But that’s just… part of the job. I rub some cream on it, gets better. Don’t need a doctor for that. Honestly, I'm startin' to wonder what I'm even doin' here. This feels like a waste of everybody's time.
DOCTOR: “A waste of everybody’s time,” you say. Well, perhaps if you cooperated, it wouldn't feel that way. Back pain… and you just rub cream on it?
PATIENT: Yeah, well, it works! Been doin’ it for years. No need for fancy doctors or nothin’. It’s just… muscles. Gets sore, rub some cream, gets better. What kind of cream are you wantin' to know? It's just somethin’ I picked up at the store. Not like it’s a secret formula or anythin’. Look, I'm a practical man, I fix things. I don’t go runnin’ to the doctor for every ache and pain. It's… inefficient.
DOCTOR: "Inefficient." Right. And what about past serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Serious? Hmm… Let me think. When I was a boy, maybe twelve years old, I had… the measles, I think. But that was ages ago! I got over it just fine. And… when I was in my twenties, I broke my arm fallin’ off a ladder. Had a cast on for a few weeks. But that’s it, really. Nothin’ major. Don’t remember anythin’ else. Are you writin’ all this down? Sounds like a whole lot of nothin’ to me.
DOCTOR: "A whole lot of nothing," you say. We'll see. Now, let’s talk about surgeries. Have you ever had any operations?
PATIENT: Operations? No. Never. Never had anythin' cut open or nothin'. I fix things, remember? I don’t need fixin’. Always been healthy, strong. People tell me that. What kind of operations are you askin’ about? Big ones? Little ones? I'm gettin' a bit tired of this, to be honest. This is startin' to feel like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: "An interrogation?
PATIENT: Well, it feels like it! Ask, ask, ask. Every little detail. I told you, I'm healthy. I work hard. I don't sit around complainin'. What are you tryin' to find out, exactly? Is there somethin' wrong with me that you think I don't know about? I feel perfectly fine. This is just… ridiculous. I'm startin' to question whether I even want to do this military thing anymore. All this bother… it's not worth it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration. However, this is a necessary process. Let’s try a different approach. Now, about your family… are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Living? No. Both gone now. Dad passed… oh, must be twenty years ago now. Heart trouble. And Mom… ten years ago. Old age, mostly. It was a long time ago. Not much to tell you about them, really. They were… normal people. Worked hard, raised a family. What does this have to do with anything? I'm startin' to think you're just tryin' to waste my time. You asked about my parents! I'm tryin' to join the military, not apply for a history grant.
DOCTOR: "A history grant." Right. We ask about family history because certain conditions can be hereditary. Did either of your parents have any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Significant? Well, Dad had that heart trouble, like I said. Got worse over time. Needed… pills, I think. And Mom… she had arthritis, mostly. Lots of aches and pains, especially in her hands. She used to rub cream on them. Seems like everyone rubs cream on somethin', these days. Look, I'm tellin' you what I remember. I wasn't payin' much attention to their medical stuff when I was a kid. I was busy with school and work, you know? Are you gonna ask about my grandparents next? This is gettin' silly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, you seem…resistant to providing information. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None that I know of. I eat everything. I work outside all day, around dust and pollen and… everything. Never had a problem. Not like I break out in hives or nothin'. I'm a practical man, I deal with things. I don't sit around worryin' about allergies. What are you thinkin', that I'm gonna faint if you mention a flower? This is ridiculous. Honestly, I think I'm done. I’m not fillin’ out any more forms. I'm gonna go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, before you go, I need to ask about your current medications. Are you taking any prescription drugs?
PATIENT: Prescription drugs? No! Never. I told you, I don't take pills! I fix things myself. If I got a headache, I take a little somethin' over-the-counter. Nothing fancy. What are you thinkin', I'm a junkie or somethin'? You're accusin' me of bein' sick, now! This is… insulting. I'm leavin'. You've wasted my time. I don't need a doctor tellin' me what's wrong with me. I'm perfectly fine. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, please. I understand you’re frustrated, but I need this information. Your lack of cooperation is concerning. You’re applying for a physically demanding position. We have a duty to assess your fitness. Now, let’s try this one last time. Any medications at all?
