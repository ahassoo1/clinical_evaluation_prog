DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Giganti, you say? Yes... well, it’s about… my waterworks, I suppose. Been a bit of trouble with them, lately. It keeps… bothering me. I don't really remember all the details, truthfully. It's happened before, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Trouble with your waterworks” can mean a few different things. And it’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember all the details; we'll work through it together. To start, could you describe what you mean by “bothering” you?
PATIENT: Well… it burns, mostly. When I… go. And I feel like I need to go all the time, even when I haven’t had much to drink. It's... unpleasant. Honestly, it’s just very tiring. Is that… helpful? I apologize for being so vague. It all feels… far away.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Wease. Burning with urination and frequent urges – those are important symptoms. Don't apologize at all; it's common for things to feel distant when you're dealing with discomfort. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s the tricky part. It comes and goes, you see? I think… maybe a few weeks at a time? But it happened… last year, too? Or maybe the year before? It's hard to say. I’ve been to the doctor about it before, I’m quite certain, but I don’t recall what they did. I feel awful even asking, it's just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Wease. These things can be difficult to pinpoint. And it's never awful to ask about your health. It’s good you’re here. Knowing it comes and goes is helpful. To clarify, when it is happening, is the burning constant, or does it come and go during urination?
PATIENT: Oh… during. Yes, during. It doesn’t hurt all the time. Just… when I’m actually… going. And it starts, well, pretty quickly after I start, then stops when I’m finished. It's not a terrible pain, more of a strong burn, like… like when you’ve had something too spicy, maybe? Does that make sense? I hope I'm not rambling.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Wease. Burning during urination, starting quickly and stopping when you finish… That’s very helpful information. Now, could you tell me about any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, sometimes… my tummy feels a bit… unsettled. Not painful, exactly, but… like a dull ache. And I've been rather tired, though that could just be… everything. Oh, and I think… I think I go to the bathroom more often at night. Does that count? I’m probably just imagining things.
DOCTOR: No, those are all important things to mention, Ms. Wease, you're not imagining anything. A dull abdominal ache, increased tiredness, and needing to urinate more at night – those could all be connected. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a good question. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, years ago, I think. My husband – God rest his soul – he always took care of those details. I don’t recall if I ever had diabetes… or kidney problems. No, I don't think so. I’ve always been fairly healthy, generally. I really am bad with remembering things, aren't I? I apologize again.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Wease. It’s common to not remember every detail, especially details managed by others. We can try to access records if that would be helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a child. And… a hysterectomy, many years ago. That was… a long time ago. Everything went fine, as far as I know. No other surgeries, I don't believe. This is… a lot of remembering, isn't it? I hope I’m not being too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Wease. You're doing just fine. Tonsils out as a child and a hysterectomy – that's helpful to know. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh… well, let me see. I take a little something for my arthritis, mostly. It's just a small pill, once a day. And… sometimes I take something for my digestion. But nothing regularly. I try to avoid pills whenever possible. And no vitamins, no. I don’t take any vitamins. This is all I take, usually. Though it’s empty now. I need to get a refill.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. My husband always said I was… remarkably resilient. No allergies, no. But… I do get a bit itchy sometimes, when I wear certain fabrics. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… sensitive skin. I hope that doesn’t count.
DOCTOR: No, sensitive skin doesn’t count as an allergy. Okay, good to know. Finally, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. Well, my mother… she had a bit of trouble with her heart, towards the end. And my father… he always had a strong constitution, thankfully. No… I don't really know much about their medical history, truthfully. We weren’t very close, I’m afraid. I apologize for not being more helpful. It's all rather… hazy.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Wease. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t have much information about your family history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if that's okay with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a brief neurological exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please be gentle. My bones aren't what they used to be, you see. But go ahead, please. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, I'm noticing a bit of tenderness when I press here, in your lower abdomen. Is that where you feel the discomfort you mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s it. That’s exactly where it feels… unsettled. Not painful, exactly, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, as I said. It’s not too bad, though. Just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and sensation. This is very quick. Okay, everything seems normal there as well. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, your symptoms – the burning with urination, frequent urges, lower abdominal tenderness, and tiredness – suggest a possible urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, to confirm this, we need to send a urine sample for testing. Do you think you can provide a urine sample for me now?
PATIENT: Oh… a urine sample? Yes, I suppose I can. It’s just… where do I go? I haven’t had one in years! I hope I remember how to do it properly. Is there a restroom nearby?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. I will give you a sterile cup and instructions. Don’t worry, it’s very straightforward. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample—that means starting to urinate, then collecting a small amount in the cup mid-way through. We want to avoid the very beginning and end of your stream. Take your time, and let me know if you have any trouble. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A mid-stream sample, you say? I’ll try my best. Thank you, Doctor. I hope I don’t make a mess. I’ll be right back.
