DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time for chit-chat, so let’s get right to it. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. All the time. It’s really unpleasant, you know? And it happens especially after I eat. It’s just… bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you'd like to get straight to the point, and you're experiencing something unpleasant coming up, especially after eating. Can you tell me a little more about this “stuff”?
PATIENT: Well, what is there to tell? It’s… food. Undigested food. It just… comes back up. Sometimes it’s sour, sometimes not. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it's…disgusting. Honestly, it’s a waste of a good meal. And frankly, I don't understand why a grown woman needs to ask me to describe it. It's regurgitation, isn't it? You're the doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, Mr. Altine – regurgitation is a good way to describe it. And I apologize for asking you to elaborate when it’s clearly unpleasant to discuss. It’s helpful for me to get a full picture, though, so I can best understand what's going on. When did this start happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, probably… six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It started gradually. At first, it was just occasionally after a big meal, you know? Now it seems like it happens more often than not. Especially if I have anything spicy. Though, honestly, even a simple sandwich can set it off sometimes. It's getting old, let me tell you. I used to enjoy my food.
DOCTOR: Six months, starting gradually and worsening… and triggered by spicy foods, but now even milder things can cause it. Okay. And is this happening every day, or are there days when you don’t experience it?
PATIENT: Almost every day, now. I’d say maybe one or two days a week I’m lucky enough to not have it. But even then, I feel it coming on, you know? That… burning sensation. Like it's just waiting to happen. It’s really quite bothersome. I’ve tried antacids, over-the-counter stuff, but they don’t do much good. A temporary fix at best. Honestly, I expected more from modern medicine.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine, and I'm sorry the over-the-counter remedies haven't provided much relief. It's good you tried those, though. You mentioned a burning sensation. Where exactly do you feel that burning?
PATIENT: Right here. It’s not a pain, exactly. More like… a warmth. That gets worse when I lie down. And then, of course, the stuff comes up. It’s just… a whole ordeal. Look, I'm a busy man, you know. Emergency Management doesn't run itself. Do you need to poke around in there or something? Because I’d rather get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the burning sensation is located right here, below the sternum, and it worsens when you lie down. That gives me some more information. And I appreciate you telling me about your work in Emergency Management – I understand wanting to be efficient with your time. I would like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to gently press on your abdomen to get a better sense of things. It won't be uncomfortable, I promise. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don’t take all day. And be gentle, like you said. I haven’t got time for a full physical. Just tell me what’s wrong and what I need to do to fix it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Altine. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness when I press here, and here, . Based on what you've described – the regurgitation, the burning sensation that worsens when lying down, and the tenderness I feel – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. It’s quite common, especially with certain dietary triggers. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: GERD? Oh, for heaven's sake. Another fancy medical term. Look, just tell me in plain English. Is it serious? And what can I do about it? As for weight loss… well, maybe a couple of pounds. But that’s probably just from being busy, you know? I haven’t been eating as much lately because I’m afraid of… well, you know. The whole ordeal. Honestly, it's a bother. And I'm starting to lose my appetite because of it. Is it going to require surgery? I have a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Altine, let's put aside the medical terms for a moment. What's happening is that stomach acid is coming back up into your esophagus – the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach – causing the burning sensation and the regurgitation. It's not usually serious, but it can be very uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can sometimes lead to other problems. Weight loss of a couple of pounds combined with your loss of appetite is something to note. Surgery is very rarely needed for GERD. Usually, we can manage it with lifestyle changes and medication. First, let's talk about some things you can do at home. Are you able to describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a fairly simple eater, alright? Breakfast is usually coffee and a bagel. Sometimes with cream cheese, sometimes not. Lunch is a sandwich, usually ham and cheese on rye. Nothing fancy. Dinner… well, dinner varies. My wife does most of the cooking. Sometimes it’s steak, sometimes it’s pasta, sometimes it’s… I don’t know, something with vegetables. She tries to get me to eat healthy. I don't eat a lot of spicy food, frankly, and I try to avoid fried stuff. But like I said, even a simple sandwich can set it off. It doesn't make any sense! I don't drink much alcohol, either. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Is that relevant? Honestly, I try to live a healthy life. This whole thing is just… irritating.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Coffee, bagels, sandwiches, and a variety of dinners – with occasional wine. It sounds like you're generally making good choices. Coffee, unfortunately, can be a trigger for GERD due to its acidity. Wine can also contribute. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. A simple upper endoscopy – where we use a thin, flexible tube with a camera to look at your esophagus and stomach – will help us rule out any inflammation or damage. And I'd also like to check your H. pylori status – it’s a bacteria that can sometimes contribute to GERD symptoms. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for crying out loud. Look, I don't like tests. It’s a waste of time, frankly. And I don't do well with… tubes. Is there really no other way? Can't you just give me something for it? Some pills or something? I haven't got time for a camera in my stomach! I’ve got a town to run! Fine. Whatever. But make it quick, alright? I expect the results to be fast. And I expect to be back to work as soon as possible. This whole thing is completely unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The tests will give us the most accurate information to determine the best course of treatment. I assure you, the endoscopy is a relatively quick procedure, and we'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. In the meantime, while we're waiting for the results, let’s try a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. It’s a medication that reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces. I'm going to prescribe Omeprazole, 20 milligrams, once daily, 30 minutes before a meal. Also, a few lifestyle adjustments can help: avoid caffeine and alcohol, eat smaller, more frequent meals, and try to stay upright for at least three hours after eating. Avoid lying down immediately after a meal. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. Though my wife says I'm allergic to nonsense, but that's a different story. Alright, Omeprazole, once a day. And no caffeine, no alcohol, smaller meals... It's a lot to remember. And I'm a busy man! But fine. I'll try it. Just tell me, honestly, is this going to fix the problem? Because if it doesn't, I don’t want to waste my time with any more tests or… tubes. I've got a very important town meeting next week, and I need to be on my A-game. This whole ordeal is just… incredibly inconvenient. Can we wrap this up now?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Altine, and I wish I could give you a definitive answer. PPIs are very effective for many people with GERD, and we're hopeful this will provide relief. However, everyone responds differently, and it may take a few weeks to see the full effect. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to see how you're doing. If you’re not seeing improvement, we can discuss the results of the tests and explore other options. Okay, I’m sending the prescription to your pharmacy now. And here’s a handout with more information about GERD and lifestyle modifications. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get me out of here. I've got a town to run, remember? Thank you… I suppose.
