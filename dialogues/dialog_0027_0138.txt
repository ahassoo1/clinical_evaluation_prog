DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Hmm… what brings me in… Well, it's a bit of a worry, really. My daughter, bless her heart, she's been after me to come. Seems I've been… well, having a little trouble sometimes. It’s hard to explain, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Something about weakness… on one side? And my family… we’ve always had terrible headaches. Horrible migraines, you know? My mother suffered with them something awful.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in, and it's very helpful to know about your family history. So, let’s try to get a clearer picture of what's been going on. You mentioned some trouble with your memory and weakness… can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh dear, trying to remember… It comes and goes, you see? Sometimes my arm feels… heavy, like I can't lift it properly. Or my leg feels a bit clumsy. It doesn’t happen all the time, just… now and then. It’s usually on my right side, I think. And it doesn’t last long, thankfully. Just a few minutes, maybe. Then it’s gone. It's just… unsettling, you know? It's like a little shadow, always at the back of my mind. And the headaches… well, they’re not like my mother’s migraines, thankfully, but I do get them, a dull ache mostly. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Ms. Tofani. It’s helpful to know it’s intermittent and mostly on your right side. And you said it lasts just a few minutes?
PATIENT: Yes, a few minutes, usually. Sometimes a little longer, maybe ten, fifteen minutes, but rarely more than that. It’s hard to say exactly, my sense of time isn’t what it used to be either! It's like a little… wave, and then it passes. It hasn't been interfering with things too much, thankfully. I still manage my garden, and I can still cook for my husband. But my daughter, she worries… and you know how daughters are! They always want the best for you.
DOCTOR: They do, Ms. Tofani. That’s very good to hear you’re still able to do the things you enjoy. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… other symptoms… Hmm. Sometimes when it happens, my speech feels a little… slurred, maybe? Not all the time, and it’s very slight, but my husband has noticed it a couple of times. And I think… yes, sometimes I get a little dizzy, but that could just be getting up too quickly, you know? I’m getting older, things don’t always work quite right! But no, nothing major, thankfully. Just those little things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Tofani. This is all very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam to assess your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding! As long as it helps figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. 140 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, breath sounds normal. Now, I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes, don’t move your head. Okay, good. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here you go. Is that alright? I haven’t been doing much with my hands lately, just gardening mostly. They’re a bit arthritic, you know, getting older. But I still manage. Is that strong enough? Do you want me to squeeze harder? I don’t want to hurt you!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. Tofani, you're not hurting me at all. It looks like your strength is a little diminished on your right side, but not significantly. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little brisk on the right side, but again, not terribly concerning. Finally, I’m going to check your balance. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here we go. Careful now, these old bones aren’t as steady as they used to be! Is that alright? I’m a bit wobbly, you know. Maybe I should hold onto something? I don’t want to fall!
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Ms. Tofani. Just take your time. It does seem like your balance is slightly off on your right side. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms consistent with a transient ischemic attack, sometimes called a "mini-stroke."
PATIENT: Oh dear. A… a mini-stroke? That sounds… frightening. Is it serious? Is that why my daughter was so worried? I thought it was just my memory… and the headaches… Is it something I need to be really worried about? And what does that mean, exactly? I don’t think I understand… Is it something that will… happen again?
DOCTOR: It is understandable to be worried, Ms. Tofani. It can be serious, but we’re going to take steps to figure out what’s going on and prevent anything more serious from happening. A transient ischemic attack means there was a temporary interruption of blood flow to part of your brain, causing those symptoms you described – the weakness, slurred speech, dizziness. It’s a warning sign that you may be at risk for a full stroke in the future. That’s why your daughter was so concerned, and why it’s good you came in. Now, to get a better understanding of what's happening, I want to order some tests. We'll need a CT scan of your brain to rule out any other causes, and I'd like to order blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and other factors that could contribute to stroke risk. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A CT scan… and blood work… Yes, yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… I don’t want to be a bother. And I don’t want to worry my husband too much. He’s already getting on in years, you know. He gets anxious easily. But if it helps figure out what’s going on… then yes, please. Do what you think is best. Will the CT scan hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s no bother at all, Ms. Tofani. And you’re not worrying me at all. We'll do everything we can to make this as smooth as possible. The CT scan is painless. You’ll lie on a table, and a machine will take pictures of your brain. It’s very quick and non-invasive. We’ll also need to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And I want you to start taking a low-dose aspirin daily, unless you have any allergies or other medical conditions that prevent it. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in brain and nerve disorders. They can help us manage your risk and prevent future strokes. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A neurologist… and aspirin… Yes, yes, that sounds sensible. I don’t think I’m allergic to aspirin, but I’ll have to ask my husband, he remembers things better than me. He’ll want to know all the details, you know. And I’ll make an appointment with the neurologist as soon as possible. Is there anything I need to do, besides take the aspirin and make the appointment? Should I be… changing my diet, or… avoiding anything? I still like to bake, you know. My husband loves my biscotti.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. For now, I want you to continue with your normal activities as much as possible, but it's important to be mindful of your diet. Try to eat a healthy diet, low in saturated and trans fats, and rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. And moderate your salt intake. As for your baking, you can still enjoy your biscotti, but perhaps in moderation. It's also important to manage your blood pressure, so follow up with your primary care physician to ensure it's well-controlled. And most importantly, if you experience any new symptoms—weakness, slurred speech, dizziness—seek medical attention immediately. I’m going to give you a handout with information about stroke prevention and symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Well-controlled blood pressure… healthy diet… and moderation. Yes, yes, that makes sense. I'll be sure to talk to my husband about it. He's good at keeping track of things like that. Hmm… I think that’s everything for now. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time. I'm a bit overwhelmed, to be honest, but I feel better knowing we’re doing something about it. So, a CT scan, aspirin, see a neurologist, and keep an eye on my blood pressure… Is that right?
DOCTOR: That’s exactly right, Ms. Tofani. You've got it. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. The nurse will go over the paperwork for the CT scan and give you a prescription for the aspirin. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself. It was a pleasure meeting you today.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. It was a pleasure meeting you too. I feel much better now, knowing what’s going on. I’ll make those appointments and take care of myself. And I’ll tell my husband everything. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
