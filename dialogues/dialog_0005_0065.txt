DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I can’t seem to figure out why. It’s quite bothersome, frankly. It’s not like I’ve changed my habits, you see.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. “Gaining weight despite no changes in habits,” that's what we’ll start with. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… approximately six months, I would say. Perhaps seven. It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual thing, but definitely noticeable now. I noticed my clothes were feeling tighter, and… well, the scale doesn't lie, does it?
DOCTOR: Right. Six to seven months of gradual weight gain. And you’re sure there haven’t been any changes to your diet or exercise routine during that time?
PATIENT: Positive. Absolutely certain. My husband and I, we have the same meals most evenings. I still walk the dog every morning, rain or shine – a good two kilometers, at least. It's… it's perplexing, truly. I’m quite diligent with my routine, so this is very unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Two kilometers daily. And the meals… could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Certainly. Breakfast is usually a small bowl of oatmeal with some berries. Lunch is often a sandwich – turkey or cheese, mostly – and a piece of fruit. Dinner… well, my husband is an excellent cook. Usually some sort of meat – chicken or pork, perhaps – with potatoes and vegetables. We don’t have sweets often, maybe a small biscuit with our tea after dinner. Portion sizes haven’t changed either, Doctor. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sounds… reasonably balanced, honestly. Let's move on. Besides the weight gain, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me consider… I’ve been… a little more tired than usual, I suppose. Not debilitatingly so, just… lacking my usual energy. And perhaps slightly more thirsty, but I thought that was just the warm weather. Oh, and my hands sometimes feel a bit cold, even when it isn’t particularly cool. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, increased thirst, and cold hands… those are things we'll definitely look into. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… a rather personal question. Well, no, not really. Everything is… regular, if you understand. No constipation, no… the opposite, either. I apologize for the bluntness, but I believe that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Right, perfectly fine. Regular bowel movements. Good to know. Now, Ms. Selbitschka, do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart problems, no allergies that I know of. My husband always says I’m as strong as an ox, but… this weight gain is making me question that.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known medical conditions. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single surgery, not a single overnight stay. My mother always said I had a constitution of steel. It’s just… this is so unlike me. I pride myself on being a healthy individual, and this unexplained weight gain is quite worrying. Perhaps I'm simply imagining things, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, we're not dismissing anything. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – diabetes, thyroid problems, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she had… well, she was diagnosed with something called hypothyroidism. That was many years ago, of course. And my father… he had some heart trouble in his later years. He had to watch his salt intake, and he took some medication. That is… to the best of my recollection, anyway. My mother always handled the medical details. It's been quite a few years since their passing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Hypothyroidism in your grandmother and heart trouble in your father. That's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer natural remedies when possible. A cup of chamomile tea for a good night's sleep, perhaps, but that's the extent of it. I generally avoid medications unless absolutely necessary. I believe in a good diet and a healthy lifestyle. Which, as you know, is rather frustrating given my current situation.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications or supplements. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also palpate your thyroid. Please, have a seat. We'll get this sorted out.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. I hope you discover the cause of this… inconvenience. I must admit, I'm growing rather anxious about it. I trust your expertise implicitly, of course. Proceed whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: “Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear.” “Thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but not significantly firm. No nodules that I can detect at this time.” "Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found here, I suspect we need to run some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid hormone levels – TSH, T4, and T3 – to see if hypothyroidism might be playing a role. We'll also check your blood sugar and a complete metabolic panel to rule out other possibilities.”
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Blood tests are not my favorite, but if it will help determine the cause, I am more than willing. Will I need to fast before the tests? And… when might I expect the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw. No food or sugary drinks, water is fine. The lab is right down the hall, and they'll get you scheduled. As for results, it usually takes a couple of business days. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. “I’m also going to order a lipid panel. Just to get a broader picture of your overall health.” “Here you go. This is your order. Take this to the lab and they’ll take care of everything.” “In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We'll have some answers soon.”
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is… reassuring. Eight hours fasting, a lipid panel… I shall make the necessary arrangements. I appreciate your thorough approach, and I trust we’ll get to the bottom of this. Please, do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information. I will await your call with… anticipation. Is there anything else I should be doing in the interim? Perhaps adjusting my diet, or increasing my exercise?
DOCTOR: “For now, no drastic changes. Continue with your current diet and exercise routine. We want to get a baseline before making any adjustments. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like excessive fatigue, weight loss, or changes in your heart rate – contact us immediately, of course. But otherwise, just try to relax. We'll have the results in a couple of days, and we can discuss them then." "If you don’t hear from us within three business days, feel free to give the office a call to check on the status of the tests."
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. No drastic changes, await results, contact if worsening symptoms… I shall endeavor to follow your instructions precisely. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I trust we shall have a positive outcome. Please, extend your greetings to your staff. They were most courteous. I believe that concludes our visit?
DOCTOR: “Yes, that concludes our visit for today, Ms. Selbitschka. I will certainly pass along your kind words to the staff. They do a wonderful job. You take care now, and we'll be in touch soon."
