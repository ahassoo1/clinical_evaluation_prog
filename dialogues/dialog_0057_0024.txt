DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Confirming that I’m able to fly. It’s for… well, a trip I’m planning. It's a bit complicated, but they need official confirmation from a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A fit-to-fly letter. No problem, I can certainly help with that. To write that letter, I'll need to gather some information about your health. First, let's start with any current medical conditions you have. Are you currently being treated for anything?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean… my husband passed away about a year ago, and I’ve been a little… stressed, I guess, since then. But I haven’t been treated for anything, if that makes sense. I have Medicare, and they covered everything after he… well. But no ongoing conditions, not that a doctor is looking after right now.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Ms. Sayar. Grief can be incredibly difficult. It’s good that you're thinking about your health as you navigate this. Okay, so no current medical conditions being actively treated. And you mentioned some stress following your husband’s passing. Has that stress manifested in any physical symptoms – things like difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, headaches, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. The sleeping is… unreliable. Some nights I barely sleep, others I sleep too much. And my appetite has been all over the place. Some days I don’t eat at all, others I just… eat whatever’s easiest. I get headaches sometimes, too, but I just take some over-the-counter pain relievers and it usually helps. It’s nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Difficulty sleeping, fluctuating appetite, and occasional headaches. Do those headaches have any particular characteristics?
PATIENT: Not really. They’re just… regular headaches. Not migraines or anything like that. Just a dull ache, usually around my temples. Sometimes it’s in the back of my neck. Like tension, I guess. They come and go. I haven’t really paid them much attention, to be honest. I figured it was just the stress.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar. And have you experienced any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No, not that I can recall. My vision’s okay, I think. I had my eyes checked last year, and they said everything was fine. I haven’t been feeling dizzy or anything like that. No chest pain, no shortness of breath… Honestly, nothing else that I’ve noticed. I really don’t go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, no significant changes in your vision, no dizziness, no chest pain or shortness of breath. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband… he had some heart trouble, that's why I know what to look for, but I've always been pretty healthy. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything chronic. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothing like that. I always thought I was lucky, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery either. I avoid hospitals if I can, to be honest. It reminds me too much of… everything. So, no, no surgeries. Just the usual childhood illnesses when I was little, but nothing major. Nothing that would require… a letter.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, and no significant childhood illnesses. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Just over-the-counter stuff. Pain relievers for the headaches, occasionally. And sometimes something for sleep if I'm really struggling, but I don't take it often. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I really try to avoid taking anything if I can. It just… makes me feel worse, somehow. I'd rather just deal with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional over-the-counter pain relievers and sleep aids. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I don't even have allergies to things like pollen or dust. No allergies. I'm pretty boring, health-wise.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, a little bit about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father had high blood pressure, I think. And his mother, my grandmother, she had… some kind of arthritis. And my husband's mother had cancer, but she was a smoker, so… That's about it, really. Nothing major. No one on either side had any… serious mental health issues.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure, arthritis, and cancer in your husband’s mother. And finally, a couple of quick questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband used to drink sometimes, but I don’t. And definitely no recreational drugs. I don't really socialize much anymore, to be honest. Mostly just keep to myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sayar. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. So, to summarize, you're a 33-year-old female with no significant past medical history, no surgeries, no known allergies, and no current medications, other than occasional over-the-counter pain relievers and sleep aids. You've experienced some stress following the loss of your husband, which has manifested in difficulty sleeping and fluctuating appetite, with occasional tension headaches. Your family history is relatively unremarkable, and you don't smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Perfectly right, actually. You listened very carefully. I appreciate that. I just… I want to make sure this trip can happen. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sayar. I understand. Given your history and what you've described, I don't see any immediate medical contraindications to flying. However, to be thorough, I'd like to do a brief physical exam just to check your heart and lungs, and assess your overall well-being. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. A quick exam sounds perfectly fine. I just want to get this letter, and get everything sorted.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is good, 122 over 78. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems within normal limits, Ms. Sayar.
PATIENT: That's good to hear. I really appreciate you taking the time to check everything so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sayar. Here is your fit-to-fly letter. It states that, based on my examination today, you are medically cleared for air travel. Please review it to make sure all the information is correct. It is dated today, August 2, 2025. I also recommend that you stay well-hydrated during your flight, and get up and move around periodically to prevent blood clots. And, if you experience any unusual symptoms during your trip, please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Perfect, yes, that's everything. Thank you so, so much, Doctor. This is a huge relief. No, I don’t think I have any questions. You’ve covered everything. You’ve been very kind, and very helpful. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I’m glad I could help. I wish you a safe and enjoyable trip. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Take care.
