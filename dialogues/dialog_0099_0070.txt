DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hmm? Oh, right. New here. Just...social visit, they said. Medicare, you know? Old man needs check-up, I guess. Not feeling bad, really. Just… what do you do here? Like, what are you checking for?
DOCTOR: A “social visit”?
PATIENT: Social... yeah. The lady on the phone said it was. New to the area, need to get… registered, I think. Something about being seen. Honestly, I don't remember much. Lots of paperwork. Is this a good clinic? It looks… clean. My ex-wife always complained about doctors.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Szmyd, a “check-up” – which is what I believe you’re referring to – is a routine assessment of your overall health. We look for any potential problems before they become serious. It’s preventative care. It’s... common sense, really. Now, let’s try to be a bit more specific. You said you're not feeling bad, but are there any changes you've noticed lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? I’m old, things change all the time. My knees ache, that's a change. I forget where I put my glasses, that’s a change. Is that what you mean? Honestly, I mostly just want to make sure my insurance works okay. That’s important.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, those are everyday occurrences, Mr. Szmyd. I’m looking for anything new or different from your usual baseline. Anything that’s bothering you, even if it seems minor. Have you experienced any fever, chills, weight loss, fatigue, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, changes in bowel or bladder habits… shall I continue?
PATIENT: Woah, slow down! You're listing off things from TV commercials! I don't have all those things! Look, I used to work with actors, okay? I know when someone's making a big deal out of nothing. I eat, I sleep, I… occasionally forget things. Is that a problem? You’re going to give me a headache with all these questions. I think my ex-wife asked questions like this, always trying to find something wrong. Is this going to cost me a lot of money?
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I assure you I am not trying to “find something wrong.” I am trying to gather a comprehensive medical history. It's standard procedure. Now, let's try a different approach. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis. Yeah, the knees, definitely. And… something with the blood pressure, maybe? The doctor back home, he always talked about it, gave me pills. I think it started with a ‘H’… Hypertension? Is that right? I take a lot of pills, honestly. I don’t even know what half of them are for anymore. See? Lots. My ex-wife managed them. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, yes. That’s high blood pressure. And you said arthritis in your knees. Any other joints affected?
PATIENT: Hmm… probably. My back, sometimes. And my hands… they get stiff. It’s like…old man stuff, you know? It's not like a sudden pain, just… achy. I used to have to hold makeup brushes all day, very delicate work. Maybe that did something. It's been years since I did that work, though. Much easier just to sit now. Do you…do you know anything about theater makeup?
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, with all due respect, we can discuss your professional history later. Right now, I need to focus on your medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries... Oh, boy. Let me think. There was the tonsils, when I was little. And… something with my appendix, I think. And… my ex-wife made me get a hernia fixed. She said it was embarrassing. That one was… unpleasant. Lots of pain. I don’t remember much else. Old doctors, everything was different back then. They just… cut you open and fixed it. Not like now, with all the fancy machines. Is this going to take much longer? I'm starting to get a little bored.
DOCTOR: Tonsils, appendix, hernia repair. Good. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I used to have to taste all the makeup, make sure it didn't irritate the actors' skin. Some of that stuff smelled awful. No…I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Except maybe my ex-wife, but that’s not a medical allergy. Is that a funny answer? You don't look like you're amused.
DOCTOR: Let me pull up your EHR information. The clinic received some records from your previous physician. Ah, here we are. It confirms the hypertension, the hernia repair… and it lists a penicillin allergy. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Penicillin allergy? Huh. Well, that would explain why I always felt strange after taking that white pill. Itchy skin, maybe? I don’t remember much, honestly. It was years ago. So, they do have some information? Good. That’s good. Maybe this won’t be so bad after all. Now, what else do you need to know? And can we please hurry it up? My knees are starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No. My mother…she passed a long time ago. When I was young. And my father... he disappeared during the war. Never knew much about him, to be honest. It’s not something I like to talk about. Is that information important? Because I don’t remember much about either of them. They were…old people. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright if you don't remember much. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no, no. Not anymore. I used to, back in the old days, when everything was different. Terrible habit. Quit years ago. My ex-wife made me. Said it was ruining my complexion. She was always worried about my looks. Do you… do you ever talk to actors? I could tell you some stories. Really fascinating people.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, with all due respect, we need to stay focused. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Well… a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Maybe two. Nothing heavy. It helps me relax. My ex-wife didn’t approve, naturally. Said it was bad for my liver. She was always telling me what was bad for me. Is she… is she listed in this record somewhere? It's always about her, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, tell me about your typical diet. What does a normal day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Diet? Well, I eat. That’s about it. Toast, usually. Sometimes soup. I don’t really cook. Not anymore. Used to make a nice borscht, back in the old days, but… it’s too much trouble now. I mostly just eat what’s easy. Leftovers, sometimes. Or… whatever someone brings me. I don’t pay much attention to it, honestly. It's all just… fuel. Is that a good enough answer? I'm feeling a little tired now. Can we finish soon?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. I think I have enough information for now. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. If you could just sit up here for me.
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, right. Exam. My knees, you know. Is this going to hurt? Because I don't do well with pain. And please, try not to poke me too much. I’m a delicate flower, you know. Just get it over with quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly… muffled. Take a deep breath in… and out… Again… Some slight wheezing on exhalation. 145 over 90. A bit elevated. Tympanic membranes appear normal. Throat is clear, but some mild redness at the back of the tongue. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but slightly…distended. Alright, Mr. Szmyd. I'm going to order some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a better picture of what’s going on. We need to address your blood pressure, and I want to rule out any potential lung issues.
PATIENT: Lung issues? What kind of lung issues? Is it… serious? I don't smoke anymore! I told you! Is it something I caught from the actors? Some of them were… questionable characters. Blood work… X-ray… This sounds expensive. Will Medicare cover all of this? Please tell me it's not something bad. I don't want to end up in the hospital. I have no one to take care of me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, please try to remain calm. We're just being thorough. The wheezing I heard could be caused by a number of things – a simple cold, allergies, or something more. The X-ray will help us determine the cause. And yes, Medicare should cover the necessary tests. Now, I'm also going to prescribe you a low-sodium diet plan and recommend you start walking for at least 30 minutes a day. These lifestyle changes can significantly improve your blood pressure. I’ll also have the nurse give you a referral to a cardiologist for a consultation. It's important to address these issues proactively. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Cardiologist? A heart doctor? Oh, this is serious. My ex-wife always said my heart was weak. I don’t want to see a specialist! I just wanted a check-up! Low-sodium diet… walking… It sounds exhausting. I can barely get out of this chair. Can't I just take some pills? Is there a pill for all of this? My ex-wife always had a pill for everything. This is a disaster. An absolute disaster.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, please listen to me. I understand you're anxious, but avoiding a specialist won't make the problem go away. A cardiologist is the best person to assess your heart health and determine the appropriate course of treatment. And while medication can help manage your blood pressure, it’s not a substitute for lifestyle changes. I’m not trying to scare you, but I’m concerned about your overall health. Ignoring these issues could lead to serious complications down the road. I'm giving you the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma. She's an excellent cardiologist and very patient-focused. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I'll also have the nurse review the low-sodium diet plan with you before you leave. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… Fine. Fine, I’ll see her. But I’m telling you, I don’t like this. Low-sodium diet… what does that even mean? No salt? Everything tastes bland without salt! This is going to be terrible. Absolutely terrible. Is there anything… anything at all that’s going to be easy? A pill, a potion, a magical cure? I’m too old for all of this. Just get it over with. Just get it over with. My ex-wife would have known what to do. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I’ve ordered the necessary tests and provided you with a referral to a cardiologist. The nurse will review the diet plan and answer any questions you have. I’ve documented everything in your chart, and I’ll follow up with you after you’ve seen Dr. Sharma. I think that concludes our consultation for today. Please, have a seat and the nurse will be with you shortly.
