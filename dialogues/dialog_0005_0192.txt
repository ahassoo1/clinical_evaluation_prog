DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it’s about this exam. For the… the army. They want me to take it. Gotta get checked out first, I guess. Seems silly, but rules are rules. Don’t see what’s wrong with me, but they insist.
DOCTOR: Right. The army. Yes, well, they do have their protocols. So, you're saying you feel perfectly healthy, no complaints whatsoever?
PATIENT: Perfectly. Never been sick a day in my life, practically. Strong as an ox, always have been. Worked with engines my whole life, you know. Keeps a man fit. Though my wife, Ingrid, she worries about my back sometimes. But that’s just… wives.
DOCTOR: “Just wives,” huh?
PATIENT: Well, they always think something’s wrong. Worrywarts, the lot of them. But seriously, doc, my back is fine. A little ache now and then, after a long day, but nothing I can’t work through. It’s not gonna stop me from… from serving, or anything. I just… don't want them wasting time on it, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll see what the exam says. Though, with all due respect, Mr. Hartness, dismissing your wife’s concerns – and your own aches and pains – isn’t the most… pragmatic approach to a medical assessment. It's my job to look at everything, regardless of whether you think it’s important. Now, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been seriously ill?
PATIENT: Seriously ill? No. Not once. Had a bad cold when I was a boy, maybe. But Ingrid always says that was just a sniffle. Nothing like these things you hear about on the news. Look, I’m a simple man, doc. I fix engines, I don’t… have a medical history.
DOCTOR: Right. A simple man. Very well. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had anything cut open. Why would I? I’m careful. Always been careful around machinery. Accidents happen, of course, but not to me. Ingrid tried to get me to get my…wisdom teeth out, years ago. Said they were crooked. But I told her, "If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it." And they never bothered me none.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Let's move on. Family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No. Both gone now. Dad went first, heart trouble. Worked too hard, I reckon. Always pushing himself. Mom… she just got old. Peaceful, mostly. She worried a lot, like Ingrid. Always fussing about something or other. Both Swedish, they were. Good, strong people.
DOCTOR: And did either of your parents have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Dad, like I said, heart trouble. Real bad towards the end. Couldn't climb a flight of stairs without getting winded. Mom… she had her… her arthritis, I think it was. Hands always stiff and swollen. She could barely knit towards the end. But that's just old age, really. Comes with the territory.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you, Mr. Hartness?
PATIENT: Me? What about me? I told you, I'm fine. Never been sick, never broken a bone, never had nothing seriously wrong. Ingrid keeps trying to tell me I got high blood pressure, but she just checks it when I'm mad about something. It’s always high when she does that. Makes no sense.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let's get some actual numbers, shall we?
PATIENT: Numbers? What kind of numbers? Look, I'm a practical man, doc. I deal with nuts and bolts, not… numbers. You gonna poke and prod me? Because I haven’t got all day. I’ve got an engine to rebuild, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Hartness, I am going to poke and prod you. It's called a physical exam. We need to check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… the usual. It will take about fifteen minutes. Then we'll get a better idea of whether this "fine" state of yours is as robust as you believe. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes, huh? Fine. But if you find nothing wrong, I expect a quick sign-off. Don’t want to waste the army’s time, or mine. And Ingrid’s gonna be furious if I’m gone too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Try to relax, and keep your arm still. 148 over 92. A bit elevated. And your pulse is 78, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart. Take a deep breath. Hmm. Interesting.
PATIENT: Interesting? What's interesting? Is something wrong? Ingrid was right, wasn’t she? She always says I worry too much, but this is what happens when you ignore a woman's intuition. Don't tell me I need pills or something. I don’t take pills.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, your blood pressure is consistently elevated. And I detect a slight murmur in your heart. It's not necessarily serious, but it warrants further investigation. Your weight is also significantly below what it should be for your height. And frankly, dismissing your wife’s concerns is… unwise.
PATIENT: Unwise? Look, I'm a grown man, doc. I can decide for myself what's going on with my body. A little murmur? Everyone gets a little murmur. And weight? I’m built lean. Always have been. Muscle, not fat. Ingrid just likes to… fuss. You’re trying to make something out of nothing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand you feel healthy. However, ignoring potential issues will not make them disappear. Elevated blood pressure can lead to serious complications, like heart attack and stroke. And your weight is concerning. A murmur requires investigation. I'm ordering an EKG, a blood test, and a chest X-ray. We need to rule out any underlying heart condition. And I strongly recommend a consultation with a cardiologist.
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Now you're just being ridiculous! An X-ray? Tests? This is what happens when you let doctors get involved. It's a waste of time and money, all because Ingrid thinks I'm made of glass. Look, I need this exam signed off. The army won't pay for all this nonsense. I'm perfectly capable of serving my country, and I don't need a bunch of tests to tell me that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, I cannot in good conscience sign off on this exam without addressing these findings. It would be unethical, and potentially dangerous. Your health is my primary concern, regardless of your… preferences. The army has specific requirements for a reason, and I doubt they would appreciate a knowingly incomplete assessment. I understand you're frustrated, but I am not going to compromise your well-being. I will order the tests. If you refuse, I will be unable to complete the exam, and will have to document that refusal. That decision is yours, but I strongly advise against it.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do your tests. But I swear, if it turns out to be nothing… Ingrid is getting a very pointed lecture about worrying too much. And if it delays my recruitment… I'll have a word with the sergeant, that's for sure. But do them quickly, alright? I haven't got all day to sit around while you poke and prod me. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. The EKG will take about five minutes. You'll need to lie still and relax. After that, the lab will draw some blood. It's standard procedure. Try to breathe normally. And I would suggest informing your wife that you are proceeding with the tests. It may alleviate some of her concerns.
PATIENT: I'll tell her. Though I doubt it’ll make much difference. She’ll probably just tell me I should have gone to the doctor sooner. Just hurry up. And don't expect me to thank you for all this unnecessary fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright. The EKG is complete. I’ll send it to the lab along with the blood work order. The nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood. It's just a routine panel, nothing to be alarmed about. Try to rest for a few minutes after the blood draw. And please, try to be more open to the possibility that there might be something worth investigating. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to your health.
PATIENT: Safe is overrated. I’ve lived a long life without doctors telling me what to do. But fine. I’ll sit here and let you poke around. Just get it over with. And tell the nurse to be quick. I have an engine waiting.
DOCTOR: Here’s the nurse now. She’ll get you taken care of quickly. I’ll be back to discuss the results when they’re available. Stubborn as a mule…
