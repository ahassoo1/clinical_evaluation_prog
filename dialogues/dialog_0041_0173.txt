DOCTOR: Hi Jailenne, welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Polczynski, nice to meet you too. Well, I've just been getting the chills lately. It's a bit weird, honestly. Not like a fever chill, just...cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills… that's good to know. And you said ‘lately’ – how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably about three or four days now? It comes and goes, but it's definitely not stopping completely. It's just annoying, you know? I feel cold even when it's warm.
DOCTOR: Right, comes and goes over the last three or four days. And feeling cold even when you’re warm… okay. Any other symptoms along with the chills?
PATIENT: Not really… I mean, I’ve been a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t these days? Nothing major. No cough, no sore throat, no aches or anything like that. Just the chills and a bit of feeling worn out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so chills and some fatigue, no other obvious symptoms. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I don't think so, actually. It just… happens. I haven’t noticed a pattern with what I'm doing or anything. Maybe it's worse at night, now that I think about it, but I'm not even sure. I've been trying to drink lots of water, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright. Water's a good idea. Let's talk a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox when I was a kid, like everyone else, and I had my tonsils out when I was younger, but that's about it. No big illnesses or anything, thankfully. I’m generally pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a kid, and chickenpox. Good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some issues with his heart a few years back, but nothing else really stands out. They’re both doing okay now, as far as I know. No major illnesses that run in the family, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Right, okay. High blood pressure in your mom, heart issues in your dad. Good to know. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I haven't really had any bad reactions to anything before. I can take most things, I think. I haven’t had to take much medication lately, though. Mostly just over-the-counter stuff for headaches, if needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even the over-the-counter headache stuff?
PATIENT: Just when I get a headache, which isn't often. I just take ibuprofen, the normal kind. Nothing else, I promise. I try to avoid taking pills when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, just ibuprofen as needed. Alright. Well, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and maybe take a look at your throat. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Polczynski. I'm happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds good, lungs are clear. Your temperature is slightly elevated, but not significantly. Your throat looks clear as well. I don’t hear or see anything immediately concerning. I'm going to check your blood pressure, just to get a full picture.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Hopefully it's nothing serious. I really just want to figure out what's going on and get back to normal. I’ve got a lot on my plate, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little on the higher side, but nothing too alarming at the moment. It's good you're getting this checked out. Given your symptoms and what I've found so far, it could be a few things. It could be a mild viral infection, or it might be related to stress, which can sometimes cause chills and fatigue. Since your blood pressure is slightly elevated, I'd like to run a few basic blood tests to rule out anything more serious. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. I mean, if it rules things out, that's good. I'm happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. Stress is definitely a possibility, to be honest. Work has been crazy lately. So yeah, blood tests are fine. What kind of tests are we talking about?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We’ll do a complete blood count – that’ll check for any signs of infection or anemia. We’ll also check your thyroid function, as that can sometimes cause chills and fatigue. And finally, we’ll do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. It's a pretty standard set of tests. It will take a few minutes to draw the blood. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that all sounds fine. Thyroid… I’ve heard of that being a thing. As long as it gives us some answers, I’m good. A few minutes, you said? No problem. Where do we go from here? Do I need to fast or anything?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. No, you don’t need to fast for these tests. We’ll just head over to the lab, and the phlebotomist will take a small blood sample. It should only take about 10-15 minutes total. Once the results are back – usually within a day or two – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. A day or two is fine. Okay, let's go to the lab then. I’m ready when you are, Dr. Polczynski. Hopefully it's nothing too serious, and I can get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s head over. I'll let the lab know to expect you. And try not to worry too much; we’re just being thorough. We'll figure out what's going on.
