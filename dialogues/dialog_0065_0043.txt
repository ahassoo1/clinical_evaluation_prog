DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. It's this headache, right here at the back of my head. Been botherin' me for a little while now, nothin' terrible, but… well, it just won’t go away, you know? Feels like a dull ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. A headache at the back of your head… and you say it’s been going on for a “little while”. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, I'd say about three weeks ago, maybe a little longer. It comes and goes, not constant. Some days I barely notice it, other days it’s just… there. Not throbbing, nothin’ like a migraine my daughter used to get. Just a steady ache, like someone's tightened a band around my head. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does. A dull, steady ache at the back of the head, intermittent for about three weeks. Any triggers you've noticed?
PATIENT: Triggers… now that you mention it, I don’t think so. I haven't been doin' anything different, really. Same routine as always. I do a lot of gardening, though. Maybe that? Bendin' over, sun, all that. But I've been gardenin' for years, and never had trouble before. I did help my grandson build a shed last month... lots of lifting and such. Could be that? I don’t rightly know. It's just... there.
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening and some recent lifting assisting with shed construction. And you haven't noticed any changes in your vision, any nausea, dizziness, or any weakness with this headache?
PATIENT: No, nothin' like that. Vision's fine, still read my newspaper every mornin’. No dizziness, and my hands are steady as they ever were. No nausea either, thankfully! I eat pretty good, you know. My daughter worries about that sometimes. Just this headache…it’s a bit of a nuisance, that's all. I just figured I'd get it checked out, see what you think.
DOCTOR: Alright. No changes in vision, no nausea, no dizziness, no weakness. And you said it doesn't interfere with your daily activities… just a nuisance. Do you have any other medical problems that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my prostate looked at a few years back, just somethin’ normal for a man my age, the doctor said. No big deal, just needed checkin’. And my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but nothin' I take medicine for, just watch my salt intake. Oh! And I broke my wrist when I was younger, fallin’ off a ladder. That healed up fine, though. Everything else… I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. I try to stay active, eat well, and get enough sleep. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of a prostate check, some elevated blood pressure, and an old wrist fracture. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had anythin' cut open, thank goodness. Just a few stitches here and there when I was a boy, runnin’ around gettin' into trouble. Mostly scrapes and bruises, nothin' serious. My wife… well, she had her gallbladder out a long time ago, but I never had anythin' myself. Just the usual bumps and scrapes, nothin' that needed a doctor’s knife.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother, she had… what was it? Arthritis, I think. In her hands, mostly. My father… he lived a long life, pretty healthy actually, ‘til the very end. He had a bit of heart trouble in his later years, but nothin’ major. My sister… she’s got diabetes, I think. And my daughter, she gets migraines, like I said. Does that help? It's hard to remember everything after all these years. I don't have much contact with my other relatives.
DOCTOR: Okay. Arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father, diabetes in your sister, and your daughter with migraines. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a one. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. Just a multivitamin every now and then, but that's it. I take some fish oil sometimes for my joints, but that's more for prevention, really. I usually try to tough things out, you know? Don’t like relyin’ on medicine if I can help it. I prefer a good night's sleep and a bit of fresh air, that usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds just fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m ready when you are. And please, still call me Percell. Makes me feel a little less…old.
DOCTOR: Of course, Percell. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 148 over 86. Not alarmingly high, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Your heart and lungs sound okay, a little quiet, but nothing concerning at the moment. Now, let’s just check your reflexes and coordination… Your reflexes are a little bit slow, and your coordination is good. Everything seems normal for now, but a slow reflex could indicate some underlying issues. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no numbness or tingling. Not at all. Hands feel fine, same with my feet. Sometimes they get a little cold in the winter, but that's just the weather, I think. Always been that way. Cold feet, warm heart, that’s what my wife used to say. But no, no numbness, no tingling, nothin' like that. Just the slightly slow reflexes, if that means anything. It’s funny, I don’t feel any different. That’s why I was surprised about the headache, really. Usually, somethin’ feels off if somethin’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, no numbness or tingling, despite the slightly diminished reflexes. And you feel otherwise well. Considering your age and blood pressure, we should investigate this headache further. I’d like to order some blood work, just to rule out any underlying issues. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and thyroid levels. Also, I'm going to recommend an MRI of the brain, just to rule out anything structural. It’s a precautionary measure, but it's best to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Thorough is good, I agree. Blood work and an MRI... Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. An MRI… that sounds a little scary, but if it helps figure things out, then I’m all for it. Will it involve any needles? I don't care for needles much, you know. And how long does it take? I have a grandson’s baseball game next Saturday, and I wouldn’t want to miss that.
DOCTOR: The blood work will require a small needle, I understand your apprehension, but it's a quick pinch, and we have skilled phlebotomists who are very gentle. As for the MRI, it doesn’t involve any needles. You'll lie inside a large machine, and it uses magnets and radio waves to create images of your brain. It takes about 30-45 minutes, and you’ll need to lie very still during the scan. It’s a painless procedure, but it can be a little noisy. As long as you don't have any metal implants – pacemakers, certain types of clips, etc. – you should be perfectly fine. I'll have the radiology department check your medical history beforehand to make sure it’s safe. The baseball game… we’ll schedule the MRI for early in the week, so you shouldn’t miss it. Does that alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help, Doctor. No metal, thank goodness. Just the usual aches and pains. 30-45 minutes… I can handle that. And scheduled for early in the week is perfect. I wouldn’t want to miss that game. My grandson, little Timmy, he’s been practicing so hard. Alright, let's do it. Blood work and MRI… Whatever it takes. I just want to get to the bottom of this headache and get back to normal. Can I still garden?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, you can absolutely still garden. There’s no reason to restrict your activities at this point. Just try to stay hydrated, and if you experience any worsening of your headache or any new symptoms – dizziness, vision changes, weakness – please contact us immediately. I’m going to write you a referral for the blood work and the MRI. The radiology department will call you to schedule the MRI appointment. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Hydrated, no new symptoms, follow-up in two weeks... I can remember that. Thank you for takin' the time to listen and figure things out. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I feel a bit better already, just knowin’ we’re gettin’ it checked out. Alright then, I guess I'll be headin' home. Thanks again, Doctor Duplichan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. It was my pleasure. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Just remember to contact us if anything changes. Here are the referrals, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. Have a good day, and enjoy the baseball game with your grandson!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. You have a good day too. And I definitely will enjoy that baseball game.
