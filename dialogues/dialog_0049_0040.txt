DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again… my flank, I think you’d call it. And it seems to come with… trouble with my waterworks, if you understand me. It’s been happening on and off for a while now.
DOCTOR: On and off for a while… alright. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, but… persistent. It feels deep inside, not on the surface. And it comes and goes, like waves, you know? Some days it’s barely there, others it’s hard to ignore. It’s usually on my right side, but sometimes it feels… both sides a little. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a little something to work with. And you mentioned trouble with your waterworks… could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I feel like I need to go quite often, even if there's not much there. And sometimes… it burns when I go. It’s not every time, mind you, but often enough to be bothersome. And sometimes it feels like I haven’t emptied my bladder completely, if you follow me. It’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, really.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be… delicate to discuss. Burning, frequency, and incomplete emptying… alright. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood… now, that’s a good question. I haven't seen any, not that I recall. But sometimes the colour seems a little… off. Not clear, like it should be. More of a… reddish tinge, perhaps? It’s hard to say for certain, you understand. I don’t pay that close attention every time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No fever, no chills, and my stomach’s been fine. I eat okay, and haven’t been sick at all. It’s just this pain and trouble with… well, you know. It's not affecting my appetite, thankfully. I still enjoy my meals.
DOCTOR: Very good. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. We'll listen to your abdomen, and I'll gently press on your sides and back. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable, alright? I'm not a fan of pain if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be gentle. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Normal bowel sounds… no obvious distension. Now, I'm going to gently press on your flanks and back. Tell me if anything is particularly tender. Okay… a little tenderness on the right flank, but not severe. No rebound tenderness. Bladder is palpable, feels normal size. Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Examination reveals some tenderness in your right flank. Given your symptoms and the tenderness, it could be a number of things, but a urinary tract infection is a possibility, or perhaps kidney stones. We will need to do some tests to confirm.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. What kind of tests are we talking about, Doctor? I hope nothing too… invasive. And will they tell us what’s causing all this trouble? I’ve been getting these pains for a while now, and I’d really like to get to the bottom of it. I'm also under Medicare, if that makes a difference to what tests are available.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course Medicare coverage is relevant. We'll start with a urine analysis – a simple test to check for infection or blood. We'll also do a urine culture, which will identify any bacteria present. If those results are inconclusive, or if your symptoms worsen, we may need to consider a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, which gives us a detailed picture of your kidneys, bladder, and surrounding organs. That would require a referral, of course. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A urine analysis and culture… yes, that sounds… manageable. A CT scan sounds a bit… serious, but if it’s necessary, I suppose it’s necessary. I trust your judgement, Doctor. So, the urine tests first, then we see what those say? And how long will it take to get the results? I do have a bit of a trip planned next month, and I’d like to know if it’s likely to interfere with that. It’s nothing definite yet, but… well, it’s important.
DOCTOR: Yes, the urine analysis and culture first. Those results usually take 24 to 48 hours. We'll call you as soon as we have them. If they show an infection, we can start you on antibiotics immediately. If they're clear, or show something else, then we'll discuss the possibility of a CT scan in more detail. As for your trip, hopefully it won’t be an issue, but it depends on the results. If we do need to do a CT scan, we’ll need to schedule it as soon as possible. I’ll write the orders for the urine tests now. Here you go. Please take this to the lab. They are just down the hall. And please let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's very helpful. Down the hall, you say? I should be able to manage that. And I will certainly let you know if anything changes, or if I think of any questions. It's just… worrying, you know? Having something not quite right for so long. But I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out. I suppose I’ll head to the lab now.
DOCTOR: Yes, go ahead. We’ll be in touch.
