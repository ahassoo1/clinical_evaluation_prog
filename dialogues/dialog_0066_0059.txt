DOCTOR: Hi Adyn, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Well, it's... my speech, I think. It's been a bit off, you see. Not as clear as it usually is. I wouldn’t say it’s bad bad, but… difficult, sometimes. I'm not entirely sure when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a bit off” and “difficult sometimes” is helpful. Let’s try to narrow it down a little. When you say it’s difficult, can you describe how it’s difficult?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a good question. It feels…slurred, I suppose. Like I’m not fully forming the words, even though I think I am. And sometimes…people have to ask me to repeat myself. It's not constant, though. It comes and goes, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Comes and goes is important information. And slurred speech… okay. Has this been happening more frequently lately, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Honestly? I really can’t say. My memory isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. It feels like it’s been going on for a little while, but whether it’s more recently… I couldn’t tell you for certain. My husband might have a better idea. He notices these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's good you're aware of it, and even better that your husband is observant. We can definitely try to get a clearer timeline. Now, has anything specific happened around the time you noticed this starting?
PATIENT: Specific...? That’s… tricky. Let me think. No, not that I recall. Nothing major, anyway. Work has been… work, you know? Construction. A bit tiring, but nothing out of the ordinary. We had a pretty big project finish up last month, but I didn’t feel any different then. I really wish I could be more helpful with a date or something.
DOCTOR: Okay. Construction work – that’s physically demanding, so fatigue is understandable. Let’s move on to other symptoms. Aside from the speech, have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness…? No, not that I’ve noticed. I mean, I get tired after a long day on the site, like anyone would. But no sudden weakness or anything like that. I can still do everything I need to, thankfully. My job requires a fair bit of physical work, and I haven't had any trouble keeping up.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to hear. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision...? Now that you mention it… perhaps a little bit of blurriness sometimes. It's very minor, and I just assumed it was my eyes getting tired from looking at blueprints all day. I wear glasses, you know, for reading, but my distance vision is fine. I haven’t had my eyes checked in… a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurriness, especially with close work, and needing glasses for reading… that's good information. Have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. Nothing severe, just a bit of a tension headache, like when I’m stressed. Dizziness, no, not really. And swallowing… no, I haven't had any trouble with that. Everything seems normal there, thankfully. I do get a bit thirsty working in the sun, though. Is this helping, Doctor? I'm trying my best to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is very helpful. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I do have Medicare, so I must have something on record. My husband usually handles all the medical paperwork. I know I was perfectly healthy as a child. As an adult… I think I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but they gave me some pills, and it seemed to sort itself out. I stopped taking them after a while, with the doctor’s approval, of course. Would my records have that information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, your records should have that information. Let me take a quick look… Okay, I see here a history of controlled hypertension, last checked about three years ago. And no other significant medical conditions listed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything and everything. And I haven’t had any bad reactions to medications either, as far as I can remember. My husband might recall if I've ever had a reaction, though. He's very careful about those things. Is this… is this a bad sign, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It's good you don't have any known allergies. And it's perfectly normal to not remember every detail. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while back. Just trying to eat a balanced diet, you know? Nothing prescribed, though. And I certainly don't take anything for my blood pressure now, as we discussed. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Alright, Adyn, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright with you. I'll check your reflexes, strength, coordination, and listen to your heart and lungs. It'll just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement. I’m happy to do whatever you need to find out what’s going on. I’m just glad to be getting this checked out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, I'm going to check your reflexes now. Please relax your arm. Good. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that alright? I try to keep my hands strong for work, you know. Lifting things and all that. It’s important to have a good grip.
DOCTOR: Excellent grip. 5/5 strength bilaterally. Now, I’m going to have you close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger. Very good. And now, touch my finger with your finger. Coordination is good as well. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Okay, everything sounds normal so far.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Doctor. So, what do you think it could be? Is it something serious? I know you haven't had much to go on, with my poor memory and all.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re proactive about getting this checked out. Based on the exam, everything sounds normal, which is a good sign. However, the slurred speech, even if intermittent, does warrant further investigation. Given your history of controlled hypertension, and the intermittent nature of the symptoms, a few possibilities come to mind. It could be related to fluctuations in blood pressure, though your current reading is within a reasonable range. It could also be something neurological, though the exam didn’t reveal any obvious deficits. To rule out more serious causes and get a clearer picture, I would recommend a few tests. Would you be comfortable with an MRI of the brain and a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor?
PATIENT: An MRI and…a monitor? Oh dear. That sounds…serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? I just don’t want it to be anything…major. My husband would be very worried. What would those tests even show? And… how expensive are they?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Adyn. It’s natural to be worried when we hear about tests like an MRI. Let me explain. An MRI – Magnetic Resonance Imaging – is a painless scan that takes detailed pictures of your brain. It can help us rule out any structural problems, like a small stroke or other neurological issues. The 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor is a small device you wear on your arm for a day. It measures your blood pressure at regular intervals, giving us a more accurate picture of how it fluctuates throughout the day and night. It’s not necessarily something bad. We’re doing these tests to be thorough and rule things out. Many times, these tests come back normal, and we can find another explanation. As for cost, it depends on your insurance coverage. I'll have the billing department check with Medicare to give you an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. Would you like me to go ahead and order those tests for you?
PATIENT: Okay. If it will help rule things out… then yes, please. Order the tests. I trust your judgement, Doctor. But… can you explain what happens during the MRI? I’ve never had one before, and I’m a little claustrophobic, I think. And how long does it take? I just… I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Of course, absolutely. It’s completely normal to be anxious about an MRI, especially if you’ve never had one before. The machine is a large, cylindrical magnet, and you will lie on a table that slides into the opening. It can feel a bit enclosed, but we can absolutely take steps to make you comfortable. First, you’ll remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, even some clothing. We’ll provide you with earplugs or headphones to reduce the noise, which can be loud. You will be able to communicate with the technician at all times via an intercom. The scan itself typically takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on what we’re looking at. You’ll need to lie very still during the scan to get clear images. If you're feeling claustrophobic, let the technician know immediately. They can pause the scan and even give you a mild sedative to help you relax. We can also discuss the possibility of an open MRI if you’re extremely anxious. It’s not as powerful as a traditional MRI, but it might be a good option if the enclosed space is too much. Does that help ease your concerns a little?
PATIENT: That does help, thank you. Knowing I can talk to someone and they can stop it if I get too anxious is a relief. And the headphones sound good. Thirty to sixty minutes… I can manage that, I think. So, what happens after the MRI and the monitor? How long will it take to get the results? And will I have to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: Good. We’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible. The technician will contact you directly to set up an appointment. You’ll wear the ambulatory blood pressure monitor for 24 hours, and then return it to the clinic. It usually takes a few days to a week for the radiologists to read the MRI results, and a few more days for me to review them. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Yes, you will definitely need to come back for another appointment. We’ll review the results together, discuss any potential findings, and create a plan based on what we find. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe headache, weakness, vision changes, or difficulty speaking – please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit. I’ll wait for the technician to call about the MRI. And I’ll try not to worry too much. Thank you again for your time and patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. It was my pleasure. Remember, we're here to help you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
