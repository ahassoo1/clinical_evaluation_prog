DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor Billman. It’s very kind of you to see me. I’m planning a cruise, you see. A lovely one, to the Mediterranean. And the cruise line… well, they require a bit of medical information before I can confirm my booking. Just a general check, really. Nothing to be alarmed about, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Right. A cruise, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. It’s been a dream of mine for years, actually. My husband, God rest his soul, always wanted to go, but… well, things never quite worked out. This feels like a good time, though. A nice change. I’m just wanting to be sure I’ve got everything sorted for the paperwork. Do you need a list of what they require?
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. We’ll just do a standard check-up. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Not… regularly, no. My husband handled all that, bless him. He always kept on top of things. Since he passed… well, I haven’t really needed to, to be honest. Just the occasional visit for a cold, you know. Nothing serious. I did see Doctor MacIntyre about five years ago when I twisted my ankle, but that was it. Would you like his contact information? Perhaps he has records?
DOCTOR: Five years is a long time, Ms. Squiers. We really need to get your current medical situation down. Do you have any ongoing medical problems?
PATIENT: Ongoing… problems? Hmm. Not that I’m aware of, no. I get a bit of aches and pains, naturally, at my age. But nothing I take anything for. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, that’s why I have these glasses. But truly, nothing a person would call a problem, Doctor. I feel quite fit for my age, if I may say so. Do you want me to list everything I had as a child? Perhaps that will help?
DOCTOR: Childhood illnesses aren’t typically relevant for a cruise physical, Ms. Squiers. I’m trying to understand if you have any current conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that. Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh dear, you’re asking a lot! No, no chest pain. Absolutely not. Shortness of breath… sometimes when I climb a lot of stairs, perhaps? But I’m not a very active person these days. And dizziness… well, I get a little lightheaded if I stand up too quickly, but that’s just my age, isn’t it? I really don't think I have anything serious, Doctor. I just want to be sure I'm fit enough to enjoy my cruise. Would it help if I told you about the time I fell off a ladder decorating the shop window? It wasn't too bad, just a bruised ego, mostly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, with all due respect, we need to focus. I’m trying to assess your overall health. Do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. No, not regularly. I sometimes take paracetamol for headaches, if they get bad. And I had some indigestion tablets last month when I ate a particularly spicy curry, but that was a one-off. Otherwise… no, nothing at all. I’m a very healthy eater, you see. I bake my own bread, and I always use fresh ingredients. That must count for something, mustn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That's a tricky one. I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. My husband always said I was a very hardy soul. Oh! Wait a moment. I did get a bit of a rash once, years ago, when I used a new hand cream. But it went away after a few days, so it couldn't have been too bad. It was lavender scented, if that makes any difference. Is that what you mean by allergies, Doctor? A rash?
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, we are going in circles. I need a clear answer. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed…? Oh dear. No, not that I recall. Never. My husband always took care of all the doctor’s appointments and such. He said I worried too much about things, and he handled everything. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been quite healthy. A bit of aches and pains, naturally, at my age, but nothing a good night’s sleep wouldn’t cure. I really don’t think I’ve ever been diagnosed with anything. Would he have told me? It’s possible, I suppose… but I truly don’t remember. This is all a bit stressful, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. It’s standard procedure for a cruise physical. I need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. If you'll just sit back, please.
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. That sounds sensible. A good check-up is always a good thing. I hope I won’t be too much trouble. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if anything is amiss, even if it's just a little thing. I want to be perfectly fit for my cruise, you see. It's rather important to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 142/88. Not alarming, but we'll keep an eye on it. Heart sounds… somewhat normal, though a little rapid. Pulse is 82. Lungs are clear, but breathing seems slightly shallow. Do you smoke, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never in my life! My husband… he used to smoke a pipe, years ago, but I always insisted he do it outdoors. I can't abide the smell, and I certainly wouldn't dream of it myself. It’s terrible for your health, you know. Absolutely dreadful. I always told my husband… well, never mind. Are… are those readings bad, Doctor? I hope it’s not too serious. I really am quite fit, normally. Perhaps it’s just the stress of all this… paperwork and examinations.
DOCTOR: It's not terrible, Ms. Squiers, but it warrants further investigation. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and rapid pulse, and your lack of a recent medical history, I recommend we do some blood work. Just to rule things out. And I’d like an EKG, just to check your heart rhythm. We can get it done here in the clinic. It’s fairly quick.
PATIENT: Blood work… and an EKG? Oh dear. That sounds… rather a lot. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, I feel perfectly alright, you see. Just a bit flustered, perhaps. And I was hoping to get my cruise paperwork sorted today. Perhaps if I just relaxed a bit, everything would go back to normal? I really don't like hospitals or… or things like that. I always get terribly anxious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I understand your anxiety, but I am trying to ensure your safety. You are planning an overseas trip, and it is my professional responsibility to assess your health risks. These tests aren’t optional; they’re necessary. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially when you have no recent medical records. I can order the blood work and EKG right now. It will take about an hour to complete. And frankly, a little anxiety is preferable to a medical emergency on a cruise ship.
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. If you insist. It’s just… all this is rather upsetting. And I was hoping to enjoy a nice, relaxing cruise. If it is absolutely necessary, then I suppose I have no choice. But please, be gentle with me. I really don’t like needles, and… and I get a bit faint sometimes. Will it be very painful? And how long will it take? Perhaps if I close my eyes and think of the Mediterranean…
DOCTOR: The blood work involves a simple needle prick. It will be quick, and the nurse is very good. As for the EKG, it just involves placing some stickers on your chest. It's painless. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work and an order for the EKG. The nurse will come in shortly to explain everything. I’ll review the results as soon as they come back. In the meantime, try to relax. And try not to worry unnecessarily.
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. Thank you… I suppose. Stickers… and a needle… If you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll just sit here for a moment and try to calm my nerves. It all seems rather a lot… But I do want to enjoy my cruise. I just hope everything is alright.
