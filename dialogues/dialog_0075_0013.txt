DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Panjoj. Welcome to the clinic. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It feels like there’s always some left, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty emptying your bladder completely – feeling like you can't get all the urine out. And you said this has been happening for “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A little while… maybe a month or so? It’s hard to say exactly. Time… it kinda slips away. It wasn't bad at first, just a little bit left. But it’s gotten… more noticeable lately. It worries me some. It feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s been gradually worsening over the past month or so, and it’s now causing you some discomfort. That’s important information. To help me understand better, can you describe what that discomfort feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not pain, exactly. It’s more… a fullness. Like there’s a weight there, even after I think I’m done. And sometimes, when I try to go again, it’s hard to start. Like it takes effort. It's not sharp, just… a pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness and pressure, even after voiding, and some difficulty initiating the stream. That’s helpful. And you mentioned difficulty starting—does that happen every time, or just sometimes?
PATIENT: Just sometimes, Doctor. Not every time. Most of the time it starts okay. But maybe one out of every… three or four times? It just takes a little… push, you know? I don’t strain hard, but I have to… concentrate on it more. It's mostly in the mornings, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, mostly in the mornings, and requiring a bit more effort to initiate the stream about a quarter of the time. Have you noticed any other changes in your urination, such as increased frequency—needing to go more often—or urgency—a sudden, strong need to go?
PATIENT: No, not really. I go about the same number of times as always, I think. And I don't feel like I have to rush, usually. It doesn’t feel urgent. It’s just… the emptying part is the trouble. And like I said, the fullness afterward.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No changes in frequency or urgency. That helps narrow things down. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills. My belly feels alright. It doesn’t hurt. Just that fullness, like I said. I haven't felt sick or anything like that. I eat pretty good, mostly fish and berries.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No fever, chills, or abdominal pain. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… not much, really. I had my appendix taken out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And my wife… she passed away a few years back. That’s about it. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Lived a simple life. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Appendix removal is good to have on record. And I’m very sorry for your loss. Medicare is noted as well. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you take any supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any pills, or anything like that. Never really needed to. Just the usual… vitamins sometimes, when I remember. But not every day. My wife used to remind me, but… well. Nothing regular, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements. And you have no known allergies to medications, food, or anything else, correct?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of berries… sometimes I try new ones, even! Never had any trouble. I guess I’m just lucky.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… that’s a hard one. My wife’s family… they had some heart trouble, I think. Her mother, mostly. And… my mother’s side… there was some sickness, but I don’t know what kind. We didn’t talk about it much. We lived pretty far out, and didn’t see doctors often.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart trouble on your wife’s side and some unspecified illness on your mother’s side. That's helpful, even if it's not a lot of detail. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife didn't like it. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a small sip at Christmas sometimes, with friends. And I definitely don’t use any… recreational drugs. Never had any interest in that. Just fish and berries, mostly. A simple life, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I’ll also do a quick prostate exam. It’s a standard part of evaluating urinary issues in men. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A prostate exam…? Oh. Well… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? It sounds… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It is a standard part of the evaluation, Mr. Hilber, and helps us assess the prostate gland, which can contribute to urinary symptoms. I understand it can be uncomfortable, and I'll do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. We can certainly discuss alternatives if you'd prefer, but it provides valuable information. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail before you decide?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain it to me. I'm… a little nervous, to be honest. I'm not used to doctors doing… things like that. Just tell me what it involves, and how long it will take. And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Certainly. It involves a gentle insertion of a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to feel the size, shape, and texture of the prostate gland. It allows me to check for any abnormalities, such as enlargement or tenderness. It typically takes less than a minute, Mr. Hilber. You may feel some pressure, and some mild discomfort, but it shouldn’t be painful. If you do experience any significant pain, please let me know immediately, and we can stop. I'll be as gentle as possible. It's important information to help determine the cause of your symptoms, and whether further testing is needed. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that makes a little more sense. Pressure… I can handle pressure. It’s just… the thought of it. It’s… personal, you know? But I understand it’s important. And you said it won’t take long. Alright… alright, I guess I can do it. But please be gentle, Doctor. And tell me if you see anything… anything I should be worried about.
DOCTOR: Thank you for agreeing, Mr. Hilber. I appreciate your trust. I will be as gentle as possible. And I will certainly explain anything I find, and we'll discuss it together. If you could lie on your side with your knees bent, that would be perfect. Let me know when you're ready, and we'll get started. Take your time.
PATIENT: Alright… I’m lying down now. On my side, knees bent. It feels… strange. Just tell me when you’re starting, so I don’t get surprised.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I'm going to gently insert my finger now. It might feel a little cool at first. Okay, just relax. I'm palpating the prostate now… Hmm… the prostate feels slightly enlarged, but it’s smooth and symmetrical. There’s no obvious tenderness. It feels… firm, but not hard. Okay, that’s all done. I apologize for any discomfort.
PATIENT: Slightly enlarged…? Oh. Is that… bad? What does that mean? Firm… is that better or worse than… hard? I'm getting worried now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. A slightly enlarged prostate is quite common as men age – it's called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it can cause urinary symptoms like the ones you've been experiencing. “Firm” is better than “hard,” as a very hard prostate could indicate a more concerning issue, such as infection or, in rare cases, cancer. Yours is firm, but not rock-hard, which is a good sign. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urine analysis to check for infection, and a PSA blood test to help assess your risk of prostate cancer. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A PSA test…? Cancer…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Urine analysis… that sounds easy enough. But the blood test… for cancer… I’m really starting to worry now. Is it… is it likely to be cancer? I don’t want to be sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Hilber. It's natural to be worried when you hear the word “cancer.” However, it's important to remember that a PSA test is not a definitive diagnosis of cancer. It simply measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood, which can be elevated in cases of prostate cancer, but also in many other, less serious conditions, like BPH or infection. Many men with elevated PSA levels do not have cancer. The test simply helps us determine if further investigation is needed. We'll discuss the results carefully and, if necessary, consider additional tests, such as a biopsy, to get a definitive answer. For now, let’s focus on getting the urine analysis and PSA test done. We'll take it one step at a time. Would you like me to explain the procedures for those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain the tests. The more I know, the less worried I’ll be, I think. Just tell me what I have to do, and what the results mean. And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The urine analysis is very simple. You'll be given a sterile cup, and I'll ask you to provide a urine sample. It checks for signs of infection or other abnormalities. It doesn't require any special preparation. The PSA blood test is also straightforward. A small amount of blood will be drawn from your arm. You don’t need to fast or do anything special beforehand. The lab results usually take about 3 to 5 business days to come back. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or significant pain while urinating, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about the procedures or what to expect?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Urine sample… blood test… wait a few days. I’ll try to be patient. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Explaining everything… it makes me feel a little better. I still worry, but… a little better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. It’s perfectly normal to be worried, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the urine sample and draw the blood. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… the tests. And waiting. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I'll go wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before the nurse arrives. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
