DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Uh, it’s for a tryout. For a team. Need to get checked out, make sure I’m… you know… good to go. It’s a sports thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lamark, a sports physical. Excellent. To get started, can you tell me a bit more about the sport you’re trying out for?
PATIENT: It’s… wrestling. Freestyle wrestling. Not professional, just… a local team. Trying to get back into it, been a while.
DOCTOR: Wrestling, fantastic! It's quite demanding. And you said it's been a while… roughly how long has it been since you were regularly involved in wrestling?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Let me think… probably… fifteen years? Maybe a little more. I did some lifting here and there, but nothing serious. Just trying to stay in some kind of shape.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years, okay. That’s good to know. We’ll definitely want to be thorough. Now, have you experienced any pain, injuries, or discomfort recently – anything at all, even if it seems minor – that might be related to wrestling or just general activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… my shoulder's been a bit creaky lately. Left one. Just when I lift things, nothing major. And sometimes my knees feel a little stiff in the morning. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Creaky shoulder and morning stiffness in the knees, alright. We’ll take a closer look at those. And just to get a complete picture, have you had any other medical issues in the past – any surgeries, chronic conditions like diabetes or heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No surgeries. No… nothing like diabetes. Blood pressure's usually okay when I check it at the pharmacy, but that's… not often. I think I had a bad flu a few years back, but that's it. Honestly, I don't go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history, just a flu a few years ago. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Just… coffee. Lots of coffee. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Coffee doesn’t count as medication, Lamark. Alright, and finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s excellent. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Sure. Just tell me if I'm getting too heavy, I can skip it.
DOCTOR: 129 pounds, alright. And your height is listed as 183 centimeters. That gives us a BMI of… 38.2. We'll discuss that briefly later, but it's not the primary concern right now. Let’s check your blood pressure and pulse first. Could you please extend your left arm?
PATIENT: Okay. Thirty-eight… is that bad? I told you I shouldn't have had that second coffee this morning.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 155/90 and your pulse is 78. The blood pressure is a little elevated. We’ll want to keep an eye on that, but it could be due to being here at the doctor’s office – some people get anxious. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Sounds clear. Now I’m going to check your range of motion in your shoulder and knees, since you mentioned some discomfort there. Can you lift your left arm up as high as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Okay. There we go. It's… a little tight. Feels okay, but doesn't go all the way up without… you know. Feeling it.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just checking for any tenderness. And you’re right, there's a slight restriction in your range of motion. Now, let’s check your knees. Can you bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Okay… there. It’s a little… creaky. And I can feel a bit of a pop in there sometimes. Doesn’t hurt bad, just… feels old. Like it needs oiling or something.
DOCTOR: Alright, there’s some crepitus in both knees, which is common with age and activity. And I feel a slight pop on the left knee as you bend it. No significant swelling or tenderness at this time. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and muscle strength. Could you please sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Sure. Reflexes… haven’t thought about those in a long time. I hope they still work.
DOCTOR: Alright, your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'm going to ask you to push against my hand with your legs. Just push as hard as you can. First, your right leg… And now your left leg… Strength is 5/5 in both legs, good. Okay, Lamark, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and the exam, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and you have some crepitus and a slight restriction in range of motion in your left shoulder and both knees. It’s good that your strength and reflexes are normal. Given your history of being away from wrestling for fifteen years, I recommend starting slowly with your training to avoid injury. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, slow… got it. Fifteen years is a long time. Hmm… well, I guess the big question is… do you think I’m gonna break anything trying to get back into it? That’s the main thing my coach wanted to know. And… uh… should I worry about the blood pressure? Is that something serious?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, and a smart one to ask. Based on the exam, I don’t believe you’re at immediate risk of breaking anything, but you absolutely need to be cautious. Starting slowly and listening to your body are crucial. Warm up thoroughly before each session, and don't push yourself too hard too soon. Regarding your blood pressure, it’s a little elevated, and we should address it. It's not necessarily an emergency right now, but consistently elevated blood pressure can lead to more serious health problems down the line, like heart disease and stroke. I recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home for a week or so. You can get a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. If it remains consistently above 140/90, I’d like you to schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss lifestyle modifications or medication options. Do you have access to a home blood pressure monitor?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think I can get one. The pharmacy down the street has them, right? Okay, monitor… got it. So, basically, take it easy, warm up, and check my blood pressure. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like… stretches or something? My coach is old-school, doesn’t really believe in all that fancy stuff.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Take it easy, warm up thoroughly, and monitor your blood pressure. As for stretches, while your coach might be old-school, incorporating some gentle stretching and flexibility exercises can definitely help prevent injuries and improve your performance. This handout has some basic stretches for wrestlers that you can try. Focus on shoulder stretches, hamstring stretches, and quad stretches. Also, pay attention to your hydration – drink plenty of water before, during, and after training. I'm also going to give you a note to take to your coach, outlining my recommendations about starting slowly and warming up properly. It's important that he understands the importance of preventing injuries, especially given your time away from the sport. Do you have any other questions for me today, Lamark?
PATIENT: Okay, great. A note for the coach… good idea. He’ll probably ignore it, but it's worth a try. No, I think that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been really helpful. I was worried I was gonna be too old to do this, but you made me feel a little better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lamark. I’m glad I could help. Age is just a number, but it is important to be smart about your body and take things slowly. Remember, listen to your body, warm up properly, monitor your blood pressure, and don’t hesitate to come back if you experience any pain or discomfort. Here are those handouts and the note for your coach. Best of luck with your training! And please, don’t push yourself too hard. .
