DOCTOR: Right. Evann Buoniconti, 35. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Ruocco. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I understand I scheduled this appointment to discuss… plans for the future, should something… unexpected occur. I believe it has to do with making sure my wishes are known, if I am unable to communicate them myself. I’m terribly sorry, it’s all rather vague in my mind. Is this about a form, perhaps? A document?
DOCTOR: A document… yes, likely. Look, I see here you scheduled for “advance care planning.” It’s… about what happens if you become incapacitated. Can't speak for yourself, that sort of thing. Honestly, most people don’t think about it until it's too late. It’s a bit… morbid, if you ask me. Are you feeling unwell?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, Doctor. Not at all. It’s not about feeling unwell, not presently. It's… a friend mentioned it. They recently went through a difficult situation with a family member and suggested I get something in order. Something official. They used words like “POLST” and “Advance Directive,” but I confess I don’t recall the details. I just… want to be prepared, I suppose. Is it a complicated process? I’m afraid I’m not very good at remembering things, and filling out forms… well, it often ends in frustration.
DOCTOR: POLST… Advance Directive… yes, paperwork. Lots and lots of paperwork. And legal jargon. Honestly, it's a waste of everyone’s time, if you don’t have a serious condition. Are you currently under the care of another physician for anything significant?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I haven't seen another physician recently. I… I work with my hands, you see. I'm an etcher, an engraver. It keeps me quite occupied, thankfully. And reasonably healthy, I believe. I haven't needed to consult a doctor for anything beyond the usual check-ups in… well, it's been quite some time, actually. Is this form… required for certain professions, perhaps? Because I confess, I was under the impression it was something I should have, rather than something I needed.
DOCTOR: Required?
PATIENT: No, certainly not required. My friend… she just explained it as a way to… ease the burden on loved ones. If something were to happen, they would know what I would want. Though, truthfully, I'm not entirely sure what I would want. I've never really considered… the specifics. Would someone guide me through that part? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed, I must admit. Perhaps it’s best if I simply explain what I don't want, if that’s possible?
DOCTOR: Look, I have other patients waiting. This isn’t really my area of expertise. It's more of a… legal thing, a philosophical thing. I’m a doctor, I treat illnesses. Not… end-of-life wishes. I can document that you discussed it, but I'm not going to sit here and debate your preferences. Do you have any actual medical concerns?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I see. I apologize, Doctor. I hadn't realized it would be such a… burden. I simply hoped to gain some clarity, and to have a document in place for peace of mind. If it truly isn't within your purview, perhaps you could recommend someone who specializes in this area? Someone who can help me navigate the… philosophical aspects, as you put it? I wouldn't want to take up any more of your valuable time. Perhaps a social worker, or a legal professional familiar with these matters? I assure you, I have no pressing medical concerns at this moment. Just this… uncertainty.
DOCTOR: There’s a list of resources on the clinic website. Legal aid, social workers… that sort of thing. I'll print it for you. Honestly, it's all a bit of a hassle. There. That should get you started. Now, is there anything else, or can I dismiss you?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. Yes, this looks quite helpful. No, I believe that is all, for now. I truly appreciate you taking the time to explain things, even if it isn't your specialty. Thank you again for your assistance. I will review this information and see where it leads. Good afternoon, Doctor Ruocco.
DOCTOR: Right. Good afternoon. And try not to worry so much. It’s… usually not as complicated as it seems. .
PATIENT: .
