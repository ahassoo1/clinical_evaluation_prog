DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. My back... it's been really bad. Hurts all the time, you know? And… well, you probably know why I’m here, with the… the other thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do have a little information in your chart. But could you tell me more about this back pain?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it started a few weeks ago, just a little ache. I thought I maybe slept wrong. But it got worse. Now, it's like… a sharp pain, all down my back. It hurts to stand up straight, and even sitting isn’t great. And when I try to bend over… oof. Really bad. It makes me feel sick sometimes, too. Not throwing up sick, just… weak and dizzy.
DOCTOR: I see. A sharp pain radiating down your back, worse with movement, and accompanied by some dizziness and weakness. That doesn’t sound pleasant at all. When you say "a few weeks ago," can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was after I helped my niece with her garden. July 15th, I think. Yes, July 15th. We were moving rocks, big rocks, for a new flower bed. I felt a little strain then, but it wasn’t bad bad. Just… a little sore. Then, maybe a week later, it started to really bother me. Now it's… like this. It's always there, but some days are worse than others.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 15th after helping with the garden. And it's been progressively worsening since then. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly constant. There's always something. But it gets spikes, you know? Like… if I try to lift anything, even something small, or if I sit for too long. Then it really flares up. And at night… that’s the worst. Hard to get comfortable, hard to sleep. It wakes me up a lot. I have to keep changing positions. It’s been… a rough few weeks.
DOCTOR: Alright. Constant pain with spikes related to activity and worse at night. That's helpful information. Now, does this pain radiate anywhere – down your legs, into your hips, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Yes! It goes down my legs. Mostly my left leg, but sometimes my right one too. It's not always there, but when the pain is really bad in my back, it shoots down my leg, like… an electric shock almost. And sometimes I feel it in my hips, too. Like a deep ache, not like the sharp pain in my back. It makes it hard to walk sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, radiating pain down your legs, particularly the left leg, and hip aching. That gives me a clearer picture. Before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Um… well, you know about the cancer. I was diagnosed two years ago. I’ve been getting treatments since then, at the hospital in town. Other than that… I don’t really have much. I had the flu a few times, when I was a kid. And… I broke my arm once, when I was little. But nothing serious. No other big illnesses. I try to stay healthy. I eat good food, mostly fish and fruit. And I walk when I can, but… not so much lately with the back pain.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Meigs. It's good to know about your cancer treatment history; that is very important. Do you recall the type of cancer, and what kind of treatment you are currently receiving?
PATIENT: Yes, it’s… uh… ovarian cancer. And I'm getting chemotherapy. I finished a round about a month ago, and I'm supposed to start another one next week. That’s why I wanted to see you, Doctor. The pain… is it from the cancer getting worse? Or is it something else? It’s just… it’s so bad, and I’m worried. I don’t want to have to stop the chemo.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ms. Meigs. It's important to determine the cause of the pain before making any decisions about your treatment. It’s certainly possible the pain is related to the cancer, but it could also be something else entirely. I want to rule out other possibilities. Now, have you noticed any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Mostly my left leg, like with the pain. It’s… hard to explain. It feels kinda tingly, like when your foot falls asleep. And sometimes it feels weak, like I can’t lift it up very high. Not all the time, though. It comes and goes. It’s worse when I’ve been standing for a long time, or if I’ve been trying to walk. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling and intermittent weakness in your left leg, particularly with standing and walking. Thank you for sharing that information. To get a better understanding, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. I want to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, Ms. Meigs, I’m going to gently press on your back to see where it’s most tender. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. There is significant tenderness along your lower spine, particularly on the left side. And your range of motion is somewhat limited. And now, I’m going to have you lie on your back, and I’ll gently lift each leg up, one at a time. Just let me know if you feel any pain shooting down your leg. The straight leg raise on your left leg reproduces the pain radiating down your leg. That’s significant. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes and muscle strength in both legs. Your reflexes are normal, but I do notice some mild weakness in your left leg. Based on this brief examination, Ms. Meigs, it appears you may have a pinched nerve in your lower back, likely due to some inflammation or compression. However, given your cancer history, we need to rule out any other potential causes. I recommend we get an MRI of your lower back to get a clearer picture. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: MRI… yes, that's okay. If that’s what you think is best. A pinched nerve… that doesn’t sound too bad, but… what does that mean? Will I need surgery? Can I still get my chemo? I’m so worried, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’re worried, Ms. Meigs. Let’s take things one step at a time. A pinched nerve, also known as radiculopathy, means that a nerve in your lower back is being compressed or irritated, often by inflammation, a bulging disc, or bony changes. It can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in your legs and feet, as you’ve been experiencing. Now, whether you'll need surgery is something we can’t determine yet. Most cases of pinched nerves can be managed with conservative treatments such as physical therapy, pain medication, and injections. Surgery is usually only considered if these treatments aren’t effective. As for your chemotherapy, we will need to determine the cause of the pain before making any decisions about your treatment schedule. If the pain is related to the cancer, we may need to adjust your treatment plan. However, if the pain is due to something else, such as a pinched nerve, we may be able to continue your chemotherapy as planned. I'm going to order the MRI right away. I’ll also prescribe a mild pain reliever to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. Once we have the results of the MRI, we can discuss your treatment options in more detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… better. A mild pain reliever… that would be good. And waiting for the MRI… okay. I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t want anything to stop my chemo. That’s the most important thing. Can you… can you tell me when I can expect the results? And will someone call me when they’re ready? I don’t want to have to keep calling and asking.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. I understand your concern, and I’ll do everything I can to make this as smooth as possible for you. The MRI should be scheduled within the next few days. The radiology department will contact you directly to arrange a time. Once the scan is completed, the results typically take 24-48 hours to be reviewed by the radiologist. My office will then contact you as soon as I’ve had a chance to review the report. You won’t need to call and check; we’ll reach out to you directly. I will personally discuss the findings with you, and we’ll develop a plan together. In the meantime, I’m also going to write a prescription for gabapentin, a mild pain reliever that can help with nerve pain. It may take a few days to reach its full effect, so please be patient. And if the pain becomes unbearable, please don’t hesitate to contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I feel a little better, knowing we’re trying to figure it out. I appreciate you not making me call and ask about the results. That’s one less thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It’s my pleasure. I understand this is a difficult situation, and I want to assure you that I’m here to support you every step of the way. We’ll work through this together. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns that arise before our next discussion. I'll see you again once the MRI results are available. In the meantime, take care of yourself, and try to rest. Have a good day, Ms. Meigs.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye now.
