DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fogelstrom. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning! It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor Alanes. Um… well, I keep… belching. It’s been happening for a little while now. It’s… embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be quite disruptive and uncomfortable. “A little while now” – could you give me a bit more detail on that?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… two, three weeks? It doesn’t happen all the time, you know? More after I eat, usually. Big meals, especially. Sometimes even with just… water. It just… comes up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been occurring for about two to three weeks, more frequently after meals, particularly larger ones, and even occasionally with water. Is it painful at all, or just… uncomfortable?
PATIENT: No, not painful. Just… loud. And it feels… bubbly? Like a lot of air inside. Not like heartburn, you know? Just… poof.
DOCTOR: “Bubbly” is a good way to describe it. And you're saying it doesn’t feel like heartburn – no burning sensation in your chest?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Nothing like that. It's… just the air. I feel full pretty fast too, sometimes. Even if I don’t eat that much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no heartburn, just the sensation of air and a feeling of fullness quickly after eating, even with modest portions. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. Maybe… sometimes my stomach feels a little… swishy? Like liquid moving around. But that could just be… normal, right?
DOCTOR: “Swishy” is interesting. It’s good you’re paying attention to how your body feels. And yes, some stomach movement is perfectly normal. Has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I eat pretty much the same things all the time. Rice, beans, chicken… sometimes fish. I drink a lot of water. No… nothing different. I haven't tried any new foods or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no recent dietary changes. And just to confirm, are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or weight loss alongside these belches?
PATIENT: No, none of that. No sickness, no… problems with that. And no, I haven't lost any weight. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work a lot, so that’s probably it.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s helpful to know. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time, to be honest. I usually just try to take care of myself. No allergies, no… big illnesses. I had chickenpox when I was little, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Fogelstrom. It's good you’re generally healthy. And you said you haven't been to the doctor recently. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. I just… work hard and try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family…? Hmm. My mama… she had some stomach problems sometimes, but I don’t remember exactly what. Just… aches and pains. My papa was healthy. And my brother… he’s okay. No… nothing like this that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some stomach issues in your mother, but nothing specific that you recall. And your father and brother appear to be healthy. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. And definitely not… that other stuff. I just… don’t. I take care of myself.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. One final question regarding your current medications: Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t take pills or anything. Just… water. And sometimes, when my muscles hurt, I use a cream. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for answering all of my questions so thoroughly. It sounds like you are generally quite healthy, and you're very mindful of your body. Given your symptoms – the belching, the feeling of fullness, and the occasional “swishing” sensation – and considering your history, it could be something as simple as aerophagia – excessive air swallowing – or possibly some mild indigestion. However, to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. If that will help, then yes. I want to know what's wrong. I just… I want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s always best to investigate. Please lie down on the examination table, if you would. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently palpate your stomach to check for any tenderness. I’m listening now. Take nice, deep breaths. Okay, I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. No signs of obstruction. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No… that doesn’t hurt. Just… feels normal. Maybe a little… squishy? Is that a word?
DOCTOR: "Squishy" is a perfectly good word! And no pain, that’s good. I don’t feel any masses or significant tenderness. Your abdomen is soft. Based on the exam, everything feels normal physically. Given your symptoms and the results of the physical, I’m leaning towards a functional gastrointestinal issue—meaning something is affecting your digestion without a clear structural cause. I’d like to start with some conservative measures, and we can see if those help. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. What kind of measures? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The first thing I recommend is being mindful of how quickly you eat and drink. Try to eat smaller meals, chew your food thoroughly, and avoid carbonated beverages if possible. Also, avoid chewing gum or sucking on hard candies, as those can cause you to swallow more air. We can also try an over-the-counter medication like simethicone—Gas-X—to help reduce gas. It’s generally safe and effective for occasional relief. I'm going to write you a note outlining these recommendations. If your symptoms don't improve within a week or two, or if they worsen, please come back and see me. We may need to consider further investigation, such as a blood test to rule out celiac disease or a referral to a gastroenterologist. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Smaller meals, chew more, no bubbles… I can do that. Gas-X… I’ll try it. A week or two, and then come back? Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fogelstrom. I'm hopeful that these simple changes will make a difference. I’ll also give you a handout with more information on managing gas and bloating. Here you go. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for listening to me. I feel better just knowing what it might be.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fogelstrom. It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could help. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day!
