DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Tremor, they said. Honestly, it’s probably nothing. Old age, what can you do? They fuss over everything these days. Just…shaking, you know? Mostly in my hand. It’s annoying, is all. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Annoying is good to know, but let's try to be a little more specific, if you don’t mind. When did you first notice this shaking?
PATIENT: Oh, geez…when did I notice it? A while now. Months, probably. Look, I don't keep track of these things. It comes and goes. Is it important? I’ve got things to do, you know. Used to be a busy man, making pictures. Now…well.
DOCTOR: Okay, months. That’s helpful. And you said it comes and goes… is there anything specifically that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Worse? When I try to do things, naturally. Like, holding a fork. Writing. Things that require a… steady hand. Better? When I'm sitting still, I guess. Not that I do much of that anymore. Honestly, I think it’s just… nerves. I used to be able to handle anything, but these days… everything’s different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, “changed”? I’m eighty years old, everything changes. My wife passed, that’s a change. My memory isn’t what it used to be, that’s a change. Are we listing changes now? This is ridiculous. Just fix the shaking, please.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. I apologize if I’m asking too many questions. It's important for me to get a full picture. You mentioned your wife passing; I'm very sorry for your loss. When did that happen?
PATIENT: Oh, it was… a while ago. Last year, I think. Or maybe the year before. Time all blurs together. It doesn’t matter, does it? She’s gone. A good woman, but… well. Don’t want to talk about it. Really, let’s just focus on this hand. It’s embarrassing, you know? Trying to eat in public… a disaster.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. We can focus on the hand. Have you noticed any stiffness in your hand, or any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Stiffness… sometimes, maybe? It’s hard to say. My joints ache all over, that’s just… getting old. It’s not a sharp pain, if that’s what you’re asking. Just a general… discomfort. It's nothing a little rest doesn't help, usually. Though, what is restful these days? Too many doctors, too many questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for anything, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? A little something for my blood pressure, I think. And a vitamin, something the lady at the pharmacy recommended. Can’t remember the name. Honestly, I let my daughter handle all that. She’s the organized one. Why do you need to know all this anyway? Is this getting us anywhere?
DOCTOR: Okay. I just need to make sure I have a complete picture of your health. We’ll get there. Do you know the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't remember! It's a little white pill, that’s all I know. My daughter fills the thing every month. Ask her! Honestly, this is a waste of my time. Can’t we just try something for the shaking? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide. I understand your frustration. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. It won't take long. Can you extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don't expect miracles. I'm a stubborn old man, you know. And I've seen doctors come and go. They rarely know what they're doing. Just…hurry it up, will you?
DOCTOR: Okay. I see a tremor in both hands, which is more pronounced with movement. There's some mild rigidity as well. Your gait is a little bit slow, and I notice a slight shuffling of your feet. Do you have any trouble with your balance?
PATIENT: Balance? Not particularly. Maybe I’m not as nimble as I used to be, but what eighty-year-old is? It's just… old age. Look, is this it? What’s the diagnosis? And more importantly, what are you going to do about it? I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve observed, the most likely possibility is essential tremor, possibly with some signs of Parkinsonism. However, to be certain, I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out other potential causes. I'd also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Essential tremor? Parkinsonism? You're throwing around a lot of fancy words. Blood tests, a neurologist… More appointments, more waiting, more poking and prodding. Honestly, it’s ridiculous. I’m not sure I want to go through all that. Can't you just give me something for the shaking? A pill, anything? I just want to be able to eat my lunch without making a mess. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide. I understand your reluctance. While I can't definitively diagnose you without further testing, and prescribing medication without a diagnosis isn't ethical, I can offer a trial of propranolol, a beta-blocker sometimes used for essential tremor, with the understanding that it may not fully resolve the issue and has potential side effects. We would monitor you closely. However, I strongly recommend the neurology referral. They can provide a more accurate diagnosis and tailor a treatment plan to your specific needs. If you're willing to try the propranolol, I'll write you a prescription. But I also want to emphasize the importance of following up with a neurologist. What are your thoughts?
