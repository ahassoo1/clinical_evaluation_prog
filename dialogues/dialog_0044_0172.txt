DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Yes, well, frankly, I don’t have all day. I just moved here, you see, and someone said I needed to… register with a doctor? For my… benefits. Medicare, I believe it’s called. It’s all rather confusing, and I'd simply like to get it over with. I suppose you need to… check me over? Though I can assure you, I’m quite healthy for my age.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Candice. Getting settled in a new place can be a lot, and Medicare paperwork can be… a little daunting. And yes, a quick check-up is standard when establishing care with a new doctor, even if you're feeling well. It just helps me get a baseline understanding of your health. So, let’s start with a little bit of information. You mentioned you just moved here. How long have you been in the area?
PATIENT: Oh, not long at all. A few weeks, perhaps? It all blurs together, you know. It’s a…retirement community. Very bland, if you ask me. Though my husband seems to like it. He’s the practical one. Honestly, I barely remember why we moved. Something about being closer to… a daughter, I think? Or a son? Really, it's all terribly unimportant. Can we just get on with the… checking?
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. We can absolutely get to the check-up. Before we do, though, just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Goodness. That's… a long time ago. I suppose I've had the usual things. A cold now and then. A bit of… indigestion. My husband handles all the records, you see. He's very organized. I really couldn’t tell you about specific ailments or… dates. It's all quite beneath me, frankly. Are you going to listen to my heart, or what? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. Listening to your heart is part of the check-up. Before that, perhaps we could just quickly go through a few basic questions?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please, be quick. I have a bridge game this afternoon. And frankly, these questions feel rather… intrusive. What sort of things are you going to ask? Are they confidential? My husband would be most displeased if I divulged personal information.
DOCTOR: Absolutely confidential, Candice. Everything we discuss is private and stays between us. I understand your concerns. I'm just trying to get a general idea of your health, and these questions will help me do that. Let's start simple. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me think… I don't believe so. Though I once had a rather unpleasant reaction to a shellfish dish. But that was decades ago! And I’m not entirely certain it was the shellfish. It could have been the wine. Or perhaps something I ate earlier that day. Honestly, I can’t recall. Is this really necessary? I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: It's good to rule things out, Candice. We'll move on quickly if you're uncomfortable. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s all my husband's domain. He has a little chart, you see. Lists everything. I simply take what he gives me. A white pill, I think? And a blue one sometimes. Perhaps a yellow one on Tuesdays? Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea. He's very meticulous about it. I suggest you ask him. He’d be thrilled to tell you all about it, I assure you. It’s quite… comprehensive. Are we quite finished with these questions yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, Candice. We'll definitely get that list from your husband. That’s very helpful to know. Now, just a few more general questions. Do you have any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain? Well… a little bit of stiffness in my joints, perhaps? But that’s just old age, you see. And sometimes my back aches after gardening. But nothing… serious. I’ve always been quite resilient. And frankly, I don’t believe in dwelling on aches and pains. It just makes them worse. Are you going to examine me now? I'm beginning to feel rather lightheaded. This chair isn't terribly comfortable, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Candice, we’ll move on to a quick examination now. I just want to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears and throat. Then I'll check your reflexes and feel your abdomen. It won’t take long. First, let's just take a deep breath for me, and I'll listen to your heart. Relax your shoulders.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please, be gentle. I bruise easily, you know. And I dislike being touched unexpectedly. A deep breath… Yes, I can do that. Though I do find doctors rather…clinical. It's all very impersonal. Are you going to use a cold stethoscope? I loathe cold instruments. Honestly, this is all rather… trying. Are we nearing the end of this ordeal?
DOCTOR: I understand, Candice. I'll be as gentle as possible. And yes, I’m warming the stethoscope first. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds… are regular, but a little bit faint. We may want to do an EKG just to get a clearer picture. But nothing to be alarmed about at this point. Now, I’ll listen to your lungs.
PATIENT: An EKG? Goodness. Now you’re talking about… procedures. I don’t like procedures. I'm perfectly healthy, I assure you. My husband says so. And I’ve always had a strong constitution. Really, I think this is all unnecessary. Are you sure there isn't a quicker way to… complete this visit? I have a bridge game this afternoon, you know. And Mildred gets very cross if I’m late. It’s simply dreadful when she gets cross.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Candice. An EKG is a very simple, painless test—just some stickers on your chest. It's a precaution, to get a complete baseline. Your lungs sound clear, though your breathing is a little shallow. We can discuss the EKG further after I’ve completed the exam. Now, let’s just take a look at your ears and throat. Can you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please be quick! I dislike having things stuck in my mouth. It’s simply… vulgar. And don’t poke around too much. I have sensitive gums, you see. Honestly, doctors these days… They seem to have forgotten all about bedside manner. My grandmother’s doctor used to bring her flowers! Flowers, you understand. Now open my mouth, you say? sighs dramatically Very well. But do hurry. I’m beginning to feel quite faint. And I do believe Mildred is going to be furious.
DOCTOR: Just a quick look… Your ears look clear, and your throat… is a little dry. No obvious signs of infection. Okay, Candice. That completes the physical exam. Now, to discuss the next steps. We’ve established you’re generally healthy, but to get a more complete picture, I recommend an EKG and some routine blood work. This will help us identify any potential issues early on. It’s just a precaution. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An EKG and blood work? Heavens to Betsy! That sounds… dreadful. Are you certain it's necessary? I feel perfectly fine. Honestly, I’ve never had so many tests in my life. And the thought of needles… simply appalling. My husband will be most displeased. He doesn’t like me being subjected to unnecessary procedures. He always says, “If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it!” Perhaps I should just stick to my bridge game. It’s far less… invasive. Are you absolutely certain you can’t just… declare me healthy and be done with it? This is all terribly unsettling. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Candice. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests. We're not trying to upset you, but as a new patient, it's important to establish a baseline understanding of your health. The EKG and blood work will give us that. If everything comes back normal, we can simply move forward with routine check-ups. We can discuss any concerns you have with your husband and perhaps schedule the tests at a later date if that would make you more comfortable. We don’t have to do everything today. For now, let's focus on getting you scheduled for a follow-up appointment so we can discuss these options further. Would that be alright?
