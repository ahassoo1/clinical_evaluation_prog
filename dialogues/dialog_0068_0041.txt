DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I’m Dr. Sham. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s…well, it’s getting harder to do things. Just feeling weaker, you know? Not a sudden thing, just…slowly getting more difficult. It’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Slowly getting more difficult…” Can you tell me a little more about what specifically is becoming harder?
PATIENT: Hmm. Walking is…troublesome. Not that I can’t walk, but my legs…they feel heavy. And I drop things more often. Used to be very good with my hands, fixing things, but now…not so much. It makes my wife worry. She does a lot for me, you see.
DOCTOR: Heavy legs…dropping things… Right. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. A few years, I think. Maybe three? It started small, just a little clumsiness. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it's…worse now. Definitely worse this past year. I don't remember the exact month, sorry. Things aren’t as clear as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Three years…gradually worsening. Alright. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think…sometimes my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, just comes and goes. And I get tired easier. Much easier. Used to be able to work all day, now I need a nap in the afternoon. And…oh, sometimes my hands tingle. Like pins and needles. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, fatigue, tingling in your hands… yes, all potentially important. Do the tingling sensations happen in both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: Mostly in my left hand, Doctor. Sometimes it goes up my arm a little. Not always painful, just…uncomfortable. Like when your foot falls asleep, but in my hand. It comes and goes, like most things these days. It's hard to keep track, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Left hand primarily, tingling sensation… I see you've been seen here before, mostly for blood pressure. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure, Doctor. And my knees, getting old knees. Arthritis, the doctor said a few years back. Nothing serious, just a little ache now and then. I take some medicine for it. And, well, my wife keeps me on a good diet, so I try to eat healthy. She's a good woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure, arthritis… and you're on medication for the arthritis. Do you happen to know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a white pill. I take it every morning. Oh, now…my wife handles all the pills, she knows everything. I think it starts with a ‘N’… Naproxen, maybe? Is that right? I’m sorry, I’m not very good with names. My memory…it's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Naproxen, yes. That’s fine, don’t worry about it. Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the Naproxen, Doctor. And a multivitamin, my wife insists on that one too. Said I wasn't getting enough of something. She's probably right. I don’t know what kind…just a regular one, I think. From the store. Nothing special. She takes good care of me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Naproxen and a multivitamin. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat most things, thankfully. My wife likes to cook, so that’s good. I don't go near shellfish, doesn't appeal to me, but that's not an allergy, just a preference.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Okay. Now, just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… my mother, she had some problems with her heart later in life. And my older brother, he had… diabetes, I think. And arthritis, like me. Lots of aches and pains in that family, sadly. Nothing major, as far as I know. We didn't talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Heart problems in your mother, diabetes and arthritis in your brother. Alright. Now, before we move on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be…uncomfortable. I’m getting too old for rough handling.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible, Mr. Astore. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little sluggish, but symmetrical. Strength is slightly reduced in both hands, particularly the left. Coordination is somewhat impaired. Your walk is a little slower and more shuffling than usual, and you don't swing your arms as much. Alright. I'm going to check your hands and feet now. Any pain or tenderness when I touch these areas?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. A little ache in my knees, but I’m used to that. My hands…they tingle sometimes, but not pain. You can touch them. Go ahead. Just be careful, they're old hands.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting some mild decreased sensation in your left hand, which explains the tingling you've been experiencing. The rest feels mostly normal. Okay, Mr. Astore, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, possibly combined with early signs of Parkinson’s disease. The neuropathy could be contributing to the tingling and weakness in your hands, and the slower movements and shuffling gait could be early signs of Parkinson's. Now, this isn't a definitive diagnosis. We'll need to do some further testing to confirm this. I'm going to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and other underlying conditions. I also want to schedule you for an MRI of the brain to rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: MRI? Oh my. That sounds…serious. Parkinson's… I've heard of that. Isn't that what Michael J. Fox has? I don't know… is it bad? I just want to know what's going on, you see. If it's something I need to worry about. Blood tests are fine, of course. But the MRI…is it necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Astore. It is a little unsettling to hear those terms. The MRI will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your brain, and it’s the best way to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. It's not necessarily bad, and many things can cause these symptoms, so we need to investigate. It’s a precaution, really. Parkinson’s is a progressive neurological disorder, but there are treatments available to manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. And it affects everyone differently. We won’t know for sure until we have the results of the tests. For now, I'm going to order the blood tests, and I’ll schedule the MRI for next week. In the meantime, it might be helpful to start some gentle hand exercises to maintain your range of motion. I can give you a referral to a physical therapist. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a physical therapist sounds good. Anything to help. And thank you for explaining it so…clearly. I appreciate that. Blood tests and the MRI… alright. Next week is fine. I just…I don’t want to worry my wife too much. She worries enough as it is. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Besides the hand exercises? Anything to…slow it down?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your wife. We’ll take things one step at a time. In the meantime, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is important. That means eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and getting enough sleep. I also recommend avoiding any activities that might exacerbate your symptoms. Stress can also worsen neurological symptoms, so try to find ways to manage your stress levels. There's some evidence that certain supplements, like Coenzyme Q10, might be helpful for people with Parkinson’s, but more research is needed. I wouldn't recommend taking anything without talking to me first. We'll discuss that further once we have the results of the tests. I'm also going to give you a referral to a neurologist. They're specialists in disorders of the nervous system and can provide more specialized care. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, a neurologist sounds very wise, Doctor. Thank you. So, tests, physical therapist, neurologist… and try not to worry too much. That’s a lot to take in. I will try to keep busy. My wife likes me to help in the garden. Is that alright? Gentle exercise, you said. You think…you think it could be serious? I’m sorry to ask, but I need to know. Even if it’s just a possibility.
DOCTOR: It’s a fair question, Mr. Astore. It’s important to be realistic, but also not to jump to conclusions. Your symptoms could be indicative of a more serious condition, such as early Parkinson’s disease, but they could also be caused by other, less concerning factors. That's why we're doing the tests. Gardening is excellent gentle exercise, as long as you're not overdoing it. Listen to your body and take breaks when you need them. I want to emphasize that even if you are diagnosed with Parkinson’s, it’s a manageable condition. There are treatments available that can help control the symptoms and improve your quality of life. We’ll work together to develop a plan that’s right for you. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and seeing what the results show. I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think…I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you. I’ll schedule the tests and the neurologist appointment. And I'll try not to worry too much. Thank you again, Doctor Sham.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get this sorted out together. Have a good day.
