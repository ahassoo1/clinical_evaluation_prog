DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, doctor. Um… well, it’s… going to the bathroom. It's hard now. Not like before. I have to… push a lot. Does that make sense? I don't remember exactly when it started, just… lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're having difficulty with bowel movements – needing to strain more than usual. And you said this has been happening “lately.” Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Bowel… oh, you mean… poop? Yes, that's it. Poop is hard. Not easy. It’s not every time, but… most times. Lately… hmm. My daughter, Leilani, she helped me get here. She said it’s been a few weeks maybe? I don't keep track of days so good anymore. It just feels… old. Everything feels old.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks. And it's not every time, but most of the time it's difficult. And you describe it as needing to strain. Is it painful when you go, or just… difficult?
PATIENT: Painful… sometimes. Not sharp pain, but… a pressure. Like I need to push really hard. It makes my face red. And then… sometimes not much comes out, even after pushing. It’s… embarrassing to talk about! But Leilani said I should tell you everything. She worries.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be embarrassing, Ms. Stoffregen, but it's important information, and I appreciate you sharing it. So, pressure and straining, sometimes not much comes out, and your face gets red. Have you noticed any blood with your stool, or around your bottom?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear… I don't think so. I haven't… looked so closely, if you know what I mean. Leilani always helps with that part now. I get a little shaky, and it's easier for her. I haven't told her about any blood, though. She'd get very upset. I don’t want to worry her more than she already is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And no blood that you’ve noticed. Has there been any change in the shape of your stool?
PATIENT: Shape? Oh… well, it’s not like it used to be. It used to be… long and smooth, you know? Now it’s… smaller. And sometimes it’s… broken up. Like little pebbles. Is that… bad? I’m sorry, I don’t understand all these questions. It feels like a test!
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a test, Ms. Stoffregen. It's just trying to get a clear picture. Smaller, broken-up stools… okay. Have you been having any abdominal pain—any cramping or discomfort—outside of when you’re trying to have a bowel movement?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not all the time. It’s… a dull ache. Like after a big meal, maybe? Or when I bend over. It's not a bad pain, just… there. I thought it was just my old bones creaking! I get aches everywhere these days. Leilani makes me take those little fish oil pills. She says it helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, not a sharp pain, and it’s related to eating or bending. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. That’s a hard one. I haven’t been on the scale in… a long time. Leilani weighs me when I go to her house, but I don't ask what it is. I used to be a big girl, very strong. Now… I feel a little lighter, maybe. But I don't know if that’s just me getting older. Everything feels… smaller these days. Even my stories!
DOCTOR: Okay, you feel a little lighter, but you aren’t sure if it’s actual weight loss. And you're not actively tracking your weight. Let’s talk about your diet for a moment. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, I try to eat good things. Leilani brings me a lot of soup. Chicken soup is my favorite. And taro. I like taro. I eat a little fish sometimes, but not much. I used to grow my own vegetables, but my garden is too much work now. I drink a lot of water, because Leilani tells me to. And I like a little bit of coconut cream with my taro. It's a little treat. But mostly soup and taro. That sounds boring, doesn’t it? It’s hard to cook for just one person.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly soup and taro, a little fish, and coconut cream. And you're drinking plenty of water, that's good. Now, just one more question before I do a quick examination. Have you been experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or fever?
PATIENT: No, no nausea. And I haven't been sick to my stomach. No vomiting either. And no fever. I haven't felt hot or shaky like when I had the flu a long time ago. Just… tired. Always tired. Is it okay if I sit down now? My legs are starting to feel a little wobbly.
DOCTOR: Of course, please sit down. Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. Let's do a quick exam. I'm going to listen to your stomach with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. It might be a little uncomfortable, but I’ll be gentle. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, doctor. That sounds… okay. Gently now, please. My stomach is a little sensitive. And… is my dress alright? I didn't want to wear anything too fancy. Leilani said it didn't matter. But I like to look nice when I go out.
DOCTOR: Yes, your dress is perfectly fine. Just relax and breathe normally. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. There. Just a little bit. It’s not sharp, but it… feels funny. Like a dull ache, like I told you. Is that bad? You’re pressing right where it hurts the most. Please don't press too hard. It makes me… nervous. It feels like something is… stuck. But I don't know what.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m being gentle now. I noted some tenderness there. Do you feel any fullness or bloating in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Bloated… hmm. Sometimes. After I eat a big bowl of soup, maybe. I feel… puffy. Like a balloon. But it goes away after a while. I thought it was just the soup. Leilani says I should eat smaller portions, but I like my soup! It reminds me of my mother. She made the best soup. Oh dear, I’m rambling again, aren’t I? Sorry, doctor. My mind wanders these days.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Stoffregen, don’t apologize. You’re not rambling. Okay, so fullness and bloating after eating. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing constipation with some possible tenderness in your lower abdomen. It’s important to rule out anything more serious, though. I'd like to order a stool test to check for any signs of infection or bleeding, and a blood test to check your overall health and rule out any anemia. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A stool test… and a blood test? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Will it hurt? And will it take long? I don’t like going to the hospital. Everything feels so… sterile. And I don't want to be poked and prodded. But… if you think it's important, I guess I can do it. Leilani always says I should listen to the doctor. But please, don't take too much blood. I get dizzy easily. And… what if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: The stool test is very simple, Ms. Stoffregen. It just involves collecting a small sample of your stool, and we’ll give you detailed instructions on how to do that at home. It won't hurt at all. The blood test is just a few vials of blood drawn from your arm, and it will only take a few minutes. We'll have you sit or lie down to make sure you don’t feel dizzy. As for what if something is wrong—that’s what the tests are for. It's better to know what's going on so we can take care of it. Most of the time, constipation is easily treatable with diet changes, increased fluid intake, and sometimes a mild laxative. But we want to rule out anything more serious, just to be safe. I’ll write you the orders for the tests now, and the nurse will explain everything in detail. We'll get the results back in a few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A few days… alright. If it will help. And if it won’t hurt too much. And if Leilani is okay with it. She worries so much. I guess… I guess I can do it. Just… please be gentle with me. And don't let them take too much blood. I get scared so easily these days. Thank you, doctor. You’re very kind. Now, is it alright if I sit here for a little bit longer? My legs are still wobbly. And I’m a little tired.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. Please, take all the time you need. I'll have the nurse come in shortly with the test orders and explain everything. She’s very gentle and will answer all your questions. And I’ll make a note to have her check your blood pressure before the blood draw, just to be extra cautious. You've been very brave coming in today, and I appreciate you sharing everything with me. Just relax, and we'll take things one step at a time. Now, is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you. And… tell the nurse I don't like needles. And maybe… a glass of water? My mouth feels a little dry.
