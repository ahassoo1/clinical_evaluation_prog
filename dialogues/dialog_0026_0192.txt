DOCTOR: Good morning, Delron. My name is Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I’m here 'cause… the army. They want me to take a test before they even think about letting me join. Something about making sure I ain’t falling apart before I even start. Seems a bit much, honestly. But, you know, rules.
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-enlistment physical. Yes, quite standard. They are very thorough, as they should be. So, to start, are you experiencing any specific health concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Health concerns? No. Not really. I mean, I get tired, but who doesn’t? I work with machines all day, it’s hard work. And my knees sometimes ache a bit when it’s cold, but that’s just… old age creeping in, I suppose. Nothing a bit of ignoring can’t fix. You know? I'm a strong guy. Always have been.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're generally feeling well. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I'm falling asleep standing up, alright? It's just… by the end of the day, I'm done. Completely wiped. I sit down and I stay down. Used to be able to go straight from work to… well, to doing things. Now? Nah. I need a good few hours on the couch. And my wife makes me drink some herbal tea. Weak stuff, if you ask me. But she worries.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. It sounds like it's impacting your energy levels somewhat. And you mentioned your knees ache when it’s cold. Is that a recent development, or has that been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, the knees. That's been… a while now. Years, probably. Not that I ever bothered with a doctor about it. Just… part of getting older, you know? I used to play football back in the day. Took a few knocks. Nothing serious, mind you. Just… the usual bumps and bruises. It flares up in the winter, definitely. Makes getting out of bed a bit… unpleasant. But I manage. I always do.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And just to get a complete picture, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ like that. Never been sick much, honestly. A cold here and there, the flu maybe once or twice. But nothing a good lie-down and a strong cup of coffee couldn’t sort out. My wife keeps telling me I should get a check-up, but I just… don’t see the point. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, right? Besides, doctors just tell you to stop doing things you enjoy. And I'm not about that.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance. Sometimes a check-up is just preventative, though, to make sure everything is functioning as it should. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… vitamins, sometimes. My wife buys 'em. Some kind of multi-vitamin thing. Says I need 'em. Honestly, I forget to take 'em half the time. And… sometimes I take a couple of paracetamol if my knees are really bad. But that’s it. Nothing regular. I don't like being pumped full of pills, if I can avoid it. Weakens you up, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with anything. Bees stung me once when I was a kid, but that just hurt. Didn't swell up or anything. My wife asked me that last time we went to the dentist, and I told her the same thing. I'm pretty tough, you see. Don’t react to much.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... My father, he had a bad heart. Kept coughing all the time, ended up needing… well, a fix, you know? A proper fix. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her stomach. Cancer, I think. But that was a long time ago. Everyone dies of something, doesn’t it? Don’t see the point in worrying about it. It'll happen when it happens. My wife's always going on about genetics and all that, but I just tune her out. Makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to be aware of those things, though. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, eh? Well, I work. A lot. Engines and all sorts. It's physical work. I used to go fishing a lot, but haven’t had time lately. My wife likes gardening, so I sometimes help her out with that. And I like a beer or two with my mates on a Friday night. Nothing crazy. Just… relaxing. Used to smoke, but quit about ten years ago. My wife said it was killing me. She's probably right. It’s hard to explain a lifestyle, really. It's just… life, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That’s a good way to put it. Now, to get a better understanding of your current state, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Ugh. Alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. I’ve got things to do, you know? And I hate being poked and prodded. Just get it over with, alright? I’m a busy man. But no funny business, yeah? I don’t like doctors much, if I haven’t made that clear.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No funny business, I promise. It’s just a routine check-up. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a look at your knees. It shouldn’t take too long. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. If you could just sit up on the table for me, that would be great.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here we go. Get it over with, then. But be gentle, yeah? These old bones ain’t what they used to be. And don't go poking around too much. Honestly, I don't see the point of all this, but... well, the army wants it, I suppose. Just hurry up, alright? I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon here.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relaxing. Deep breath in… and out. Good. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Nothing too concerning at this point, but we’ll make a note of it. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Okay, and your knees… there’s some tenderness on both sides, especially with flexion. Some crepitus as well. Do you experience any swelling?
PATIENT: Swelling? Not usually. Sometimes, after a really cold day, they feel a bit puffy, but nothing like… balloons, you know? Just… thicker. And stiff. Horribly stiff. Makes getting out of bed a proper struggle. And that crepitus… that’s just the sound of old age, isn’t it? Bones rubbing together. My wife says I should get an X-ray, but I told her no. Waste of time and money. I can manage. I always have. But… it does ache sometimes. Especially when it rains. The weather affects ‘em, you know? Don't ask me how, but it does. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. It's just making me think about all the things that are falling apart.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s good you’ve been managing, and we’ll keep that in mind. Now, just to complete the exam, could you stand up for me and let me check your reflexes and range of motion?
PATIENT: Ugh, alright. Here we go again. Be gentle, yeah? I’m not a spring chicken anymore. And don’t go expecting me to do any gymnastics. I’m an engine assembler, not an acrobat. Just… get it over with. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I feel like a broken machine being inspected.
DOCTOR: Alright, reflexes are a little diminished, but within the normal range for your age. And your range of motion is slightly limited in both knees, especially with flexion. There’s some discomfort with movement. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems fairly consistent with someone who's had some wear and tear over the years. It’s nothing drastically alarming, but we'll want to investigate a little further, given the elevated blood pressure and the murmur I detected. Would you be open to a few simple blood tests and an EKG?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an EKG? Ugh. Seriously? Is this really necessary? I just want them to tell me I'm fit enough to join the army, not turn me into a science experiment. And what are you going to do with all my blood, anyway? I don't trust doctors with my blood. It's… private. Look, can't you just… write something down and say I'm okay? I've got things to do, you know? I’m a busy man. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Is this what I have to look forward to in the army? Endless poking and prodding? I’m starting to have second thoughts about all of this. Really.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Delron. It’s not about turning you into a science experiment, I assure you. The blood tests will simply give us a baseline of your overall health – things like cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. The EKG is a quick, painless test to check your heart’s electrical activity. It will help us understand that murmur I detected and make sure everything is functioning properly. It’s standard procedure for anyone considering joining the military, and it’s just to make sure we’re not missing anything. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially given your family history and the elevated blood pressure. It will give you peace of mind, and it will give the army peace of mind as well. It's a relatively quick process, and we can discuss the results together. If everything comes back normal, we can simply write a note saying you’re fit to join. But if we do detect anything, it’s better to address it now, before you begin training. It's about ensuring your long-term health and safety. Would you be willing to consider it?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But you have to promise me you'll explain everything. No medical jargon, alright? Just… plain English. And no needles bigger than my thumb. And you have to hurry up. I haven’t got all day. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time. But… alright. Do what you have to do. But I'm not happy about it. And if I faint, I’m blaming you. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, you won't faint, I promise. And I'll explain everything in plain English, no medical jargon. And the needle is definitely smaller than your thumb. First, we’ll just need to draw a small sample of blood. I'll start with your arm. Then we'll put some stickers on your chest and use a machine to record your heart’s electrical activity. It's completely painless, I assure you. If you could just sit here, and I’ll explain each step as we go. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… don’t poke me too hard, alright? And if I start to feel dizzy, you have to tell me. I don't want to end up face down on the floor. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m a grown man, not a fragile flower. But… alright. Let’s get it over with. But I’m watching you.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a little pinch. You might feel a slight sting. I’ll be quick. And you're perfectly right to watch me. It’s always good to be informed. There you go. Just relaxing. This will only take a moment. Alright, all done. See?
PATIENT: Ugh. That wasn't so bad, I suppose. Just… a bit uncomfortable. It feels cold, though. And I think I'm starting to feel a bit… lightheaded. Is that normal? My wife always tells me I don't handle needles well. She's probably right. Honestly, I’m starting to regret this whole thing. What if I have some horrible disease? What if I'm not fit enough to join the army? What if… Ugh. I think I need to lie down.
DOCTOR: Delron, you're feeling lightheaded?
PATIENT: Yeah. Real lightheaded. And kinda… sweaty. My vision’s getting blurry. Ugh. This isn’t good. I don’t like this. I don't like this at all. My wife always told me I shouldn't go to doctors. She's probably right. What's happening? Am I going to faint? Ugh… I think I'm gonna…
DOCTOR: Nurse, we have a patient experiencing a vasovagal reaction, possibly pre-syncope. Blood pressure and pulse are dropping. Get him lying down immediately, and prepare to monitor his vital signs. Check his blood sugar, stat. Delron, try to stay calm. Just breathe deeply. You’re going to be alright. We're going to get you lying down, and then we'll check everything out. You're safe here. Check for any underlying conditions, especially cardiac history. And get an IV line started, just in case. .
PATIENT: .
