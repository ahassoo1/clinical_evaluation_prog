DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… fine to meet you, I suppose. It’s this bruising. I've been on this blood thinner for… well, a while now, since my wife passed, and I’ve just noticed more of it lately. Seems to come out of nowhere. I keep knocking into things, apparently. Though I hardly ever do. It’s a little embarrassing, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. It can certainly be concerning to notice increased bruising, especially while on a blood thinner. And it's perfectly reasonable to be a little embarrassed – it’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. Just to clarify, when you say “lately,” about how long have you been noticing more frequent or easier bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It's probably been… a month, maybe a bit longer? It’s hard to say exactly, I don’t keep a calendar of my bruises, Doctor. It’s just… more noticeable now than it used to be. And bigger, I think. Though that could be my imagination. I’m a pathologist, not a hematologist, you know. I see the blood, I don’t necessarily study it when it’s happening to me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Farson. It’s a different perspective when you're the patient! A month or so is helpful. And no need to apologize – I appreciate your honesty. Now, aside from the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Well… I’ve been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. But honestly, Doctor, at my age, aren’t we always a bit tired? It could be anything. The heat, for one thing. This weather is dreadful. And I haven't been sleeping as well. Though, that's probably just worrying about… things. It’s hard to say what’s connected to what. I don’t go around cataloging my aches and pains, you know. I’m a man who gets on with things.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Farson. It's good to get a full picture. Fatigue can certainly be a symptom of several things, and it’s helpful to know you’ve been experiencing that alongside the bruising. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any bleeding from anywhere else – gums when you brush your teeth, nosebleeds, blood in your stool or urine, or any unusual heavy bleeding from cuts that take a long time to stop?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing like that. My gums are fine. I brush diligently, you know. Always have. And no nosebleeds. Definitely no blood in… well, you know. I would notice that, Doctor. I'm not completely oblivious. Cuts stop… reasonably quickly, I suppose. A little longer than they used to, maybe. But nothing alarming. Really, it’s just this bruising. It's… unsightly, to be frank. And my daughter keeps looking at me with concern. She worries too much, that girl. But still... it's something.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. It sounds like the bruising is the most significant change you've noticed. And it’s good you’re aware of your body and what's normal for you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, as I said, I've been on this blood thinner… Warfarin, I think it is… since my wife, bless her, passed away about two years ago. She had a blood clot, you see. Horrible thing. The doctor put me on it to prevent one for myself. I've had the usual… high blood pressure, a little arthritis, nothing major. I try to stay active, walk every day. I was a perfectly healthy man before all this… well, you know. I had a routine check-up last year, everything was fine then. The doctor said my levels were good. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t see what the fuss is about. It's probably just a phase. I'm 58, things change.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Farson, and it’s good you've been diligent about taking your Warfarin and staying active. It’s also good to hear you had a routine check-up last year. It’s helpful to have that baseline information. To clarify, do you know what your blood pressure readings typically are?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I leave all that to the doctor, you know? I don’t go around taking my blood pressure. I go to the doctor, they take it. I’m a pathologist, not a… a medical instrument! I have people for these things. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know why I’m bruising. Is it something serious? Is it the Warfarin? Is it going to stop? That’s all I want to know. I’m a practical man. I don’t need a long explanation about systolic and diastolic… whatever. Just tell me what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. You’re right to want clear answers, and I apologize if I was getting too technical. We will get to the bottom of this. Let's talk about your family history, if you don’t mind. Have there been any bleeding disorders or unusual bruising in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… well, my mother had a bit of a tendency to bruise easily, I suppose. She was a delicate woman, always bumping into things. But she just dismissed it as being clumsy. And my grandfather… he died young, from something entirely different, I believe. A heart attack. No bleeding problems that I ever knew of. Honestly, Doctor, we weren’t a family that talked much about illnesses. It was just… not done. We were practical people. And it's all a bit… hazy, to be frank. It's been a long time. I’m not a genealogist, you know. I look at cells under a microscope, not family trees.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Farson. Knowing about your mother’s tendency to bruise is helpful. And it’s completely understandable that you don't have a detailed family medical history. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking besides the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Just the Warfarin, Doctor. And a little something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. Losartan, I think it's called. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. But that's only as needed, maybe once or twice a month. And… oh, a multivitamin. But that's it. Really, I try to avoid taking too many pills. I’m a firm believer in natural remedies, you know. A good walk, a healthy diet… that’s what keeps a man going. Not a cupboard full of pharmaceuticals.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Warfarin, Losartan, and occasional Ibuprofen and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not to anything, thankfully. I've been quite lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, take anything, with no ill effects. I've never had a reaction to anything in my life, as far as I know. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a remarkably robust specimen, considering my age. Though this bruising is a bit concerning, I must admit. Perhaps it’s a sign I should slow down? Though I doubt that's the answer. A man needs to keep busy, you know.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Mr. Farson. No known allergies is certainly good news. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your general health and take a closer look at the bruising. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well, alright, Doctor. If you think it's necessary. I suppose it can't hurt. Though I assure you, I feel perfectly fine. It’s just this… discoloration. I’m a bit squeamish, to be honest. All this medical poking and prodding… it’s not my favorite thing. But go ahead. Get it over with. And please, be gentle. I’m a pathologist, not a test subject.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then I'll just take a look at the bruising, feel your abdomen, and check your joints. It shouldn’t take long. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, if you could just lie back for me… I’ll take a look at the bruising on your arms and legs. Alright, Mr. Farson. The bruising does seem more prominent than you’d expect, and it’s distributed on both arms and legs. Your abdomen is soft, and your joints don't appear particularly inflamed. I do notice some tenderness in your left wrist when I press here... does that bother you?
PATIENT: Well, that wrist… now that you mention it, it has been a bit achy lately. Not terribly painful, just… a dull ache. I thought it was just arthritis, you know. I do a lot of work with my hands, looking at these microscopic slides. It’s probably just strain. Though I haven't done anything to injure it, as far as I know. It just… bothers me sometimes. Mostly when it's cold. Honestly, Doctor, I hardly pay attention to these little aches and pains. I’m an older man, you know. Things are bound to creak and groan a bit. Is it something serious? Is it connected to the bruising? That’s what I want to know. I don’t need a lecture about tendons and ligaments. Just tell me what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Farson. The tenderness in your wrist is something we'll need to investigate further. It could be related to the bruising, or it could be a separate issue. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, your coagulation studies – that’s to assess how well your blood is clotting – and a basic metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, eh? Well, alright. I suppose it's unavoidable. Though I do detest needles. And I always get lightheaded when they take blood. It's a terrible weakness, I know. But yes, go ahead. Order your tests. Get it over with. Just tell me when and where I can have them done. And please, remind them to be gentle. I don't want to faint in there. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a pathologist, not a pincushion.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I’ll write the orders now. You can have the blood drawn at the lab just down the hall, and I'll make a note for the phlebotomist to be extra gentle. They are very experienced, and we can have you lie down if you're feeling lightheaded. Here's the lab request form. They’ll need this, and your insurance card if you have it with you. The results should be back within a couple of days. Once I have those, we can discuss them and figure out the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and being careful to avoid any injuries. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, Doctor. Just the blood tests. And please, if you could just call me if the results are particularly alarming. I don't want to spend the next two days worrying unnecessarily. I'm a practical man, you know. I prefer to face things head-on. And honestly, this whole thing is a bit unsettling. I’ve never had a problem like this before. Just keep me informed. And thank you… I suppose. I still don't see what all the fuss is about, but I appreciate your attention.
