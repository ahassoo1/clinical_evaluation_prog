DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Doyle Pitmon, I'm your doctor today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Pitmon. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why I'm here. My wife insisted. Something about my… complexion? I feel perfectly well, aside from being a bit tired, naturally. At my age, one is tired. Let’s get this over with, shall we? I have a rather pressing matter to attend to.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, your wife clearly has some concern, and it’s always best to address those. “A bit tired,” you say. Is this a new development, or has this been ongoing?
PATIENT: Ongoing, I suppose. Though, defining “new” is difficult these days, isn’t it? My memory… isn't what it once was. It's just… a general lack of energy. Nothing debilitating. I still manage my work, though it takes a bit longer. Rebar doesn't lay itself, you know. And truthfully, I don’t recall ever feeling particularly robust. Is this going to be a lengthy inquiry?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to have a timeline, even if it's approximate. So, this fatigue has been present for… how long would you say?
PATIENT: Goodness. Months, certainly. Perhaps a year? It’s all a blur, frankly. Look, Doctor, I'm a practical man. I build things. I don't spend time dwelling on… feelings. I suspect it's simply the natural progression of things. Old age. Not much one can do about that, is there? Perhaps a strong tea? Though I doubt that’s within your purview.
DOCTOR: Well, “natural progression” can still have underlying causes we should rule out. And a simple blood test can tell us quite a bit. It's standard procedure, Mr. Drahota. Now, aside from the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Goodness. What sort of changes? My wife complains about my hearing, but that's hardly new. And I’m… perhaps a bit slower on my feet. But that’s to be expected, isn't it? I haven’t been ill, if that’s what you’re asking. No aches, no pains, no… whatever else one gets at my age. Honestly, Doctor, I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon here. Is this test absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary to get a baseline, Mr. Drahota. We need to see what's going on internally, even if you feel "perfectly well." It's about being thorough. Now, let’s go through a quick review of systems, just to be certain. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? No, not really. I eat. My wife makes… adequate meals. Sometimes a bit bland for my liking, but one doesn’t argue with one’s wife, does one? It's not like I've lost my taste entirely. I still enjoy a good roast pork, when she makes it. This feels rather… intrusive, Doctor. Are you quite sure this is standard? I’ve never had so many questions before.
DOCTOR: It's standard when a patient presents with fatigue, Mr. Drahota. We need to rule out common causes. Now, what about your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Good heavens. Are you quite serious? Doctor, I assure you, I’m not here to discuss… that. I find this line of questioning exceedingly… uncouth. And frankly, irrelevant. I’m tired, not… ailing. If you must know, they are perfectly regular, thank you very much. Now, if you’ll excuse me… is there a quicker way to conclude this examination? Perhaps a simple pronouncement of “old age” and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your… discomfort, but this is important. Ignoring potential issues won’t make them disappear. We need to assess your overall health. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? I doubt it. My wife insists I’m eating too much, if anything. She’s constantly fretting over my portions. Though, truthfully, I haven’t been on the scales lately. Not that I recall. Look, Doctor, I build things. Solid, enduring structures. I’m a practical man, not a hypochondriac. This feels like a waste of both our times. Perhaps you have other patients who require your attention more urgently? I'm quite sure my… 'fatigue' isn't a medical emergency. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. I've documented your refusal to cooperate with a basic medical evaluation. I strongly advise you reconsider, but I won’t force you. However, should your condition worsen, or your wife remain concerned, please return. We will not provide any further assistance without a proper assessment.
