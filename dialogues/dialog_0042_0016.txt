DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… Farson, actually. Nicky Farson. And frankly, it’s about this… this ridiculous bruising. It’s getting out of hand. I’m on that blood thinner, you see, and I bump myself normally, like anyone else, but this is… excessive. It's not dignified.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Farson, I see that you are on a blood thinner – warfarin, according to your medication list. And you’re concerned about easy bruising. It is good you're bringing this to my attention, especially with being on warfarin. "Not dignified" is a very fair way to put it, and we want to get this sorted out. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the bruising becoming more of a problem?
PATIENT: Well, it didn't used to be like this. I've been on the stuff – what did you say, warfarin? – for… oh, must be five years now, since the… well, never mind that. Anyway, for years it was manageable. A little bump, a little color, gone in a week. But the last… few months, it’s different. I'll barely touch something and boom, a bruise the size of my hand. And they don’t go away quickly, you know? They linger. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. A noticeable change like that is unsettling, and it's good you're paying attention to it. Five years on warfarin and then a recent change… that definitely warrants investigation. When you say “barely touch something,” can you give me an example of a recent bump that caused a significant bruise?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, it’s embarrassing. Yesterday, I was reaching for a can of peaches in the pantry—just a normal reach—and I grazed the corner of the doorframe. Grazed it. Not even a proper hit. And this morning? Purple. A proper bruise, right on my forearm. It's ridiculous. My wife... well, she would have said something. She always did notice these things.
DOCTOR: A graze causing a significant bruise… alright. And I understand your wife would notice. It's good you have someone who pays attention. It’s important to have that support. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… Let me think. No… no, not really. I mean, I get tired easily, but that's just… old age, I suppose. And my appetite hasn't been fantastic lately, but again, who needs a big appetite? I'm not exactly running marathons. No nosebleeds, no bleeding gums… no anything dramatic, if that's what you mean. Just the bruises. And frankly, they’re enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other dramatic symptoms – that’s good to know. Tiredness and a decreased appetite can be common, but it's helpful to rule things out. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any blood in your stool or urine?
PATIENT: Now that's a personal question, Doctor. Really. I mean, do you have to ask? Look, I’m a reasonable man, but… No. Absolutely not. No blood anywhere. I assure you. It’s just the bruising. Honestly, it feels like you’re fishing for something terrible.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Farson. I assure you, I'm not "fishing" for anything terrible. I need to ask these questions to get a complete picture of your health and rule out any serious causes for the bruising. It’s standard procedure, and completely necessary. It’s my job to be thorough. Alright, let's move on. Are you experiencing any pain or swelling in your joints?
PATIENT: Joint pain? No. Not particularly. My knees ache a bit in the cold, but that's just the weather. Happens every winter. I’m not a young man, Doctor. A few aches and pains are to be expected. Honestly, I feel like I’m being interrogated here. Is this bruising really that unusual?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. You're right, some aches and pains are to be expected. I'm simply trying to gather all the information I need. And yes, it's good you brought this to my attention, as a change in bruising, especially with being on warfarin, warrants a thorough look. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, even a mild one?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. I had a little sniffle about a month ago, maybe. Nothing serious. Just a tickle in my throat. I didn't even bother going to the doctor. It went away on its own. Look, I’m a retired pathologist. I know a cold when I have one. I don't need a medical degree to tell me I had a slight head cold. Is this getting us anywhere, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Farson, this is getting us somewhere. And knowing you're a retired pathologist is actually very helpful – it means you have a good understanding of medical things, and I appreciate that. It makes our conversation much easier. A recent sniffle… alright. Now, let’s talk about your medications. Besides the warfarin, are you taking any other prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. I take a little Vitamin D in the winter, the doctor told me to. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take some ibuprofen. Just the occasional one, mind you. Nothing regular. And… that’s it, I think. Nothing else. Really. I try to keep things simple. I’m not one for filling my body with unnecessary pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, Vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at the bruising to get a better sense of what's going on. It’s fairly routine, and won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. Whatever you have to do, Doctor. I suppose. Just get on with it. But don't expect any miracles. I'm a tough old bird. And be gentle with my arm, if you don't mind. That bruise is quite tender.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I will be very gentle. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 130 over 80. That’s within a normal range. Now, if you’ll just take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, may I take a look at the bruising on your arm?
PATIENT: There. Be careful now. It's quite discolored, isn’t it? My wife would have a fit if she saw it like this. She always said I bruise like a peach. It's… well, it's not a pretty sight. Honestly, Doctor, it’s almost… black.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Farson, it is quite extensive and the discoloration is significant. It does appear tender to the touch, as you mentioned. And it's raised slightly… I'm noting the size, location, and characteristics of the bruising. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, we need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I want to check your INR – that’s the test to see how well the warfarin is working – as well as a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. These tests will help us rule out any underlying causes for the bruising. Do you have any allergies to blood draws or latex?
PATIENT: More tests? Honestly, Doctor, you’re not going to get away with just poking me and drawing blood, are you? I knew it. This is what they always do. Look, I’m not allergic to anything. Never have been. Just get it over with, quickly, please. And try not to stick me more than once. I have a low tolerance for needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. I assure you, the blood tests are necessary to get to the bottom of this. And I will do my best to make it as quick and painless as possible. I’ll let the phlebotomist know you have a low tolerance for needles, and she's very skilled. The tests I’m ordering are a complete blood count to look at your red and white blood cells, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and an INR to see how well your warfarin is working. The lab should be able to get the results back to us within 24 to 48 hours. We can discuss them then and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I’d like you to avoid any activities that could cause further injury. And if you notice any new bruising or bleeding, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Avoid injury? What does that even mean? I'm an old man, Doctor. I trip over things. It's what I do. And bleeding... well, I suppose I'll try to avoid getting stabbed. Honestly, this is all a bit much. Look, I don't have any questions. Just… hurry up with the tests. And tell me, straight, what are you looking for? Don’t give me medical jargon. Are you thinking it's something serious?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Mr. Farson. I’m looking for a few things. The complete blood count will help rule out any underlying blood disorders, such as leukemia or thrombocytopenia – that’s a low platelet count, which can cause excessive bleeding and bruising. The basic metabolic panel will help assess your kidney and liver function, as problems with those organs can also affect your blood clotting. And the INR will tell me if your warfarin dose is appropriate. I’m not assuming it’s something serious, but it’s important to rule out any potential causes for the change in your bruising. A change like this warrants investigation. While it could be something as simple as a slight adjustment needed to your warfarin dose, we need to be thorough. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible, and I’ll contact you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, please try to be careful, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. I suppose not. Just… get it over with. Honestly, this whole thing is… unsettling. My wife always said I worry too much. She would have known what to do. Alright, Doctor. Let's get these tests done. And please, try not to stick me more than once. I really hate needles.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. I'll do my best. I'll let the phlebotomist know you dislike needles, and she's very skilled. I'll also be right here if you need anything during the draw. Let's go ahead and get you to the lab. They're ready for you. And remember, if you experience any sudden or heavy bleeding, or feel weak or dizzy, please contact us immediately. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results, Mr. Farson. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. .
