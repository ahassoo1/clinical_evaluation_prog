DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. I see here you’re 44 years of age. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. My throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a bit. Not a good hurt, you understand. Just… bothersome. I need to get this over with quickly, if you don’t mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: A bothersome throat, you say. I understand you’d like to be quick, Ms. Ottaviani, and I will do my best to be efficient. Could you elaborate on the nature of this “hurt”?
PATIENT: It’s… scratchy. And… swollen, maybe? It feels big. Like something is stuck. Honestly, I don't know what kind of hurt it is. I just know it's unpleasant. It’s not like a cold, though. I never get colds.
DOCTOR: Scratchy and a sensation of swelling, no associated cold symptoms. And you generally do not experience common colds, is that correct?
PATIENT: That is correct. I am a very… robust woman. Never been sick much. It’s probably just… something. I don’t need a lot of fuss. Is there something you can give me to make it stop? Quickly?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your… robustness, Ms. Ottaviani. However, we must ascertain the cause of the discomfort before determining a course of action. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty…? Well, yes, a little. Food… goes down slower. It doesn’t hurt to swallow, exactly. It just… takes more effort. I hadn’t really thought about it. It’s not important. Can we just skip to the medicine part?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I understand your desire for a quick resolution, but delaying a proper assessment could be… unwise. I need to perform a brief examination of your throat. It's a standard procedure. After that, we can discuss potential remedies. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An examination? Honestly. Well… I suppose so. But make it quick. I have important things to do, you understand. And don’t touch me roughly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Ottaviani. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. Please open your mouth and say “Ah.” Say “Ah” again, please. Now, can you tell me if you've experienced any fever, chills, or body aches alongside this sore throat?
PATIENT: Ah. There. Done. And no, I have not had a fever, chills, or… body aches. Honestly, I told you, it’s just a bothersome throat. Are you quite finished? This is very… inconvenient. I don’t understand why you need to ask so many questions.
DOCTOR: I observe some redness and mild swelling of your tonsils, Ms. Ottaviani. While it may seem “just a bothersome throat” to you, it’s important to rule out anything more serious. Have you noticed any white spots or pus on your tonsils?
PATIENT: White spots? Pus? I have no idea. I don’t… inspect my throat, Doctor. Honestly, that’s a rather rude question. I expect you to just know what’s wrong, that’s what I pay you for. Now, are you going to give me something or not? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I assure you I am doing my best to provide you with appropriate care. However, I cannot simply prescribe medication without a proper assessment. Have you recently been exposed to anyone with a similar illness?
PATIENT: Exposed? No. I keep to myself. I don’t… mingle. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m a very clean woman. I don’t get sick from other people. Is there anything at all you can give me? A spray, a lozenge… anything to make this stop? I really must be going. This is wasting my time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Ottaviani. Given your insistence, and the absence of any high-risk symptoms, I will recommend a symptomatic treatment. However, if your symptoms worsen—specifically, difficulty breathing, high fever, or significant difficulty swallowing—you must seek immediate medical attention. I am prescribing a throat lozenge with a mild anesthetic and antiseptic. It should provide some temporary relief. Use as directed.
