DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Oh, goodness... the hiccups. That’s what brings me in. They just won’t stop. Been going on for… well, I’d say close to a day now, maybe a little longer. It’s quite bothersome, actually.
DOCTOR: Right, hiccups that have been persistent for close to a day… that is bothersome. Okay. And can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. They come and go, you know? Not a regular rhythm or anything. Sometimes just a few, then nothing for a bit, then a whole bunch again. They aren't painful, exactly… just startling, and a bit tiring, honestly. I keep trying to hold my breath, like my mother always did, but that doesn’t seem to be working this time. Do you need to know what I was doing when they started? I can’t quite recall exactly, but I was probably in the garden, weeding. I do a lot of weeding.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they're irregular, not painful, just startling and tiring, and holding your breath isn't helping. And they seemed to start while you were gardening… that's helpful. Were you doing anything unusual in the garden?
PATIENT: Unusual… hmm. Not that I recall. Just the usual weeding, you know? I was pulling out some of those bindweed things – they’re terrible, those things, they just wrap themselves around everything. And I was bending over a lot, of course. It was quite hot that day, too. I had a sun hat on, but still… warm. I did have a glass of lemonade while I was working, but I drink that most days when it's warm. Oh! And I might have been talking to the tomatoes. I do like to encourage them.
DOCTOR: Talking to the tomatoes, that’s lovely! Okay, so bending, heat, lemonade, and a bit of chat with the garden… all good things to know. Now, Mirriam, have you had hiccups this persistent before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I get the occasional hiccup, like anyone, you know? After a big meal, or if I laugh too hard. But nothing like this. Usually, they go away on their own after a few minutes. This has been going on since yesterday afternoon, I think… maybe even a little before that. It’s just… unusual. It’s starting to worry me a little, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and persistent hiccups are worth looking into, especially when they're lasting this long. Now, let’s go through a quick review of your health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be thirty years now. And my knees aren’t what they used to be, that’s why I sometimes need a little help getting up. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I used to be a psychiatric aide, you know, so I have to be fairly robust. I don’t take any regular medications, just a little something for the knees sometimes if they’re really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, some knee trouble, and no regular medications. And you were a psychiatric aide – that does require robustness! Just to clarify, what do you take for your knees when they bother you?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just over-the-counter stuff, really. Paracetamol mostly, and sometimes a little bit of ibuprofen if they’re particularly sore. Nothing prescribed, you know? Just something to take the edge off. I don’t take it very often, thankfully. Mostly when it’s been a particularly damp day, or I’ve been doing a lot of gardening.
DOCTOR: Okay, paracetamol and ibuprofen occasionally for your knees. And no allergies to either of those, correct?
PATIENT: Oh, no, goodness, no allergies. I’ve been taking those for years, as I said, and never had any trouble with them. I’m usually pretty good, you know? No food allergies, no reactions to anything I’m aware of. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Unless you count dust, but who doesn’t react to dust a little bit?
DOCTOR: Fair enough - most of us do! Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that's a tricky one. My mother lived to be 92, very sprightly woman she was. Her father had… I think it was high blood pressure. And my brother, he had some trouble with his heart a few years back, but he smoked for years, you know? So it’s hard to say what’s inherited and what’s… lifestyle. My father’s side, I don’t really know much about. He passed away when I was young. There wasn’t much talk of family medical history back then, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure and some heart trouble in your brother, but not much detail beyond that. That’s perfectly alright – it’s common for those details to be scarce. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle… do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. A little bit. I enjoy a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes, nothing too much. Usually just a small glass, maybe two if it’s a special occasion. And I certainly don’t drink every day. Perhaps three or four times a week, you know? Just a little something to relax with. Not a heavy drinker, never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine three or four times a week. And do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never have, never will. My mother always said it was a dreadful habit. And I’ve seen enough of it in my line of work, you know? Terrible for your health. I’ve always been very careful about my health, even when I was young.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No smoking. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, I just want to quickly check your height and weight if that’s alright. I see in the system you are 179cm and 99kg, is this still accurate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, that sounds about right. I haven’t weighed myself recently, but that height is definitely me. I used to be a bit taller, I think, but you shrink a bit as you get older, don't you? And the weight… well, I do enjoy my food. It’s probably fairly accurate.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And just so I have a complete picture, can you tell me what your typical diet is like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, it’s probably not as healthy as it should be, to be honest. I cook most of my meals myself. I eat a lot of vegetables, from the garden of course, that's the best part. But I do enjoy my comfort food too, you know? Things like roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and a good pudding. I have a sweet tooth, I'm afraid. And I have to admit, I do enjoy a biscuit or two with my tea. I try to balance it out with the vegetables, but I’m not one for strict diets.
DOCTOR: Okay, a balanced diet with lots of vegetables from the garden, but with some comfort foods and a sweet tooth. That sounds very reasonable! Alright, Mirriam, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then just quickly examine your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m happy to help in any way I can. I used to do a lot of observations myself, you know, so I understand. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, breathing sounds are normal. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness on palpation. I'm not detecting any masses or abnormalities. Blood pressure is 140/90, and pulse is 80. Now, this is slightly elevated blood pressure, but it could be due to being a bit anxious about the hiccups. Overall, everything seems normal physically.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s reassuring to hear. Slightly elevated blood pressure… well, I do get a bit flustered easily. I’m glad you didn’t find anything worrying. So, what do you think it is, Doctor? These hiccups are just… so persistent. Do you think it’s something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good that the physical exam didn’t reveal anything concerning. Persistent hiccups can be caused by a lot of things, Mirriam. Most of the time, they’re benign and resolve on their own. However, given that they’ve been going on for almost a day, it's worth investigating a little further to rule out any underlying causes. Sometimes they can be triggered by things like irritation to the diaphragm, maybe from a large meal, carbonated drinks, or even stress. But, because of your age, and the length of time they’ve persisted, I’d like to order a blood test to check your electrolyte levels and rule out any other potential issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement completely. A blood test… that sounds sensible. I haven’t had one in ages, I don’t think. Will it be a lot of blood? I’m not a fan of needles, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: No, it won't be a lot at all, Mirriam. Just a standard vial or two, nothing major. And the phlebotomist is very good, very gentle. We'll take it slow and steady. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d also like you to try a few things at home. Try sipping on some water slowly. And when you feel a hiccup coming on, try holding your breath for as long as comfortable, then exhale slowly. Sometimes, a teaspoon of sugar can help too – though I don't want to encourage too much sugar intake! If the hiccups continue for more than 24 hours after the blood test, or if you develop any other symptoms, like shortness of breath or chest pain, please call the clinic immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, that all sounds very sensible. Water, holding my breath, a little bit of sugar… I can certainly try those things. I'll try anything, to be honest, to get rid of these pesky hiccups! And I will definitely call if anything changes, or if I start to feel unwell. Shortness of breath, chest pain… yes, I understand perfectly. Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a little bit. So, what happens now with the blood test? Do I need to go somewhere else?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. I'm glad I could reassure you. We have a phlebotomy room just down the hall. The nurse will take a small sample of your blood. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes. Once the results are back - usually within a couple of days - we'll give you a call to discuss them, and decide on the next steps. Here's the form for the lab. If you feel up to it, you can go down there now. Otherwise, feel free to take your time. And don’t hesitate to ask the nurse if you have any questions. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, this is very helpful. Thank you so much, Doctor. No, I think that’s everything for now. I’ll just go and get the blood test done. Hopefully, that will give us some answers. You’ve been very kind, Doctor Auelua. I appreciate your patience. I do hope these hiccups don't last too long, though!
DOCTOR: I certainly hope not either, Mirriam. Please do let us know how you get on. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, I will, Doctor. Thank you again.
