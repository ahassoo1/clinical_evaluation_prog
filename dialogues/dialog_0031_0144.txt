DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. RAKOSKY, is it? Yes, well, honestly, I'm not entirely sure. My daughter, bless her heart, she just thought I should…get checked out. Said I haven't been to a doctor in ages. I feel fine, mostly. Just…old, I suppose. It’s not like anything’s wrong, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Calvery. It’s very wise of your daughter to encourage a check-up, even if you’re feeling generally well. Preventative care is very important. And feeling "old" is a perfectly valid reason to come see a doctor – we can certainly explore that. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit more about what “feeling old” means to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it's just…things aren’t working like they used to. My knees ache, especially when it rains. And I forget things. Not important things, usually, just…names. And where I put my glasses. It’s probably just age, though. My mother was the same way, you know. A bit…scatterbrained at the end. I don’t want to be like that. Not completely.
DOCTOR: I see. Knee pain and some memory lapses…those are common concerns as we get older, and it’s good you’re aware of them. It’s also helpful to know about your mother's experience. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. When did you first start noticing the knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… that's a hard one. Years, I suppose. Probably… after my husband passed. Everything felt a bit… duller then. The pain wasn’t bad at first, just a little stiffness. It's gotten worse in the winters, definitely. Especially with the dampness. We always lived in nicer climates, you know? California, Arizona… moving up here was my daughter’s idea. Said it was “safer.” Safer for who, I wonder.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss can certainly have an impact on our physical well-being, and a change in climate can exacerbate joint pain. It sounds like the pain is related to the weather, and has been present for some time. And just to clarify, when you say it's gotten worse, would you describe it as pain that's constantly present, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Definitely comes and goes. Not a constant ache, thank goodness. It’s worse when it’s cold and rainy, like it has been lately. And if I… overdo it, I suppose. My daughter wants me to take walks with her, but sometimes my knees just… protest. It’s not crippling, mind you. I can still get around. Just… slower. And with a bit of a groan.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery, that’s helpful. So, intermittent knee pain, worse with cold weather and activity. We'll definitely want to explore that further. Now, you also mentioned some memory lapses. Could you describe what those are like?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not like… forgetting who people are, you know? It’s more… words. The right word just… escapes me. Or I’ll go into a room and forget why I went there. Little things. And names. Faces, sometimes. I know I know them, but the name just won't come. It's frustrating, honestly. Makes me feel… foolish.
DOCTOR: I understand that can be very frustrating, Ms. Calvery. It’s good you’re able to describe it so clearly. It sounds like you're aware of the lapses and they aren't significantly interfering with your daily life, but it's still something we should investigate. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Past medical history… that’s a long one. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. And a bad bout of the flu in… oh, I don’t even remember when. Mostly, I’ve been healthy. Very healthy. My husband always said I was a sturdy one. I had a gallbladder removed, I think? Years ago. It was a simple surgery. Nothing major. I really can’t recall much else, honestly. It all feels so… distant.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. We can work with what you remember. Tonsils out as a child, a bout of the flu, and gallbladder removal. We do have your electronic health record here, so I can review the details of that surgery, if you’d like. Okay, it looks like you had your gallbladder removed laparoscopically in 2008. No complications noted. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I used to take something for hay fever, when I lived in… Arizona, I think it was. But that was ages ago. And it didn't bother me, as far as I remember. Nothing serious, definitely. Honestly, my daughter is probably more aware of these things than I am. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good to know. And it's wonderful that you have a supportive daughter. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. A small white pill. I think it’s… amlodipine? Yes, amlodipine. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I’ll take ibuprofen. Just when I need it, though. Not every day. And…oh, sometimes a vitamin D supplement in the winter. My daughter makes me take it. Says I’m not getting enough sunshine.
DOCTOR: Alright, amlodipine for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and vitamin D supplement. That's helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a bit sad, really. My mother, she had… well, she got very forgetful towards the end, like I said. And my father, he had heart trouble. A bad heart, always. He didn't live to be very old. And my husband… he had diabetes. Yes, diabetes. That was a long time ago, though. I don't know much beyond that, honestly. We didn't talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Calvery. That gives me a better understanding of your family's health background. History of forgetfulness in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and diabetes in your husband. Now, one last thing before we move to the physical exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… well, it’s not very exciting. I mostly stay home. Read a lot. Watch television. My daughter takes me out sometimes, but I prefer the quiet, honestly. I used to be very active, when I was younger. We travelled a lot with my husband. But that was a long time ago. Now, I just… take it easy. I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. It’s a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. That’s very helpful. So, a quiet lifestyle, no smoking, and minimal alcohol consumption. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… don't expect too much. I'm not as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. We'll take things at your pace. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. It's likely benign, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142/88. And your pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and range of motion. Please extend your arms. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. And your range of motion is slightly limited in your knees and elbows. There is some tenderness to palpation on the medial aspect of both knees. Finally, I'd like to do a brief neurological exam. I'm just going to ask you a few simple questions and have you do a few simple tasks. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Today’s date… let me think. It’s… August… the second? Yes, August 2nd. Is that right? 2025, isn’t it? I hope so. I sometimes get those dates mixed up.
DOCTOR: Yes, August 2nd, 2025 is correct. That’s good. Now, can you tell me where we are today?
PATIENT: Oh, that's easy. We're at the… Doctor's office. Yes, the doctor’s office. In… well, it’s a small town, isn’t it? My daughter said it was… rural. That’s the word. Rural.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re right, we are in a rural clinic. And finally, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words…? Oh. Let me listen. Apple… table… penny. Did I get them right? I'm not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Yes, you repeated them correctly. Alright, Ms. Calvery, thank you for your patience. Based on our conversation and the physical exam, it seems you’re experiencing some age-related changes, including intermittent knee pain, some memory lapses, and slightly diminished reflexes. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that could be due to anxiety. I’d like to order some routine blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a course of physical therapy for your knees, and I'd like to discuss some strategies to help improve your memory. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work… Physical therapy… It all sounds like a lot. I suppose it’s probably necessary. Will the blood work be painful? And physical therapy… will it be… hard? I don’t want to strain anything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Calvery. Let’s address your concerns. The blood work is a simple procedure. A small sample of blood will be taken from your arm. There might be a brief pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. As for physical therapy, it will be tailored to your specific needs and limitations. The therapist will start with gentle exercises to improve your range of motion and strengthen your muscles. It won't be strenuous, and they will monitor your progress closely. The goal is to help you manage your knee pain and improve your overall function. I want to assure you, we’ll take things at your pace, and we’ll work together to create a plan that’s comfortable and effective for you. Does that sound more reassuring?
PATIENT: Yes… that does sound a little better. Gentle exercises… that’s good. I don't want to push myself too hard. And if it gets too painful, I can stop, right? My daughter will be furious if I fall and break something. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. You can stop at any time if you experience pain. The therapist will be very attentive to your needs, and they will adjust the exercises accordingly. Your comfort and safety are our top priorities. And yes, it's good your daughter cares for you. It’s always good to have someone looking out for us. Now, I also recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the blood work and monitor your progress. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that should be fine. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my book club meeting. We’re reading a very good mystery right now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. We’ll make sure the appointment doesn’t conflict with your book club. Alright, to summarize, we’ve ordered blood work, scheduled a physical therapy consultation, and will follow up in two weeks to discuss the results and your progress. I’m also going to give you a handout with some tips on improving your memory and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I do get a bit… flustered sometimes.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Ms. Calvery. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
