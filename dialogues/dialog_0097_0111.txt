DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Though I must say, I haven’t much time for pleasantries. My skin… it’s darkening. And I’m ever so tired. It’s quite bothersome, really. I work with iron, you see. Reinforcing, mostly. Not that you’d understand the intricacies of the trade. It’s… demanding. And it seems to be affecting my complexion.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me all of that, Mr. Drahota. It is helpful to understand what you do. Working with iron, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Iron and rebar. For buildings, bridges… things that last. Though I suppose that’s lost on most people these days. It’s… strenuous work. And this fatigue is quite debilitating. I haven’t been sleeping properly, and frankly, I’m not as… robust as I once was. It’s probably just old age, but my wife insisted I come. Women. Always fussing.
DOCTOR: Wives often have good instincts, Mr. Drahota. It’s good of your wife to encourage you to come in. We'll figure out what’s going on. You mentioned your skin darkening and fatigue. Can you tell me a bit more about the darkening?
PATIENT: Darkening… well, it’s… all over, I suppose. Not in patches, thankfully. Just… a general dullness. And a sort of… brownish tinge. It’s hard to explain. It wasn’t noticeable at first, of course. But it’s become… more pronounced lately. As I said, I’ve been rather tired. It makes everything seem… less vibrant. And I haven’t been eating as well, either. Though that’s probably unrelated. I’m not a doctor, you know. I just know I feel… unwell.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Unwell” is a perfectly good description, Mr. Drahota. And it’s good you're noticing these changes. So, it’s a general darkening all over, and you’ve also noticed a decrease in appetite. Has this darkening been gradual, or did it seem to come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I presume. Honestly, I don’t spend much time scrutinizing my skin. I have more important matters to attend to. It wasn’t like waking up one morning and finding myself… a different shade. More of a slow… accumulation of dullness, as I said. It’s been… months, perhaps? Several months, at least. Time blurs when one is busy. My wife keeps track of these things. Though I’m not entirely sure why. It’s hardly a matter of national importance.
DOCTOR: Even things that aren't matters of "national importance," as you put it, Mr. Drahota, are worth investigating when they affect your well-being. Several months of gradual darkening… alright. And you mentioned fatigue and decreased appetite. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me see. I… ache, occasionally. Joints, mostly. It’s to be expected, I suppose, at my age. And I’ve been… a bit more short-tempered than usual. My wife says so. She’s very observant, that woman. But beyond that… no. Nothing significant. Just the general malaise of growing old, I suspect. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t got all day. Is there something you can do about this, or am I simply wasting my time?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Drahota. And no, you are not wasting your time. The joint aches and the change in temperament are good things to know. Let’s talk a bit about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical history… Honestly, Doctor, that was decades ago. I had a… a touch of the flu, once. And a bad sprain in my ankle, when I was younger. Working with iron, you see. It’s… hazardous. Beyond that… no. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. I don’t believe in coddling myself with doctors and pills. My father always said, “A strong constitution and a good work ethic are all you need.” I suppose I’ve lived by that creed. Honestly, I doubt there's much to report. It’s probably just… old age. Can we be done soon? My wife is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant past medical history. That's helpful to know. Now, what about any medications you're currently taking, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I told you, I don't believe in coddling myself. I take nothing. Not a single pill. A bit of liniment for the joints, perhaps, when they're particularly troublesome. But that’s it. I prefer natural remedies, if anything. A good night's sleep, a strong cup of tea… things like that. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a very self-sufficient man. I don’t require a pharmacy to function. This is becoming rather tedious. Are you certain you can assist me, or shall I simply return home?
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for a natural approach, Mr. Drahota. And I assure you, I am doing my best to assist you. Now, one final question about your history: Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really? At my age, one develops immunity to everything. No, Doctor, I have no allergies. None whatsoever. I’ve eaten everything imaginable, worked with every conceivable substance… I assure you, allergies are the least of my concerns. Now, are we finally getting somewhere? I have a luncheon appointment. It’s a… rather important engagement.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Thank you for that information. So, to summarize, you’ve noticed a gradual darkening of your skin over several months, accompanied by fatigue and decreased appetite. You've also mentioned some joint aches and increased irritability. You have no significant past medical history, take no medications, and have no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re agreeable. I'll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well. A physical exam, I suppose. Though I highly doubt it will reveal anything of consequence. I told you, it’s probably just old age. But… fine. Get it over with. Quickly, if you please. My luncheon appointment is fast approaching, and I’m not one to keep my colleagues waiting. Just… be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And please, don’t ask me to remove my shoes. I have very particular feet.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. We'll keep it quick and gentle, and your shoes can absolutely stay on. Alright, your vital signs are a bit elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds are regular, although I am hearing a very faint murmur. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to examine your skin. I notice the generalized darkening you described, and also observe some mild hyperpigmentation on your hands and face. The skin feels slightly dry to the touch. Do you moisturize regularly?
PATIENT: Moisturize? Good heavens, no. I work with iron, Doctor, not lotions and creams. My hands are… calloused. Rough. It comes with the trade. I haven’t pampered my skin in decades. It’s a functional necessity, not a beauty regime. I suppose it is a bit dry… everything is dry these days. The air conditioning, you see. It's… rather aggressive. But I assure you, it's nothing of consequence. A bit of hard work and a strong hand cream should suffice. Though I doubt I'll ever find the time. Now, are we nearly finished? This is becoming… rather uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Thank you for allowing me to examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and my initial examination, several possibilities come to mind. The darkening of your skin, fatigue, and decreased appetite, along with the dry skin and slightly elevated blood pressure, could be related to several factors. One possibility is iron overload, given your profession. While your body needs iron, too much can be harmful. Another possibility is a vitamin deficiency, such as B12 or folate. Less likely, but we need to consider it, is a thyroid issue. And finally, given your age, we should rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I would like to order some blood tests. These tests will check your iron levels, vitamin levels, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Honestly, Doctor, is this truly necessary? I told you, it’s probably just old age. A bit of fatigue, a bit of dryness… it’s to be expected. But… fine. If it will appease you. Though I highly doubt it will reveal anything of significance. Just… make it quick, please. I have very little patience for needles and laboratories. And I’m not fond of hospitals. They… smell unpleasant. Just get it over with. And can I have a glass of water afterward? My mouth feels rather dry. Now, where do I sign? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I understand your concerns. The blood draw will be quick, and we can arrange for you to have a glass of water afterward. The lab is just down the hall. Here's the requisition form. You’ll need to take this to the lab technician. They'll draw a few vials of blood, and the results should be back in a few days. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, I would also recommend that you try to increase your fluid intake and eat a balanced diet. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact me. Do you have any questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: Balanced diet? Fluid intake? Honestly, Doctor, I’m a working man, not a… a pampered invalid. I eat what I can, when I can. And I drink enough water to keep myself functioning. But… fine. I’ll try. Though I make no promises. And no, I don't have any questions. Just… get this over with. The sooner I have these results, the sooner I can return to my life. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a luncheon appointment to attend. Good day, Doctor. .
