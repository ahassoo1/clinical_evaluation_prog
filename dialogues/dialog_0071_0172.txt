DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh. Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the slightest idea why I’m here. My husband, Harold, insisted. Something about… settling in? We just moved, you see. Rural, he said it would be… peaceful. It’s all rather inconvenient, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, settling in. A check-up with a new doctor is always a good idea after a move. That’s very thoughtful of Harold. Well, let’s just start with a general overview then, shall we?
PATIENT: Overview? Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very private person. And I haven't the time for… generalities. Is there a form I can fill out? I prefer to write things down. My memory… it’s not what it used to be, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, absolutely. A form is perfect. It’s always best to have things in writing. Here you are. It covers the basics – medical history, allergies, medications… things like that. Take your time, there’s no rush. I'll be right outside if you need anything. Just… let me know if you have trouble finding a comfortable spot to write.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I fail to see why a doctor needs to know everything about my life. Allergies… honestly. I eat what Harold puts in front of me. And medications? A little something for my nerves, perhaps. But I’m not one to advertise.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright, Candice. We only need the information that’s relevant to your health. And “something for your nerves” is perfectly fine to note – knowing anything you take is helpful. Just fill in whatever you’re comfortable with, and we'll go from there. Don't feel pressured to disclose anything you don't want to. Take your time.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. It's not as if I'm riddled with ailments. I simply… prefer a quiet life. Harold insists I be “proactive” about my health. Men. Always fussing. Now, where does it ask about… previous doctors? That seems a reasonable question.
DOCTOR: Yes, previous doctors is a good place to start. That helps us get a complete picture. It’s right there, on the second page, under “Medical History.” Don't worry about being perfect; just the names and locations are fine if you recall them. And if not, that's perfectly alright too. We can try to track things down if needed.
PATIENT: Track things down? Honestly, the bureaucracy of this country! It’s appalling. I haven't seen a doctor in… well, decades, probably. Before we moved, of course. We had Dr. Abernathy back in the city. A perfectly competent man, though a bit young for my taste. And before that… Oh dear. Before that… it’s all a blur. I simply don’t recall. It’s hardly relevant, is it? I feel perfectly fine, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Candice. Knowing Dr. Abernathy’s name is helpful. We can always try to obtain records if you're comfortable with that. No need to stress over the details. Now, perhaps we could talk a little bit about what brings you in today, even if it's just a general check-up?
PATIENT: Obtain records? Absolutely not. I have no desire to dredge up old history. And as for what brings me in… honestly, Doctor, I told you, my husband insisted! He worries incessantly about… everything. He says I need to “establish care” or some such nonsense. I assure you, I require no care. I simply wanted a quick assessment to appease him and then be on my way. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand, Candice. A quick assessment to appease Harold. Perfectly reasonable. Well, let’s do just that then. Just to be thorough, even if you feel perfectly fine, I'd like to take a few basic measurements – your blood pressure, pulse, and weight. And perhaps a quick listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Measurements? Listen to my heart and lungs? Honestly, Doctor, are you implying something? I assure you, my heart is perfectly sound, and my lungs are… perfectly adequate. I do not appreciate being subjected to a battery of tests simply to satisfy my husband’s anxieties. If you must take measurements, do so quickly. I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. A quick assessment. That's all I intend. It’s just standard procedure, even for a healthy individual. It doesn’t take long at all. If you’ll just step on the scale for a moment… and then I'll take your blood pressure while you're seated.
PATIENT: Very well. But do be quick about it. I have no intention of spending the entire afternoon in a doctor's office. Honestly, the inefficiency of modern healthcare is appalling. And please, try not to poke and prod too much. I have sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Just relax, if you can. It won’t take long. . Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s a little elevated, but not concerning at this moment. Just something to keep an eye on. And your height is… 196 centimeters, is that correct?
PATIENT: 196 centimeters? Good heavens, is that all? I always thought I was taller. Harold insists I maintain good posture, you see. Perhaps that explains it. And “elevated” blood pressure? What does that even mean? Am I ill? Honestly, Doctor, you’re causing me unnecessary anxiety. I specifically requested a quick assessment, not a medical diagnosis.
DOCTOR: No, Candice, it doesn't mean you’re ill. “Elevated” simply means it’s a little higher than the ideal range. It can be caused by many things – stress, even just sitting in a doctor’s office can raise it slightly. It’s not something to worry about right now, but we should just be aware of it. Now, just to complete the quick assessment, would you mind if I listened to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Listen to my heart and lungs? Honestly, Doctor, you are relentless. I suppose I have no choice if you insist. But do be gentle. And please, refrain from making any alarming noises with your… stethoscope, or whatever it’s called. I have a very sensitive constitution. But make it quick, please. I have a luncheon date and I simply must be on time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Just a few deep breaths, if you can. Your lungs sound clear, and your heart sounds regular. Everything sounds good. Just a bit of shallow breathing, which isn’t unusual. Now, is there anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see the point of this entire exercise. Everything sounds “good”? As if you could possibly discern anything of significance with that… contraption. And no, there is nothing else you need to be aware of. I have lived a perfectly healthy life, and I intend to continue doing so. Now, may I be excused? I have a luncheon date, and I simply must be on my way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. As you wish. Everything does sound good. Just remember to try and manage your stress, and perhaps encourage Harold to relax a little as well. If you experience any changes in your health, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Here’s my card. And please, enjoy your luncheon.
PATIENT: Very well. I shall. Though I doubt I shall have occasion to use it. Honestly, the fuss over nothing. Good day, Doctor. And please, refrain from contacting me unless absolutely necessary. I have a luncheon date, and I simply must be on my way. .
