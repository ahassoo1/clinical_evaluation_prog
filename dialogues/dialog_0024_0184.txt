DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Trendler. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Straight to the point is good. Waste no time. It’s…well, it’s this belly. Look at it. <gestures vaguely at midsection> It just…hangs. Used to be strong, you know? Pile driving. Hard work. Now…it’s just there. I want it gone. Not lookin’ for sympathy, just a fix. What can you do?
DOCTOR: “A ‘fix’,” you say. Right. Well, ‘hanging’ is not a medical term, Mr. Trendler. We need to be precise. Is this a recent development, this…prominence?
PATIENT: Recent? Goodness no. Years now. Maybe five, six years. Started after I…well, after my wife passed. Didn’t have much appetite after that. Lost weight everywhere else, but this…this stayed. Stubborn thing. Don't need a history lesson, doc. Just tell me if you can shrink it. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Five to six years. Significant weight loss elsewhere concurrent with the abdominal…increase. Very well. And have you noticed any changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What kind of question is that? I go to the bathroom when I need to, same as anyone! Look, I didn't come here to talk about…that. I want this belly fixed. You got machines? Surgery? Something? I ain’t got all day to be answerin’ personal questions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, it’s imperative that I gather a complete history to determine the cause of this…situation. A simple ‘fix’ is rarely possible without understanding the underlying problem. We need to rule out serious causes. Are you experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? No! Not a bit. Just…displeased with the appearance. Look, I ain't sick! I’m a strong man, was a strong man. This is about how I look, not how I feel. You makin’ this complicated for no reason. Can't you just…remove the fat? Like they do on television? Don’t tell me you can't do somethin’. I got good insurance, you know. Private. I expect results.
DOCTOR: “Results,” yes. Insurance is…irrelevant if there is no medical indication for intervention. While I understand your dissatisfaction with the aesthetic appearance, simply wanting to remove fat is not a justifiable medical procedure. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Like in the past week? No. I told you, after my wife passed, I didn’t eat much for a long time. Things are…stable now. I eat. Not like I used to, mind you. More fish now. Doctor, are you listenin’ to a word I’m sayin’? I want this belly gone. Is it possible, or are you just gonna sit there and ask me about my toilet habits all day? I got things to do, you know. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Since you insist on bypassing a proper medical history, let’s proceed with a physical examination, then. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to palpate your abdomen. And please, Mr. Trendler, refrain from interrupting. This is for your own…assessment.
