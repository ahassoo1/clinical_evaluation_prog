DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you are 53 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. It’s just… this itching. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s really getting on my nerves. Everywhere, really. Not just one spot.
DOCTOR: "Everywhere," you say. Hmm. And how long exactly has this “itching” been occurring, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, I'd say, about three weeks ago, maybe a little longer. It wasn't bad at first, just a little annoying. But it’s gotten worse each day, you know? It keeps me up at night, scratching. It's… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, progressively worsening. I understand your frustration, Mr. Ferneding. And is this itching accompanied by any visible rash, bumps, or changes in your skin texture?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. I think there might be… little red spots, but they’re so small, I honestly hadn't paid much attention. It’s mostly just the itch, really. They don't really… stand out. Just…reddish. Very small. I don't know if they've changed or grown, to be honest. I haven't looked that closely.
DOCTOR: Very well. And where precisely on your body are you experiencing this itching most prominently?
PATIENT: Well, it’s pretty widespread, like I said. But I think it's worst on my back, especially my lower back. And my arms… the insides of my elbows, mostly. And my legs, calves especially. It's… everywhere, but those spots are the most bothersome, I suppose. It's hard to pinpoint, honestly. It’s a general discomfort, not one specific place.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you tried anything to alleviate the itching thus far, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I've tried a few things. I put some lotion on it, regular lotion. Didn’t really help. Then I tried some of that anti-itch cream, you know, the kind you get over the counter? It helped a little, for maybe ten minutes, but then it just started itching again. I'm really not sure what to do anymore.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind, Mr. Ferneding. Just to assess the distribution and nature of the rash, if present. Please, have a seat on the examination table. I'll need you to disrobe from the waist up and down, but a gown is provided for your comfort and modesty.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam. Good idea. Yes, I can do that. A gown, you say? Excellent. I'll just… go change then.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Ferneding. Now, if you could just stand with your arms relaxed at your sides. I’m going to start with a visual inspection of your skin, and then I'll lightly palpate the areas you've mentioned. I observe scattered, small erythematous papules predominantly on your lower back, extending onto your upper back and flanks. There are also some similar lesions on the volar aspects of your elbows and lower legs. No significant excoriations noted at this time. Palpation reveals mild warmth to the skin in affected areas, but no significant induration or edema. Hmm. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years ago, but it's been under control with medication for a long time now. Just a small dose. And… my wife, God rest her soul, she passed away last year, and I've been a bit… under the weather since, if you know what I mean. Just tired, generally. No other serious illnesses, Doctor. I don’t think so. Oh, and allergies… I’m allergic to penicillin, I think. Or maybe it was amoxicillin? Something like that.
DOCTOR: Controlled hypertension, recent bereavement, possible penicillin/amoxicillin allergy. Thank you, Mr. Ferneding. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, and any other conditions, if any?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. That’s for the blood pressure. And… that’s it, really. Just the Lisinopril. No other medications, Doctor. I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 10mg daily. Do you have any family history of skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or chronic itching?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My mother, she had… dry skin, I think. Very dry hands, especially in the winter. She used a lot of lotion. But I don’t think it was anything… serious. My father, he was perfectly healthy, as far as I know. No real skin problems that I remember. And my wife… she didn't have anything like that either. No, I don't recall any family history of chronic itching or anything like eczema or psoriasis.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Ferneding. Based on your history and physical examination, the presentation is suggestive of a possible drug-induced exanthema, given your Lisinopril use, though other etiologies must also be considered. It’s important to rule out other potential causes. I am going to order a complete blood count with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying systemic issues. Additionally, I recommend a skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other dermatological conditions. We'll proceed with these tests and discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, I'll prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream to alleviate the itching. It's a mild potency cream, and should be applied twice daily to the affected areas.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Tests and a biopsy. Alright. Whatever you think is best. Topical cream, you say? Twice a day. I can do that. Drug-induced… because of the blood pressure medicine? That doesn't sound good. But I appreciate you looking into it. And I understand we’ll talk more when the results are back. So, a follow-up appointment… when should I expect that?
DOCTOR: The prescription is for Triamcinolone 0.1% cream. Apply a thin layer twice daily to the affected areas for two weeks. As for the follow-up, let’s schedule an appointment in two weeks, on August 16th at 10:00 AM. This will allow sufficient time for the test results to return and for you to assess the response to the topical corticosteroid. If your itching worsens significantly before then, or you develop any fever, blistering, or difficulty breathing, please contact the office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Are there any questions I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: August 16th at 10:00 AM. Okay, good. I’ve got that written down. Triamcinolone… alright. And I will definitely contact you if anything gets worse. No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate it very much. I’ll go get that cream filled, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I am glad I could be of assistance. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns whatsoever. Get well soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. .
