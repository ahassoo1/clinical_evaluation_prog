DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit… tedious having to explain this. Workplace stress, they said. Burnout. Really, it's just… young people these days. They don’t understand dedication. They expect everything handed to them. I teach library science, you know. Real library science. Not whatever they’re doing now. Is this going to take long? I have a rather important collection to catalogue.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re feeling quite frustrated with the current work environment, and that's impacting you. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible, sir. Just to clarify, it sounds like this stress is related to your job teaching library science. Is that right?
PATIENT: “Related to”? Well, naturally. Where else would it be from? Though, I suppose I do have a rather demanding garden… but no, it's the students, mostly. And the administration. Constantly changing things. They don't respect the classics. Honestly, it's appalling. Are we quite finished? I really must get back.
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, it sounds like the job is the primary source of your stress. And a demanding garden certainly adds to things! To help me understand better, could you describe what this stress feels like?
PATIENT: "Feels like"? Doctor, are you asking me to feel? It feels… unpleasant. I'm constantly tired, irritable. I find myself snapping at people, even those who don't deserve it. My appetite is… diminished. It’s all very… draining. And frankly, it's beneath me to be discussing these personal matters. I'm a professional, you know. I shouldn't have to explain this. Is there a test for this “burnout” business? Perhaps a simple blood sample?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you’re experiencing fatigue, irritability, and a decreased appetite – those are all common symptoms of stress and, yes, burnout. While there isn’t a single test for burnout, we can certainly do some blood work to rule out other potential causes for your fatigue and appetite changes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… fine, if you insist. Though I highly doubt it will reveal anything of significance. I've always been a healthy man. And frankly, Doctor, I'm not entirely sure I understand the point of all this. Are you suggesting I’m… ill? Because I assure you, I’m perfectly capable. Just… worn down. A bit… exasperated. Get on with it, please. The sooner this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. We’re just ruling things out to get a clearer picture. And no, I'm not suggesting you're ill. It’s important to understand what’s causing these feelings so we can find the best way to help you feel more like yourself. Before we proceed with the blood work, perhaps I can ask a few more questions, just to get a better understanding of your overall health?
PATIENT: Questions, of course. More questions. Very well. But please, keep it brief. I have a collection of first editions calling my name, you know. And I’m really not in the mood for a prolonged interrogation. Ask away, Doctor. But make it quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, sir. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions… hmm. Nothing of any great consequence. A bout of influenza in ’68, I believe. And a rather nasty case of shingles a few years back. But nothing that would be relevant now. I've always been a remarkably robust specimen. Honestly, Doctor, are you writing all this down? It’s rather… demeaning.
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, I am. It's important to have a complete medical history. Influenza in '68 and shingles, noted. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Good heavens, no. Why would I subject myself to such barbarity? I take excellent care of myself, you know. Proper diet, regular exercise – well, regular walks in the garden, at least. No, I’ve never had any need for a surgeon’s knife. It’s a dreadful thought, really. Honestly, Doctor, you’re asking very personal questions. Are you quite finished with your inquiries?
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, almost finished. No surgeries, noted. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Are you implying I'm infirm? I take a multivitamin, occasionally. And a little something for my arthritis when it flares up, which is rarely. But that’s hardly a “medication,” Doctor. It's a herbal remedy. My wife – my ex-wife, actually – insisted on it. A rather pungent concoction, if I recall correctly. Is that sufficient? Can we please move on? I'm beginning to feel quite faint. All this reminiscing… it’s dreadful.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin and a herbal remedy for arthritis, noted. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? A mild irritation to ragweed, perhaps. Nothing to speak of. I simply avoid the countryside in the autumn. It's quite simple, really. I’m not one for self-pity or dramatic displays. Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to prolong this ordeal? I have a valuable collection that requires my immediate attention. Please, let's get this over with. Blood work, you said? Let's proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. No known drug allergies, mild ragweed allergy, noted. Just a few more quick questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any family members with a history of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, dear. That's… complicated. My mother’s side were all rather… robust individuals. They tended to live long lives, mostly from sheer stubbornness. My father… he had a touch of high blood pressure, I believe. And an aunt, on my ex-wife's side, succumbed to some sort of… ailment. Cancer, perhaps? It was a very long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather morbid. I really don’t see the point of delving into the past. It’s irrelevant. Are we absolutely certain this blood work is necessary? I’m feeling increasingly unwell just thinking about it. Perhaps a nice cup of tea would be more beneficial.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. I understand your reluctance. High blood pressure in your father and possible cancer in an ex-wife's relative, noted. Perhaps the blood work will give us some insight. We can order it now, and you can rest comfortably afterward. Would that be acceptable?
