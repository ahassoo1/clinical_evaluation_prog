DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Gentz, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Brad Gentz. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, but… well, this ain’t goin’ away on its own, is it? It’s just… a lot of blood, you know? And it's not exactly pleasant.
DOCTOR: Blood, you say. Alright. Let’s not get dramatic. A lot of blood is… subjective. Where exactly is this blood coming from, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Subjective? Lady, I'm tellin' ya, it's enough to make a fella queasy. It’s… well, it's comin' from… down there. You know. The other end. Been happenin' for a few days now, gettin' worse each time. Not somethin’ a man likes to talk about, frankly. And it ain’t like I’m eatin' anything weird, either. Just normal food.
DOCTOR: “Normal food” is also subjective, Mr. Gentz. But let’s focus. So, blood with bowel movements, you’re saying?
PATIENT: Look, I ain't a fancy eater. Meat, potatoes, maybe some veggies. Nothing spicy, nothing exotic. And yeah, with… when I go to the bathroom. It's… it's in the bowl, alright? And on the… paper. Bright red. Not… not dark. That matter? It's kinda scary, honestly. Never had this happen before.
DOCTOR: Bright red suggests it's likely coming from lower in the digestive tract, which… is not necessarily good. Have you experienced any pain, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain, lady. More like… discomfort. A kinda crampin’ feelin’. Comes and goes. Not sharp, just… annoying. And I've been feelin' a bit tired, now that you mention it. Weak, almost. Could just be the… the blood loss, I guess. You got any ideas what it is? I don't need a whole lecture, just... what are we lookin' at here?
DOCTOR: Weakness with blood loss is concerning. I need to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, now that you mention it... it’s been a bit looser than usual. Not diarrhea, exactly, but… softer. And I've been goin' more often, if you wanna know. Used to be regular as clockwork, now it's... unpredictable. Honestly, everything's kinda messed up down there. Is this somethin’ serious? I ain't got insurance, you know. Don't wanna get stuck with a huge bill.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your concerns about finances, but ignoring this won't make it disappear. We need to rule out some possibilities. Have you ever had a colonoscopy or any other screening tests for…problems in that area?
PATIENT: A colono… what now? Look, lady, I'm a simple man. I work in a crematory. I deal with…final arrangements. Fancy tests ain’t exactly in my wheelhouse. Never had anythin’ poked around down there, no. Just… normal check-ups, years ago. Doc always said I was healthy as a horse. Until now, I guess. You think it's… cancer? Don't tell me it's cancer.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, let's not jump to conclusions. There are many reasons for rectal bleeding, and cancer is just one of them. We need to do some basic tests to determine the cause. I'm going to need to perform a physical exam. And I'll order a stool sample to check for blood and infection. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical exam, huh? Look, I'm not exactly thrilled about someone pokin' around... but I guess I don't have much choice, do I? Stool sample… that’s… manageable, I suppose. Just tell me exactly what you need, and let's get this over with. And how much is all this gonna cost? I really need a rough idea. Before you start pokin' and proddin'.
DOCTOR: The exam is necessary, Mr. Gentz. As for cost… it depends on the lab results. A basic stool sample is relatively inexpensive. The exam itself is standard. We can discuss payment options with the billing department afterward. Now, if you'll excuse me… please lie down on the examination table, face up. We'll start with abdominal palpation. And please try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Don't rush me. Just get it over with. And try not to poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just feeling for any tenderness or masses. Deep breath in… and out. Any pain here?
PATIENT: A little… right there. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like somethin's… tight. Is that normal? You're pushin' kinda hard, lady.
DOCTOR: Okay, just noting that tenderness. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. These are normal bowel sounds. Are you experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No nausea, no vomit. Just… tired. And that bleedin'. It's been happenin’ more often, even with… you know. Tryin' to eat right, stay hydrated. It don't seem to be makin' a difference. You findin' anythin'? Anything bad? Just tell me straight. I don't need sugar-coating.
DOCTOR: I'm not prepared to give a definitive diagnosis at this stage, Mr. Gentz. Your exam reveals some tenderness in the lower left quadrant, and you've described rectal bleeding and changes in your bowel habits. To get a clearer picture, we need to send a stool sample to the lab. It will check for infection, inflammation, and… blood. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Send the stool sample. Just… how long will it take to get the results? I can't just sit around waitin' for days, worried sick. And if it is somethin' bad… what happens then? I need to know what I'm lookin' at here. I ain’t got family. Just… me.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 3-5 business days, Mr. Gentz. If the results indicate a serious issue, we'll discuss further testing options – likely a colonoscopy. That would involve… a more detailed examination of your colon. As for costs… I cannot provide an accurate estimate at this time. Our billing department can offer payment plans. Now, I’ll provide you with a collection cup and instructions for the stool sample. Please follow them carefully. Do you have any questions about the sample collection?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy… that sounds expensive. And unpleasant. Payment plans… that don't help if I got nothin' to pay with. What kinda infection are we talkin' about? Is it… somethin' contagious? I work around… remains. Don't wanna cause any trouble for anyone. Just tell me straight. And don’t give me any fancy medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I assure you, we are not suspecting a contagious infection. It’s likely related to inflammation or… other issues within the digestive tract. The stool sample will help us determine the cause. I understand your concerns about costs, but I cannot provide specific financial advice. I’m a physician, not a financial advisor. I’ve ordered the necessary tests, and our billing department will contact you regarding payment options. Now, please, if you’re finished with the collection cup, you can proceed to the restroom to collect your sample. The instructions are straightforward. I’ll be in my office if you have any further questions… after you’ve collected the sample.
PATIENT: Fine. I’ll go collect the… sample. Don’t expect me to be happy about it. And if it turns out to be somethin’ serious… I expect you to be straight with me. No sugar-coating.
