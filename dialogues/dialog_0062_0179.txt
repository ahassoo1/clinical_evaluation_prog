DOCTOR: Hi Sherrell, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It is… well, it is the words. They do not come so easily now. It is… difficult to find them, you understand? It has been happening for… some time, I believe. A while now, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with your speech, specifically finding the right words. And this has been going on for a while now. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this happening?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a difficult question. It was after… after my wife, Elfriede, passed. Yes, after. It was not immediately, but… gradually. Perhaps six months, maybe more? It is hard to say, truly. Everything feels… distant now. I remember feeling very… tired, also. Perhaps that played a part? I do not know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started gradually about six months or more after your wife Elfriede passed away. And you also noticed feeling very tired around that time. I'm very sorry for your loss, by the way. Grief can certainly affect many things, and fatigue is very common. Let's focus on the words for a moment. Can you describe how difficult it is to find them?
PATIENT: It is… frustrating, Doctor. Sometimes… the word is on the tip of my tongue, you understand? I can feel it, almost, but I cannot… grasp it. Other times… it is as if the word does not even exist anymore. I know what I want to say, the idea is clear, but the… the proper phrasing escapes me. It is very embarrassing, to be honest. Especially when speaking with… acquaintances. I try to avoid long conversations now.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds incredibly frustrating, and it's perfectly understandable that you'd find it embarrassing and want to avoid difficult situations. It's good you're recognizing this and coming to see me about it. So, it sounds like sometimes the word is just out of reach, and other times it’s more like you can’t even recall what the word is at all. Does this happen more often when you're stressed, or tired, or does it seem to be consistent regardless of how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… worse when I am tired, yes. Definitely. And if I am… attempting to explain something complicated, it is much more difficult. Simple things, like ordering a coffee, are usually alright. But… a detailed explanation? No. Very difficult. Stress… I do not believe so. I am usually a very calm person, Doctor. Perhaps a little sad, but not stressed. I have retired, you see. Not much to stress about these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So it seems to be worse with fatigue and when you're trying to articulate more complex thoughts. Simple tasks are usually manageable. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a better overall picture. Have you noticed any other changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Sometimes… my voice feels… weak. Not always, but occasionally. And… I believe people ask me to repeat myself more often now. Not a great deal, but… it has happened. I do not slur my words, I do not think. But… the volume, perhaps? It is quieter now, I suppose. And… I stumble, sometimes. Over the sounds, not the thoughts. It is… subtle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasionally a weaker voice, needing to repeat yourself more often, and some subtle stumbling over sounds. That's good information. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any difficulty with understanding what others are saying?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I hear everything perfectly well. It is… saying things that is the problem, not hearing them. People speak quite clearly, usually. I may ask them to repeat themselves if they mumble, but that is… a general habit of mine, even before this started. It is not related to the words, I believe. No, I understand everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That's reassuring. So you're hearing clearly, just having trouble with your own speech. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I had a… a bad heart, many years ago. But it was… fixed. A surgery, many years ago. I see my general practitioner regularly for check-ups. And… high blood pressure, perhaps? I take medication for that, I believe. And… arthritis in my knees. It is why I walk with a cane. But… nothing else, I think. Nothing that affects the… the speaking. I take Medicare, if that is helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. History of heart surgery, high blood pressure managed with medication, and arthritis in your knees. Medicare is helpful information too. Do you recall what medications you're taking for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… a good question. I believe it is… a white pill? Small, white, round. And… another one, a yellow one. But the names… no, I do not recall. My general practitioner handles all of that. I have a list at home, I believe, but I did not bring it with me. I apologize, Doctor. It is… difficult for me to keep track of these things. I trust my doctor to ensure I am taking the correct medication.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Sherrell. We can certainly look those up in your records. Just one moment while I check your chart… Okay, it looks like you're currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily and Amlodipine 5mg daily. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Lisinopril and… Amlodipine. Yes, that sounds right. And allergies… hmm. No, Doctor. I do not believe so. I have never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. No allergies to food, either. I eat everything. Perhaps a little sensitive to dairy, but not a true allergy. It is just… discomfort, sometimes. No, no allergies to be concerned about. I am quite a healthy man, despite my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No known allergies. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has experienced any speech problems, difficulty swallowing, or neurological conditions like stroke or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had… a weakness, in her legs. Towards the end of her life. But I do not believe it affected her speech. She was always very talkative. My father… no, he was perfectly healthy. A strong man. My wife’s brother… he had some… confusion, later in life. But I don’t think it was… speech related. Just… forgetting things. Nothing like this, no. No one in the family had difficulty speaking, as far as I am aware. It is… a new problem, this. For me, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No known family history of speech problems or neurological conditions. Alright, Sherrell. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam, including testing your reflexes, strength, and coordination. I’ll also take a look in your mouth and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgement. Please, proceed. I am ready. Just… be gentle, if you would. My knees are not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Alright, take a deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90, but not critically high. Let’s check your reflexes now… Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon with age and arthritis. Strength feels adequate in your arms and legs. Now, I’m just going to ask you to say a few words after me… Can you say “hello”?
PATIENT: Hello.
DOCTOR: Good. And now, can you say “goodbye”?
PATIENT: Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Okay, and can you try saying “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious”?
PATIENT: Su… super… cali… frag… it’s… difficult. Supercali… fragilistic… exp… I apologize, Doctor. That is a very… long word. I am struggling. It feels… stuck. I cannot quite… form the sounds. It is very frustrating.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Sherrell. It's a very difficult word, and many people struggle with it. That’s helpful information. Your mouth and throat look clear. No signs of any obvious obstruction or inflammation. Okay, based on what you’ve told me, your medical history, and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing what could be early signs of dysarthria. That’s a motor speech disorder, meaning it’s caused by weakness or difficulty controlling the muscles used for speech. The diminished reflexes could be contributing, as well as the high blood pressure. The gradual onset of difficulty finding words, and the worsening with fatigue and complex thought, are also consistent with that. However, we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Dysarthria… A weakness in the muscles? Is it… serious, Doctor? Will it… worsen? And what… what are the other possibilities we need to rule out? I trust your expertise, but… I would appreciate some clarification, if you would be so kind. Is there… anything I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Sherrell, and it’s good you’re asking. Dysarthria isn’t necessarily serious in and of itself, but it can be a symptom of other underlying conditions, which is why we need to investigate further. The cause could be anything from a minor stroke to medication side effects to simply the natural effects of aging. To rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order an MRI of your brain to check for any structural abnormalities, and a speech pathology evaluation to get a more detailed assessment of your speech and swallowing. We’ll also repeat your blood pressure monitoring and review your medications. As for your question about worsening, that's difficult to say definitively without knowing the underlying cause. However, with speech therapy, many people can learn strategies to improve their speech clarity and maintain their communication skills. I also want to be upfront and say that it’s important to rule out a transient ischemic attack, or TIA, which is a mini-stroke. The symptoms can be subtle, and it's important to catch it early. We'll be proceeding cautiously and thoroughly to make sure we get the correct diagnosis and treatment plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A mini-stroke… That is worrying, Doctor. Yes, it makes… some sense, what you are saying. The caution is… appreciated. So, an MRI… to look at the brain. And speech therapy… to strengthen the muscles? If I may ask… how long does this process typically take? And will the MRI… will it be painful? I do not… I do not handle confinement well. And will the speech therapy be… expensive? I am on Medicare, as I mentioned, but… I worry about the costs. I apologize for the questions, Doctor, but I am… anxious. This is all rather overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Sherrell, and I completely understand your anxiety. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed. The MRI typically takes about 30-60 minutes, and it's not painful. You’ll lie inside a large, tube-shaped machine, and it will be noisy. We can provide you with earplugs or headphones. If you’re claustrophobic, we can discuss options like open MRI machines or medication to help you relax. We'll ensure you're as comfortable as possible. As for speech therapy, the length of treatment varies depending on your individual needs. We can discuss this in more detail once you’ve had the evaluation. Regarding the costs, Medicare typically covers a significant portion of both the MRI and speech therapy, but there may be some co-pays or deductibles. Our billing department can provide you with a detailed breakdown of the expected costs and help you navigate the coverage. I'm going to give you a referral for a speech pathology evaluation, and I'll schedule the MRI for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your symptoms and keeping a journal of any changes you notice. And if you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or vision changes, please seek immediate medical attention. Here’s the referral for speech therapy. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. And I’ll have my nurse schedule your MRI before you leave. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. A little overwhelming, but… alright. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your patience. Perhaps… perhaps I should avoid long conversations until we have a better understanding of what is happening? And… are there any exercises I can do at home, to… strengthen the muscles? Even just small things? I feel… helpless, waiting for the results.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good idea, Sherrell. Avoiding overly strenuous conversations until we have a better understanding of what’s going on is a sensible precaution. And yes, there are a few simple exercises you can do at home. They won’t cure anything, but they can help keep your muscles engaged and potentially slow any further decline. Here's a handout with some tongue and lip exercises. They’re simple to do, and you can practice them a few times a day. Just don’t push yourself too hard. Also, staying hydrated is important, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine might be helpful. I understand it’s frustrating waiting for results, and feeling helpless is completely normal. We’ll move as quickly as possible, and I’ll be here every step of the way to answer your questions and provide support. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all for now. You have answered my questions… most thoroughly. I appreciate your kindness, and your patience. And… thank you for not dismissing my concerns. I suppose… I shall await the call to schedule the MRI. And I will practice the exercises. Thank you again, Doctor Decosta. I wish you a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your MRI. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
