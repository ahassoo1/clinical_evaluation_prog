DOCTOR: Hi Yamir, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. I... need check for referee. For fitness. I want to be sure I can do it. It's for work.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fitness check for work – that makes sense. Just to clarify, you need a physical to make sure you’re cleared to be a sports referee, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes. Referee. Sometimes umpire. And... maybe coach little league. Need doctor say okay. I am… 31. Want to be sure. My wife… she would want this.
DOCTOR: Alright, a comprehensive check for refereeing, umpiring, and potentially coaching little league. Good thinking to get everything cleared beforehand, and that’s very considerate of you to mention your wife! So, let’s start with a little bit about your overall health. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly well. No big problems. Sometimes tired. But work is… hard work. Lifting things, hot. You know? I try to eat good. Not too much sugar. And I… I don't smoke. Never smoke. My wife… she didn't like smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. It's understandable to be tired with physically demanding work. And that’s excellent about not smoking. So, when you say “sometimes tired”, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Not sick tired. Just… at the end of the day, very sleepy. And sometimes, when I wake up, still feel a little slow. It’s been… a few months now. Not getting worse, but not getting better either. Maybe just… old? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Not getting worse but not getting better is good to know. It's definitely not just "old" – there are lots of things we can look at. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm... sometimes my muscles feel a little sore. But that’s from work, right? Lifting, bending. And… maybe a little achy in my back. Not bad. But I do a lot of lifting. I… I don't know if that counts. I just thought it was the job.
DOCTOR: Muscle soreness and back aches with your line of work is certainly common, but we still need to consider everything. Do you ever experience any fever, chills, unexplained weight loss, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No. No fever. No chills. Weight… maybe a little bit, but I am always working hard. And no… no night sweats. I sleep okay. Usually. Sometimes I wake up, but just to go to the bathroom. Nothing… bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats is helpful to know. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No diabetes. No high blood pressure. Doctor told me once my cholesterol was a little high, but I… I forgot what he said to do. I think he said… watch what I eat? I try. My wife… she was good at cooking healthy food. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Since… she passed. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand, and I'm sorry for your loss. It’s completely understandable that you haven’t been to a doctor in a while. We can certainly review your cholesterol and get things back on track. Were you ever hospitalized for any reason or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No hospital. No surgeries. I… I broke my arm when I was a little boy. Fell from a tree. But that was a long time ago. Nothing serious. Just… a cast. Everything okay now. No problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no hospitalizations or surgeries, just the broken arm as a child – good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or other significant medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... my father… he had heart problems. When he was old. Very old. And my mother… she had… something with her stomach. Cancer, I think. But that was a long time ago too. And… I don't really know much else. We didn’t talk about health much. Sorry. I don't mean to be… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Yamir. It’s common for families not to discuss health openly. Knowing about your father’s heart problems and your mother’s stomach cancer is helpful. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No medications. Just… sometimes I take a multivitamin. Just the one-a-day kind. Nothing special. And… sometimes, when my muscles are sore, I take… something from the store. For the pain. I forget the name. It’s… red bottle. Maybe. I don't take it often. Just when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and an occasional pain reliever for muscle soreness. Do you know the active ingredient in the pain reliever?
PATIENT: No. I don't know. I just… look at the picture on the bottle. For muscle pain. It's… I think it has "Ibu" in the name. Ibuprofen? Something like that. I'm sorry, I'm not good with names. I just want it to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: No worries at all. Ibuprofen is fine for occasional muscle pain. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No alcohol. No smoke. Never. And no… no drugs. I work hard. I don't need that. My wife… she wouldn't like that either. Just work. And… sometimes watch TV. Not much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No alcohol, smoking, or recreational drugs. To get a better picture of your overall health, I’d like to do a physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Physical exam is good. Whatever you need. I just… want to be sure I can do this job. And coach little league. For the kids. That’s why I came.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, and I completely understand. Let’s start with your height and weight. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. I'll also feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Sounds good. Whatever you need. Let’s get started. I… I hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your height and weight. Okay, you're 5'8" and 134 pounds. That’s a healthy weight for your height. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
PATIENT: Okay. Good. That’s good to hear. What does that… mean? About the lungs and heart? I just want to be sure I’m strong enough. For work and everything.
DOCTOR: It means everything sounds healthy! Clear lungs mean there’s no sign of fluid or obstruction. A regular heartbeat means your heart is functioning as it should. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops are all good signs. Okay, your blood pressure is 122/78. That's within a normal range. Now, let's take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears are clear bilaterally, no signs of infection. Nose is clear, no congestion or polyps. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling.
PATIENT: Okay. Good. Everything clear. That’s… good. I hope I don't need any medicine. I don't like taking pills. My wife… she always said they made her feel sick.
DOCTOR: I understand. We always try to avoid medication when possible. Okay, I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No organomegaly noted. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, within normal limits. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Everything sounds and feels good so far. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to order some basic blood work: a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a cholesterol panel. That will help us rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. If you think it's important. I just want to be sure. I don't like needles… but I guess I can do it. If it means I can keep working. And coach. That’s important to me. When can I do it? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns about needles, and we’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. The blood work is just to give us a baseline and make sure everything is functioning optimally. We can do the blood work right here in the clinic today. It will take about 15-20 minutes. The results usually come back within 2-3 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. 2-3 days is okay. Let’s just get it over with. I… I hope everything is okay. I really need to keep working. And coaching the kids. They… they are counting on me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, and I’m confident we’ll get you the answers you need. I'll have the phlebotomist come in to draw your blood. It will be quick and efficient. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address or any questions you have?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… please hurry. I just want to know if I’m okay. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll let the phlebotomist know you’re ready. I’ll be right here when you’re done and we can discuss the next steps. “Nurse, could you please come in and draw blood for Mr. Shanor?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you.
