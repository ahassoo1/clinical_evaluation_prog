DOCTOR: Hi Julie, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, honestly, I haven’t the time for this. But my housekeeper insisted. Something about not being able to…see or hear properly. It came on quite suddenly, you understand. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds a bit concerning that things came on so suddenly. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's been happening. When you say not being able to see or hear properly, can you tell me more specifically what you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Specifics? Honestly, it's rather obvious, isn't it? I can’t see things clearly, and sounds are…muffled. Like someone put cotton in my ears. I don’t need a detailed examination to tell you that. It’s just… inconvenient. When did it start? Goodness, I haven’t the faintest. A few days ago, perhaps? It all feels rather…blur together, you understand. I have a great deal on my mind.
DOCTOR: I completely understand it can be frustrating when things aren’t clear, and having a lot on your mind certainly doesn't help. It is good we’re checking it out, though, as sudden changes in vision or hearing can sometimes indicate something important. “A few days ago” is helpful. Has it been getting progressively worse, or has it stayed about the same since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Progressively worse? I suppose…a little. Though honestly, I haven’t been actively paying attention. I have a very important gala to plan, doctor. These things simply aren't a priority. It’s just…dimmer, I think. And the sounds…further away. Is that a sufficient description for you? Really, I’d prefer a quick diagnosis and a swift solution.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly sufficient, Julie. “Dimmer” and “further away” gives me a better idea. And I appreciate you telling me about the gala – it helps me understand what’s important for you right now. Okay, let’s do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. It won’t take long. I'm going to check your vision and hearing, and then we can talk about what might be going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Must we? I really don't have the time for…tests. But if it will hasten this process, I suppose. Just…be quick about it. And please, no complicated jargon. I haven't the patience for medical explanations.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll keep it as quick and straightforward as possible. No complicated jargon, I promise. Let's start with your vision. Could you please stand about ten feet away from the chart and read the smallest line you can see clearly?
PATIENT: Ten feet? Really. Very well. Honestly, these letters are terribly small. E… uh… P… T… Oh, goodness, this is dreadful. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. It is helpful to see how well you're able to read at a distance. It appears you have some difficulty with the smaller letters. Now, let’s just quickly check your ears. I’m going to gently place this instrument into your ear canal to see if there's anything blocking your hearing. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if it feels painful. I'll start with your right ear.
PATIENT: Oh, dear! That’s rather…intrusive. Be careful! My ears are very sensitive. Is something wrong? You’re poking around in there for quite a while. Honestly, I feel like I’m at a mechanic’s.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that was uncomfortable, Julie. I was just taking a look inside your ear canal. I don't see any obvious blockages, like wax buildup. However, your eardrum appears a little…dull in color, and isn't moving as much as it should when I blow a puff of air into your ear. The left ear looks similar to the right. Now, let’s do a very quick test to see how well you hear different sounds. I’m going to ask you to raise your hand when you hear a beep. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A dull eardrum? Is that bad? Honestly, you’re not telling me anything concrete. And a beep test? Really? This is utterly ridiculous. But fine, a beep test. Get it over with. But if it takes long, I’m leaving. I have a luncheon appointment, you know.
DOCTOR: A dull eardrum can sometimes indicate fluid behind the eardrum, which can affect your hearing. That's why I want to do a quick test to see if it's impacting your ability to hear different sounds. It will only take a minute or two. Okay, Julie, I’m going to make some beeping sounds. Just raise your hand whenever you hear one, no matter how faint. Ready?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let's just get this over with. There. I heard something. Is that good enough? Honestly, this is most undignified. And terribly boring. I do hope this doesn’t take much longer. It’s bad enough my hearing is going, I don’t need to sit here listening to beeps all afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. It seems you have some difficulty hearing higher-pitched sounds, particularly in both ears. Alright, that’s enough for now. Based on the exam and the quick hearing test, it appears you have some hearing loss, and potentially some fluid buildup behind your eardrums. This could be due to a number of things, like a cold, allergies, or even age-related changes. I'm not able to give you a definitive diagnosis right now without further testing. However, I recommend a tympanometry test to see if there is fluid buildup and a referral to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Further testing? A referral? Honestly! This is precisely what I feared. More appointments, more poking and prodding… It’s simply inconvenient. Look, doctor, is this serious? Will I go deaf? Because if it’s nothing serious, I’d rather just ignore it. I have a gala to plan, you know. And frankly, I haven’t time for all of this medical…fuss. Just tell me if it’s something I need to worry about or not. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Julie, and I want to assure you that I’m not trying to add to your stress. It's good you asked if it’s serious. Based on what I’ve seen today, it doesn’t sound like you're in immediate danger of going deaf. However, hearing loss can significantly impact your quality of life if left untreated, and it’s best to get it properly evaluated. The tympanometry test is a quick, painless procedure that measures how well your eardrum moves, which will help determine if there's fluid buildup. The audiologist can then perform a more detailed hearing test to see exactly what frequencies you’re having trouble with, and recommend appropriate solutions, like hearing aids if needed. I can write you a referral to a highly recommended audiologist, and schedule the tympanometry test for you here at the clinic. We can also discuss some strategies to protect your hearing in the meantime, like avoiding loud noises. Would you be open to that?
