DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I believe you have my file? I requested some… paperwork. About planning for, well, the inevitable. My husband thought it best to get things in order. It’s rather… distasteful to discuss, but I suppose necessary. I was hoping to get one of those forms – an Advance Directive, I think it was called? Or perhaps a POLST? He mentioned something about both.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do have your file here, Marija. I see the request for advanced care planning documents – both an Advance Directive and a POLST form. It’s very responsible of you and your husband to think about this now. It is a difficult conversation, and you're right, it's necessary. To make sure we get you the right information and forms, and to help you understand what each one does, could you tell me a little bit about why you're interested in these forms now?
PATIENT: Honestly? My husband is… overly cautious. He worries about everything. He read an article, naturally. Something about people not being able to make decisions for themselves, and the chaos it causes. He’s convinced I’ll end up… incapacitated, and everyone will fight over what they think I’d want. It’s ridiculous, really. I’m perfectly healthy. But he’s… insistent. And frankly, it’s easier to just comply than to argue. Though, I would like to understand what exactly I’m signing. It’s not as if I want to be kept alive by machines if there’s truly no hope, but I also don’t want anyone making rash decisions for me before it's absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your husband is motivated by a desire to protect you and avoid difficult situations, even if it’s causing you some stress. And it’s very wise of you to want to be fully informed before making any decisions. Let’s clarify the difference between an Advance Directive and a POLST form. An Advance Directive, also called a living will, outlines your wishes for medical care in general if you become unable to speak for yourself. It covers a broad range of potential situations. A POLST, or Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, is a more specific document. It’s a medical order, based on your current health status and wishes, that tells healthcare providers what treatments you want or don't want right now. It’s typically used for people with serious illnesses or who are frail. Before we focus on the forms themselves, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, as I said, I am perfectly healthy. I do have… occasional migraines, but those are manageable with a good lie-down and a darkened room. And my knees ache a bit in the winter, but who doesn’t have aching knees? I exercise regularly – I walk every morning, and I do some light gardening. I eat a reasonably balanced diet, though I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. I’ve never had any serious illnesses, no surgeries, no major injuries. Honestly, Doctor, I find this entire conversation rather… unnecessary. But if you insist, I suppose I’ve given you a sufficient overview. Are we getting closer to actually obtaining the paperwork now? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your thoroughness, Marija, and I understand your frustration. It is a bit unusual to be discussing advance care planning with someone in seemingly perfect health, but as you said, it's better to be prepared. And you're right, we are getting closer to the paperwork. Just to be thorough, and for the record, let’s quickly go through a standard review of systems. This just helps me get a complete picture. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather tedious. I assure you, my weight is perfectly stable. Perhaps a pound or two fluctuation, as one would expect, but nothing significant. I maintain a consistent wardrobe, if that provides any reassurance. I am not wasting away, nor am I suddenly expanding. Is this truly necessary for a form? I am perfectly capable of articulating my wishes when – and if – the need arises. I find this level of scrutiny… insulting, frankly.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question this level of detail, Marija. I apologize if I'm causing you frustration. It’s standard practice to gather this information, but I can certainly streamline the process if you're feeling it’s unnecessary. We can focus on your stated good health and proceed directly to discussing your wishes regarding an Advance Directive and POLST form. Before we do that, just one more quick question, to cover all bases. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Fine. No allergies. None whatsoever. Not to penicillin, not to shellfish, not to pollen, not to dust, not to cats, not to anything. I’ve lived a relatively unremarkable life, free from allergic reactions. Are we finally reaching the point where I can sign something and be done with this? My husband will be expecting an update. He’s… quite insistent on these things, as I’ve mentioned. I trust you have the forms readily available? And that they aren't excessively complicated? I have no patience for bureaucratic nonsense.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No allergies – that’s good to know. And you are right to be concerned about complexity. I have both the Advance Directive and POLST forms here. They are fairly straightforward, but we will go through them together, section by section, and I’ll explain anything that’s unclear. First, let’s discuss the Advance Directive. This form allows you to appoint a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions for you if you’re unable to do so yourself. Do you already have someone in mind for this role?
PATIENT: Naturally. My husband, of course. Who else would it be? He's... very organized, very meticulous, and he has a… strong opinion on everything. He’s already drafted a list of potential scenarios and corresponding actions, I’m sure. Though, I must admit, some of his suggestions are rather… extreme. But that’s just him being thorough. I suppose. Yes, my husband. He is perfectly capable of handling such matters. Though, I do hope he won't consult with his sister. She's… rather opinionated as well, and prone to exaggeration.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you have someone you trust, and that your husband is prepared to take on this responsibility. It’s also helpful to know about his sister – we can certainly note your preference regarding consultation. The next section of the Advance Directive outlines your wishes regarding specific medical treatments. This includes things like life-sustaining treatments, pain management, and end-of-life care. Do you have any initial thoughts on these types of treatments?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve always believed in a… dignified end. I don’t wish to be kept alive artificially if there is truly no hope. No machines, no tubes, no prolonged suffering. I’ve seen enough of that in films, thank you very much. I’d prefer a peaceful transition, surrounded by loved ones. And adequate pain management, naturally. I’m not particularly fond of pain. But I also don’t want to be… drugged into oblivion. A clear head is important, even in such circumstances. As for the specifics… I suppose my husband has already compiled a rather extensive list. He’s very thorough, as I’ve mentioned repeatedly. Do I need to reiterate everything he's already prepared? This is becoming rather redundant.
DOCTOR: You’ve articulated your wishes very clearly, Marija. And no, you don’t need to reiterate anything your husband has already prepared. We can certainly review his list, but it’s helpful to have a general understanding of your preferences first. Given your wishes, and considering your overall good health, it sounds like a POLST form may not be necessary at this time. It’s typically used for people with serious illnesses or who are frail. An Advance Directive, outlining your wishes and appointing your husband as your healthcare proxy, would likely be sufficient. Would you like me to bring up the Advance Directive form now, and we can begin reviewing it together?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes, let’s get on with it then. The Advance Directive. Honestly, Doctor, I still find this whole process rather… unsettling. But if it appeases my husband, and allows me to finally put this matter to rest, then so be it. Bring up the form. And please, let’s keep it brief. I have a luncheon appointment this afternoon. I trust it won’t take too long? And do try to avoid any unnecessary jargon. I'm a literature teacher, not a medical professional.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. We’ll keep it brief, and I’ll avoid any jargon. I will explain everything in plain language. And I assure you, we’ll move at your pace. This first section is about appointing your healthcare proxy. As you mentioned, you’ve chosen your husband. Here, it simply asks for his full name, address, and phone number. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. His name is Omar Chilla. The address is 14 Rue Jasmin, Marrakech, Morocco. And his phone number is… Oh dear. I haven't memorized his new number. He changed it last month. It's… let me see… Ah, here we are. It's +212 661-234-5678. Yes, that’s correct. Do you need his email address as well? He's quite adept at using technology, though he does occasionally fall victim to phishing scams.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, his email address would be helpful, just for additional contact. Okay, next section. This is where you can outline your wishes regarding specific medical treatments. It covers things like CPR, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. Do you have any specific preferences regarding these types of treatments?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, as I said before, no machines. Absolutely no machines. No prolonged life support. No artificial anything. If my time has come, then let it come naturally. I do not wish to be kept alive artificially, regardless of the circumstances. As for CPR… well, if my heart stops, then let it stop. I’m not particularly fond of broken ribs, and I’ve heard it’s quite painful. I’d prefer a peaceful passing, with dignity and grace. Is that clear enough? Do I need to elaborate further? My husband has a rather detailed document outlining my preferences, if you’d prefer to consult that. He’s very thorough, as you know. It covers everything from organ donation to funeral arrangements. It’s quite… comprehensive.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly clear, Marija. "No machines, no prolonged life support, no artificial anything, and no CPR." I’ve documented that. And we can certainly review your husband’s detailed document if you’d like, but I think we’ve captured the essence of your wishes. The next section is about your values and beliefs regarding end-of-life care. It’s an open-ended section where you can express any specific preferences or concerns. Do you have anything you’d like to add here?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose I would like to be surrounded by loved ones, if possible. My husband, of course. And perhaps my sister, if she’s not being too… difficult. I’d prefer a quiet and peaceful environment, with some soft music. And perhaps a vase of fresh flowers. I've always enjoyed a good floral arrangement. As for religious considerations… I'm not particularly devout, but a brief prayer wouldn't hurt. And I’d prefer a dignified burial, with a simple headstone. No extravagant displays, please. I’m not one for ostentation. Is that sufficient? Do I need to provide a list of my favorite hymns? This is becoming rather tedious, don’t you think? I have a luncheon appointment, you know.
DOCTOR: That is perfect, Marija. “Surrounded by loved ones, soft music, fresh flowers, a brief prayer, and a dignified burial.” I’ve documented all of that. And no need for a list of hymns. Now, the final section is the signature and date. This confirms that you’ve read and understand the document and that your wishes are legally binding. Would you like me to read it over with you one last time before you sign?
PATIENT: No, no. That won’t be necessary. I’ve already told you everything. And frankly, I’m rather eager to be done with this. It’s… unsettling, to contemplate such matters. Just… present me with the pen. And let’s get this over with. Hopefully, I won't have to think about this again. My husband will be thrilled, of course. He's always been the practical one. Though, I do hope he doesn't try to add any more stipulations. He's rather… thorough, as you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Here’s the signed copy for your records. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or if your wishes change in the future. We’re here to support you and your husband. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. Thank you for your patience. And for putting up with my… fussiness. Hopefully, this document will suffice to appease my husband. And allow me to finally enjoy my luncheon in peace.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marija. It was my pleasure. Enjoy your luncheon, and please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a wonderful day.
