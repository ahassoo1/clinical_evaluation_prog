DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, my blood pressure's been actin' up again. Been high for a spell now, and my regular doctor told me to come see someone here. Didn't say much else, just said I needed a check-up for it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. It's good to meet you as well. I understand your regular doctor referred you in regarding your blood pressure. That’s certainly a good reason to get things checked out. To start, can you tell me a little more about what "actin' up" means?
PATIENT: Well, I get these headaches, mostly in the back of my neck. And sometimes I feel dizzy, just a little off-balance. It ain't constant, comes and goes. Mostly when I'm tryin' to do somethin', like bakin' – which is most of the time, ya know? Makes it hard to concentrate. And my daughter, bless her heart, she keeps tellin' me my face looks kinda red sometimes. She worries somethin' fierce.
DOCTOR: I see. Headaches in the back of the neck, occasional dizziness, and your daughter noticing some redness in your face – that gives us a good starting point. It's good you have someone looking out for you. To get a better picture, can you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's been… a few months now, I reckon. Maybe three or four? It started kinda slow, just a little tired feelin' more than usual. Then the headaches started, and the dizziness come along after. It's been gettin' worse lately, that's for sure. Hard to say exactly when, old age makes it hard to remember dates, ya know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Venna. Dates can certainly become less clear as time goes on. A few months, gradually worsening – that’s helpful. Now, do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings were when your regular doctor was concerned?
PATIENT: No, I don't. They just called and said I needed to come see someone. Never gave me numbers or nothin'. I asked, but they said the specialist would tell me. I ain't one for numbers much anyway. Just tell me if it's bad, that's all I need to know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venna. We’ll certainly figure things out. Not having specific numbers is not a problem, we can check it here today. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any other medical problems in the past, like diabetes, heart trouble, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had a bit of arthritis in my hands for a long time, but that's mostly managed now with some cream. Other than that, nothin' major. My mama had a weak heart, but I've always felt pretty strong, knock on wood. Never been one to sit still long enough to have trouble, ya know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the arthritis, and good that it's managed. And that’s interesting to hear about your mother’s heart. It’s helpful to have that family history. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything besides the arthritis?
PATIENT: No, not really. When I was a young girl, I broke my arm fallin' outta a tree, but that's it. Just a little cast, healed up quick. Never been one for hospitals, if I can help it. Prefer to stay home and bake, that's where I'm happiest.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Venna. No significant surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, do you take any medications currently – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just some ibuprofen for my hands when they're achin' real bad. And a little vitamin D in the winter, cause the sun don't shine much then. That's about it. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. My grandma used to say they just mask the problem, don't fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference to avoid medications when possible, Venna. Ibuprofen as needed for your hands and some vitamin D – that's good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to nothin'. I eat just about anything. Though I don’t much care for okra, but that ain't an allergy, just a dislike!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Venna. No known allergies. Alright, thank you for answering all those questions. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your eyes and ears. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Get it over with, I got pies to bake! Just don't take too long, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venna. Won’t be long at all. Okay, Venna, everything seems to be functioning, but your blood pressure is quite elevated. I also noticed a slightly stronger sound when listening to your heart. Your eyes show some changes consistent with long-standing hypertension. I want to be thorough, so I’d like to order some blood tests and an EKG to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests and… what was that other thing? Sounds complicated. Look, Doc, is it bad? Is it somethin' serious? I just want to know if I can still bake my pies.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Venna. It's completely natural to feel worried when you hear about tests and elevated readings. The EKG is a simple, painless test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us see if the elevated blood pressure has affected it in any way. Your blood pressure is higher than we’d like it to be, and that’s why we need to investigate further. It could be serious if left untreated, as it can increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney problems. But we're catching it now, and with proper management, we can work to get it under control. Right now, I can’t give you a definitive diagnosis without the results of the tests, but it's looking like we're dealing with high blood pressure – what we call hypertension. As for your pies… We want to keep you healthy so you can keep baking them for many years to come. The tests will help us figure out the best way to do that. Would you be willing to let me order those tests?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Tests it is. Just get it over with. But no funny business, Doctor. And tell me straight if I gotta stop bakin'. I need to know. Where do I go for these tests?
DOCTOR: I understand, Venna. No funny business, I promise. I will tell you straight what’s going on, and we will make decisions together. You’ll need to go to the lab down the hall – room 203. They’ll draw some blood, and then the technician will perform the EKG right there. It should take about an hour or so. I'll have the results sent to me, and I’ll give you a call as soon as I’ve reviewed them – probably within a day or two. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend some lifestyle changes to help lower your blood pressure. Reducing salt intake, eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and getting regular exercise can make a big difference. I also recommend avoiding stress as much as possible. Here's a written order for the lab tests, and a handout with information about managing high blood pressure. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… less salt… I reckon I use a good bit of salt in my pies. But alright. I can try. Stress, though… that’s a hard one. No, I don’t think so. Just… call me when you know somethin'. And please, Doc, be honest with me. I just want to keep bakin' my pies. Alright, I'll be goin' now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. I will be honest with you. And we will work together to find the best way to keep you healthy and baking your pies. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before I call you with the results. Have a good day, and try not to stress too much. I’ll be in touch soon. .
