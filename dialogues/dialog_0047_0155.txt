DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this… shaking. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. Been getting worse lately, makes things… difficult. Can't really hold a cup steady anymore, you know? Honestly, I just want to get this sorted if we can.
DOCTOR: Hmm, shaking, you say. And it’s primarily in your hands. And you've noticed it's been worsening recently, impacting your ability to hold things… like a cup. Right. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this shaking?
PATIENT: When did I first notice… Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. It feels like… a long time. Maybe a year or so ago? It started small, just a little tremble when I was tired, I think. I worked at the plant for… well, a long time, so my hands weren’t always the steadiest, even then. It’s hard to say exactly when it started getting worse though. Everything feels a bit blurry these days, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: A year ago, starting subtly and gradually worsening. And you mentioned working at the plant… What kind of work did you do there, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: The water plant, yes. I was an operator, mostly. Making sure everything ran smoothly, checking the levels, cleaning things… all sorts of things. It was a good job, kept me busy. For… a long time. I retired a few years back now, maybe five? Six? It all runs together, you see.
DOCTOR: Right, water plant operator for many years, retired five or six years ago. And this shaking… does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Well… stress, I think. When I get nervous, it’s worse. And… when I try to do something precise. Like, if I’m trying to button my shirt, or pour a glass of water… that’s when it’s really noticeable. Just trying to concentrate on doing something fiddly seems to make it worse. It's frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: So, exacerbated by stress and tasks requiring fine motor skills. Do you notice it at rest, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: At rest…? What do you mean? Like, when I’m just… sitting? Hmm. I hadn’t really thought about it. I suppose… sometimes. A little bit. It’s not as bad when I’m doing something, like I said. Mostly it’s when I try to do something that it gets bad. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. So, it's more pronounced with action. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Oh dear. Let me think. I’ve been a bit… forgetful lately, if that counts. Like I was saying before, things are blurry. And my… legs feel a little stiff sometimes, getting up from a chair. Nothing major, just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness and some stiffness in your legs. And how would you rate your balance, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: My balance… hmm. It’s not bad, exactly. But I wouldn’t say it’s fantastic either. I’ve stumbled a couple of times recently, nothing serious, just a bit wobbly. I try to be careful. It’s probably just getting old, you know? Everything’s a bit slower these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, some imbalance, with occasional stumbling. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. I had the flu a few times, of course. And… my blood pressure was a little high for a while, but they gave me some pills for that, years ago. I don’t take them anymore. I think that was it. Nothing major. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years, to be honest.
DOCTOR: History of hypertension, managed with medication in the past, but currently not taking any medications. Any surgeries or hospitalizations that you can recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. That’s about it, I think. No major hospital stays, thankfully. I always tried to stay healthy, you know? Kept busy, didn’t sit around much.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy in youth, no other significant surgical history. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother had arthritis, I think. Badly, in her hands. And my father… well, he just got old, you know? He was a strong man, but he just slowed down eventually. I don’t really remember any other major illnesses in the family, to be honest. They weren't really ones for talking about health problems.
DOCTOR: History of arthritis in mother, no other significant family medical history reported. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, never smoked. Never liked the smell of it. Always thought it was a foolish habit. My wife… she tried it for a while, but she gave it up years ago. No, I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life.
DOCTOR: No history of smoking. Do you drink alcohol, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Just a little. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that's it. Nothing heavy. I wouldn't say I drink, exactly. It's more of a… habit. An old man's habit, you might say. I haven't had a drink in a couple of weeks though.
DOCTOR: Occasional alcohol use, currently abstaining. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. I don't think so. I haven't had any trouble with medications before, as far as I can remember. I’m not really one for taking pills, you see. Just the blood pressure ones for a while, years ago. But no, I don't think I have any allergies. Honestly, I’m just trying to get to the bottom of this shaking, if you can help.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for that information. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll check your reflexes, your coordination, and a few other things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to know what’s causing this. The sooner the better, if you ask me. Let’s get on with it, shall we?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit here for me, please. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Everything sounds clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Good, good. A little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, let’s look at your hands. Can you hold your arms out in front of you like this?
PATIENT: Like this? Yes, it’s worse when I try to hold them steady. See? It's a bit like… a little buzzing. It’s not constant, but it’s definitely there. It makes it hard to pour a cup of tea, you know? It spills everywhere.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the tremor. It’s present both at rest and with movement, though more pronounced with action. Now, can you touch your nose with your finger like this?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… difficult. I used to be able to do this easily. It feels like my hand has a mind of its own. It’s not… smooth, you see? A bit jerky.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, can you try to touch your heel to your shin like this?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s… tricky. I’m a bit wobbly, you see? It’s not as easy as it used to be. Honestly, I’m not very good at this, Doctor. I’m just an old man.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Jezik. It’s perfectly understandable. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs again. Everything still sounds clear. I also want to check your gait – how you walk. Would you mind walking a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Just a few steps? Alright. Like this? A bit slow, I suppose. Getting old, you know. It's hard to keep a good pace.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. A slightly shuffling gait with reduced arm swing. Now, if you could sit back down for me. Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you. That’s all I need for the physical exam for now. Based on your history and the exam findings, I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, it’s too early to say for sure. We need to rule out other possibilities and confirm the diagnosis with further testing.
PATIENT: Parkinson’s… disease? Oh dear. Is that… serious, Doctor? What sort of testing do you mean? And… what does this mean for me? I just want to be able to hold a cup of tea without spilling it, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Jezik. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. It can cause tremors, stiffness, slowness of movement, and balance problems – symptoms you’ve been describing. It is a serious condition, but it’s also highly treatable, especially when diagnosed early. As for testing, I’d like to order a DAT scan – a type of imaging test that can help assess dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical messenger that plays a crucial role in movement, and lower levels are often seen in Parkinson’s disease. I also want to rule out other causes of your symptoms with blood tests. We’ll start with those tests, and then we can discuss treatment options, which may include medication and physical therapy. It’s important to remember that every case is different, and we’ll tailor a plan specifically for you. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: A scan… and blood tests… Oh dear. It sounds… complicated. Will the medication… stop it? Will I… get worse, no matter what? And… what about holding a cup of tea? Is there anything I can do… now?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Mr. Jezik. The medication won’t stop the disease from progressing, unfortunately. However, it can significantly manage your symptoms – reducing tremors, stiffness, and improving your overall quality of life. We can adjust the dosage and type of medication over time to find what works best for you. As for getting worse, progression rates vary significantly from person to person. Some people experience slow progression, while others may experience more rapid changes. We’ll monitor your condition closely and adjust our approach as needed. And regarding holding a cup of tea… Physical therapy can help improve your coordination and strength, which may make it easier to perform everyday tasks like that. There are also adaptive devices, like weighted utensils or cups with handles, that can provide support. We can discuss those options further. In the meantime, try to avoid rushing and take your time. We’ll take this one step at a time. First, we’ll get the results of the tests, and then we can develop a comprehensive plan tailored to your needs. I'm also happy to refer you to a neurologist for a second opinion, if you'd like. Do you want to schedule the tests now?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… and special cups… that sounds… helpful. A neurologist… yes, perhaps. It’s good to know there are options. Yes, let’s schedule the tests, Doctor. The sooner we know… the better. I just want to be able to enjoy a cup of tea without spilling it, you know? It’s a small thing, but… it matters.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Jezik. It’s the small things that often matter the most. Okay, I’m scheduling you for a DAT scan next week, on Tuesday at 9 am. I’ll also order the blood tests, and you can get those done at the lab down the street any time this week. I’ll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results once they’re available. Here's a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a neurologist in town. She's excellent. Do you have any questions about the tests or the appointments?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 9… alright. I can manage that. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s… comforting to know there are people who understand.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. That’s what I’m here for. Remember, we'll take this one step at a time. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. My assistant will be in touch to confirm everything. For now, just try to take things easy and focus on taking care of yourself. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. Thank you again for your time and your kindness. I appreciate it more than you know. I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I’ll see you next week. Take care. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
