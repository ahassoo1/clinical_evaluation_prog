DOCTOR: Hi Venus, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I am… concerned about my memory. It is… not what it was. I find I… forget things. Small things, mostly, but it worries me. I am Venus Alvara. And today is August 2nd, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is August 2nd. And it’s perfectly alright to be concerned, Venus. It's good you're addressing this. "Small things" can be important. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about what kinds of things you're forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… difficult to explain. Not… appointments, usually. I keep very good records for my properties. No, it is… names, sometimes. Or where I put my glasses. Things like that. I remember when I put them down, but not where. And… words. Sometimes the right word escapes me. It is… frustrating. I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me some time ago. Could it be that?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Names, misplaced items, trouble finding words… those are all things we want to explore. And yes, high blood pressure can absolutely be a factor, along with a lot of other things. Let’s get a bit more detail. You mentioned remembering when you put your glasses down – is that a recent change, or has that always been how you recall things?
PATIENT: It is… more recent, I think. Perhaps the last… six months? Before that, I simply remembered where. Now, the when is very clear, but the where… it is like a blank space. And it is not every time, Doctor. Some days are better than others. It is… unpredictable. I worry it is something serious. My husband… he passed five years ago. He always remembered everything. I feel… less myself.
DOCTOR: I understand that’s very unsettling, Venus, and it's completely valid to feel worried. Losing those abilities, and feeling like yourself is changing... that’s tough. The unpredictability is something we’ll want to pay attention to. Six months is a good timeframe to work with. Okay, let's try to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any changes in other areas besides memory?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I… do not believe so. I still manage my properties, all five of them. The tenants… they are sometimes difficult, but I handle them. I cook, I clean, I… I go to church on Sundays. My appetite is good, I sleep… mostly well. No dizziness, no headaches. I am… still myself, I believe. Just… with gaps. Small gaps, but they are… worrying. I do not want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're still managing everything, and that your appetite and sleep are good. And no dizziness or headaches is helpful information. “Small gaps” is a good way to describe it, and I appreciate you being so clear. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions that might seem a little… basic, but it helps me get a baseline understanding. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Ask me anything you need to know. I understand. It is good to be thorough. I… I just want to understand what is happening. And if it can be fixed, I would be most grateful.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. Okay, first, can you tell me the current year?
PATIENT: The current year? It is… 2025. August 2nd, 2025. I keep a calendar, you see. Very important for the properties. And… church events.
DOCTOR: That’s right, good. And who is the current president of the United States?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a difficult question. I… I try not to follow politics too closely. It is… upsetting, usually. Let me think… Is it… Biden? Yes, I believe it is Biden. Is that correct? I read it in the newspaper, perhaps a month ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Okay, good. Let's switch gears a little. Have you noticed any changes in your mood?
PATIENT: My mood? No, I do not think so. I am… sad, sometimes. Because of my husband. Five years is a long time. But… not more sad than usual. I am… a practical woman. I keep busy. Worrying does not solve anything. I find comfort in my routine. And… in helping others. I volunteer at the church, you see. I… I do not dwell on things. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Venus. It sounds like you have very healthy coping mechanisms. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. You mentioned high blood pressure. Are you currently taking any medications for that or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take… Lisinopril, I believe it is called. One pill, every morning. And… sometimes, for my arthritis in my knees. Ibuprofen, when it is bad. But not every day. Just when I need it. And… nothing else. I try to avoid medication when possible. It is… not good for the body, usually. I prefer herbal teas, when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and ibuprofen as needed. Good. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have no allergies. None that I know of, at least. I eat everything. I… grew up on a farm, you see. We ate everything we grew. And… I have never had a reaction to any medication. I… I am very careful about what I put in my body. I… I believe in moderation. And… in fresh air.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Venus, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment – just to check your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Do whatever you need to do. I… I trust your judgment. I… I just want to know what is happening. And… if it can be fixed. I… I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes… Good. No obvious deficits there. Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination seems fine. I’m also going to quickly check your gait – could you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that… alright, Doctor? I… I sometimes feel a little unsteady on my feet. Especially when I stand up quickly. But… I manage. It is… just a little dizziness, sometimes. I… I am careful not to fall. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful to know. You're right to be careful. Your gait is a little slow, and there’s a slight hesitancy, but nothing immediately concerning. Okay, Venus. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, I think it’s important to rule out a few things. We need to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to order some blood work - a complete metabolic panel and a thyroid panel - to check your overall health and rule out any underlying imbalances. And, given your concerns about memory, I'm going to recommend a cognitive assessment – a simple test that can help us assess your thinking and memory skills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Blood work and… a cognitive assessment. I… I am happy to do whatever you think is best. I… I want to understand what is happening. And… if it can be fixed, I would be most grateful. When will I know the results? And… will it be painful? I… I do not like needles. But… I will endure, if necessary. I… I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, and I assure you the blood draw will be as quick and painless as possible. The cognitive assessment is completely non-invasive – it's just a series of questions and tasks, like remembering a list of words or drawing a clock. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you continue with your routine – stay active, keep your mind engaged, and make sure you're getting enough sleep. Given your history of high blood pressure, it's important to make sure it's well-controlled. I'd also like you to keep a daily log of your memory lapses – what you're forgetting, when it happens, and any potential triggers you notice. That will give us more information to work with. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… manageable. A daily log… I can do that. I… I keep records for my properties, so it is not a difficult habit to form. And… I will continue with my routine. Stay active, keep my mind engaged, and get enough sleep. I… I will do my best. And… I will wait for the results. Three to five business days… I understand. Is there… anything else I need to do? Or… anything I should be worried about? I… I worry sometimes. But… I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, you’ve covered everything perfectly. Just try not to worry too much – we’re just gathering information at this point. It's good that you’re already proactive about keeping records. I’m going to give you a form with instructions for the cognitive assessment and a log for your memory lapses. My nurse will also give you a requisition for the blood work. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re taking this one step at a time, Venus. And I want you to know I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I believe you have answered all of my questions. I… I appreciate your kindness and… your patience. I… I am grateful for your help. I… I will wait for the results. And… I will keep the log. Thank you. I… I think that is all. I… I should probably be going now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venus. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I'm glad you came in. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any questions at all. Take care, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
