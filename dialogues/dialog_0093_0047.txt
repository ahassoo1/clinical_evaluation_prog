DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, my daughter, she set this up. Something about… insurance? Long-term care, I think she said. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details. She said it was important, though. I just… want to make sure I’m doing what I need to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. It’s common for these things to be a bit confusing, and it’s very responsible of you to be proactive about your health. Your daughter is wise to encourage this. So, to clarify, you were prompted to come in today primarily due to concerns about long-term care planning and ensuring you are taking appropriate steps?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. She’s a good girl, my daughter. Always lookin’ out for me. I… I used to be pretty sharp, but things get fuzzy now, you know? It’s just… been a while since I had to think about stuff like this. I mostly just… work. And try to keep busy.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rover. It's natural for memory to shift as we age, and focusing on daily life is important. We'll take things at your pace today. To get a better understanding of your overall health and what might be relevant to long-term care planning, perhaps we could start with a bit of your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Medical history… hmm. Well, I’ve broken a few bones workin’ – mostly just sprains and stuff, nothin’ too serious. And I had my appendix out when I was a kid. A long time ago. Other than that… I don’t really go to the doctor much. I try to avoid it, if I can. Not a fan of hospitals.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Rover. It's good to know you generally stay healthy and avoid medical intervention when possible. Do you recall approximately when you had your appendix removed?
PATIENT: Uh… golly. That was… a long time ago. I was maybe… eight? Nine? It was before my dad passed, definitely. So… probably… the early sixties? I’m not good with dates, Doc. Sorry. It was a small hospital, back then. Not like these fancy places now.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. An approximate date is very helpful. And you mentioned some sprains from work – could you tell me a little more about the type of work you do?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. I mostly load and unload… freight. Boats come into the harbor, and I get it moved. Boxes, crates, you name it. Heavy lifting, mostly. Been doin’ it for… well, a long time. Since I was a young man. It’s hard work, but it keeps me movin’. Used to be more people doin’ it, but now… it’s just a few of us.
DOCTOR: I see. That is physically demanding work, Mr. Rover. Have you experienced any injuries related to that work in recent years – anything beyond the sprains you mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my back… it gets sore sometimes. Real sore. Especially after a long day. And my knees… they ache. It’s just… gettin’ old, I guess. I take some over-the-counter pain pills when it gets bad, but… that’s about it. Nothin’ a good night’s sleep won’t fix, usually.
DOCTOR: I understand. Back and knee pain with physically demanding work is not uncommon. Do you take those pain pills regularly, or only as needed when the pain flares up?
PATIENT: Only when it flares up, Doc. I try not to take ‘em too much. Don’t like feelin’ all… foggy. Maybe once or twice a week, if I’ve had a really hard day. Just enough to get me through. My daughter… she worries about it, though. Says I should see a doctor about it.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re mindful of the side effects of medication, Mr. Rover. And it sounds like your daughter has your best interests at heart. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you may have, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Well… I got high blood pressure, the Doc told me a few years back. I take a little white pill for that every day. Can’t remember the name of it. And… oh, my eyesight ain’t what it used to be, that’s why I got these glasses. Other than that… I think that’s about it. I used to smoke, but I quit about ten years ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rover. That’s very helpful. Do you happen to know the dosage of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Golly, no. I just take one every morning. The little bottle says… uh… hold on… …It says “Lisinopril” on it. And the number… it says “10mg”. Is that what you need to know? I don’t usually pay much attention to those numbers. My wife… she used to handle all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Mr. Rover. Thank you for looking that up for me. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don’t think I got any… serious allergies. I used to get a little itchy when I was around cats, but that was when I was a kid. And… oh! I can’t eat shellfish. Makes me real sick. Real, real sick. Broke out in hives once, and had to go to the hospital. Haven’t touched it since.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rover. A shellfish allergy is important to know. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… my mom, she had… heart trouble. Real bad heart trouble. She passed away when I was pretty young. And my dad… he had diabetes. He lost his leg, because of it. My sister… she’s still livin’, but she’s got arthritis. Real bad arthritis. She can barely walk. Other than that… I don’t really know much about my family history. My wife… she was the one who kept track of all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rover. That's helpful information to have. A family history of heart trouble, diabetes, and arthritis is important to consider. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doc. I told ya, I quit smokin’ ten years ago. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer now and then, with dinner. Just one. And I definitely don’t use any of them… recreational drugs. Never have. Never will. I’m a simple man, Doc. I just like to work and keep busy.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Rover. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important. Now, to get a complete picture, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. I guess. Just… try not to poke too much. Old bones, ya know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rover. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your history. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to briefly examine your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t feel any masses or abnormalities. Finally, I’d like to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, your physical examination is unremarkable, but your blood pressure is something we'll want to monitor. Now, do you have any questions for me before we move on?
PATIENT: Well… that don’t sound too bad, I guess. A little high blood pressure, but… nothin’ I didn’t already know. Um… what does all this mean, Doc? What are we tryin’ to figure out, exactly? My daughter just said somethin’ about… “long-term care” and “insurance.” I’m just worried about… losin’ my independence, I guess. I still wanna be able to work, as long as I can.
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable concern, Mr. Rover. Your daughter is right to be proactive. Essentially, long-term care planning is about preparing for potential future needs, should you require assistance with daily activities like bathing, dressing, or managing medications. It can involve exploring options for assisted living, in-home care, or nursing home facilities. As for your insurance, we’re assessing your overall health to determine if you qualify for any policies that could help cover those costs, should they become necessary. Right now, given your blood pressure and family history, it’s important to ensure it remains well-controlled. We can discuss lifestyle modifications – like diet and exercise – and potentially adjust your medication if needed. The goal isn't to take away your independence, but to preserve it for as long as possible by proactively addressing potential health concerns. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah… that makes a little more sense, I guess. So, it’s not like… they’re gonna take my tools away and put me in a home right away? I still got work to do! And… what about my knees? Can you do somethin’ about my knees? They ache real bad after a long day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Mr. Rover. No one is talking about taking your tools away. This is about planning for the future, not restricting your present life. You’re perfectly capable and active, and we want to keep it that way. Now, regarding your knees, that's something we can definitely address. Given the aching after work, it sounds like you might be experiencing some osteoarthritis – wear and tear on the joint. We can start with some conservative measures, such as over-the-counter pain relievers, physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knees, and possibly injections to reduce inflammation. If those don't provide sufficient relief, we could discuss other options, such as a referral to an orthopedist for further evaluation. I'm going to write a prescription for a stronger anti-inflammatory medication for your pain, and I'll give you a handout with some exercises you can do at home. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to see how you’re doing and discuss the possibility of a referral if needed. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Thank you. A little somethin’ for the knees would be mighty nice. And… thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. I still don’t understand all of it, but… it’s better than not knowin’ at all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. I’m glad I could help. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, and you can always reach out with any questions or concerns that come up. I'm going to have my nurse print out those exercises and the prescription for you. To summarize, we’ve discussed your medical history, performed a physical exam, and addressed your concerns about long-term care planning and knee pain. We’ll be monitoring your blood pressure, managing your knee pain with medication and physical therapy, and keeping the door open for further evaluation if needed. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s about it, Doc. You covered everything. Thank you again for takin’ the time to listen. And… tell your nurse thank you too. She’s been real nice.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. It was my pleasure. I’ll be sure to pass along your kind words to the nurse. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call the office if anything changes or if you have any concerns. Here’s your prescription and the exercise handout. The nurse will be with you shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Rover.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doc. You have a good day too.
