DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor… Stiller? Is that right? Something like that. Yes. I… moved here. From… a place. Not important. They said I needed to… check in. With someone. For… old people things. Medicare, I think. It's all very confusing. I make up faces for people, you know? Not my face, of course. Other people's. For the… stage.
DOCTOR: Stilaire, Mr. Szmyd. Yes, that's correct. And it's perfectly alright if things are a bit confusing, especially with a new move and getting settled with Medicare. We’re here to help make it as straightforward as possible. So, to clarify, you were advised to establish care with a primary care physician as part of your Medicare enrollment?
PATIENT: Primary… what now? Look, I just… they sent a letter. Said I had to come. Something about being… new. And… old. Is this about my health? I feel… fine. A little tired, maybe. But making up faces is hard work! Lots of… powders. And lights. And people wanting different noses. You understand? It’s… artistic.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, I understand. A "primary care physician" is simply your regular doctor – the one you see for check-ups and when you’re not feeling well. It sounds like this appointment was scheduled as a general wellness check, to make sure everything is as it should be now that you're a new patient and enrolled in Medicare. You mentioned feeling a little tired. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Tired… hmm. It's not like… sick tired. More like… always tired. Even when I sleep. And my back… aches a little. From bending over. For the… faces. It’s always the back. Everyone says so. Old backs, they say. It's… normal. I suppose. Is this… important? I don’t usually bother doctors. They just tell you to stop doing things. And I like doing things.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Szmyd. We’re not here to tell you to stop doing things you enjoy, but rather to help you continue doing them as comfortably and safely as possible. The fatigue and back pain are worth investigating, even if it’s just to rule out anything serious. Could you describe the back pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's… dull. Not sharp. Like… a weight. Always there. Worse when I’m… leaning. Or… reaching. Making a very dramatic eye for someone. It’s… in the lower part. Not… up high. I used to be able to… bend over easy. But now… it’s slower. And I grunt a little. My ex-wife… she complained about the grunting. She said it was… undignified. Women. Always complaining. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like the pain is localized to your lower back and is aggravated by bending and reaching. And it's been progressively worsening. Your ex-wife's observations aren't directly relevant to your medical condition, but I appreciate you sharing. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh dear. That’s… a long time ago. I went to a doctor… in Russia. A very serious doctor. He gave me… pills. For… something. I don’t remember what. Something with my… stomach, maybe? It was… uncomfortable. And then I moved. To America. And I mostly just… ignored things. I didn't really have a doctor here. Just… when I broke my toe. That’s it. A very silly toe. I dropped a… light on it. A big light. Is that… important? I have a very good memory for lights, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you recall having a stomach issue treated with pills in Russia, and a broken toe here in America. It’s alright that you don’t recall specifics – we can try to obtain records if that's something you’d like. Did the doctor in Russia explain why you were taking the pills?
PATIENT: No. He didn't speak much English. And I didn’t speak much Russian. He just… pointed. And gave me the pills. They were… small. White pills. I think. Maybe. It was… a long time ago. I remember the waiting room. Very cold. And lots of… sad people. I don’t like sad people. They ruin the… atmosphere. Honestly, I just want to be done with this. Is there a… shortcut? Can you just tell me I’m fine? I have a… very important face to make tomorrow. A very dramatic queen. She’s… demanding.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick assessment, Mr. Szmyd, especially with your demanding schedule. However, to ensure your well-being, I do need to gather a bit more information. A thorough assessment will help me determine the best course of action. Before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. I think… maybe dust? Sometimes my eyes get… itchy. And red. But that's probably just… old age. My ex-wife said I was allergic to… responsibility. She said I was very… flaky. Women. Always… observing. And criticizing. No, no serious allergies, I think. I can eat anything. Except maybe… beets. I don’t like beets. They stain everything. A very dramatic stain. Is that… relevant? You ask a lot of questions, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, a dislike of beets isn’t medically relevant, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like you have no known drug or food allergies. Now, let’s talk about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements.
PATIENT: Medications… oh dear. Let me see. I… sometimes take something for my… knees. They creak a little. Like an old door. But it’s… very occasional. Just when it rains. And… maybe a vitamin D? My neighbor… she said I looked pale. She gave me a bottle. I think. It's somewhere in the… kitchen. A very chaotic kitchen. Honestly, I mostly just… ignore things. I’m not very good with… remembering pills. Too many colors. It confuses me. Are you a… colorful person, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like you occasionally take something for knee discomfort and a vitamin D supplement, as recommended by your neighbor. To get a better understanding of your overall health, I'd like to ask about your past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Not… major surgeries. Just the toe, I think. When I dropped the light. They… wrapped it up. And gave me… a bandage. A very silly bandage. It was… blue. I think. Not a dramatic blue, though. A… faded blue. Honestly, I mostly just avoid things that might… require surgery. Too much… fuss. And too many… needles. I don’t like needles. They’re… pointy. And frightening. Do you use needles, Doctor? A lot of needles?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Mr. Szmyd. We'll discuss that further if needed. For now, so it sounds like the only surgery you've had was to repair your toe. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s… complicated. My mother… she passed away. A long time ago. I don’t… remember much about it. She was… a very serious woman. And my father… he disappeared. Even longer ago. During… something. I don’t like talking about it. It’s… sad. Honestly, I mostly just… focus on the faces. They’re much more… cheerful. Do you have a family, Doctor? A cheerful family?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. It's perfectly alright if you're not comfortable discussing your family history in detail. We can skip that for now if you prefer. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Makes me cough. And… smells bad. Alcohol? Occasionally. A little glass of… something. When I’m feeling… celebratory. Or… stressed. But not much. And… recreational drugs? Goodness no. Too… chaotic. I need a clear head for the faces. They require… precision. Honestly, I mostly just… drink tea. A very strong tea. Keeps me… focused. Do you drink tea, Doctor? A very strong tea?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Szmyd. So you occasionally drink alcohol, but don’t smoke or use recreational drugs. And you prefer tea. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will help me assess your overall health and identify any potential issues. I'll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… pulse… temperature? Oh dear. Is this… necessary? It sounds… invasive. I don’t like things… poking me. Will it… hurt? I mostly just… like to be left alone. Making up faces is a very… delicate art. It requires… tranquility. Are you… a tranquil person, Doctor? And do you poke people? A lot of poking? Honestly, I’m starting to feel… stressed. Perhaps I should just… go home. And make a very dramatic queen. She's waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Szmyd. It won't be invasive at all, I promise. Checking your blood pressure and pulse is quick and painless, and simply gives me a baseline understanding of your cardiovascular health. We can proceed very slowly, and I’ll explain everything as we go. It's important to get a sense of your overall health, even if it’s just a quick check. It will only take a few minutes. We can focus on the most essential parts, if that helps. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, we can stop immediately. Would you prefer if I just check your blood pressure and pulse today, and we can postpone the rest of the exam?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure and pulse… yes. That sounds… manageable. As long as it’s… quick. And painless. And you don’t poke me. I have… sensitive skin. And I need to get back to the queen. She’s very demanding. Honestly, I mostly just… want this over with. Are you… a fast person, Doctor? A very fast blood pressure taker? And do you have… soft hands?
DOCTOR: I am, Mr. Szmyd. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. And yes, I do have soft hands. Please, have a seat and relax. I'll take your blood pressure and pulse now. Alright, just relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. This won’t take long at all. I'm getting a reading of 148/92. Your pulse is 78 and regular. That blood pressure is a bit elevated. Do you know if it’s usually this high?
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh dear. Is that… bad? I don't… usually measure things. I mostly just… make up faces. The queen, you know? She’s very critical. Perhaps it’s… her stress. It's… contagious. I think. Honestly, I mostly just… ignore numbers. They confuse me. And they ruin the… aesthetic. Are you good with numbers, Doctor? A very good number reader? Perhaps you should measure the queen. She’s very… substantial.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to not be familiar with numbers, Mr. Szmyd. A blood pressure of 148/92 is a bit higher than we’d like. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it’s something we should investigate further. It could be due to stress, as you mentioned, or a number of other factors. We can try to manage it with lifestyle changes first – reducing stress, eating a healthy diet, and regular exercise. I also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment so we can recheck your blood pressure and discuss it further. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… oh dear. That sounds… exhausting. Reducing stress? Impossible. The queen… she’s a constant source of… anxiety. Healthy diet? I mostly just drink tea. And exercise? I mostly just… reach for the powders. Honestly, I mostly just want to… avoid things. Follow-up appointment? That sounds… inconvenient. Perhaps it’s just… old age. Everyone says so. Are you old, Doctor? A very old number reader? Perhaps you should just… tell me I’m fine. And let me go make up the queen. She’s waiting. Very impatiently.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate. I won't push you into anything you’re not comfortable with. However, ignoring high blood pressure can lead to serious health problems down the line, and I want to ensure you’re as healthy as possible. Let’s start small. Would you be open to keeping a log of your blood pressure for a week?
PATIENT: A log? Oh dear. Another… number thing. That sounds… tedious. And complicated. I mostly just… lose things. Like my keys. And my glasses. And my memory. Honestly, I mostly just want to… forget things. Like numbers. And appointments. And logs. Are you good at remembering things, Doctor? A very good log keeper? Perhaps you should just… write the log for me. And tell me I’m fine. And let me go make up the queen. She’s waiting. Very, very impatiently. Is she… a number? A very dramatic number? Perhaps that’s the problem. Numbers are… stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. This is clearly causing you a great deal of stress, and I don't want to add to it. Perhaps we can revisit this at a later time. Given your reluctance to pursue further investigation, and the fact that you're currently feeling well, I will document your elevated blood pressure reading and advise you to monitor for any new or worsening symptoms. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Monitor for… symptoms? Oh dear. Another… thing to remember. Honestly, I mostly just… ignore things. They usually go away. Like… unpleasant faces. And bad numbers. And appointments. Are you good at ignoring things, Doctor? A very good symptom ignorer? Perhaps you should just… ignore the numbers. And let me go make up the queen. She’s waiting. Very, very, very impatiently. She's… a demanding number. A very dramatic, critical, imposing number. That’s the problem. Numbers are… terrifying. Perhaps I should just… retire. And hide. From the numbers.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like this entire process is causing you a significant amount of distress. I respect your wishes, and I won’t push you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. I will document your elevated blood pressure reading, and advise you to contact the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. Just… let me go. Let me go make up the queen. She’s waiting. Very, very, very, very impatiently. She is… a force of nature. A demanding, dramatic, critical, imposing, terrifying force of nature. And she doesn't like waiting. Honestly, I mostly just… want to escape. Escape the numbers. Escape the appointments. Escape the stress. Escape… everything. Thank you, Doctor. But please… just let me go. And may the queen… have mercy. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I wish you all the best with the queen.
