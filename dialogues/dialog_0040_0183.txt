DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman, let’s get this over with. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Tired. Very tired. Always tired now. Not like… sleepy tired. Just… heavy tired. Like carrying rocks. Been this way a long time, maybe six months? Hard to say exactly. My wife, she keeps telling me to come, says I don't do enough.
DOCTOR: Six months, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Six months, maybe a little longer. And before that… I just thought I was getting old. You know? Old man things. But it's not… getting better. It's just… there. Like a weight. And the doctor before… he said something about my liver. Something not good. I don't remember all the words. Too many words.
DOCTOR: Your liver, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. He poked around. Said something about… tests. Numbers. Bad numbers. I didn't ask him to explain the numbers. I just wanted him to fix it. And he gave me some pills. Didn't help. Now I'm here. You gonna give me more pills? Because I don't want more pills.
DOCTOR: Well, we're not going to "fix" anything without understanding what needs fixing, are we?
PATIENT: Understand? I told you. Tired. Liver. Bad numbers. What more is there to understand? It's not a complicated problem. Just make it stop. I have things to do, you know. I don't have all day to talk about… feelings.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's just go through a few things, then. Standard procedure. Have you had any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I eat. I sleep… mostly. Sometimes I feel a little… sick to my stomach. But that could be anything. Bad food, maybe. My wife makes me eat a lot of vegetables now. Those make me sick too. Is that a symptom? Everything feels wrong, but… it's mostly just tired.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… less. I don’t want to eat as much. But my wife… she pushes food on me. Says I'm too thin. She’s always saying something. I used to eat a lot. Big meals. Now… not so much. Food doesn’t taste good anymore, either. Everything tastes… flat.
DOCTOR: Flat… Alright. And any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… movements? You ask a lot of questions. What do you mean, changes? I go to the bathroom. Sometimes it's hard. Sometimes it's… not. It’s not a pleasant topic. Why are you asking about this? Is this going to help me feel less tired?
DOCTOR: It helps me build a complete picture, Mr. Grumman. Is it darker than usual?
PATIENT: Darker? I don’t… I don’t look at it. I just… go. My wife says I should drink more water. She says everything is from not drinking enough water. She's a very bossy woman, you know. Is this water going to fix my liver? Because I doubt it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes?
PATIENT: Yellowing? No. I haven’t… looked. I don't spend my time looking at my skin. My wife would tell me if I was yellow. She notices everything. She's always telling me I need to put on sunscreen. You'd think I was a child. But… now that you mention it… maybe? A little pale, perhaps. But I'm an old man. Old men are pale.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check, nothing extensive. I need to listen to your abdomen, feel your liver. Lie back on the table, please.
PATIENT: Lie back? You're going to poke around again? Just like the last doctor? What good will poking do? I'm telling you, I'm just tired. Very tired. But… fine. If you insist. But don’t take too long. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your abdomen is a little tender here, on the right side. And… yes, your liver is slightly enlarged. It’s not dramatically so, but it's definitely noticeable. I'm also noting some mild fluid retention in your lower legs. Do you notice any swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? I wear shoes. I don’t look at my ankles. My wife buys me comfortable shoes. She says I need good support. She thinks everything is about support. But… maybe? They feel a little… tight. Like my shoes are too small. But they’re not too small. She just bought them last month. Is this getting me closer to not being tired? Because frankly, I'm losing patience.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam, it's likely your liver issues are continuing to cause your fatigue and other symptoms. We need some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll order a full liver panel, complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. Also, I'm going to order an ultrasound of your abdomen. We need to visualize the liver and rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Ultrasound? More poking and prodding? This is ridiculous. All these tests… for being tired? I just want to feel normal again. Fine. Do the tests. But I'm not promising I'll come back if they just tell me I need to drink more water. And tell your nurse to be quick. I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. The lab results will take a few days, and we'll schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. I’ll have my assistant schedule that for you. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as you can, though I understand that's difficult. We’ll see what the tests reveal. Is there anything else before I go?
PATIENT: Rest? You think I haven't tried resting? It doesn’t work. It just makes me more tired. No. No, there’s nothing else. Just… get this over with. And don't waste my time with nonsense. If these tests don't actually help, I'm finding another doctor. A doctor who actually listens.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
