DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I’ve been having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a long time. It’s been going on for maybe a week or so now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's not embarrassing at all, Ms. Yadao, these things happen. A week, alright. And is it difficult every time, or just sometimes?
PATIENT: Every time, Doctor. Though sometimes it’s worse than others. Like yesterday, it took me a good ten minutes just to get anything going. And it felt like I wasn’t emptying my bladder completely, even then. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Ten minutes is a long time, certainly. And the feeling of incomplete emptying is important information. Do you feel any pain or burning when you try to urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning, thankfully. It’s not painful, just… frustrating and weak. Like the stream is very thin, if that explains it. And it sort of starts and stops, you know? Not a steady flow. It’s… well, it’s not normal, is it? I’ve always had a good, strong stream before.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't sound quite normal, Ms. Yadao. A weak, intermittent stream is something we need to investigate. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… the color? No, I don’t think so. It looks pretty much the same as always. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink a lot of tea, so… I figure that could be it. I haven't seen any blood or anything like that, thankfully. No fever or chills either. Just… this trouble going.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you been experiencing any lower abdominal pain, or any back pain?
PATIENT: No, no pain in my belly, Doctor. And my back feels alright too. Sometimes a little stiff when I get up in the morning, but that’s just my age, I think. I do a bit of gardening, you know, bending over and things. But nothing sharp or… concerning. It’s really just the bathroom trouble. I’m starting to get worried about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Yadao. It’s good that you’re getting it checked out. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago. And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s it really. Oh! And I had a small heart flutter a few years back, but they gave me some pills and it’s been fine ever since. I see Dr. Miller for my blood pressure, and he says it’s usually okay. Nothing else comes to mind. I’m on Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, arthritis, and a history of atrial fibrillation treated with medication… I see it here. And you see Dr. Miller for blood pressure, good. Now, are you currently taking any medications other than what Dr. Miller prescribes?
PATIENT: Let’s see… I take a pill for my knees, something for the pain, but it’s just over-the-counter, ibuprofen, I think. And sometimes I take a little something for my sleep, but only when I really need it. Just a small dose, you know? Melatonin, I believe it’s called. Nothing else, Doctor. I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen as needed for your knees, and melatonin occasionally for sleep. Now, have you ever had any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve taken lots of different things over the years, and never had a reaction. I’m pretty lucky, I think. My mother was allergic to penicillin, but I haven’t had any trouble with it myself. Does that make sense? To tell you about my mother? Sometimes I go off on tangents…
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Yadao. Knowing your family history is helpful. No allergies to medications, that's good. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll do a quick neurological exam just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. I trust your judgment. I just want to get to the bottom of this bathroom trouble. It’s starting to worry me, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's begin then. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Just breathe normally. Hmm… bowel sounds are present, normal. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay. Gently is good. Oh! That’s… a little tender there, on the left side. Not painful, just… sensitive. The rest feels okay, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Nothing significantly concerning otherwise. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam. I’m just checking your reflexes and sensation. Everything seems intact here as well. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, it could be a few things. It could be a urinary tract infection, although you don't have any fever or the usual burning sensation. It could also be an issue with your bladder itself, or even a mild constipation contributing to the difficulty. To be certain, I'd like to order a urine analysis to rule out infection, and a post-void residual measurement to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A urine analysis and… the other test, the post-void… yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best to find out what’s going on. I just want to get back to normal, you know? I don't like feeling like I have to struggle every time I go to the bathroom. When will I know the results?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Yadao. It's frustrating to have these issues. The lab results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours. The post-void residual measurement will be done right here in the clinic. After you urinate, the nurse will use a small, handheld device to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder. It’s a quick, painless procedure. In the meantime, I recommend you increase your fluid intake – water is best – and try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate your bladder. If you develop a fever, or if you notice any blood in your urine, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. More water, less caffeine and alcohol. And contact you if I get a fever or see blood. I can do that. So, the nurse will help me with the… measurement, after I urinate? Is there anything else I should be doing? Should I be keeping a diary of how often I go to the bathroom? Or… anything like that? I just want to be helpful, you know, and get this sorted out quickly.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. The nurse will assist you with the post-void residual measurement after you urinate. And yes, keeping a bladder diary would be very helpful. Just note down the time you urinate, the amount of urine you pass , and whether you had any difficulty starting or emptying your bladder. This will give us a better idea of what's going on. I'll have the nurse bring you a form to record this information on. We can review it at your follow-up appointment in a week, once we have the lab results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. A diary, and a follow-up appointment in a week. I can definitely do that. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I was getting quite worried, you know, but I feel much better now, knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Yadao. It’s my job to listen and help you figure things out. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you. And remember, stay hydrated. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. Thank you again for everything. I’ll see you in a week, then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. You have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: .
