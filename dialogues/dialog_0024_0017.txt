DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… a tryout. For a team. A sports team. It's… important. I need to be sure I'm still… able. You understand. It’s been a while, though. A long while.
DOCTOR: A tryout, you say. And you are concerned about your… ability. Right. To be precise, what sport are we discussing, and what specifically are you worried about?
PATIENT: Baseball. It was… always baseball. Though, honestly? I don't recall much detail. Just… aches. Old aches. And… shortness of breath, sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. Just… when I think about running. It’s… complicated.
DOCTOR: Baseball. "Old aches" and breathlessness upon anticipation of exertion. Very well. Let's quantify these "aches." Where exactly are you experiencing discomfort, and on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the most severe pain imaginable, what would you rate them?
PATIENT: Quantify… you want numbers? Really? Well… the shoulder, mostly. Right one. And the knees. Both of ‘em. It’s… hard to say. A five, maybe? On a good day. A seven when it’s… damp. Like today. It’s… a feeling. You wouldn't understand unless you played. It's not just pain, you see. It's… a limitation. A definite limitation.
DOCTOR: A subjective “limitation” fluctuating with the weather. Fascinating. And this breathlessness… does it occur with any other activity besides… thinking about running?
PATIENT: Thinking about running was just an example! It happens… when I lift things. Heavy things. Like… wood. I do some work, you know? Construction. Not much anymore, but… still. And… sometimes just walking up the stairs. It’s… embarrassing, if I’m honest. Not that you would know about embarrassment.
DOCTOR: So, exertional dyspnea and shoulder/knee discomfort. Let's move on to a more structured assessment. Do you have any history of cardiac issues?
PATIENT: Cardiac… issues? What does that mean? Look, I’m not a doctor! I just know I feel… old. And tired. And I need to know if I can play baseball. Is that so hard to understand? I had… something… a long time ago. With my chest. But I don't recall the details. It was… dealt with. By a… someone. Years ago. A very long time ago.
DOCTOR: "Something" with your chest, "dealt with" by an unspecified individual, years ago. This is… less than ideal. Do you, to the best of your recollection, have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I take… something for the aches, sometimes. A white pill. But I don’t… I don’t remember the name. It was prescribed by… someone. A long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep track of these things. I just take it when I need to. It helps. Sometimes. Is this… necessary? All these questions? Baseball is a simple game.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, a medical evaluation requires precise information. The inability to recall even basic details regarding your medications is… concerning. Let’s attempt a brief physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Examination? Look, I came here to see if I can play baseball, not to be… interrogated. Fine. Do what you have to do. But don’t expect much. My memory isn’t what it used to be. And frankly, I don't see what poking and prodding will accomplish.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I will assess your range of motion in your shoulders and knees, auscultate your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Please remove your shirt.
PATIENT: Remove my… my shirt? Is that really necessary? I assure you, my aches are quite obvious. But… fine. Do what you must. Just… be quick about it. This is… undignified.
DOCTOR: Shoulder range of motion is limited with mild crepitus. Lungs sound slightly diminished bilaterally. Blood pressure is elevated: 145/90. Knees exhibit mild tenderness and swelling. I also notice some mild edema in your lower extremities. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… sometimes. I thought it was just… old age. Or the heat. It comes and goes. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t pay much attention to these things. I just try to ignore the aches and keep moving. Is this going to affect my baseball? That’s all I want to know. Is this… a yes or a no?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I cannot offer a definitive "yes" or "no" without further investigation. Your elevated blood pressure, diminished lung sounds, and joint swelling are concerning. I recommend an electrocardiogram to assess your cardiac function, a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs, and blood work to assess your overall health. Until we have these results, I strongly advise against any strenuous activity, including a baseball tryout. It would be irresponsible of me to clear you without a thorough assessment.
PATIENT: An electrocardiogram… a chest X-ray… blood work? That sounds… excessive. And expensive. Look, I just want to play a little baseball. I’m not asking for a miracle. Just a simple opinion. I’ve been playing sports my whole life. I’m sure I’m fine. Fine. Do what you have to do. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. I have things to do, you know. Baseball to play.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bartok. I will order the necessary tests. The lab is just down the hall. I will have the results sent to my office, and we can discuss them at a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please refrain from any strenuous activity. I’ll schedule that follow-up now. .
