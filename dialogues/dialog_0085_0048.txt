DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lahn, you said? Well, it’s about my head. Been getting…fuzzy, you know? Like little clouds drifting through. My wife, she’s the one who really pushed me to come. Says I ask the same questions twice in one hour, sometimes. Honestly, I think she worries too much. But she’s right, I suppose. It’s happening more often lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fuzzy” is a good way to describe it. And it’s good that your wife is noticing and encouraging you to get it checked out – it is always better to be safe. So, this feeling of fogginess… when did you first start noticing it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it’s been… probably six months, maybe a little more? It started subtly, just forgetting where I put my tools, things like that. A tile setter forgets things sometimes, you know? Lots of little pieces to keep track of. But it’s gotten…more than that now. It's not just tools. It’s…names, dates, what I had for breakfast. Little things. Important little things, my wife keeps saying. She makes a big fuss about breakfast.
DOCTOR: Right, six months, starting with minor forgetfulness and gradually becoming more noticeable. And it’s affecting more than just objects now – names and dates as well. I understand. And your wife is concerned about the impact it's having. Can you tell me a bit more about how it feels when you're experiencing this fogginess?
PATIENT: Well, it's not pain, Doctor. Nothing like that. It's just… like trying to see through a dirty window. Everything's there, but it’s not clear. Like the words are on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t quite grab them. Or I’ll be in the middle of a sentence, and…poof. Gone. Like a radio signal fading out. And sometimes I get confused about the day. Yesterday I thought it was Wednesday when it was Tuesday. My wife nearly had a fit. Honestly, I find it rather irritating. I’m a perfectly capable man.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating, certainly. It's good you can describe it so clearly – "like trying to see through a dirty window" is very helpful. And the confusion with the day… okay. Let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this memory issue?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… well, my temper’s been shorter, I suppose. Not that I was ever a saint, but I find myself getting annoyed at things that wouldn’t have bothered me before. The neighbor’s dog barking, the price of tile… little things. My wife says I’m more…withdrawn. Spending more time in the workshop, less time chatting. She thinks I’m depressed, but I just need my space. Tile work requires concentration, you know? Can’t have people bothering you while you’re laying stone. And I haven’t been sleeping as well either. Wake up a few times a night, just…thinking.
DOCTOR: Okay, shorter temper, feeling more withdrawn, difficulty sleeping… Those are all things we should consider. And it's good you're aware of them. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I take medication for my blood pressure. Doctor Soun prescribed it, maybe five years ago now? Says it was creeping up. Otherwise, not much. Had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was…oh, forty years ago? And I broke my wrist falling off a ladder a few years back. That healed fine. Otherwise, I’ve always been a healthy man. Good strong Khmer blood, you know? We don't get sick easily. Medicare covers everything, thankfully. My wife handles all the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hypertension managed with medication prescribed by Dr. Soun, gallbladder removal forty years ago, and a broken wrist that healed well. And you generally consider yourself to be healthy. That's helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always checks, of course. She’s very cautious. But I’ve always been able to eat whatever I want, take whatever the doctor gives me. No problems. We eat a lot of fish, lots of rice. Good, wholesome food. Nothing fancy. Don't need fancy to stay healthy. Just hard work and good genetics.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. And you eat a generally healthy diet. Now, let's talk about family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a tough one. My father...he got a little confused towards the end, but we just put it down to old age. He was a farmer, very hard life. He didn't have the best diet, you know? And my mother… she died young, from a fever. Didn't have time to get old and confused. I have a sister, living in Phnom Penh, but we don’t talk much. Don’t know anything about her health. Honestly, my family wasn’t one for talking about… those sorts of things. It was considered shameful, I think. Best to just ignore it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited information about family history. Your father experienced some confusion towards the end of his life, but it was attributed to age, and your mother passed away young. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications other than the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the one. The little white pill. Doctor Soun prescribed it. I take it every morning with my rice. My wife keeps it in a little plastic container, makes sure I don't forget. She's very organized, that woman. Honestly, I wouldn't remember half the things without her. She reminds me about everything. Even to brush my teeth. It's embarrassing to admit, but…sometimes I do forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the one medication as prescribed by Dr. Soun. And your wife helps you manage it. Thank you for being so honest. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your memory, balance, and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. I suppose if I’m here, I should let you poke around a bit. Don’t expect much, though. I’m a strong man. A bit forgetful, perhaps, but still strong. Just be quick about it. I have tiles to lay, you know? And my wife will be expecting me home soon. She made a special fish stew. I don't want it to get cold.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lason. I'll be as quick as possible. And don’t worry, I'll keep that fish stew in mind. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound good. Now, let's do a few simple tests to check your memory and balance. Could you please tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? Hmm. That’s a trick question, isn’t it? Let me think… It’s…August… the second? Yes, August the second. 2025, of course. My wife told me this morning. She always tells me the date. Just to be sure, you know. I remember. August the second, 2025. Don't ask me what day of the week it is, though. That’s where I get confused.
DOCTOR: Okay, you remember the date—August 2nd, 2025—that's good. And you correctly identified it was Tuesday. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. I’ll say them, and I want you to remember them, and I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me now to show me you’ve heard them?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Easy enough. My memory’s not that bad, you know. I remember perfectly well. Apple, table, penny. Don't try to trick me with this. I've been laying tile for forty years. I have to remember lots of things. Measurements, colors, types of stone… three little words are nothing. Apple, table, penny. Now, what’s next? I’m sure you have more important things to do than test an old man’s memory.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mr. Lason, those words are easy. And I assure you, I’m not trying to trick you. Just gathering some information. Now, I'm going to ask you to draw a clock face, showing all the numbers, and set the hands to ten minutes past eleven. Do you have a good hand-eye coordination?
PATIENT: A clock face? Now you are testing me! I’m a tile setter, not an artist. I work with stone, with precision, with angles. Not with…doodles. But fine. I’ll try. It won’t be pretty, I can tell you that much. There. Is that good enough? It's not perfect, but I’m sure you can figure it out. I'm better with a trowel than a pen, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That’s perfectly fine. It gives me some useful information. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect me to dance or anything. I have a bad knee, you know. Old injury from…well, from laying tile. See? Perfectly steady. A little slow, perhaps, but steady. This is all a waste of time, you know? I just want to get home and eat my wife’s fish stew. It's probably getting cold by now.
DOCTOR: You're doing very well, Mr. Lason. And you're right to think of your wife's stew – we don’t want that getting cold. Okay, one last thing. I asked you to remember three words earlier—apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me now?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… Apple… table… Now, what was the third one? It's on the tip of my tongue. I remember apple, I remember table… But the third one… Oh dear. It’s gone. Completely gone. I knew I shouldn’t have come. I always forget things. It’s the age, I suppose. What was the third word? I’m so sorry. My wife will be furious. She told me to remember. It was… something small… a coin, perhaps? I can’t… I just can’t remember.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Lason. Don't worry about it. It’s not a test to fail. The word was penny. Okay, thank you. That was very helpful. Based on what I’ve observed and what you’ve told me, it seems you are experiencing some cognitive changes – specifically with short-term memory and recall. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. I’m concerned enough that I recommend further evaluation. I want to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. And I'd also like you to undergo a more comprehensive cognitive assessment with a specialist – a neurologist. They can perform detailed tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Blood tests? This is getting serious. Is something…wrong? I just thought it was my age. My wife worries too much, you know? A specialist…that sounds expensive. Medicare will cover it, right? I don’t want to be a burden. And what if it is something bad? I just want to go home and lay tiles. I'm perfectly capable. I've been doing this for forty years. But… if you think it's necessary… I suppose I can do it. For my wife. She’ll be relieved. Just…don’t tell her it’s anything serious, alright? She’ll be beside herself. And what about the tiles? Who will lay the tiles? I have a job to finish…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. It’s perfectly natural to be worried. And you are right to ask those questions. Let’s address them one by one. First, it’s too early to say definitively what’s going on. These tests are simply to get more information and rule out other possibilities. The vast majority of memory problems are caused by treatable conditions. We need to identify the cause before we can determine the best course of action. Regarding cost, Medicare will cover these tests, as long as they are deemed medically necessary. We will handle all the paperwork. You won’t have to worry about that. And about your tiles, let's focus on getting you evaluated first. We can discuss options for your work later, if necessary. Your health is the most important thing right now. I want to be clear: I’m not saying you have anything serious. I’m simply being thorough and proactive. Early detection is always best. I’m going to write you a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Anya Sharma, who is excellent. I’ll also order the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall. The nurse will give you the instructions. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Alright. Dr. Sharma, you said? And the tests…fine. Do what you have to do. Just… please, don't make a fuss. I don't want my wife worrying any more than she already is. She'll insist on driving me everywhere, asking a million questions…it'll be a disaster. Can I still lay tiles? As long as I can still lay tiles, I’ll be alright. It keeps my mind sharp, you know? Focuses my attention. I can't just sit around and…worry. And…what if it is something bad? What would that mean? Will I…forget everything? Forget my wife? Forget how to lay tiles? That’s what I’m really afraid of. Tell me the truth, Doctor. Don't sugarcoat it. But… try to be gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your fears. It’s completely natural to be worried about those possibilities. And you deserve honesty. Let me address your questions directly. First, regarding continuing to lay tiles: As long as you feel safe and capable, there's no reason you can't continue to do the things you enjoy. We will monitor your condition, and if necessary, we can discuss adjustments. Now, about the possibility of a more serious diagnosis… It’s important to understand that there are many different causes of cognitive changes. Some are reversible, and some are progressive. If it is something progressive, like Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia, it would mean a gradual decline in cognitive function over time. However, even with a progressive condition, people can still live fulfilling lives for many years. There are medications and therapies that can help manage symptoms and slow the progression. And, most importantly, there is support available for both you and your wife. The fear of forgetting everything, including your wife and your skills, is understandable. But it’s important to remember that everyone experiences these conditions differently. The progression varies greatly, and there are ways to cope with memory loss and maintain a good quality of life. Right now, we don’t know what’s going on. Let’s focus on getting the tests done and getting a clearer picture. Then, we can discuss your options and create a plan that’s right for you. I will also provide you with information about support groups and resources for both patients and caregivers. You are not alone in this. And your wife will be fully supported throughout this process. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Support groups… That sounds awful. Just a bunch of old people… forgetting things together. I don't want that. No. I don't have any questions. I just… want to go home. And lay tiles. Maybe if I keep busy… maybe it won't be so bad. Just… tell the nurse where to go for the blood tests. And give me the referral for Dr. Sharma. I’ll… I’ll deal with it later. Thank you, Doctor. I think. But… please. Don't expect me to be happy about this. It’s not something I wanted.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. You don’t have to be happy about it. It’s perfectly okay to feel however you’re feeling. The nurse’s station is just outside the door. I’ll have her come and get you in a moment, and she’ll take you for the blood tests. Here’s the referral to Dr. Sharma. Please remember that I’m here to support you. And if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call. Take care, Mr. Lason. And I truly hope you find some comfort in your work. .
