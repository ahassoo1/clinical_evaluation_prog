DOCTOR: Right. Philipp Puder, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. August 2nd, right? Today.
DOCTOR: Yes, today is August 2nd. And you're here...why are you here today?
PATIENT: My heart... it feels funny sometimes. Like it's flapping. Not good flapping, you know? Like a bird stuck. My wife, she say I need to see a doctor. She worry.
DOCTOR: "Flapping," eh?
PATIENT: Yes. It comes and goes. Sometimes I feel it all day, sometimes just for a little bit. Not always when I’m doing something. Sometimes when I’m sitting. It’s… hard to explain. Like a quick beat, then a slow beat, then quick again. Not pain, just… feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it's not a painful sensation, just an awareness of your heartbeat being irregular?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Irregular is… good word. Not pain. Just feel it. Like it skip, or… rush. My wife, she say it look like my wrist jump when it happen. She watch me when I sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: Your wife watches you when you sleep?
PATIENT: She worry! She say she just want to be sure. She is a good wife. She make strong coffee, too. But yes, she watch. Just when I’m sleeping. Not all the time! Just… when she think the flapping might be happening.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let's try to get a better understanding of this "flapping." How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe six months? It started slow, just once in a while. I didn’t think much of it. But then it started to happen more. Now, it’s… I don’t know, maybe three or four times a week? Sometimes more if I drink coffee. My wife say I drink too much coffee.
DOCTOR: And how much coffee is too much, in your opinion?
PATIENT: Maybe… four cups? Each day? Big cups! My wife, she say that is too many. She say one cup. But one cup is not enough to wake up! I work hard. I need coffee. We have a little disagreement about coffee. It’s okay. We still love each other.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s put the coffee aside for a moment. Besides the coffee and your wife’s observations, have you noticed anything else that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I try to think… sometimes when I am tired? But I am always a little tired. I work long hours. And… when I am stressed? But who is not stressed these days? It’s hard to say. Nothing makes it always happen. It just… does. Sometimes. It's strange.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I have a little bit of back pain from work. Lifting things. But nothing serious. I take some pills for it sometimes, but not every day. And… I don’t have insurance. That is why I wait so long to come to the doctor. I don't want big bill. My wife, she say it's okay, we will figure it out. She is very practical.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father, he have high blood pressure. But he live long life. To eighty-five. My mother, she… she have problems with her stomach. Not heart. And… I don’t know much about my grandparents. They live in Yemen. Far away. I don’t know if they have heart trouble. I never meet them.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. I don't like it. Alcohol... sometimes, a little beer with my wife on the weekend. But not much. Maybe one or two. And no… other substances. Just coffee. My wife say too much coffee. But I already tell you that. She is always right about the coffee.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a listen to your heart and lungs. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. No problem. Is cold in there? I feel cold sometimes.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be. Just lie back and try to relax. I’ll need to listen with the stethoscope, so please try to be still. And don't worry, I'll make sure to keep you covered.
PATIENT: Okay. Is okay if I think about coffee? My wife say it bad to think about stressful things. But I like thinking about coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Okay. Your heart rate is a little fast, but otherwise… sounds normal. Lungs are clear. I don’t hear any unusual sounds. But we need to do an EKG to get a better picture of this “flapping” you’re describing. It will help us see if there is anything irregular happening with the electrical activity of your heart. And a blood test is probably a good idea too, just to check your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never. I can eat anything. And… EKG? Blood test? Is that… expensive? My wife, she worry about money. She is very good at saving. But I want to know what is wrong. If something is wrong. Is okay, I think. For my wife. And for me.
DOCTOR: We can discuss the cost with the billing department. And we’ll see what we can do. We'll start with the EKG and the blood work. Nurse Patel will come in shortly to draw the blood and get you set up for the EKG. It’s just a quick, painless test. It won’t take long. Let’s see what those results tell us, and then we can go from there. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. But it’s best to be sure. Now, do you have a list of any medications you are currently taking, even for something like back pain?
PATIENT: Yes. I have… Ibuprofen. Sometimes, for my back. Just when it hurts bad. I buy it at the store. Not prescription. And… that is all. I don’t like taking pills. My wife, she say I should see a doctor about my back, but I don’t like going to the doctor. It takes too long. And… it costs money. But my heart… that is different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen, as needed. Good. Nurse Patel will be in shortly. She’ll explain everything. Try not to worry too much, Philipp. We're just going to do some basic tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We’ll take it one step at a time. And we'll see what we can do about the cost. Just focus on relaxing for now.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I… I will try to relax. But it’s hard when my heart is flapping. .
