DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you. Well, it’s… the words. They are not coming so easy now. It’s… difficult to find them, you understand? It's been happening for… some time, I think. Not a long time, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating when words don't come easily. “Some time”… can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… Rough estimate… Perhaps… six months? Or maybe a little more? It is difficult to say for certain. Things… blend together, you know? It's not like yesterday, but not… years ago either. It feels… in the middle. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Gyamfi. “In the middle” gives me a good starting point. And it’s helpful to know it’s been gradual. Has this difficulty with words been affecting your daily life?
PATIENT: Yes, it has, Doctor. I… work with numbers and… people’s benefits. Compensation, you see? And… explaining things clearly is very important. It’s becoming… harder to explain. I sometimes… stumble. And I worry people do not understand. It makes me… hesitant to speak, if that makes sense. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Hesitancy is a very common response in that situation. So, it's impacting your work, specifically the clarity of your communication. Have you noticed it affecting anything else – conversations with family, hobbies, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… Yes. My wife… passed away two years ago. We used to… talk a great deal. Now… I see my daughter sometimes. And I… want to share things, but… the words don’t flow. It feels… sad. And frustrating for her, I think. Hobbies… I used to read. But it is difficult to… concentrate if I am struggling with the words. So, I do not do that so much now. Mostly… I just… rest.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Gyamfi. That must be very difficult. And it sounds like this is impacting more than just your work – it's affecting your relationships and enjoyment of life. Okay. To get a better understanding, let's talk a little bit about how you're struggling with words. Are you having trouble finding the right words, or are you having trouble understanding what people say to you?
PATIENT: Hmm… finding, I think. Mostly finding. People speak… I hear them. It is… the answer, the correct word… it is not there. Like… a blank space. I know what I mean, you understand? But the word… it hides. Sometimes it comes after a long time. But sometimes… it does not come at all. Understanding… that is mostly okay. Although… sometimes… in a group… it is difficult to follow. But I think that is just… the noise. Mostly finding. Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily difficulty with word finding - that's a good distinction. And occasionally trouble following in a group, which could be related or just the environment. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well… I… sometimes feel a little… tired. But I am older, you understand? That could be anything. And… my memory is not what it was. But again… I forget things. Small things. Where I put my glasses, for example. Or… the name of an actor. Is that what you mean? Symptoms… I am not sure. Nothing… major. Just… older.
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to mention, thank you. Fatigue and some memory lapses are common, and we'll definitely consider those. Now, let's briefly talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… Let me see. High blood pressure, yes. I take medicine for that. For many years now. And… my cholesterol was a little high, but it is controlled with diet and… a pill, I think. Otherwise… no. Nothing major. I had a… surgery on my knee, some years ago. But that is… fixed now. Otherwise, I am… reasonably healthy, I believe. For my age. Medicare covers everything, you see. So I go for my check-ups.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, both well-managed with medication and diet. And you had knee surgery in the past. Do you know what medications you're currently taking for your blood pressure and cholesterol?
PATIENT: Medications… That is… difficult. I have many pills. My daughter helps me with them. She organizes everything. I… I know there is a white one for the blood pressure. And a… yellow one for the cholesterol, perhaps? But the names… no. I do not remember the names. I take them every day, as prescribed. My daughter… she knows everything. I am sorry. I am not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s common to have a lot of medications and it’s good you have your daughter helping you manage them. I can access your medication list through the EHR system, let me just pull that up… Okay, I see here you’re currently taking Lisinopril for your blood pressure and Atorvastatin for your cholesterol. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Lisinopril and… Atorvastatin. Yes, that sounds right. Allergic… No, I do not think so. I have never had a… reaction to any medicine. Not that I remember, anyway. My wife… she always checked everything. She was very careful. No, I am not allergic. I am quite sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Alright, Mr. Gyamfi, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just a few things to check your reflexes, balance, and listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I will… cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just step over here and sit on the table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Balance is stable, no swaying. Strength is good in all extremities. Now, I'm going to do a quick cognitive assessment - just a few simple questions to get a better understanding of your memory and thinking skills. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… fine. Cognitive assessment… I will do my best. I am not very good with… tests, you understand. But I will try. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry at all, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s very simple, and it’s not a test to pass or fail. Just a way for me to get a better picture of things. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… Hmm. It is… August. Yes, August. But the day… Is it the… second? Or the third? I am not quite sure. It feels like the second, but… I am not certain. August the second, I think. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: August the second is correct. Okay. Now, can you tell me where we are today?
PATIENT: Where we are… We are… in the doctor’s office. Yes, in the office. In… the rural clinic. I believe that is what my daughter said. Yes, the rural clinic. Is that correct? It is… small, but very nice.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Mr. Gyamfi. Okay. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I'll say them, and then I'll ask you to remember them. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Three words… I will try my best to remember them. Please, proceed. My memory is not… what it was, you understand. But I will attempt it.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: “apple,” “table,” and “penny.” Please try to remember them. I will ask you to repeat them later.
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny… Apple… table… and penny. I think I have them. But I am not sure for how long. Apple, table, penny. Is that correct? I will try to keep them in my mind.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Gyamfi. Don't worry about keeping them in mind perfectly, just do your best. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: The year… hmm. Is it… 2024? No, that feels wrong. Is it… 2025? Yes, I believe it is 2025. 2025, is that correct? It is difficult to keep track of the years, you understand.
DOCTOR: 2025 is correct. Okay. Now, can you tell me who the current president of the United States is?
PATIENT: The president… hmm. That is… a difficult question. I am not… very good with politics, you understand. Is it… Mr. Biden? I believe his name is Mr. Biden. But I am not certain. Is that correct? It is… very confusing these days.
DOCTOR: Mr. Biden is correct. Alright, Mr. Gyamfi, let’s go back to those three words I asked you to remember earlier. Can you tell me what those words were?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I am afraid I have forgotten them. I was trying so hard to remember, but they… slipped away. Apple… table… something else… I cannot recall. I am so sorry. My memory is… not what it used to be. I truly cannot remember.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s not uncommon to have difficulty with recall, especially with a few distractions. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, your symptoms – difficulty finding words, some memory lapses, and fatigue – and the results of this brief assessment, it appears you may be experiencing Mild Cognitive Impairment, or MCI. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes. I want to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and other medical conditions that can affect cognitive function. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation, including possible brain imaging. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Mild Cognitive… Impairment? I do not… understand. Is that… serious? And brain… imaging? What does that mean? Blood tests… that is alright. I can do blood tests. But brain… imaging sounds… frightening. I trust your judgment, Doctor, but I am… a little concerned. What are we looking for, exactly? And what does this mean for… my future?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s natural to be worried when you hear terms like that. Mild Cognitive Impairment means you're experiencing a slight decline in cognitive abilities – things like memory, thinking, and language – that's more noticeable than what's typical for your age. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, and many people with MCI never progress to those conditions. The blood tests are just to rule out any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. Brain imaging – a simple MRI or CT scan – helps us get a better look at your brain to see if there are any structural abnormalities or signs of stroke or other problems. It's not painful, and it doesn't involve any radiation. We're doing these tests to get a clear diagnosis and determine the best course of action. This will help us understand what's going on and whether any treatments or lifestyle changes might be helpful. We'll discuss the results thoroughly, and I'll answer all your questions. The goal is to give you the information you need to make informed decisions about your health. Would you like me to explain any of that in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A little more detail would be… helpful. What kind of lifestyle changes are we talking about? And what if… what if it is something serious? I am… a widower, you see. My wife… she always took care of everything. I am… a little frightened to face this alone. And what are the chances… what are the chances this could be… the Alzheimer’s?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel frightened, Mr. Gyamfi, and you are not alone in facing this. It’s very brave of you to ask these questions. Lifestyle changes we're talking about are things like regular exercise, a healthy diet, staying socially active, and engaging in mentally stimulating activities – puzzles, reading, learning a new skill. These can help protect your cognitive function and slow down any potential decline. As for the chances of it being Alzheimer’s, it’s too early to say. MCI can be caused by many different things, and not all of them are related to dementia. The neurologist will conduct a more thorough evaluation to determine the underlying cause and assess your risk factors. If it is determined to be Alzheimer’s, there are treatments available that can help manage symptoms and improve your quality of life. There are also numerous support groups and resources available to help you and your family cope with the challenges of the disease. And please know that you wouldn’t be facing this alone. I’m here to support you every step of the way, and we can connect you with other resources to ensure you have the help you need. Would you like me to write down the names of some local support groups and resources for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very kind. Support groups… that might be… helpful. To talk to others… who understand. And what about… the tests themselves? What do they involve? And how long will it take to get the results? I have… appointments, you see. My daughter… she helps me with everything. I do not want to… disrupt her schedule.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m printing out a list of local support groups now. As for the tests, the blood tests are fairly straightforward – just a quick draw of blood from your arm. It will take about 15-20 minutes. The neurologist will schedule a comprehensive cognitive assessment, which involves a series of questions and tasks designed to evaluate your memory, thinking, and language skills. This usually takes about an hour or two. They may also order a brain MRI or CT scan, which involves lying still inside a scanner for about 30-60 minutes. The results of the blood tests should be back within a few days. The results of the cognitive assessment and brain imaging may take a week or two to come back, as they need to be reviewed by the neurologist. I’ll help you coordinate the appointments with the neurologist, and we can work around your and your daughter’s schedule as much as possible. Here's the list of support groups. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’m here to support you through this process, Mr. Gyamfi. And remember, we're taking these steps to get a clear understanding of what's going on, so we can make informed decisions about your health. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is… very helpful. I think… I think that is all for now. I need to… process everything. And talk to my daughter. I appreciate your patience and kindness, Doctor. You have… been very reassuring. I will… schedule the appointments as soon as possible. And I will… be in touch if I have any questions.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. And remember, we're in this together. Take your time to process everything, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care.
