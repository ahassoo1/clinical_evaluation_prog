DOCTOR: Hi Derick, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. Condray, you said? Well, it's… my face and legs. They're puffed up. Been that way a bit now. Don't rightly know why, though. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, “puffed up” face and legs… and how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Hmm. Oh, goodness. A couple weeks, maybe? Hard to say, really. Time just… slips away, you know? It wasn’t sudden, not like I woke up one morning lookin' like a balloon. Just kinda… gradually got worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. Gradual onset can be tricky to pinpoint. And you said it’s uncomfortable – can you describe how uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Well, it's not painful, exactly. More… heavy. Like I'm carryin' extra weight, all the time. And my shoes feel tighter. It’s just… annoying. Makes it harder to get around, especially in the heat. My ankles feel kinda achy sometimes too, now that I think about it. Not bad, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy feeling, tightness in shoes, and some ankle aching. Have you noticed this swelling is worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah. Definitely worse at the end of the day. I work, you see. Welding and such. Standing a lot. It's always noticeably worse after a long day on my feet. Mornings are usually a little better, but it creeps back as the day goes on.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s related to being on your feet all day. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – like going more or less often, or difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Urination? Well, I go when I need to go. I haven’t been… payin’ much attention to it, if that makes sense. It hasn't been… different, not that I’ve noticed. Why would that matter? Is that somethin’ to worry about?
DOCTOR: It's just a question I ask to get a broader picture. Sometimes swelling can be related to kidney function, so changes in urination can be a clue. No need to worry yet, just gathering information. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… hmm. The doctor, back when my wife was still around, mentioned somethin’ about it bein’ a little high once. But he just told me to lay off the salt. Didn't give me any pills or nothin’. Never got around to really lookin' into it. Diabetes? No. Heart problems… not that I know of. I get a little short of breath sometimes when I’m climbin’ stairs, but I figured that was just gettin’ old. I haven’t been to a doctor in years, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, but never formally diagnosed or treated, and some shortness of breath with exertion. And you mentioned your wife passed away – I’m sorry for your loss. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Yeah… a long time ago. When I was a young man, I broke my leg. Skiin’. Had to have a pin put in. And… well, my wife was in the hospital a lot towards the end. Cancer. But me? Not much. Aside from that broken leg, nothin' major. A few stitches here and there over the years, but that's about it. It was a long time ago, though. Don’t remember the details much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken leg as a young man and your wife’s illness. Thank you for sharing that. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Not a one. Never been much for pills. Always figured if I could avoid 'em, I would. Don’t take nothin’. Maybe some aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. I don't trust 'em, really. Always got side effects, or so I've heard.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, environmental things like pollen?
PATIENT: Pollen? Well, I sneeze a bit in the spring, if that counts. But I wouldn’t call it an allergy. Just… normal sneezin'. I haven’t had any serious reactions to anythin’ that I know of. Food? Nope. I eat just about anything. Not picky. I remember once, back when I was a kid, I got a rash from poison ivy, but that’s about it. Nothing to write home about.
DOCTOR: Okay, seasonal allergies and a past reaction to poison ivy, but no serious known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems, or swelling in their legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had a weak heart towards the end. Spent some time in the hospital for it. And my father, he always complained about his kidneys, but I don’t know if it was anything serious. He just liked to complain. And… my sister, she had some swelling in her ankles when she was pregnant. But that was a long time ago, and she was pregnant. Other than that… not really. We weren't a family that talked much about health problems. Mostly just kept to ourselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your mother, kidney complaints in your father, and swelling in your sister during pregnancy. That's helpful. Finally, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I might have a beer with dinner now and then, but that’s about it. Not a drinker. And recreational drugs? I'm a welder, not a… whatever you call 'em. No, no drugs. Never been interested. A simple life is a good life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. Thank you for answering all those questions. Now, would you mind if I take a look at your face and legs, and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I suppose so. But I gotta warn ya, I don't like bein' poked and prodded. Just… be gentle, alright? And don't take too long. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I’ll try to be quick. Okay, I'm noticing some clear swelling in your face, particularly around your eyes and cheeks. It’s soft to the touch, and doesn’t appear to be painful. On your legs, the swelling is more pronounced around your ankles and lower calves. It’s also soft and non-tender. Your heart sounds are normal – no murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear to auscultation – I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. I'm also noting some slightly cool skin temperature in your lower legs.
PATIENT: Cool skin? What does that mean? Is that bad? My wife always said my circulation wasn’t the best. She used to rub my legs to warm 'em up. But she's gone now… 142… that's high, right? Like you said before, about my blood pressure? Is that somethin' I need to worry about? Don't tell me I need pills, Doc. I really don't want pills.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. 142/88 is elevated, and consistently high blood pressure can lead to health problems down the road. It doesn't mean you immediately need pills, but it's something we need to address. The cool skin temperature is a finding that, along with the swelling, can point towards a few different possibilities. Given your history and the exam findings, my primary concern right now is a couple of things: possible heart failure, or kidney issues. The swelling in your legs and face, along with the elevated blood pressure, are consistent with fluid retention. The cool skin can sometimes be seen with poor circulation. However, we need more information before we can say for sure. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a few other things. I also want to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And finally, I'd like to order a urine test. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… urine tests… an EKG… Goodness gracious. It's all gettin' a bit complicated, isn't it? My wife always said I should've just stayed a farmer. Simple life. Look, Doc, I don’t like all these tests. I don't like doctors, and I really don't like bein’ poked and prodded. Is it really necessary? I mean, can't it just be… old age? Or maybe I’ve just been standin' on my feet too much? I don't want to spend a fortune on tests I don't need, and I definitely don't want pills. Is there anything else I can do? Lay off the salt? Drink more water? Maybe just rest more?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I appreciate you being honest with me. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about unnecessary tests and medication. While lifestyle changes like reducing salt intake, staying hydrated, and getting enough rest are always a good idea, they aren't enough on their own to rule out more serious underlying causes for your symptoms. It's like trying to fix a car engine without knowing what's actually broken – you might make things a little better, but you won't know if there's a bigger problem brewing. The tests I've ordered are relatively simple, and they will give us valuable information about how your heart, kidneys, and other organs are functioning. They are the best way to determine the cause of your swelling and elevated blood pressure, and to ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. The cost of the tests will depend on your insurance coverage. We have a financial counselor who can help you understand the costs and explore any available assistance programs. If we don’t investigate this further, it could lead to more serious health problems down the road. I’m not trying to scare you, but it’s important to be proactive about your health. What I can do is order just the blood tests to start. We can review those results and decide if the EKG and urine test are necessary. Would that be more comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Just the blood tests, huh? Okay. That… that sounds a little better. A little less pokin’ and proddin’. But I gotta warn you, I faint easily. Needles… don't agree with me. And if they come back normal, no pills, alright? Promise me that. I'm serious, Doc. No pills. Where do I go to get these tests done? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be comin’ back here every day. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood tests to start. And I absolutely promise – if the results are normal, we will not be talking about pills. We can explore other options, like monitoring your blood pressure at home and making further lifestyle changes. The lab is just down the hall, in Suite 203. The phlebotomist – that’s the person who draws the blood – is very experienced and gentle. Tell them you get nervous around needles, and they’ll take extra care. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once they’re available, we’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment. I’ll also be sure to review them with you in detail. I'll write you a lab requisition with the necessary instructions. And don't hesitate to let the phlebotomist know if you're feeling faint or uncomfortable at any point. They are trained to handle those situations. Do you have any questions about the tests or the appointment?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just… three to five days, you said? Seems like a long time to wait, but… alright. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate you listenin' to me. And no pills, remember? I guess I’ll go get this over with. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to make this process as comfortable as possible. And yes, I absolutely remember – no pills unless absolutely necessary. Take your time getting to the lab, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. I’ll look forward to seeing you again when the results are back. Have a good day, Derick. .
