DOCTOR: Hi Sherion, welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… my chest. It’s been hurting. Not all the time, but… enough to worry me, you know? Like a tight feeling, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chest pain can definitely be worrying. Let's talk about that. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a little over a week ago? Around July 24th, I think. Yes, July 24th. My grandson, Mateo, was visiting, and I was helping him build a Lego tower… a very big Lego tower. Maybe I lifted something wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, July 24th, while building a Lego tower with Mateo. That's helpful. Can you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, you know? It’s more like… pressure. Like someone is sitting on my chest. And it sometimes goes up into my shoulder, my left shoulder mostly. Not always, but sometimes. It doesn’t really hurt when I breathe, not usually. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure in the chest, radiating to the left shoulder, not consistently with breathing… And does anything make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Let me see… resting helps. If I just sit down and take it easy, it usually goes away pretty quick. Maybe in ten, fifteen minutes. And… um… walking up the stairs makes it worse. Definitely worse. I live in an apartment building, so… lots of stairs. Not my favorite thing these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, resting improves it, and walking up stairs makes it worse. Have you noticed it happening at any particular time of day, or is it pretty random?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… it seems to be worse in the evenings. Like after dinner. Or if I've been doing something around the house, you know? Not every evening, but more often then in the mornings. And sometimes if I get a little… excited. Like watching my telenovelas! They are very dramatic.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse in the evenings, with activity or excitement. Have you had any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t been coughing, or feeling dizzy. No… shortness of breath, like I said. Maybe a little tired, but I'm 62, Doctor! A little tired is normal, right? I eat pretty good though, mostly Colombian food. My husband, Ricardo, is a wonderful cook.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, dizziness, or shortness of breath, just some fatigue. And eating well is great. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that you’ve been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Let me think… Ricardo always reminds me to tell the doctors everything. I have… high blood pressure. Yes, the doctor told me a few years ago. I take a little pill for it every morning. And… um… my cholesterol was a little high last time I checked, but the doctor said to watch my diet. So I try to eat less chicharrón when I can. It’s hard, though!
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and borderline high cholesterol. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Ricardo helps me with all of that. It’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. One little pill, every morning with my coffee. He makes sure I don’t forget. He’s very good. And I haven’t changed the dose or anything, I promise.
DOCTOR: Good, Lisinopril, stable dose. And have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… Years ago, when I was younger, I had my tonsils taken out. A long time ago. And… um… oh! I was in the hospital when I had Mateo, my grandson. A normal birth, nothing complicated. But that was a long time ago, too. No other surgeries, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a normal delivery with Mateo. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. Ricardo always asks when I get new prescriptions, and I’ve never had a reaction to anything. No trouble with food, no trouble with… bees or anything like that. I’m very lucky.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, a few questions about your family. Does anyone in your family have a history of heart problems, like heart attacks or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… My father, he… he had a heart attack when he was older. Yes. A long time ago. And my aunt, on my mother's side, she had a stroke, I think. But that was a long time ago, too. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, like me. But mostly, everyone lived a long life.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart attack in your father, stroke in an aunt, and high blood pressure in your mother. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor! Never. I don't smoke. Ricardo doesn't either. He always tells me, “Sherion, smoking is bad for you!” He's right, of course. We both like a little aguardiente sometimes, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking. And finally, let's talk about your activity level. What's a typical day like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I live in an apartment, so lots of walking up and down the stairs! I try to walk to the market a few times a week, it's not too far. I like to cook, and I spend a lot of time with Mateo when he visits. And, of course, I watch my telenovelas! I try to keep busy, but I get tired easily, you know? It's not like I'm running marathons or anything!
DOCTOR: Okay, so moderate activity with walking, cooking, spending time with Mateo, and watching TV. Alright, Sherion, thank you for all of that information. Based on what you’ve told me – the chest pressure, radiating to your left shoulder, worsening with activity, and your history of high blood pressure and a family history of heart problems – it’s important to rule out any heart-related issues. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and order a few tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? Listening and tests… yes, please. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and I'll take a reading. Okay, blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Okay, I'm hearing a normal heart rhythm, but there’s a slight murmur. Not a cause for immediate alarm, but something we’ll want to investigate further with an EKG. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. I'm going to order an EKG, which will measure the electrical activity of your heart. And I'd also like to order a blood test to check your cholesterol levels and rule out any other potential causes for your chest pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. An EKG and a blood test. Okay. What exactly will the EKG do? Will it hurt? I don't like needles, Doctor. For the blood test, that is.
DOCTOR: The EKG is very simple and doesn’t hurt at all. We'll just place a few small, sticky pads – electrodes – on your chest, arms, and legs. They detect the electrical signals of your heart and record them on a graph. It takes just a few minutes, and it's completely painless. As for the blood test, yes, it involves a needle, but it’s a quick prick, and most people don't even feel it. We’ll try to be as gentle as possible. The phlebotomist is very good. We’ll just need a small sample of blood. I’ll write the orders now. And just to be safe, I also want to order a chest X-ray. That will help us rule out any problems with your lungs or heart size.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray too? So many tests! Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? My grandson, Mateo, he worries about me. He’s very sweet. I don't want to scare him. I just want to know what’s going on with my chest, that's all. And I hope the blood test doesn't take too long. I have a new telenovela episode tonight!
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sherion, and I want to assure you that we’re just being thorough. These tests are routine and will help us get a clear picture of what’s going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. Chest pain should always be investigated, especially with your family history and blood pressure. We're ruling out the more serious possibilities. The tests usually don’t take long, and the X-ray technician is very efficient. As for the telenovela, hopefully, we’ll have some answers for you before then! We'll get you taken care of as quickly as we can. I will have the nurse come in and get you set up for the EKG, then we’ll get the lab orders for the blood test and the X-ray. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that's everything. Just… please, be gentle with the needle. And thank you for explaining everything so carefully. You’re very kind. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sherion. We'll take excellent care of you. I’ll let the nurse know to come in right away. And don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any concerns or if you’re feeling uncomfortable at any point. I’ll be right here. She'll be in shortly.
