DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin' to ya, Doctor... Quicksey, was it? Land sakes, things ain't what they used to be with my ears, that's for sure. That's why I'm here, I reckon. Just... can't hear like I used to. It's a bother, mostly. Folks mumble, and the TV's up so loud it rattles the windows.
DOCTOR: Yes, hearing loss is a very common concern, Mr. Schneer. It’s good you came in to have it checked. "A bother" is a good way to put it – it can certainly impact quality of life. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice? That's a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe a couple o' years? Hard to say, really. It wasn't sudden, y'know? Just… things got quieter and quieter. I used to be able to hear the birds singin' clear as a bell… now? Not so much. I mostly just figured I was gettin' old.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Schneer. Hearing does often change gradually with age, but it’s still important to investigate. A couple of years is helpful to know. And it's good you recognize a change from your previous hearing ability. Has this difficulty been getting progressively worse over those two years, or has it been relatively stable?
PATIENT: Oh, I think it’s been gettin' worse, yeah. Slowly, but surely. It seems like I gotta ask folks to repeat themselves more and more often. And the TV… well, my neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she complained about it the other day. Said she could hear my TV clear as a bell in her kitchen! That's when I figured I really oughta do somethin' about it.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like it’s definitely impacting both your daily life and those around you, Mr. Schneer. That’s good you’re addressing it now. Now, besides the difficulty hearing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can recall. Maybe… sometimes my ears feel a bit… stuffy? Like when you get on an airplane, y'know? But it doesn't last long. And… oh! Sometimes a little bit of a ringin' in my ears. Not always, just now and then. It’s not too bad, though. I mostly tune it out. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Yes, both the stuffiness and the ringing – what we call tinnitus – can be associated with hearing loss, Mr. Schneer. It’s good you mentioned those. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes. Medical history… that’s a tough one. I've lived a good long life, Doctor. I've had the usual bumps and bruises, I suppose. I had a touch of the flu a few years back, and… oh, my arthritis, of course. It flares up now and then, mostly in my hands and knees. Other than that… I can't rightly recall anything major. I see Dr. Henderson for my arthritis, but that’s about it. I haven’t been to a doctor much in the last few years, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schneer. Arthritis is helpful to be aware of. And it’s perfectly alright that you haven't needed to see a doctor frequently. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… surgeries… I had my tonsils out when I was a little boy. Must’ve been… oh, goodness, seventy years ago or more! And… I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist fallin' off a ladder when I was helpin' my neighbor with his roof. But that was a long time ago too. Other than that… I don’t think so. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schneer. Tonsillectomy and a wrist fracture are helpful to have on record. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take somethin' for my arthritis, a little white pill… I think it's naproxen? Dr. Henderson gave it to me. And… sometimes I take a baby aspirin if my knees are really botherin' me. Other than that… not much. I take a multi-vitamin every mornin' with my breakfast, but that’s about it. Just the basics, really. I try not to take too many pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Schneer. Naproxen and an occasional baby aspirin are helpful to know. And a multivitamin is good. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me think… not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anythin'. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle when the pollen's bad in the spring, but that's just seasonal, y'know? Nothing serious. I can eat pretty much anythin' without worryin’ about it. I've always had a pretty strong stomach, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schneer. No known allergies are helpful. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if anyone in your family has experienced hearing loss or other ear problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Land sakes, that’s a tricky one. My mother… I think her hearin' wasn’t the best when she got older, but she never really talked about it much. And my father… he was mostly deaf as a post the last few years of his life, but I don’t know why. Just that he couldn’t hear a thing. And I had an aunt, on my mother’s side, who had terrible earaches as a child, but I don’t know if that counts. It’s hard to say, really. We didn’t talk about that sort of thing much when I was growin' up.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Schneer. Sometimes family history can be difficult to recall. Knowing that your mother and father experienced hearing loss is helpful, even if the specific cause wasn’t known. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were the devil’s sticks, and I reckon she was right. Never saw the appeal, to be honest. And I don't drink much either, just a little bit of wine with dinner now and then. Mostly just to be sociable. I always preferred a good cup of tea, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schneer. No smoking history is excellent. Now, what do you do for work, or did you work in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I used to work in a shoe factory. For… oh, land sakes, must've been forty years or more. Operatin' the machines, makin' 'em shoes. It was noisy work, comin' to think of it. Lots of clatterin' and bangin'. But it was honest work, and it kept me busy. Retired now, of course. Haven't done a day's work in… oh, goodness, twenty years or more! Now I mostly just putter around the house and garden.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Schneer. Working in a shoe factory for forty years, especially with the noise, is important information. Now, before we proceed with an exam, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I reckon. You've asked me a whole heap o' questions! I suppose I just want to know… what do you think is wrong? Is it somethin' serious? Will I be able to hear the birds singin' again? That’s what I’m worryin' about, mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Mr. Schneer. Based on what you’ve told me – the gradual hearing loss over a couple of years, the noise exposure from your work, and the occasional tinnitus – the most likely cause is age-related hearing loss, sometimes called presbycusis, potentially worsened by the noise exposure. However, we need to do a quick exam to confirm that and rule out anything else. It doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t be able to hear the birds sing again. Often, hearing aids can significantly improve hearing and quality of life. But let's get the exam done first, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds…reasonable. Hearing aids, huh? I’ve heard tell of those. They ain’t as big and clunky as they used to be, are they? I reckon I’m ready for the exam then. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: No, they've come a long way, Mr. Schneer! They're very small and discreet now, and often quite comfortable. Alright. I’m going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope to make sure there’s no wax blockage or infection. Then, we’ll do a simple hearing test in the office. I'll play some tones at different pitches and volumes, and you’ll tell me when you can hear them. It’s painless and shouldn't take too long. Could you please sit up and face me?
PATIENT: Alright, sounds easy enough. Go ahead then, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Just tell me what to do. I ain’t as nimble as I used to be, but I can still follow directions!
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to gently insert this instrument into your ear canal to take a look at your eardrum. It may feel a little cool, but it shouldn't be painful. Please just let me know if you feel any discomfort. Hmm… Okay, your ear canal looks clear. The ear drum is a little dull in color, which can be normal with age, but otherwise it looks intact. And the left ear looks similar. A little dull, but intact. No signs of infection or fluid. Okay, that's good. Now, we'll move on to the hearing test. I'm going to put these headphones on you…
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm ready when you are, Doctor. This is all a bit new to me, but I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. I appreciate your patience. Now, I’m going to play some tones at different pitches and volumes in each ear. When you hear a tone, please raise your hand. It's important to be honest, even if it’s a very faint sound. We’re just trying to determine your hearing levels. Okay… and… again… and… excellent. Now the left ear…
PATIENT: Alright… alright… I think I heard that one! Yes, definitely heard that one. And… hmm… that one was faint. Barely audible. And… oh! Yes, I heard that one clear as a bell! It’s funny, some of them I hear easy, and others… not at all. This is a bit tiring, tryin’ to listen for those faint sounds.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. That was very helpful. You did a great job, even with the faint sounds. Okay, the results confirm what we suspected. You have a moderate to severe hearing loss in both ears, particularly in the higher frequencies. This explains why you're having difficulty hearing conversations and the birds singing. It's consistent with age-related hearing loss. Now, this doesn’t mean you have to live with this. Hearing aids would likely make a significant improvement in your ability to communicate and enjoy everyday sounds. Would you be interested in discussing that further?
PATIENT: Hearing aids, huh? Like I said, I've heard tell of 'em. Always thought they’d be awful expensive, and… well, I always figured I was just gettin’ old. But… if they really could help me hear the birds singin’ again… Yes, I reckon I’d be interested in discussin’ ‘em. Tell me about ‘em. What kind are there? How much do they cost? And… would they be comfortable? I don't want nothin’ stickin’ out of my ears!
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Schneer. There are several different types of hearing aids available now. The most common are “behind-the-ear” and “in-the-ear” models. BTE aids sit behind your ear and have a small tube that carries the sound into your ear canal. ITE aids fit directly inside your ear. Both come in different sizes and styles. As for comfort, modern hearing aids are designed to be very discreet and comfortable. They're custom-molded to fit your ear, so they shouldn't feel like anything’s sticking out. The cost can vary depending on the technology and features. A basic digital hearing aid typically starts around $2,000 for one aid and $4,000 for a pair. More advanced models with noise cancellation and Bluetooth connectivity can cost more. Most insurance plans, including Medicare, will cover a portion of the cost. I can refer you to a local audiologist who can perform a more comprehensive hearing evaluation and help you choose the best hearing aid for your needs and budget. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: $2,000… Land sakes! That is a bit o’ money. Still… if they really could help… Medicare, you say? That’s good to know. I don’t want to be spendin’ a fortune on somethin’ I might not even like. Yes, I reckon I'd like to see an audiologist. If you could refer me to someone local, that'd be wonderful. I trust your judgment, Doctor. You've been very helpful so far.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here’s a referral to Dr. Emily Carter, a highly-rated audiologist right here in town. She’s very experienced with fitting hearing aids and can answer all your questions. The slip includes her contact information and address. She accepts Medicare. Before you go, do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that about covers it. You've been very patient with an old man and answered all my questions. I appreciate that. Thank you kindly, Doctor Quicksey. I'll give Dr. Carter a call and see what she says. I think that's all for today. I'm grateful for your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns after your appointment with Dr. Carter. I hope she can help you find a solution that works for you. Have a wonderful day, and I wish you the best of luck!
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor. You too. I think I’ll be seein’ you again. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Schneer. Take care.
