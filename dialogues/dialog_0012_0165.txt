DOCTOR: Hi Clide, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors, to be honest. But this fever… it keeps coming back. It’s been happening for, oh, maybe a month now? On and off. It’s just… annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month of recurring fever. I understand it's more annoying than anything right now, but we definitely want to figure out what's causing it. Can you tell me a little more about the fever itself?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts in the afternoon, feels kinda like the flu, you know? Chills, a little headache. Nothing too bad, I don't take anything for it usually. It goes away after a day or so, then comes back a week later, maybe ten days. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. I don't have a thermometer, never really needed one. It feels warm, though, definitely warmer than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it comes on with chills and headache, lasts about a day, then goes away for a week or so, and you'd describe it as feeling warm to the touch. No real high fever that you’ve noticed, just a general feeling of being warm. And just to clarify, when you say it feels like the flu, are you experiencing any other symptoms with the fever – like cough, body aches, sore throat, nausea, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No cough, no sore throat. Sometimes my muscles feel a little achy, but I do a lot of work, you know? I'm a chiropractor. So, aches and pains are kinda normal for me. And no, no nausea or anything like that. Mostly just tired and… uncomfortable. It doesn’t knock me down, I can still work, but I don't feel 100%. It's just… persistent, you know? That's what bothers me. It keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent is definitely concerning, even if it's not debilitating. Okay, so no cough, sore throat, nausea. Some muscle aches that you attribute to work, which makes sense given your profession. And the fever itself is causing fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. I've been pretty healthy, honestly. I eat okay, try to stay active, and I’ve never really been sick with anything serious. I had the flu once, a long time ago, but that’s about it. My wife keeps telling me I need to go to the doctor more, but I always tell her I’m fine. This fever's the first thing that's really bothered me in years.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy! It sounds like this fever is a bit of an anomaly for you. Okay, no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Not even for my tonsils when I was a kid. My wife will tell you I'm stubborn about these things. I try to tough it out. But this… it's been a month. I just want to know why it keeps coming back, you know? And if there’s something I need to worry about.
DOCTOR: I completely understand wanting to know the cause and whether there's anything to worry about. That's exactly what we're here for. Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune diseases, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother… she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. That runs on her side of the family, I believe. Nothing too serious, though. My wife’s family… I don't really know them that well, honestly. We don’t see them often. She has a cousin with… I think it was asthma? But that’s all I can really think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your father and arthritis in your mother. And a cousin on your wife's side with asthma. Good to know. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I’ll have a beer with dinner sometimes, maybe a glass of wine, but nothing heavy. And definitely no drugs. My wife would kill me. I’m a pretty straight-laced guy, Doctor. Honest. I spend most of my time at work or with my wife. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, occasional alcohol use, no smoking or drug use. And finally, are you allergic to any medications or anything else – like food, pollen, or insect stings?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. I can eat anything, no problem. I've been stung by a bee once or twice, but no reaction worse than a little swelling. Honestly, I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I haven't had any serious health problems in my life. That's why this fever is so weird. I just want to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. It sounds like you've been very fortunate with your health up until now, and that’s why this recurring fever is understandably concerning. Alright, Clide, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, take your temperature, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. Get this over with, if you know what I mean. I got patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. We'll be as quick as possible. Okay, let’s start with your temperature. Okay, your temperature is slightly elevated at 100.7. Now let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80. Everything sounds and feels normal so far, but the recurring fever and elevated temperature warrant further investigation. I want to order some blood work to help us determine the cause. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Look, I don't really like needles, to be honest. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, if it’s just a little fever… could it just be a virus? Something that will go away on its own? I really don't want to go through a bunch of tests if it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about needles, and I want to assure you we’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. You’re right to ask about a virus – that’s certainly a possibility. However, because this fever has been recurring for a month, and we haven't identified a clear cause, it's important to rule out other potential issues. The blood work will help us look for signs of infection, inflammation, or other underlying conditions. Think of it as gathering information to make the best decision for your health. Without it, we're just guessing. The tests will include a complete blood count to check your white blood cell count, and a metabolic panel to assess your organ function. If the results come back normal, we can likely attribute it to a virus and monitor your symptoms. But if we find anything abnormal, it will give us a clearer direction for treatment. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. You're right. Better to be safe than sorry, I guess. But… how much blood are we talking about? And will it take long? I got appointments stacked up this afternoon, you know? I really don't have a lot of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time. It’s just a standard blood draw – a few vials, about 2-3 teaspoons worth. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes. Then we'll send the samples to the lab, and the results usually come back within 24-48 hours. We can call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I'd recommend getting some rest, staying hydrated, and monitoring your symptoms. If you develop any new symptoms – like severe headache, stiff neck, rash, difficulty breathing, or chest pain – please seek immediate medical attention. Shall we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Let's get it over with. But… can you tell the person drawing the blood to be quick? And gentle, please. I really don’t like needles. Just… get it done, okay? I got patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll speak with the phlebotomist and explain your concerns. They are very experienced and will do their best to make you comfortable. Okay, let me go ahead and get them ready for you. It will just be a moment. I'll be right back.
