DOCTOR: Hi Rayshun, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor Rosanova. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here regarding a matter with my work. Specifically, the requirement to wear masks and other protective gear. I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re hoping to discuss a possible exemption from wearing masks and other protective gear at work. That's perfectly reasonable to bring up. To help me understand the situation better, can you tell me a little bit about your job, and what kind of gear you’re required to wear?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a Protective Service Worker – it’s a bit of everything, really. Mostly, I assist individuals and families who are experiencing difficulties. Sometimes that means home visits, sometimes it’s paperwork, and sometimes it’s accompanying folks to appointments. Recently, my employer has made the wearing of masks and, occasionally, face shields, mandatory for all interactions. It’s… not fitting well with my health. Not a sickness, exactly, but more of a… discomfort. I haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, Protective Service Worker, lots of different interactions, home visits, paperwork, appointments… I see. And the masks and shields are causing you discomfort, not a specific illness. That’s helpful to know. You mentioned not being formally diagnosed – can you describe the discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It's… difficult to explain precisely. It feels like a constriction, a pressure, across my face and… well, in my head, too. It makes it hard to focus, and I get a bit lightheaded after a short time wearing them. It’s more than just being uncomfortable, it’s… disorienting. It feels like it affects my breathing as well, though I haven't been short of breath, it just feels… restricted. It's hard to be fully present with the people I'm trying to help when I'm preoccupied with how I feel.
DOCTOR: Okay, constriction and pressure across the face and head, difficulty focusing, lightheadedness, and a feeling of restricted breathing. That sounds quite distressing, and I can certainly understand how it would impact your ability to do your job effectively. Have you experienced this discomfort with masks before, or is this a new issue with the recent requirement?
PATIENT: It’s a relatively new issue, Doctor. I’ve worn masks before, when necessary – a doctor’s appointment, a quick trip to the store – and it wasn't a problem. It was… manageable. But these masks are different. They're a tighter fit, and we're required to wear them for extended periods, sometimes hours at a time. I didn’t experience this issue with the looser-fitting surgical masks. This is more of… a full face covering, if that makes sense. I hadn't really thought much about it before now, but I think it might be the tight seal that’s causing the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's the tighter-fitting masks, worn for extended periods, that seem to be triggering the issue. And you hadn’t experienced this with looser surgical masks. That’s very useful information. Do you have any history of anxiety, claustrophobia, or other conditions that might be related?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety or claustrophobia. I've always been a fairly calm person, and I don’t generally feel confined or distressed in small spaces. I spend a lot of time outdoors, actually – walking, hiking. I enjoy being in open areas. I haven't had any issues with panic attacks or similar symptoms. It really does feel like a physical discomfort, more than a psychological one.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No history of anxiety or claustrophobia, and you generally feel comfortable in open spaces. So, it sounds like this is primarily a physical issue. Have you tried different types of masks to see if one is more tolerable than others?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. My employer provided a few different options – the N95s, the cloth ones with the metal nose piece, and some of the surgical-style masks. I’ve tried them all, and unfortunately, they all cause the same discomfort. The N95s are the worst, because of how tightly they seal. The cloth ones are a bit better, but still restrict my breathing enough to be distracting. And the surgical ones, while the most comfortable, still aren’t tolerable for extended periods.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve tried different types – N95s, cloth, surgical – and none are really tolerable for the length of time you need to wear them. That's helpful to know. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to check your respiratory rate, listen to your lungs, and just get a general sense of your overall health. It's standard procedure when we’re investigating breathing concerns, even if they seem related to the mask itself. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please proceed. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up straight for me. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, heart sounds are regular and strong. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now I'll check your respiratory rate. Your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, which is within the normal range. Let me just palpate your sinuses to see if there's any tenderness. No tenderness to palpation. And finally, let's check your oxygen saturation. Oxygen saturation is 98%, which is excellent. Everything sounds physically normal at this point.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to do a thorough examination. I was a bit concerned it might be something more serious, so it’s reassuring to know everything sounds normal. What are your thoughts on the possibility of an exemption, given these findings?
DOCTOR: Okay, so everything sounds physically normal, which is good. Given the lack of any underlying respiratory issues, and the fact that you've tried different mask types without success, it seems likely that you're experiencing a sensitivity or discomfort related to the mask itself, rather than a medical condition that would preclude mask-wearing. However, an exemption isn’t something I can simply grant. It would require documentation and potentially further investigation. To best support your request, I would recommend a consultation with an allergist or an otolaryngologist . They can assess for any underlying nasal or sinus issues that might be contributing to your discomfort, and provide a more definitive assessment. Would you be open to a referral to one of those specialists?
PATIENT: That makes perfect sense, Doctor. I understand the need for further documentation and a more specialized assessment. A referral to an allergist or ENT specialist sounds like a very reasonable next step. Yes, I would definitely be open to that. I’m willing to do whatever is necessary to get a clearer understanding of this issue and to explore all possible options. Thank you for your guidance.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’m happy to write a referral for you to see Dr. Anya Sharma, a board-certified allergist in the city. She’s very thorough and has experience with patients experiencing mask-related sensitivities. I’ll also include a summary of our conversation and the physical exam findings in the referral. I’ll send it to your primary care physician for their records as well. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to help document your situation for your employer?
PATIENT: That is very kind of you, Doctor. Dr. Sharma sounds like an excellent choice. I appreciate you taking the time to prepare a detailed referral. As for documentation for my employer… a simple note stating that I am undergoing evaluation for mask-related discomfort, and that I am following medical advice, would be tremendously helpful. Anything to demonstrate that I am taking this seriously and proactively seeking a solution. I can handle the rest with my HR department, but a note from your office would be very valuable. Thank you again for your support.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you go. This note summarizes our conversation, the physical exam findings, and the referral to Dr. Sharma. It also states that you are undergoing evaluation for mask-related discomfort and are following medical advice. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: That is perfect, Doctor Rosanova. Thank you so much for your time, your thorough examination, and your willingness to help. This note is exactly what I needed. I believe that will be sufficient for my employer for the time being. I do not believe there is anything further you can assist me with at this moment. I appreciate your kindness and professionalism. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshun. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns after your appointment with Dr. Sharma. I wish you all the best in getting this resolved. You have a good day as well. .
PATIENT: .
