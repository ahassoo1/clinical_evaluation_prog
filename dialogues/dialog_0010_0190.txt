DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Lilyanna. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been… experiencing some unsteadiness. A bit of a balance issue, really. It’s difficult to explain precisely. It’s not constant, but it’s… concerning. I don't recall exactly when it started, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteadiness, a balance issue. And it's intermittent, not constant, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Intermittent. It comes and goes. Some days I feel… perfectly alright, and others… well, I feel as though I might fall. It’s not a sharp fall, usually just… a wobble. Though, I do believe there was one instance where I nearly stumbled quite badly. But the details are… hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you experience this “wobble”, can you describe it?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to put into words. It doesn’t feel like weakness, exactly. More like… the room is swaying, perhaps? Or… I am swaying within the room. It’s not dizziness, not a spinning sensation. Just… off-balance. I find myself needing to hold onto things sometimes, just to steady myself. And it seems to happen… more when I’m tired, I think. Though not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it feels like the room is moving, or you are moving within the room, not a spinning sensation, and is worsened by fatigue, but not consistently. Have you noticed anything that improves the feeling, or makes it worse besides tiredness?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me see… I believe… standing still sometimes helps. If I can find a solid surface to lean against, it eases it. As for worse… quick movements, perhaps? Turning my head too quickly… or bending down. And… being in crowded places. There’s so much movement around you, it feels… unsettling. It’s hard to explain. It’s not painful, just… disorienting.
DOCTOR: Okay, standing still helps, quick movements and crowded places make it worse. Not painful, just disorienting. Now, have you had any headaches associated with this?
PATIENT: Headaches…? I… believe I have had some, yes. But they’re not… severe. More like a dull ache, around the temples. They come and go, much like the unsteadiness, actually. I hadn't thought to connect the two… perhaps they are related? I don't know. It’s all rather… muddled. I don't recall ever seeking treatment for them specifically. They just… go away on their own.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild, intermittent headaches, sometimes around the temples. Let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your vision – blurry vision, double vision, spots, anything like that?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, perhaps a little. My vision… isn’t as sharp as it used to be. It’s subtle, though. I attributed it to… well, simply getting older. And working long hours. Occasionally, things seem… a bit blurry, especially at the edges of my vision. But it’s fleeting. It doesn’t happen all the time. Double vision? No, I don't think so. Not that I recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you experienced any ringing in your ears, nausea, vomiting, or any difficulty hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing in my ears… No, I don’t believe so. Though… my hearing hasn’t been the best lately, if that counts. I often have to ask people to repeat themselves, especially in noisy environments. But I always assumed that was just age-related, too. Nausea or vomiting? No, thankfully not. I haven’t been sick in… well, I can’t recall the last time. It’s been quite a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My memory isn’t what it once was, Doctor. I… I was married, you see. My husband… he handled most of the medical appointments. And since… since his passing… I haven't really had much need for… regular check-ups. I believe I had… the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, rubella, things of that nature. But any significant conditions? I’m afraid I couldn’t say with certainty. I believe I was told I had high blood pressure at one point, but that was… years ago. I don't recall taking anything for it.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, possible history of hypertension, childhood illnesses, but nothing definitive you recall being actively treated for. And you mentioned your husband handled medical appointments. Do you have any records of past medical history we could access, perhaps through him or another doctor?
PATIENT: That’s… a kind thought, Doctor, but I’m afraid not. My husband… he passed away quite suddenly. And he wasn’t… a particularly organized man, shall we say. All of his records… were lost, unfortunately. And I haven't seen a doctor regularly enough to have established my own, comprehensive file. I’m… truly sorry. My memory is so fragmented. It’s frustrating, even for me. I do have private insurance, if that is of any assistance?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. Insurance is helpful. We can certainly work with that. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I haven’t needed to take anything regularly since… well, since my husband passed. I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, if it’s particularly bad, but that’s… infrequent. And I used to take a multivitamin, years ago, but I stopped. I don't have any regular prescriptions. Nothing at all, really. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, occasional ibuprofen for headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never knowingly had an allergic reaction to anything. I eat most foods without issue. And I haven’t experienced any skin rashes or breathing difficulties that I would attribute to allergies. I’ve never been formally tested, if that makes a difference. I apologize for my lack of precise information, Doctor. It’s… truly frustrating, not being able to recall these details.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family - heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… a difficult question. My family is… was… quite large. And scattered across Ethiopia. I wasn’t particularly close to many of them. I know my grandmother… she lived to a very old age, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses she suffered from. I believe my uncle… on my mother’s side… had some sort of heart trouble, perhaps? But I’m not certain. And my father’s side… I barely knew them. I’m afraid I can’t provide you with much useful information on that front, Doctor. It’s all rather vague and fragmented. I wish I could be of more assistance.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, vague history of potential heart trouble on your mother’s side. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with a special meal, once or twice a year. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I believe in a healthy lifestyle, and I take good care of myself. As much as my memory allows, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay. Non-smoker, rarely drinks alcohol, no recreational drug use. And finally, can you tell me about your current living situation?
PATIENT: I… I live alone, Doctor. My husband and I… we shared a small house in the suburbs. It’s a bit too large for just me now, but… it holds a lot of memories. I manage alright, I believe. I have a small garden, which keeps me occupied. And a few… acquaintances. But mostly, I keep to myself. It’s… quiet. I’m independent, and I’m capable. But… it can be lonely sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. You live alone in the suburbs, independent, but it can be lonely. Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Lilyanna. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment completely. Please, proceed. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I’m just… a little anxious, if I’m honest. It’s unsettling, not knowing what’s causing this unsteadiness. But I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll take things slowly. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, normal rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 78 and regular. Slightly elevated blood pressure, but not drastically so. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Now, could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can… I think. Is this… alright? It’s a little difficult to focus, sometimes. Everything seems… slightly blurry. But I’m following it. I believe I am.
DOCTOR: Okay. There’s a slight nystagmus, very subtle, but present. Now, I’m going to check your balance and coordination. Could you stand with your feet together and close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright… I’m standing… but I feel… Oh dear… It’s a little unsteady. I feel as though I might fall. It’s better with my eyes open. I don't recommend I continue like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. That's enough for now. It’s good we observed that. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Finally, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are normal. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, the intermittent unsteadiness, slight nystagmus, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I have a few possibilities in mind. Do you have any history of migraines?
PATIENT: Migraines… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve experienced headaches, as we discussed, but… not migraines. Not the kind with auras or nausea, or extreme sensitivity to light. Just… a dull ache, around the temples. Occasionally. But… no, I wouldn't say I have a history of migraines. Though… truthfully, it’s difficult to recall with certainty. Are you concerned? What possibilities are you considering, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good we’re clarifying this. Based on your history and the exam findings, several possibilities exist. The intermittent unsteadiness could be related to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo , which is a common inner ear problem, or potentially related to your slightly elevated blood pressure, though the blood pressure is not drastically high. The slight nystagmus suggests a possible inner ear issue. The headaches, while not classic migraines, could be contributing to your overall discomfort. Because of the nystagmus, I’d like to order some further testing. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an MRI of the brain to rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. But… if it’s necessary to determine the cause of this unsteadiness, then yes, of course. Whatever is required. Will the MRI involve… contrast? I've heard some things… And… what is a basic metabolic panel, exactly? I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It’s… reassuring. But I'm understandably anxious.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question. The MRI will be with and without contrast, yes. The contrast helps to visualize certain tissues more clearly. It is generally very safe, though there are some rare risks, such as an allergic reaction, which we will monitor for closely. We’ll have you fill out a questionnaire beforehand to assess any potential allergies or contraindications. A basic metabolic panel is a blood test that measures various levels in your blood, such as electrolytes, kidney function, and blood sugar. It helps to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. We’ll also do a Dix-Hallpike maneuver to see if we can provoke the nystagmus and diagnose BPPV. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: A Dix-Hallpike maneuver… and the contrast… Yes, that… clarifies things somewhat. I’m still a little anxious, but… I understand that you’re trying to determine the cause of this unsteadiness, and that these tests are necessary. Will the results of these tests be available quickly? And… what if something is found? What are the potential treatments for these conditions? I apologize for all of the questions, Doctor. I’m just… trying to prepare myself.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Lilyanna. It's good you're asking questions. The results of the blood tests should be available within 24-48 hours. The MRI results typically take a bit longer, around 2-3 business days. If the Dix-Hallpike maneuver is positive, indicating BPPV, the treatment is a series of simple head maneuvers called the Epley maneuver, which can often resolve the problem quickly. If the MRI reveals any other abnormalities, we’ll discuss the findings with you in detail and develop a treatment plan based on the specific condition. For example, if it reveals a stroke, we’ll need to consider medication and rehabilitation. If it's something else, we’ll explore other options. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding sudden movements, staying well-hydrated, and getting enough rest. I’m also going to prescribe you a low dose of meclizine to help with the dizziness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Meclizine… Yes, that sounds… sensible. Anything to alleviate the dizziness would be appreciated. And the Epley maneuver… is that… painful? Will it be performed here, in the clinic? I suppose… I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m ready to proceed with the tests, and… whatever treatment is required. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and… your reassurance. I suppose we should schedule the tests, then?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The Epley maneuver is not painful, though it can sometimes be a little uncomfortable, a brief spinning sensation. It will be performed here in the clinic, it takes only a few minutes. Our scheduling department will contact you to arrange the blood work and MRI. I’ll also have them set up an appointment for us to review the results and discuss a treatment plan. We'll start with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver now. Would you please sit on the examination table facing towards the side?
PATIENT: Alright… I’m seated. Please, let me know if I need to do anything. I’m… ready, I think. Though I must admit, I’m feeling rather apprehensive.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, I’m going to ask you to turn your head 45 degrees to the right. Now I'm going to quickly move you into this lying position. Don't worry, I’ll support your head. I'm observing your eyes now... Okay, we're back to sitting. Alright. We will repeat the maneuver to the left side now. I'm going to ask you to turn your head 45 degrees to the left, and then quickly lie back.
PATIENT: Alright… lying back… Oh dear… that was… unsettling. I believe I felt… a spinning sensation. And… I think I saw… everything moving. Please, let me know the results. I’m… anxious to understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, you can slowly sit back up now. Alright, Lilyanna. Based on the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, it appears you have a positive result for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV, on both sides. This means that the small crystals in your inner ear have become dislodged, causing the dizziness when you change positions. The good news is that this is very treatable with a series of maneuvers called the Epley maneuver, which we can perform here in the clinic today. Are you ready to proceed with that?
PATIENT: BPPV… and it’s treatable…? That… that is a relief. If it can be treated, then yes, please. Let’s proceed with the Epley maneuver. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever is required to alleviate this dizziness, I’m willing to try. Please, let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The Epley maneuver involves a series of head movements designed to reposition the crystals in your inner ear. We'll start by having you sit up, then quickly lie back, turning your head to the right. I will guide you through each step and support your head throughout the process. It may cause a brief period of dizziness, but it should not be painful. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes… I’m ready. Please, guide me through it. I’ll do my best to follow your instructions. Just… tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. First, I'm going to ask you to quickly lie back, with your head turned 45 degrees to the right. I will support your head throughout. Okay, hold that position for 30 seconds. Now, we’re going to quickly rotate your head 45 degrees to the left. Hold that position for 30 seconds. Alright, slowly sit back up. Okay, Lilyanna, we may need to repeat this maneuver a few times to achieve the best results. For now, I want you to avoid lying flat, bending over, or turning your head quickly for the next 24 hours. We'll re-evaluate you in a few days to see if the symptoms have improved. I’m also going to give you some instructions on vestibular rehabilitation exercises to help restore your balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… I think I’m… sitting up. It was… unsettling, but not painful. Avoid lying flat… and bending over… Yes, I can do that. Vestibular rehabilitation exercises… That sounds… sensible. Anything to restore my balance would be appreciated. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and your guidance. Hopefully, this maneuver has been successful. I’ll follow your instructions carefully and… hopefully, I’ll be feeling better soon. Is there anything else I need to know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. It’s good that we were able to identify the cause of your dizziness and perform the Epley maneuver. It often takes a few days for the symptoms to completely resolve, but most people experience significant improvement within a week. You may experience some brief periods of dizziness or nausea in the meantime, but these should be mild and self-limiting. I’m going to give you a handout with detailed instructions on the vestibular rehabilitation exercises. If your symptoms worsen or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to re-evaluate your progress. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve answered all of my questions and… you’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. Thank you again for everything. I’ll follow your instructions carefully and… I’ll see you next week. I believe that will be all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could help, Lilyanna. Just remember to take things slowly and follow the instructions carefully. If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT:
