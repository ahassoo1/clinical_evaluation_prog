DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Quicksey. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg has gotten quite swollen, and... I have a bit of a heart problem, they told me it was called... atrial fib... something? I think. It’s been happening for a while now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nixon. It is good to meet you as well. Okay, so you're experiencing swelling in your left leg and you’ve been told you have atrial fibrillation, or AFib. That's helpful to know. Let's start with the swelling in your leg. Can you tell me when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm, when did I first notice it... That's a good question. I suppose it was... maybe about a week ago? It started small, just feeling a bit heavier, but it's gotten worse each day. I didn't think much of it at first, just thought I was on my feet too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, gradually worsening. And you haven’t experienced any injury to your leg that you recall?
PATIENT: No, no injury at all. Nothing I can remember, anyway. I haven't been doing anything different, not that I recall. Just my usual routine, mostly at the computer, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is the swelling present all day, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It's... worse at the end of the day, I think. In the mornings it's not too bad, but by evening... it’s quite noticeable. Especially if I've been sitting for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse at the end of the day and after prolonged sitting. Do you notice any pain or tenderness with the swelling, or is it just the size that's bothering you?
PATIENT: It's mostly just the size, really. It doesn't hurt, not exactly. It feels a bit… tight, maybe? And heavy, of course. It’s just uncomfortable, and I worry it will keep getting bigger.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness and heaviness, without significant pain. We'll definitely want to take a look at that. Now, you mentioned your heart condition – the atrial fibrillation. Are you currently taking any medications for that?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. The doctor – Dr. MacLeod, back in Inverness – prescribed me something… a small white pill. I take one every morning and one every evening. I… I can't remember the name of it, I'm afraid. I have the bottle here though, if that helps?
DOCTOR: That would be very helpful, Nixon, thank you. Having the bottle will allow me to confirm the medication. While you’re getting that, could you tell me if you've had any other symptoms related to your heart condition?
PATIENT: Here you are. And… other symptoms? Well, sometimes I feel a bit breathless, especially if I try to do too much. And… my heart sometimes feels like it's fluttering, or racing, I suppose. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s… unsettling when it does.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Apixaban, 5 milligrams, twice a day. Good. It’s important you’re taking that as prescribed. You mentioned breathlessness and a fluttering sensation in your chest. How often would you say you experience those symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… the breathlessness isn’t very often, maybe once or twice a week, if that. It's usually just when I'm going up stairs, or trying to carry something heavy. The fluttering… that’s a bit more frequent. Maybe a couple of times a day, sometimes more, sometimes less. It doesn't last long, usually just a few seconds, but it’s worrying. It feels… irregular.
DOCTOR: Okay, so breathlessness with exertion a couple of times a week, and the irregular heartbeat sensation several times a day, lasting a few seconds at a time. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like dizziness, lightheadedness, or chest pain accompanying those palpitations?
PATIENT: No, not dizziness or lightheadedness, thankfully. And no chest pain either. Just the… the feeling of it skipping, or racing. It doesn't hurt, like I said, but it’s a bit frightening. It makes me feel… anxious, if I'm honest. I worry it's getting worse.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Nixon. It's good that you're paying attention to these changes. Now, let’s move on to some more general questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat most things, and I’ve never had any problems with medicine. My mum always said I was a hardy child.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, besides the Apixaban, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing else at all. Just the Apixaban, as we’ve discussed. I don’t really take vitamins or supplements, I always forget! I try to eat well, but… sometimes it’s hard. Mostly I just drink a lot of tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, Dr. MacLeod diagnosed me with the atrial fib about two years ago, but other than that… I haven't had much trouble, really. I had chickenpox when I was a child, and I broke my arm once, but nothing serious. I wouldn’t say I have a history of illness. I’ve always been quite healthy, until this heart business.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history aside from the atrial fibrillation. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve managed to avoid those thankfully! I don’t like the thought of them, to be honest. And I’ve never been in hospital, except for when I was born, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, can you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mum had high blood pressure, I think, but she didn't really talk about it much. My grandfather… on my father's side… he had something with his heart, I believe. But I don’t know what, exactly. It was a long time ago, and no one really discussed it. I'm not very good at remembering family medical history, I’m afraid. It's not something we talked about a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of high blood pressure and a potential heart condition in your grandfather, but limited details. And finally, a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke, and I don't drink alcohol either. I've never been much for either, to be honest. I prefer a nice cup of tea, as I mentioned earlier.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking or alcohol use. And what do you do for work or school, Nixon?
PATIENT: I'm a computer science teacher, postsecondary. I teach at the local college. It's mostly sitting at a desk, which I suppose isn't very good for my legs, now that I think about it. It’s a good job, though, I enjoy it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a computer science teacher. And do you have a lot of travel involved with that, or are you mostly stationary?
PATIENT: No, not much travel at all. I mostly stay at the college. Sometimes I have to go to conferences, but that’s only a couple of times a year, and they are usually just a short drive away. Mostly I’m at my desk, or walking between classrooms. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Nixon. That gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your legs to assess the swelling. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Please go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that alright? I can try to breathe deeper if you like.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Nixon. Okay, your lungs sound clear. I did hear a slightly irregular rhythm and some extra heart sounds, which is consistent with your atrial fibrillation. Now, let's take a look at your legs. Could you please point your toes upwards for me?
PATIENT: Yes, like this? It feels a bit stiff, to be honest. But I can do it. Is this alright?
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm feeling some mild tightness in your left leg, and it is definitely larger in circumference than your right leg. There is no significant tenderness. I also checked your pulses in both feet, and they are present and equal. Based on your history and this exam, it seems you're experiencing swelling in your left leg, likely due to fluid retention. The irregular heartbeat we heard is consistent with your atrial fibrillation, and that can contribute to swelling. We'll need to investigate the cause of the swelling further. I would like to order a few tests, including a D-dimer to rule out a blood clot, and a complete blood count to assess your overall health. We should also consider an EKG to assess the current state of your heart. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A D-dimer… and a complete blood count…? And an EKG…? Oh dear. I… I don't know what any of those are, to be honest. Is something seriously wrong? I'm worried about a blood clot… Is that what you're checking for? I… I feel a bit anxious now. Could you explain what those tests are, and why you're ordering them? And… will they be painful?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Nixon. It's good that you're asking questions. Let me explain everything. A D-dimer is a blood test that checks for a substance released when a blood clot breaks down. It's a simple blood draw, and it doesn't require any special preparation. A complete blood count is another blood test that gives us information about your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It helps us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying infections or other conditions. And an EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't involve any needles or electricity going into your body. We simply place small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure the electrical signals. The purpose of these tests is to help us determine the cause of the swelling in your leg. While a blood clot is a possibility, it’s just one of several things it could be. The swelling could also be related to your atrial fibrillation, or to other medical conditions. The tests themselves are not painful. The blood draw might cause a brief pinch, and the EKG stickers might feel a bit cool on your skin. Would you like me to explain any of those tests in more detail?
PATIENT: That… that does sound a bit less frightening when you explain it like that. Thank you. An EKG doesn’t involve electricity going into my body? That’s good. And just a pinch for the blood draw… I can manage that. So, you're saying it’s not necessarily a blood clot? Just trying to rule it out? And the swelling could be from my heart condition… that makes sense, I suppose. Yes, please, could you explain a bit more about the complete blood count? What kind of things does it tell you? And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m rather anxious about waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. We're ruling out a blood clot, but we also need to investigate other possibilities. The swelling could certainly be related to your atrial fibrillation, as fluid retention can be a symptom. The complete blood count, or CBC, gives us a lot of information. It looks at three main types of cells in your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. The CBC tells us if you have enough red blood cells, and if they are the right size and shape. White blood cells help fight infections. The CBC tells us if your white blood cell count is normal, which can indicate if you have an infection. And platelets help your blood clot. The CBC tells us if your platelet count is normal, which can indicate if you have a bleeding disorder. It's a very comprehensive test that gives us a good overall picture of your health. The results usually take about 24 to 48 hours. I know waiting can be anxiety-provoking, but it's important to get accurate results. I’ll call you as soon as they are available, and we can discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain or redness in your leg, or if you develop any shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets… I think I understand. Thank you for explaining that so clearly. 24 to 48 hours… I can manage that, I suppose. And if I experience sudden pain or redness… or shortness of breath… I will go to the emergency room. Yes, I understand. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. You've been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything. I feel a bit less anxious now, knowing what to expect. Should I… continue taking my Apixaban as usual? And… is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Resting my leg, perhaps?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. It’s important to remember I am here to help, and it's always best to ask questions. Yes, please continue taking your Apixaban as prescribed. It’s important to maintain a consistent dose for your heart condition. In the meantime, resting your leg is a good idea. Elevate it whenever possible, and try to avoid prolonged standing or sitting. You can also apply a cool compress to help reduce any swelling or discomfort. And drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. I’ll write you a prescription for the blood tests, and I’ll also provide you with a handout summarizing the instructions. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any restrictions or limitations that would affect your ability to get to the lab?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I’ll try to rest my leg and elevate it. And drink plenty of fluids. No, I don’t have any restrictions that would affect getting to the lab. I can drive myself, and I have a flexible schedule. I should be able to schedule an appointment easily enough. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I’ll be sure to call if I experience any problems.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. It was my pleasure. Remember, I am here if you need anything. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, or if you experience any new symptoms. Please take care of yourself, and I look forward to discussing your results with you soon. Have a good day, and safe travels.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
