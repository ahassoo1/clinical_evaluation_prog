DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm… my wife and I… we thinking about… maybe having a baby. She say it good idea, and I… I think so too. But we… old. We want to make sure everything okay first.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's certainly admirable that you're thinking proactively. While age is a factor, it doesn't automatically preclude a healthy pregnancy. However, we do need to assess a few things to ensure the best possible outcome. You’re 70, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Seventy. August… is that August? Yes, seventy. And my wife… she is a little younger. Much younger! But she is healthy, very healthy.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much younger, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. She is… fifty-two, I think? Yes, fifty-two. We met… a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Fifty-two. Alright. While both of you are generally healthy, a pregnancy at these ages carries significantly increased risks. We need to be thorough. Let's start with your medical history, Mr. Carlotta. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Chronic… what is chronic? Oh! Problems… long time problems? I… I had a little trouble with my heart, many years ago. But the doctors… they fixed it. A long time ago. I take some medicine for it, still. Small pills, every morning. And… I sometimes feel a little tired. But everyone feels tired, yes?
DOCTOR: “Long time problems” is correct. So, you’ve had cardiac issues in the past, and you currently take medication for it. Can you tell me the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Medication… hmmm. I… I do not remember the name. It is a small, white pill. My wife, she knows. She handles all the… the paper things. I just take it, every morning with my tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to get that information from your wife then. It’s crucial to know what you’re taking, as certain medications can affect fertility and pregnancy. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I think… when I was a little boy, I got a rash from some… some flowers. But not serious. And… my wife say I sneeze a lot when the dust is bad. But that is not allergy, yes? Just… dust. I don’t think I am allergic to anything important.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the heart issue you mentioned?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I think… when I was young, very young, I broke my arm. Playing football! They fixed it, with a cast. A big, white cast. And… hmm… I had my eyes done, many years ago. To help me see better. But that was a long time ago. I think that is all. My memory… it is not so good these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he was healthy, very strong man. He lived a long life. My mother… she had some trouble with her… with her bones, when she was old. They say it runs in the family. But I… I don’t know what it is called. And my wife’s family… they are all healthy, I think. She comes from a good family.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. My father, he smoked, but I never liked it. Alcohol… sometimes, a small glass of wine with dinner. Very small. And drugs? No, no. I am an old man, Doctor. I do not do drugs.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Carlotta, given your age, your history of cardiac issues, and the potential for underlying health concerns, a pregnancy would be considered high-risk. Before proceeding any further, we need a comprehensive workup to assess both your and your wife’s health. This will include blood tests, an electrocardiogram to evaluate your heart function, and potentially other imaging studies. I also recommend a consultation with a cardiologist before we move forward. It's critical to understand the risks involved and to ensure you are both physically capable of handling a pregnancy. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests? A lot of tests? And… a heart doctor? Hmm… it sounds… complicated. I… I just want to make sure everything is okay. Is it… is it very dangerous? I do not want to hurt my wife.
DOCTOR: It is more complex than a typical pregnancy, Mr. Carlotta, and that’s why a thorough evaluation is crucial. It's not necessarily dangerous, but the risks of complications are higher, particularly given your age and medical history. We need to rule out any underlying conditions that could pose a threat to both you and your wife. The tests will help us assess those risks and determine if proceeding is safe. If we find any concerning issues, we can discuss alternative options. I understand this is concerning, but we need to be realistic and prioritize your health and well-being. We’ll take things one step at a time. I will have my nurse schedule these tests for you today, and we will arrange a cardiology consult as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Tests, and a heart doctor. My wife… she will want to know all this. She is the strong one, she handles everything. I… I do not understand all the medical things. Can we… can we talk to her together? Maybe she can ask the questions I do not know how to ask.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Carlotta, that’s perfectly acceptable. I encourage your wife to be involved in the discussion. It’s important she understands the risks and benefits as well. I can schedule a joint appointment for both of you to review the results of the tests and discuss the next steps. Would tomorrow afternoon work?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… yes, that would be good. Tomorrow afternoon. Thank you, Doctor. It is… a lot to take in. But I want to make sure we do everything right. For my wife. And… maybe… for a little baby.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. My nurse will contact you to confirm the appointment time. In the meantime, please try not to worry. We will gather all the necessary information and make a well-informed decision. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all. Thank you for your time. And… thank you for being honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. You're welcome, Mr. Carlotta. Please have a seat, and my nurse will be with you shortly to discuss the lab orders. .
PATIENT: .
