DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. It's nice to meet you. My name is Dr. Gegan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though frankly, I haven’t much time for pleasantries. I’m here…well, it’s about my skin, I suppose. It’s darkening. And I’m terribly fatigued. It’s…unsettling. I’ve been working, of course. Always working. But this is…different. Get on with it, if you please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Drahota. I understand you're concerned and want to get to the bottom of this quickly. “Darkening skin” and fatigue… those can be caused by many things, so let’s try to get a clearer picture. When you say your skin is darkening, can you tell me where it’s darkening?
PATIENT: Where… honestly, I haven't kept meticulous notes on the precise location. It’s…all over, I suppose. Arms, face… perhaps my legs too. It’s not a pleasant sight, I assure you. I’ve always taken pride in my appearance. And it’s coinciding with this…exhaustion. It’s rather bothersome, really. Do you need a detailed map, Doctor? Because I haven’t one.
DOCTOR: No, a detailed map isn’t necessary right now, Mr. Drahota. “All over” is a helpful start. And you mentioned it’s coinciding with fatigue. Can you describe this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s…weariness, Doctor. Profound weariness. It isn’t simply being tired after a long day of work – though, believe me, that is tiring. This is…deeper. It’s a lack of…vitality. I find myself needing to rest frequently. And even then, I don't feel…refreshed. It's rather inconvenient, if I'm honest. I have responsibilities, you see. Things that need doing. This sluggishness…it hampers efficiency.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s not just physical tiredness, but a deeper lack of energy and vitality. That's very important to know. Has this fatigue come on suddenly, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I believe. It wasn’t as if I woke one morning utterly depleted. It’s…crept up on me, bit by bit. Over the past few months, perhaps? It's difficult to say precisely. Time…it all blurs together after a while, you know. I simply noticed that tasks became…more arduous. And then the skin…darkening. A most unwelcome development. I'm a practical man, Doctor. I like clear timelines, but…this is frustratingly vague.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you trying to recall the timeline, Mr. Drahota. It's common for things to feel vague when they develop gradually. Now, thinking about other symptoms... have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well, I eat. One must maintain strength, you see. Ironworking is not a profession for the faint of heart. I wouldn’t say my appetite has changed, precisely. It's simply…less enjoyable. Food tastes…bland. Not that I expect gourmet meals, mind you. But the usual fare doesn't quite satisfy anymore. It’s a minor point, really. Though I suppose everything is connected, isn't it? This fatigue, the darkening skin, the lack of zest for…sustenance. It’s all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know everything feels connected, and that your appetite hasn't changed so much as the enjoyment of food has diminished. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now there's a bothersome question. I haven't been precisely measuring myself, Doctor. I have more pressing matters. But my clothes… they feel a bit looser, perhaps? It’s subtle, mind you. I wouldn’t say it’s dramatic. But yes, I suspect there has been some…reduction. It’s likely due to this…lack of appetite, isn’t it? I haven’t been consuming my usual portions. It’s all very…disconcerting. Are we getting anywhere, Doctor? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Drahota, we are getting somewhere. The weight loss, even if subtle, is important to note, especially with the fatigue and skin darkening. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been remarkably healthy for most of my life. A few aches and pains, naturally. The rigors of the trade. But nothing…serious. I haven't spent much time with doctors, if I'm being truthful. I prefer to be doing things, not discussing them. I suppose I had a bout of…the grippe, many years ago. And a rather nasty cut on my arm, but that healed cleanly. No chronic conditions, no hospital stays. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I believe in hard work and fresh air. Not coddling and pills. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Mr. Drahota. No major medical history is good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Nothing that springs immediately to mind. Perhaps a minor procedure on my teeth, decades ago. But nothing…substantial. No major operations. Certainly nothing recent. I distinctly remember avoiding hospitals whenever possible. They’re…unpleasant places. And I’ve always been rather fortunate when it comes to illness. I’ve always prided myself on my resilience. Are we nearing the end, Doctor? I have commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’re making good progress. And no surgeries is good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… a complicated matter. My parents…they lived long lives, but they weren't ones for discussing ailments. My father was a businessman, not a hypochondriac. My mother…she tended to her garden, not her symptoms. I believe my uncle suffered from…weakness of the lungs, perhaps? But that was many years ago, and I don’t recall the specifics. There were no…widespread illnesses, no inherited conditions that I’m aware of. A sturdy lot, mostly. Prided themselves on their strength, like myself. Is that what you require, Doctor? Because frankly, genealogy isn't my forte. I deal in iron, not pedigrees.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Drahota. Knowing there's no significant family history of illness is helpful. Finally, I'd like to ask about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Do I look like the sort of man who indulges in such…frivolities? I am a practical, hardworking individual. I have no time for… vices. Smoking weakens the lungs. Alcohol impairs judgment. And recreational drugs…well, they’re simply beneath contempt. I partake in hard work and a good night’s sleep. That is sufficient stimulation for me. I assure you, Doctor, my lifestyle is…exemplary. Are we quite finished now? I have a schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Drahota, we’re nearly finished with the history. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… very well. Though I assure you, I'm in perfectly sound condition. Still, if it's necessary to appease the…procedure, I suppose I can indulge you. Get on with it, if you must. But I haven't got all day, Doctor. And be gentle, if you would. My bones are not as resilient as they once were.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Drahota. I will be as gentle as possible. Your heart sounds a little irregular, a bit fast. And your lungs sound clear, but your breathing is a little shallow. Your blood pressure is a bit high, 140 over 90. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Your skin is definitely darker than usual, and feels a bit dry. Your skin turgor is slightly diminished, meaning it takes a little longer to bounce back when pinched. Your pulses are a little weak, and there’s some mild swelling in your ankles. Your hands are a little dry and I notice a slight tremor. Do you feel any pain in your ankles or hands?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not precisely pain. A slight…discomfort, perhaps? A stiffness, a nagging ache. But not debilitating pain, no. The ankles…they feel a bit… heavy, occasionally. And the hands…well, they’ve always been rough, from years of working iron. A tremor is hardly unexpected, is it? You’re finding flaws where none exist, Doctor. I assure you, I'm still capable of wielding a hammer. Are you finished prodding me? This is becoming rather tedious. And what does all this…observation mean? What’s your diagnosis, if I may be so bold? I haven't got all day for cryptic examinations.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, your symptoms – the fatigue, the darkening skin, weight loss, along with my exam findings of an irregular heartbeat, slightly high blood pressure, and mild swelling in your ankles – are concerning. The dryness of your skin and tremor also contribute to the picture. Taken together, these suggest a few possibilities. One possibility is adrenal insufficiency, a condition where your adrenal glands aren’t producing enough hormones. Another is a possible thyroid issue, though that's less likely based on my initial exam. A third possibility, given your fatigue and weight loss, could be something more serious like an underlying malignancy. I need to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture. These tests will check your hormone levels, thyroid function, and look for any signs of inflammation or malignancy. I also want to order a complete metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hormones…thyroid…malignancy… Good heavens, Doctor. You’re painting a rather grim picture. A grim picture indeed. Frankly, I find this all… unsettling. And rather… unnecessary. I’m a practical man, as I’ve said. I don’t require a litany of tests and diagnoses for a little fatigue and darkened skin. Still…if it’s necessary to appease the…protocol… very well. Order your tests. But I assure you, I’m perfectly sound, if a little…weary. And please, be quick about it. I haven't got all day for needles and waiting rooms. Tell me, Doctor, will these tests require a prolonged stay? Because I have commitments. Important commitments.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Drahota, these tests will not require a prolonged stay. It will be a simple blood draw that should take only a few minutes. The lab results will take a few days to come back, typically 3-5 business days. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk and they'll schedule you for the blood draw. While we’re waiting for the results, I want to rule out any immediate issues. Given your age and the possibility of a more serious underlying condition, I recommend a chest X-ray to check your lungs. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… really, Doctor? You’re determined to find something wrong with me, aren’t you? I assure you, my lungs are perfectly functional. Years of breathing fresh air, that’s what keeps them going. Still… if it’s necessary to… quell your concerns, very well. Order your X-ray. But I expect a swift turnaround. I haven’t got all day to spend in sterile rooms, being bombarded with radiation. And please, inform me of the results promptly. I require a clear explanation, Doctor. None of this…medical jargon. Understand? I deal in iron, not interpretations of shadows and waves.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Drahota, I understand. I will ensure you receive a clear explanation of the results, without any unnecessary jargon. I’ll order the chest X-ray now, and the front desk will schedule that for you as well. In the meantime, I recommend you try to get some extra rest and stay well-hydrated. Avoid any strenuous activity until we have the lab results. I’ll also give you a printed handout outlining the potential causes of your symptoms, along with a list of warning signs to watch out for – such as unexplained weight loss, severe fatigue, or shortness of breath. If you experience any of those, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? No, Doctor. I believe you’ve sufficiently bombarded me with enough information for one day. Tests, X-rays, handouts… It's all rather…overwhelming. Honestly, I simply want to get this over with. I trust you’ll expedite the process. And please, ensure the results are communicated to me promptly. I haven’t got all day to wait for medical pronouncements. I have commitments, you understand. Important commitments. Very well, then. I suppose that concludes our…consultation? Get on with it, Doctor. And please, try to find nothing. That’s my fervent wish. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. We will proceed as quickly as possible. The front desk will be in touch to schedule your blood draw and chest X-ray. And please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before then. I wish you all the best, and hope we have good news soon. .
