DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think. Honestly, I’m not even sure where to start. Just… tired. Really, really tired. It’s been going on for… a while now. A long while. I just want to feel normal again, if you know what I mean?
DOCTOR: I do know what you mean, Janie. It’s frustrating when your body doesn’t feel like your own. “Tired” can mean a lot of things, so let’s try to narrow it down. When you say “a long while,” can you give me a rough estimate of how long you’ve been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An estimate… That’s… hard. Maybe… six months? Or was it eight? It all kind of blurs together, you know? It started… after my husband passed, I think. But even now, months later, it hasn't gotten any better. It's just… constant.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and grief can definitely manifest in many ways, including persistent fatigue. It’s good you’re recognizing this isn’t just a temporary thing. So, constant fatigue for six to eight months. Does this fatigue interfere with your daily activities – things like work, hobbies, or even just getting through the day?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely interferes. I work at the pharmacy, you know, as a technician. It’s… getting harder and harder to stand for long periods. I have to take more breaks. And… I used to love gardening. I can barely get out there now. Everything feels like such a… effort. Even just making dinner feels like climbing a mountain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's impacting your work and your hobbies, and even everyday tasks. That gives us a clearer picture. Besides the fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms that started around the same time, or even developed since then?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been… a little forgetful, I guess. Not like, major things, but… where I put my keys, or what I was going to say mid-sentence. And… my muscles ache sometimes. A dull ache, mostly in my legs and back. And I feel… sort of… down. Not sad, exactly, just… blah.
DOCTOR: Okay, forgetfulness, muscle aches, and feeling generally “blah.” Those are all helpful things to know. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… It comes and goes, really. Some days I can eat a little, others I just don’t feel hungry. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, but honestly, I haven’t been keeping track. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? It's hard to say. I just haven't been myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluctuating appetite and potential weight loss. And you mentioned the muscle aches are mostly in your legs and back. Are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go. They're worse after I've been on my feet all day at work, definitely. And sometimes, when I try to sleep, they keep me awake. It’s just a nagging ache, not sharp pain or anything. I take some over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, but they don’t really do much.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, muscle aches that worsen with activity and don’t fully respond to over-the-counter pain relievers. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And… I don’t think I’ve had any night sweats. I mean, sometimes I wake up a little warm, but I live in an old house, you know? It gets stuffy. I’m not sure if that counts. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know why I feel so terrible all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Janie. It’s good you’re being so thorough in describing everything. We'll work to get to the bottom of this. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history. Let me see. Well, I have Medicare, so… something must be wrong, right? I had some high blood pressure a few years ago, but they got it under control with medication. And… I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. Other than that… not much, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled high blood pressure and a gallbladder removal in the past. That's good to know. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a small pill for the blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Just one a day. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for the aches, but like I said, it doesn’t really help much. And… occasionally, a sleeping pill if I really can’t sleep. But I try to avoid those if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril daily, ibuprofen as needed, and an occasional sleeping pill. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I've been pretty lucky, I think. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes during pollen season, but that's just normal, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, seasonal allergies are quite common. Now, thinking about your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm. My mother had some problems with her heart, I think. She needed a pacemaker eventually. And my brother… he had some kind of arthritis, I think. But honestly, I wasn't very close to either of them. It's hard to remember all the details. We didn't talk about health much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your mother and arthritis in your brother. That’s helpful to know. Finally, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I don’t smoke. Never have. And I haven't had a drink in… well, since my husband passed, anyway. And definitely no drugs. I just want to feel better, Doctor. I just want my energy back.
DOCTOR: I understand, Janie, and we’ll do our best to help you get there. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a look at your thyroid and feel your abdomen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready. Just… please be quick, if you don’t mind. I have a few things I need to get done this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course. Alright, if you could just sit up here for me. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart and lungs sound good, but I did feel a slight enlargement of your thyroid gland. Everything else seems within normal limits on initial exam. I'm going to order some blood work. It'll check your thyroid function, complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. We'll also do a Vitamin D level, as low Vitamin D can sometimes cause fatigue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a little elevated, you say? And an enlarged thyroid? That sounds… serious. Blood work… alright. Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: It's good you’re asking questions, Janie. “A little elevated” blood pressure means we’ll want to monitor it, but it’s not an immediate emergency. The thyroid enlargement is something we need to investigate further with the blood work to see how it’s functioning. The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the results back to us. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to discuss them and schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, are you able to comfortably manage your daily activities?
PATIENT: Two to three days… that feels like a long time. Manage… I’m getting by. But it’s… hard. I have to take a lot of breaks at work. And I’m not really doing anything fun anymore. Just… existing, mostly. I try to help out my neighbor when I can, but even that’s tiring sometimes. I just wish I knew what was causing all this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Janie. Waiting for results can be difficult, and it's completely understandable to feel discouraged when you're not able to do the things you enjoy. We'll get to the bottom of this. While we're waiting for the blood work, I want to recommend a few things you can try to help manage your fatigue. Make sure you're getting enough sleep – aim for 7-8 hours a night. Try to eat a healthy diet, and stay hydrated. And most importantly, listen to your body – don't push yourself too hard. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Seven to eight hours… I haven’t slept that well in months. But I’ll try. Healthy diet… I used to be a good cook, but I haven’t had much appetite lately. I’ll try to eat better too. Listen to my body… that’s good advice, I guess. But it’s hard when everything feels so… exhausting. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janie. It's my job to listen, and I’m glad you feel comfortable sharing everything with me. I’m going to have the nurse draw those blood samples for you now. She’ll explain the process, and it shouldn’t take long. Once that’s done, you’re free to go. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms while we’re waiting for the results. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I will. And… I appreciate your patience. I know I'm not the easiest patient.
