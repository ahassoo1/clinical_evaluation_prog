DOCTOR: Hi Lindra, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. My husband, he say I need… paper for the old people place? He do all the… making things happen. I just come for say okay? For the place. Is good place, he say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your husband has been arranging for you to potentially move into an assisted living facility, and he’s brought you in today for a health assessment, to make sure everything is alright before you transition. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes. Assessment. That is… good word. He say they need to know… if I am okay to live there. I feel okay. Sometimes forget things, but who no forget? Husband worry too much. He good man, but… always worry.
DOCTOR: It's wonderful that you have such a caring husband. And it's completely normal to have some memory lapses as we get older, you’re right. We just want to make sure everything is safe and well-coordinated for you. Let’s just go through a few questions, if you don’t mind. It will help us get a better picture of your overall health. First, can you tell me a little bit about any health problems you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Problems… I have… the sugar. Doctor say diabetes, but I take the pills. And my back, she hurt sometimes. Old hurt, from working. I was… bartender. Long time ago. Not so much hurt now, mostly just when I bend down. And… I think that is all. Maybe? I forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, so diabetes, managed with medication, and some back pain that’s better now, mostly with bending. That’s good to know. Do you remember what medication you take for the sugar?
PATIENT: Oh. The pills. Little white pills. I take… two in the morning, and one at night, I think. My husband get them for me. He know everything. I no know the name. Is… a long name. He say it help.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we can definitely look it up. Has anything changed with your back pain recently?
PATIENT: No. Same. Sometimes a little stiff when I wake up. But I move around, and it get better. I still… make drinks sometimes. For the family. Not so much standing like before, I sit more now. But I still like to do it. Makes people happy.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! It’s good to stay active, and making people happy is a great thing. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had… when I was young, I break my arm. Fall from the tree, try to get mango. They fix it. That is surgery, right? And… I think, maybe, they take out my gallbladder once. Long time ago. Very sick then. I remember being in the hospital, but not much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, and gallbladder removal. Good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don't think so. Never been sick from food. Sometimes, my skin get itchy if I wear… some cheap jewelry. But that is just itchy, not big problem. My husband say I am strong. I do not get sick easy.
DOCTOR: That's good! It sounds like you're generally quite healthy. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family’s health?
PATIENT: Family… My mama, she live long life. But she get sick at the end. Heart problems. My papa, he work hard. He get sick from the work, lungs not good. My brother, he okay. Live in another country. We do not see each other much. And my daughter, she healthy. Have two children. They good.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had heart problems, your father had lung issues from work, and your brother and daughter are both healthy. That gives me a good picture. Now, to get a better sense of things, could I ask you a few questions about how you're feeling right now?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Right now? I feel… tired a little. Old tired. But not sick tired. Just… been a long day. And… worried a little about the place. I want it to be nice. I do not want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious about a big change like this. We’ll make sure it’s a good fit for you, and we’ll work to address any concerns you have. Aside from the tiredness and worry, have you noticed any other changes in how you're feeling lately?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Maybe… I forget things more. Like, where I put my glasses. Or what I was going to say. But like I said, who no forget? Sometimes hard to sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night, then hard to get back to sleep. But not every night. Mostly when I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, some memory lapses and difficulty sleeping, especially when you're worried. That's helpful to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Physical… You check me? Like the doctor back home? That is good. I let you check.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit up here for me. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Just relax. Take a nice deep breath for me... and again... Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That's a little elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Now, I’m going to check your pulse. Pulse is 72, regular. Everything sounds good so far. Now, just to finish, I’m going to look in your ears and check your throat. Ears look clear, and your throat is normal. Overall, everything looks pretty good. I do want to check your blood sugar to make sure it's well controlled, and we may want to do some other blood work to get a more complete picture of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Blood sugar, good idea. And the other things… if you think it is good. I trust you, Doctor. You very nice.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lindra. I appreciate that. Let’s get those blood tests ordered, and we’ll talk about the results soon. We'll also check your reflexes and balance quickly. If you could just hold my hands while you sit there and I check this. Okay, reflexes are good, and your balance seems fine. Everything is looking pretty good so far. Now, based on what we've discussed, and the information from your husband, I think it's reasonable to proceed with the assessment for assisted living. However, I do want to keep a close eye on your blood sugar, and it's always good to monitor your sleep and address any memory concerns. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You answer everything. Maybe I ask husband. He always have questions. Thank you, Doctor. You make me feel… better. Less worry.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindra. That's my job! I'll have the lab results sent to your husband's doctor. If you do have any concerns or questions later, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. Have a lovely day, Lindra. And remember, it's okay to be a little worried about change. We'll work through it together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
