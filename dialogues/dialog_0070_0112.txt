DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More often than usual, certainly. It’s been… disruptive, to be perfectly honest. I don’t really recall when it started, exactly. Just… gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to be embarrassed, Ms. MacVittie. These things happen, and we’re here to figure out what’s going on. “Quite a lot” is somewhat vague, could you perhaps quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Quantify… oh dear. That sounds… precise. Hmm. Well, normally I’d go, perhaps… three or four times a day? Now… it feels like every couple of hours, sometimes even more often. And… occasionally during the night, which is new. I don’t believe I’ve had any pain, thankfully, just… the frequency. It’s quite bothersome, really. I’m terribly sorry, I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. MacVittie. You're explaining it just fine. It's helpful to have that comparison – going from three or four times a day to every couple of hours is certainly a noticeable change. And no pain is good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in how you’re going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Changes in… how? Well, the stream feels… normal, I suppose. Not weaker or stronger than usual. And the color… seems the same. No blood or anything like that. I do feel like I’m emptying my bladder completely each time, if that makes sense. It’s just… so much more often. I hope that clarifies things? I sometimes feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: That does clarify things, Ms. MacVittie, thank you. No changes in stream, normal color, and complete emptying are all useful information. And you’re not rambling at all – it's important to be thorough. Now, let's broaden things a bit. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this increased frequency?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. I’ve been feeling rather thirsty lately, now that you mention it. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, too, but I attributed that to… well, just life, really. And… I suppose I’ve been getting up more often at night to… well, to drink water, because of the thirst. It's all rather connected, isn’t it? I'm not sure if any of that is relevant.
DOCTOR: That is relevant, Ms. MacVittie. Increased thirst and fatigue alongside the frequent urination and nighttime waking are certainly things we need to investigate. It sounds like we're building a bit of a picture here. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh dear. That’s a difficult one. I was divorced a few years ago, if that counts. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t really… I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time. I’ve always been fairly healthy, or at least I thought so. I don’t recall having any serious illnesses, or diagnoses. I’m terribly sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I do try to eat well, and get some exercise, but beyond that… I’m afraid I’m not much use. Perhaps my previous doctor has records?
DOCTOR: Don’t worry about it at all, Ms. MacVittie. Divorces definitely don’t count as medical conditions! And it’s perfectly alright that you haven’t been to a doctor in a while, and that you don’t recall specific diagnoses. We'll work with what we have. Knowing that you generally eat well and exercise is helpful. Do you know the name and location of your previous doctor’s practice?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… tricky. It was a general practitioner… Dr. Reynolds, I believe? The practice was… somewhere in the city. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. It was a large practice, with several doctors. I moved a few years ago, and just… didn’t re-establish with a new doctor. I’m terribly sorry, I’m being remarkably unhelpful, aren’t I? I seem to be drawing a complete blank on the exact location. It was near… a large park, perhaps? Honestly, it's all very vague.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize, Ms. MacVittie. It’s common to not remember details like that. Dr. Reynolds, near a large park… that’s a starting point. We can try to locate the practice records later, if you’d like. Now, let’s move on to family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – diabetes, kidney problems, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather… he had something with his heart, I think. It was a long time ago. He was a smoker, if that makes a difference. Beyond that… I don’t really know. My family isn’t terribly forthcoming with medical information, I’m afraid. We tend to… avoid talking about it. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more specific. It’s all rather hazy. I really don’t recall any instances of diabetes or kidney problems, but that doesn’t mean they weren’t there.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. MacVittie. High blood pressure in your mother and heart issues in your grandfather are good to know. It's common for families to not discuss medical history openly, so you shouldn't feel bad about not having more information. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! I’ve never smoked a day in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’m afraid I’m rather… boring in that regard. I prefer a good book and a cup of tea, if you must know. I try to live a fairly healthy and uncomplicated life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. MacVittie. That’s very good to know. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any serious allergic reactions, thankfully. I’m slightly sensitive to strong perfumes, perhaps, but that’s not really an allergy. And I can’t recall any reactions to medications. I’ve only taken over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally, and never experienced any problems with those. I once had a slight rash after eating shellfish, but it was years ago, and I’m not entirely sure it was an allergy. I’ve eaten shellfish since then without issue. I really don’t think I have any significant allergies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MacVittie. That's very helpful. So, to summarize: increased frequency of urination, increased thirst and fatigue, no known medical conditions, family history of high blood pressure and heart issues, no smoking or drug use, and no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A physical exam is fine. I’m a little nervous, if I’m honest, but I understand it’s necessary. I trust your judgement, of course. Just… please be gentle, if you wouldn’t mind. I haven’t had a proper check-up in quite some time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. MacVittie. I will be as gentle as possible. I understand it's been a while, and we'll take things at your pace. "Everything feels normal on the initial exam, Ms. MacVittie. But with the increased frequency of urination, thirst and slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some lab work. Specifically, I’d like to check a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel – that includes kidney function and blood sugar – and a Urinalysis to check for any infection or other abnormalities in your urine. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lab work… yes, that sounds… sensible. A Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and a Urinalysis, you said? If that’s what you recommend, Doctor, then please proceed. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary to find out what’s going on. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. I’m not very good with medical things, as you’ve probably gathered. Where would I go to have that done? And when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. MacVittie. We're just gathering information at this point, and often these things are easily explained. You can have the lab work done at City General Hospital, just a few blocks down Elm Street. I'll give you a lab requisition form. They take walk-ins, but it’s best to go in the morning, before you've had too much to drink. The results usually take about 24-48 hours. Once they're back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I’ll also have the lab send me the results electronically. "Do you have any questions about that, Ms. MacVittie?
PATIENT: 24-48 hours… that doesn’t seem too bad. City General Hospital, you said? No, I don’t think so. That all sounds perfectly clear. I’ll go first thing tomorrow morning. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Should I… reduce my fluid intake, perhaps? Or avoid caffeine? I just want to be prepared. I don’t want to do anything that might interfere with the results.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. MacVittie. For the next 24 hours, I would advise you to drink a normal amount of fluids – don’t restrict or overindulge. Avoid excessive caffeine, as it can sometimes affect blood pressure readings. Otherwise, just continue with your normal routine. It's also worth noting any changes in your symptoms between now and your follow-up. Are you experiencing any new pain, discomfort, or unusual fatigue?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, nothing new. The frequency is still the same, and the thirst hasn't subsided, but no pain, discomfort, or unusual fatigue. I did feel a little more tired than usual yesterday, but I attributed that to… well, just life, as I said before. Nothing alarming. I think that’s everything, Doctor. I’ll go to City General Hospital tomorrow morning, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Anything at all? I always worry about forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. MacVittie, I don't think so. You've been very thorough. Just remember to bring a list of any medications you’re taking, if you have any, to the follow-up appointment. And if anything does change significantly before then, don't hesitate to call the office. "It was a pleasure meeting you today. I’ll look forward to discussing the lab results with you. Have a good evening, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions."
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I will be sure to call if anything changes. And I will bring a list of any medications, though I doubt there will be many. Have a good evening, Doctor. And thank you again.
