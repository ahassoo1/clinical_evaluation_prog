DOCTOR: Good morning, Venus. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor Smetak. It is… pleasant to meet you as well. I am here because… well, my memory is not what it once was. It is… troubling. I find myself forgetting small things, and it is becoming more frequent. It began, I believe, after my husband passed, but it is worse now. I have been told I should come and have it checked.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It’s certainly good you’re getting this checked out, Venus. Memory changes can be concerning, and it's best to figure out what’s going on. And you said this started after your husband passed… that’s about how long ago would that be, roughly?
PATIENT: Approximately… three years ago. Three years and… six months, perhaps? It was in January. He passed in January of twenty-twenty-two. It was… a difficult winter. I am quite certain of the month, you see. I remember the funeral arrangements very clearly. But… other things… are slipping. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, three years and six months. That gives us a good starting point. And you mentioned small things slipping – can you give me some examples of what you've been forgetting?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. For example… yesterday, I made a pot of tea, and I completely forgot to add the water. The tea leaves just… sat there, dry, in the pot. A very silly thing, yes? And… last week, I went to the market to buy apples, and I returned with oranges. Completely the wrong fruit! I… I also struggle with names now. Friends I have known for years… they are… on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot recall them. It is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Those sound… unsettling, yes. It's good you're noticing these things and bringing them to my attention. And has this been a gradual decline, or did it feel more sudden at any point?
PATIENT: It has been… gradual, I believe. Very slow, at first. Just a misplaced key, or forgetting a word here and there. But… in the last six months, it has… accelerated. It feels… faster now. More frequent. It is… worrisome. I do not… I do not wish to become a burden to anyone. I used to manage everything, you see. The property, the community association… everything. Now… I worry I cannot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Venus. It's good you're aware of the changes and that you're taking steps to address them. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. I was diagnosed with… hypertension, approximately fifteen years ago. It has been… well-managed, mostly, with medication. I also had a… a slight arrhythmia, a few years ago, but that resolved itself with treatment. Otherwise… no. I have always been… quite healthy, despite my age. I do not smoke, and I drink… very little alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. But that is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension and a previous arrhythmia. Thank you for letting me know. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes. I am taking… Lisinopril, twenty milligrams, once daily. And… a small dose of Aspirin, eighty-one milligrams, also daily. That is… all. I believe. I have a list at home, but… I did not think to bring it with me. It is… a very simple regimen, really. I have been taking these medications for many years now, as prescribed by my previous doctor.
DOCTOR: Right, Lisinopril and Aspirin. That’s good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I am aware of. I have never had a… reaction to anything. I eat… most foods. I used to be quite fond of shellfish, but… I do not eat it anymore. It is… expensive, and I live alone now. It seemed… wasteful. But that is not an allergy, you understand. Just a… preference. A practical decision.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any family members—parents, siblings, or other relatives—who have experienced memory problems or conditions like Alzheimer’s or dementia?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. My mother… she had some… difficulties in her later years. She would… misplace things, and forget appointments. But she was a very… excitable woman. It was often dismissed as simply her personality. She never received a formal diagnosis, as far as I know. My father… he was quite sharp until the very end. No… no, I do not believe there is a history of… serious memory problems in my family. Though, as I said, my mother… it was something. But it was never spoken of, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, some possible memory issues with your mother, but nothing definitive. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a brief physical exam and a few simple cognitive tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that is… perfectly alright. I understand. If it will help… then please, proceed. I wish to know… what is happening. And I wish to… address it. The sooner, the better, I think. I have… appointments to keep, you see. And responsibilities. But I will… make time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venus. First, let's just check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Nothing to worry about, just routine. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 76 and regular. Good. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Now, I'd like to do a few simple memory tests. I'm going to say three words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me. Then, I’ll ask you to remember them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I am ready. Please, proceed. Three words, you say? Very well. I shall… concentrate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, the three words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those back to me, please?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Yes. I believe… I have them. Apple, Table, Penny. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Now, I'm going to ask you a few other questions. It’s just to get a broader picture. First, do you know what today’s date is?
PATIENT: Today’s date… let me see… It is August… August the second. The year is… two thousand and twenty-five. Is that correct? It is… important to be precise, you see. I try to… keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are absolutely right. August 2nd, 2025. Good. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: We are… in your office, Doctor Smetak. It is… a pleasant office. Very clean. I believe… it is in a rural area, judging by the trees outside the window. I do not know the exact location, but… it is not in the city, certainly. I am… not very good with directions, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. You're doing very well. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier: Apple, Table, and Penny. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: …Apple… I remember Apple. And… …Table? No… I… I seem to have forgotten the third word. It is… on the tip of my tongue, but… it eludes me. I know there were three… Apple… and Table… but the third… I cannot recall it. I am… terribly sorry. It was… Penny, perhaps? No… I am not certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. It's alright. Forgetting is perfectly normal, and this test is just a starting point. It seems you remembered Apple and Table, but are having difficulty recalling Penny. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam and tests we've done, it sounds like you’re experiencing some memory difficulties that warrant further investigation. It could be a number of things, from normal age-related changes to something more specific. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory loss, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I also recommend a brain scan, specifically an MRI, to get a better look at what’s going on. How does that sound to you?
PATIENT: Blood work and… a brain scan. Yes. Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help to determine the cause… then I will do it. Whatever is necessary. I… I would like to know what is happening, Doctor. I wish to be… prepared. A brain scan sounds… daunting, but if you recommend it… then I trust your judgment. When can we schedule these… tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. I understand your apprehension, and I want to assure you that we'll take things one step at a time. We can schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning, right here at the clinic. It’s a simple procedure, just a few vials of blood. The MRI will require a bit more coordination. We'll need to send a referral to the imaging center in the nearest city—about an hour's drive. They have availability next week, either Tuesday or Thursday. We'll need to discuss the specifics with them regarding any metal implants or other contraindications. I will have my assistant, Maria, help you with scheduling both appointments and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a daily journal to track any changes in your memory, even small ones. It will be helpful for us to review when we discuss the results. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes. Blood work tomorrow… and the MRI next week. Tuesday or Thursday… I believe I can manage that. Maria will help with scheduling… that is… very kind of you. A daily journal… yes, I can do that. I used to keep a journal when I was younger. It might… be helpful to have something to focus on. Very well. Let us… proceed. I trust your guidance, Doctor Smetak. And… thank you. .
