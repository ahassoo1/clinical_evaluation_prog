DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is the name. Look, I gotta get this exam done. Military wants me to take it, you know? Gotta prove I’m still…functional. Not much time to waste, really.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll certainly get it done. It helps me to understand why they're requesting this exam, and what specific concerns they have. Is there anything in particular they asked me to look at?
PATIENT: Concerns? Look, I build engines. Good engines. Always have. They just…want a check-up before letting me…do other things. Didn’t say anything specific. Just said “pre-exam”. Honestly, a waste of my time, but rules are rules, I suppose. They mentioned eyes and…strength, maybe? It was a bit of a blur. Young lad on the phone, couldn’t speak clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Pre-exam” it is. Eyes and strength…that’s a start. And you build engines, you said?
PATIENT: Yep. All sorts. Boat engines, car engines, even some small airplane ones for that fella, old man Hemlock. Precise work, you know? Requires a steady hand and a good brain. Not like…sitting around all day. What’s the first thing we gotta do? Let’s just get it over with. I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Well, before we jump into the physical part, I need to gather a bit of your medical history. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Hartness. Just helps me get a complete picture. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Look, I cut my finger once, building a carburetor. Needed a stitch. That’s it. Otherwise, healthy as a horse. Never been one for doctors or hospitals. Waste of good money. Don’t see the point in poking and prodding unless something’s actually broken. Just tell me if I need to lift something heavy or stare at some dots. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major illnesses or surgeries. Fair enough. What about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What's that even for? My old man worked in a factory, same as me. He coughed a lot when he got old, but everyone coughs when they get old, don't they? My mother…she made good meatballs. Not exactly relevant, is it? Look, I'm not one for digging up old stories. If I gotta be strong and see well, just tell me what to do. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but this information is relevant. It can give me clues about potential risks. Do you know if anyone in your family has had heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Look, I told you. Old man coughed. Mother made meatballs. That's all I know. They’re both gone now, been gone for years. Honestly, this feels like a trick. You trying to find something wrong with me? The military didn't say anything about a full…interrogation. Just an exam! I build engines, I don’t sit around thinking about family illnesses. I’m a practical man! Now, are we doing this exam or not? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Fine. We can skip the detailed history for now. But I do need to ask about medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No! Why would I be taking medications? I eat good food, work hard, and sleep when I'm tired. That's all a man needs! Allergies…hmm. Bees, maybe? Got stung when I was a lad, swelled up a bit. But that was ages ago. Never bothered me since. Honestly, this is… Look, I'm telling you, I'm fine. Completely fine. Healthy as a horse. Now, can we please get on with the exam? I've got an engine to rebuild.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with a basic physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then we’ll move onto the eye exam and strength tests. If anything concerning comes up, we may need to do further investigations. Please, sit back and relax. First, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please remove your shirt?
PATIENT: Remove my shirt? Look, I don't see the point. You haven’t even looked at me properly yet! But fine. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day to be standing around half-naked in some doctor's office. It’s not exactly dignified, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds…a little fast, but regular. Lungs…breath sounds are a bit quiet. Blood pressure is 110 over 70. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the examination table, feet dangling?
PATIENT: Feet dangling? Fine, fine. Now get on with it. The quicker this is over, the better. I’ve got work to do, you know. Not just sitting around for a doctor to poke and prod. Honestly, the military is wasting my time with this whole thing. I could be rebuilding an engine right now. A good engine.
DOCTOR: I'm going to gently tap on your tendons to check your reflexes. This is perfectly normal. Biceps…present, but a little weak. Triceps…same. Knee reflexes…diminished. Now, let’s move onto the eye exam. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Eye chart? Fine. Okay…uh…E…F…P…T…uh…C… Look, I'm not known for my eyesight. Never needed good eyesight to build engines. It’s more about feel, you know? Precision. I can see well enough to do my job. That’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand that you rely more on feel and precision. However, the military requires certain visual standards. Now, let's assess your strength. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Strength, huh? Fine. There. Is that enough? I've got strong hands, I promise you. I work with tools all day. It's not about squeezing, it’s about control. Precision. You wouldn't understand. Now, are we almost done? I really need to get back to work. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on the exam, your heart rate is slightly elevated, your breath sounds are diminished, your reflexes are a little weak, your vision is reduced, and your grip strength is below average. Given these findings, I recommend further investigation. Specifically, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a chest X-ray, and an EKG to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Do you agree to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Look, I don't like tests. Never needed tests before. I build engines, I don't sit around getting poked and prodded! An X-ray? An EKG? What's wrong with me? You’re trying to find something that isn’t there. I feel fine. Completely fine. I've got work to do. I told you, the military is wasting my time with this whole thing. No. I don’t agree to any tests. I’m perfectly healthy. Just tell me if I pass or fail and let me get back to my life. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your reluctance, but these tests are important to ensure your health and safety. I cannot definitively say whether you "pass or fail" without further information. Given your exam findings, I strongly recommend you reconsider. However, I respect your autonomy. I will document your refusal of testing. I do recommend you follow up with your primary care physician for a comprehensive evaluation. Without further investigation, I cannot confidently clear you for duty. You may want to discuss these findings with the military medical personnel. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
