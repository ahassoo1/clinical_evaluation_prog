DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been needing to use the restroom quite often lately. More often than usual, certainly. I apologize if this is… a strange thing to come to a doctor about. It’s just… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, yes, I understand. It’s hardly strange, Ms. MacVittie; frequent urination is a common complaint. Let's try to get to the bottom of it. When you say "quite often," could you give me a rough estimate of how many times per day you're going?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… difficult to say precisely. I don’t really keep track, you see. But I would say… at least every couple of hours, even when I haven’t had much to drink. Perhaps more? It feels like constantly needing to go, if that makes any sense. I’m truly sorry I can't give you a better number. My mind just doesn't focus on things like that.
DOCTOR: I see. "At least every couple of hours," even with limited fluid intake. Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this frequent urination?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I suppose… sometimes I feel a little discomfort, a sort of burning sensation, when I do go. Not terribly painful, just… noticeable. And I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, though I’m not sure if that’s connected. It’s been a warm summer, and I've been busier than usual with things around the house. I honestly can’t say for certain what's causing the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination and fatigue… Okay. Now, Ms. MacVittie, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness. No, I don’t think so. I haven’t… I haven’t checked, actually. I tend not to look, if you understand. It’s… unpleasant. I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. I know I'm not being very helpful with specifics. Should I be… looking for that?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. MacVittie. It's understandable. You shouldn’t necessarily look for it, but it's important information. We’ll get a sample today to be certain. Now, let's move on. Have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or sides?
PATIENT: Fever or chills… no, nothing like that. No, and thankfully no pain in my back or sides either. I've been feeling a bit achy, generally, but that could just be from being on my feet so much at work. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… tiredness in my muscles, if that makes sense? I really do apologize for the vague descriptions, Doctor. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Achiness, okay. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. I was divorced a few years back, does that count? Beyond that… I honestly can’t recall. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in… quite some time. I used to have terrible migraines when I was younger, but those seemed to go away on their own. I don’t think they were diagnosed, exactly. I just… stopped having them. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I worry I'm drawing a blank.
DOCTOR: No formal diagnosis, occasional migraines in the past... Alright. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. No, I don’t believe so. Nothing major, at least. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And… I think I broke my arm once, when I was little, but that was just a simple cast. No hospitalizations, to my knowledge. I really am sorry I can’t offer more detail, Doctor. My memory… it's simply not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, she’s doing well, thankfully. She's quite a bit older now, lives back in Portugal. And I have a brother, he's living in California. As far as medical history… That’s… difficult. I don't recall anyone having specific conditions. My mother had some trouble with her joints as she aged, but nothing serious, as far as I know. I haven’t spoken to them in quite some time, honestly, so I don’t have many details. Is that helpful? I feel terrible that I can’t provide more information.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. MacVittie. We work with what we have. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I can eat pretty much anything. And I haven't had any reactions to medications in the past, as far as I can remember. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about it. I'm truly sorry I'm not being more assistance. It's just… things don’t stick with me as they should.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to a physical examination, then. I'd like to check your abdomen, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll need a urine sample, of course. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly acceptable, Doctor. I understand. A physical examination is probably a good idea. And yes, of course, a urine sample. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I’m a little nervous, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. MacVittie. I'll explain everything as I go along. First, let’s have you lie down on the table. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths, please. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear, though slightly diminished on the bases. Now, I'll just palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. Oh… a little bit there, on the lower left side. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, perhaps? It's hard to describe. It’s… better when you’re not pressing, of course. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Dull ache in the lower left quadrant upon palpation. Alright. Now, could you please provide a urine sample?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Is there a restroom nearby? I assume I should just… collect it in a cup? I haven't done this in quite some time, so I apologize if I’m a bit clumsy. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Yes, just down the hall on the left. There are instructions inside. Take your time, Ms. MacVittie. I'll be right here when you're finished.
