DOCTOR: Hi Murry, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… well, it’s my chest. Hurts when I take a deep breath. Not all the time, just… when I try to fill my lungs, you know? It’s been… a little while now. Can’t rightly say how long. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain that’s worse with deep breaths. I understand. And you said it’s been going on for a little while… can you try to remember roughly when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Roughly… hmm. That's a hard one. Seems like… after the winter, maybe? Or was it spring? I do a lot of work outside, you see. Construction, mostly. Been doing that my whole life. It’s hard to remember things these days. Everything kinda blends together.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sometime after the winter, possibly in the spring. And you do construction work. That's helpful to know. Is the pain sharp, dull, crushing… can you describe how it feels?
PATIENT: Not crushing, no. More like… a tightness. A really deep ache. And it feels… higher up, in my chest. Not in my stomach or anything. Just… right here. It’s… annoying, mostly. Doesn't stop me from work, but… it’s there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a deep ache, higher up in your chest. Does anything specifically make it worse, besides taking a deep breath?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Maybe if I lift something really heavy. But I lift heavy things all the time, so… I don’t know if that’s it. Cold air sometimes feels a bit… sharper. But again, I work outside. It's cold a lot of the time. Honestly, it's just… there. A constant little bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lifting can make it worse, and cold air feels sharper. Have you had any cough, fever, or shortness of breath along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Cough… sometimes. An old man’s cough, you know? Just a little tickle in my throat. No fever, though. Definitely no fever. And shortness of breath… not really. I get tired, of course, I’m eighty years old! But not… short of breath. I can still walk around, still do my work. It’s just… I gotta pace myself now, more than I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever smoked, or been around a lot of smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke… well, when I was younger, a few cigarettes, maybe. Nothing serious. A long, long time ago. And with the construction, there's dust, sometimes. But that's just part of the job, right? Not like I’ve been a chimney sweep or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, some past smoking and dust exposure. Now, I’m going to ask about some other things, just to get a full picture. Have you had any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I haven’t really looked, to be honest. I don't really pay attention to my feet. They ache, like everything else, but I don’t know about swelling. I wear work boots most of the time, so... hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. Now, have you had any chest pain before this, maybe years ago?
PATIENT: Now that’s a good question. Let me see… I had something… a long time ago. When my wife was still around. Something at the hospital… but it was a long time ago. I don’t rightly remember what it was for. Maybe a bad cold? It wasn’t… this kind of pain. It was… different. A squeezing, I think. But it was so long ago, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past episode of squeezing chest pain, a long time ago. Now, do you have any problems with your heart that you know of?
PATIENT: Problems with my heart… not that I know of. Doctors checked me out now and then, over the years. Said I was… strong for my age. But again, that was a long time ago. Things change, right? This pain… it's just a bother. I'm more worried about finishing this job I’m on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in for me?
PATIENT: There.
DOCTOR: Okay. And again. Alright. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the right side. And I hear some… crackling. It's subtle, but it's there. And your heart rate is a little fast, but not alarmingly so. I also want to check your oxygen levels with a sensor on your finger.
PATIENT: Oxygen levels… alright. Just let me know what you find, Doctor. This is taking a while. I got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, your oxygen is 91%. That's a little low. Considering your age and the diminished breath sounds, I'm concerned about possible pneumonia or something similar. We need to get a chest X-ray to take a better look.
PATIENT: X-ray? Oh dear. Is it… bad? I don’t like hospitals, Doctor. And X-rays… I always worry about those.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is bad, Murry. An X-ray will help us see what's going on in your lungs and figure out the cause of your pain and the low oxygen. It's a precaution. We can do it right here at the clinic. It’s quick and painless. Would you be willing to get one?
PATIENT: Quick and painless, you say? Alright. If it's quick and doesn't hurt… I suppose so. But I want to know what you’re looking for, Doctor. Tell me plain and simple. No fancy medical talk.
DOCTOR: Okay, plain and simple. We're looking for any sign of fluid or infection in your lungs - that could be pneumonia, or something else causing the pain and shortness of breath. We also want to make sure there's nothing more serious going on. I’ll send you over to the X-ray technician, and then we'll review the results together as soon as they’re ready. It will be just a few minutes, Murry. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… hurry it up, if you can, please. I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll let the technician know you’re coming and to expedite the process as much as possible. Just go down the hall to the radiology department, and they’ll take good care of you. I’ll be right here waiting for the results.
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Let’s get this over with. .
