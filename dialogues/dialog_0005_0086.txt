DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning. Just the results, please. I don't really have time for a whole lot of chatting, if you don't mind. I checked the schedule and thought this was just a quick check-in about the bloodwork?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, typically, even with bloodwork results, we discuss them, Ms. Kovtun. It's not just about reading them, you understand. But, if you insist. Let me pull up the results here… Okay. So, your complete blood count… everything looks within normal limits, generally. Cholesterol is a little elevated, honestly, but not dramatically so. Vitamin D is… low. Quite low, actually. Anything you've been feeling that made you think to get this checked?
PATIENT: Low Vitamin D? Huh. No, not really. I haven’t been feeling anything different. I mean, I work, I sleep, I eat… the usual. I guess I haven't been outside much lately, it's been raining a lot. Does that matter? What does low Vitamin D even mean?
DOCTOR: It means… well, your body isn't absorbing enough Vitamin D. And yes, Ms. Kovtun, being outside does matter. Sunlight helps your body produce it. It's important for bone health, your immune system… a whole host of things. Frankly, it's a bit concerning you haven’t noticed any symptoms. Usually, people with this level of deficiency experience fatigue, muscle aches… Do you eat a lot of fish?
PATIENT: Fish? Not… a ton. Maybe once a week? I mostly eat chicken and vegetables. I try to eat healthy, honestly. Is that… bad? Should I be eating more fish? And what do I do about the low Vitamin D, exactly? Do I need a shot or something? I have a pretty busy schedule, so if it's going to be a big thing, I need to know.
DOCTOR: Well, "healthy" is relative, Ms. Kovtun. Fish is a good source, yes. Though I doubt that's the root of the problem. A shot?
PATIENT: Definitely not a shot. Please, no needles. Is there a pill I can take? Or… a special kind of food? Look, I just need something easy. I’m really not a fan of making this a whole ordeal. How long would I have to take a pill for, even? And will it make me feel… different? Like, drowsy or anything?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No needles, I understand. Look, it's not a serious problem, okay?
PATIENT: Good. So, what do I need to do? Just tell me the bottom line. Pill? How many? For how long? I’ve got things to do today, so keeping it simple is appreciated.
DOCTOR: Fine. Here. Vitamin D3, 2000 IU daily. Take it with a meal that contains fat, for better absorption. Continue for three months. Then we'll recheck your levels. Don't bother coming back if you feel fine, honestly. It's not like it's life-threatening. Just… try to spend some time outdoors. And maybe eat a salmon fillet once in a while. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Right. Okay, 2000 IU with a meal. Got it. Three months. And… maybe salmon. Look, thanks. I think that’s everything I needed to know. I appreciate you not making a big deal out of it. .
