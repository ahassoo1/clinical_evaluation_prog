DOCTOR: Bula and hello, Andrew! It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Just… my eyes. They feel dry. Real dry. Been that way a while now, I guess. Don't like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand. And you said “a while now”?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Maybe… six months? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda… goes. It’s not a sharp pain, just… gritty. Like sand. And they get tired easy.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months of gritty, tired eyes. That helps. Do you notice it more at certain times of day, or with certain activities like reading or being outside?
PATIENT: Outside, yeah. Sun makes it worse, for sure. And when I'm workin' with the cement… all that dust flyin' around. Not good. Don’t bother me too much indoors, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sun and cement dust seem to be triggers. Have you tried anything to help with it so far – like eye drops, or wearing sunglasses?
PATIENT: Eye drops… I think my daughter, bless her heart, got me some once. Didn’t seem to do much. Sunglasses, yeah, I wear ‘em when I remember. I’m not real good at rememberin’ things these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the drops weren't very helpful and you wear sunglasses sometimes. That's good you're thinking about protection. Let’s talk a little bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Nope. Just old. And… I've got a bad knee, but that's from fallin' off a ladder years ago. Nothin' else. Don’t take any pills, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other medical conditions and no current medications. And you said the knee injury was from a fall years ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, long time ago. Don't bother me too much. Just aches sometimes. Look, doc, is this gonna take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: No, we’re almost through the main questions. Just trying to get a good picture of things. Alright, let's talk a little about your family. Does anyone in your family have problems with their eyes – like glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: Geez. I don't know. My… my brother had bad eyesight, needed thick glasses. But I don’t know about them fancy names. We didn’t talk much about that sort of thing. My mom… she just got old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your brother needed glasses, but you’re not sure about any other eye problems in the family. That's alright, it's common not to know details. Now, just a couple more quick questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she did, but she passed years ago.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. Alright, good to know you've never smoked. Now, last question, Andrew. Do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Always been pretty tough. I think that’s all, right? Can we… get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, Andrew, that’s very helpful. It sounds like you’ve had dry, gritty eyes for about six months, worse in the sun and with cement dust, no other medical conditions, no medications, your brother needed glasses, and no known allergies. I’m going to take a quick look at your eyes now, just to see what’s going on. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Andrew, everything looks generally healthy, but your corneas do seem a little dry, and there's some mild inflammation. Your pupils react normally to light. I also see some conjunctival injection – that's just redness in the white part of your eyes. It’s consistent with dry eye syndrome. It's common, especially with exposure to sun and dust, and as we get older.
PATIENT: Dry eye… syndrome? Is that… bad? Will I go blind?
DOCTOR: No, Andrew, it's not typically bad in that way. It's usually just uncomfortable. It rarely leads to blindness. It means your eyes aren't producing enough tears to keep them properly lubricated. We can definitely manage it. I'm going to recommend a few things. First, I'd like you to start using artificial tears four times a day, even when your eyes don't feel dry. There are many brands available over-the-counter; I can recommend a couple that are preservative-free. Second, continue wearing sunglasses whenever you're outside. And third, try to avoid getting cement dust in your eyes as much as possible – maybe wear some safety glasses when you're working with it. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Four times a day… okay. Safety glasses… yeah, I can do that. Preservative-free… what's the difference? And… how much do these eye drops cost? I'm on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Andrew. Preservatives are added to some eye drops to keep them sterile, but they can sometimes irritate the eyes, especially if you’re using them frequently. Preservative-free drops are gentler. As for cost, they vary, but generally, a small bottle of preservative-free artificial tears will cost around $10-$20. We have some samples here at the clinic I can give you to start with, and I can also recommend some affordable brands at the pharmacy. Would you like me to write down the names of a few brands and the instructions on how to use them?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’d be good. Writing it down helps me remember. And… are there any pills I gotta take? I really don't like takin' pills.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Andrew. I've written down Systane Ultra Preservative-Free and Refresh Relieva PF. Both are good options. Use them four times a day, or more often if your eyes feel dry. And no, there are no pills needed for this. We’re starting with the eye drops and protective measures. We can always discuss other options if those aren’t enough. I want you to follow up with me in about a month, and we can see how you're doing. If your eyes get significantly worse – like blurry vision, pain, or discharge – please come see me sooner. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: A month… alright. No pills, good. I'll try these drops. And… I'll come back in a month, if I remember. Thank you, doc. I think that's all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Andrew. Just remember to be consistent with the drops and the sunglasses. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here's a card with the clinic’s number on it. Have a good day, and please take care of your eyes.
PATIENT: .
