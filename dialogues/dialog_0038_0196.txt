DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I guess. Well, to be honest, I’m just… tired. Really tired. It’s been going on for… a while now. I don’t really keep track of dates anymore. Just… always tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, “always tired.” That’s a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about that tiredness, Janie?
PATIENT: More… how? It’s not like… normal tired after a long day. It’s… inside. Like my bones are tired. And it doesn’t go away with sleep. I sleep, or I try to, and wake up just as… drained. Does that make sense? I don’t even know anymore.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Janie. That sounds incredibly frustrating. "Tiredness that doesn’t improve with sleep" is definitely something we need to look into. When did you first start noticing this tiredness?
PATIENT: Ugh, that’s… a hard question. It feels like… after my husband passed. But honestly? Things got blurry then. A lot of things got blurry. Maybe… a year? Two? It’s all just… a long time ago now. It wasn’t sudden, if that helps. It just… crept up on me. I just kept thinking I needed more rest, but… it never helped.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started gradually, around a year or two ago after your husband passed. I’m very sorry for your loss, Janie. That’s a huge change and can definitely affect everything. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. I guess… things just don’t feel good anymore. Like… my muscles ache, even when I haven’t done anything. And I… I forget things. A lot. Small things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I was going to say. Nothing major, but… it’s annoying. And I just don't have the energy to do things, even things I used to enjoy. Everything feels like too much effort.
DOCTOR: Okay, so muscle aches, some memory issues, and a general lack of energy. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, the appetite… It comes and goes. Some days I eat okay, others I just… don’t. It's not like I’m trying to lose weight, but I guess I have. Not a lot, but my clothes feel a little looser. I don’t really weigh myself, though. Never really have. It's not something I worry about much. Just… not hungry sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about sleep itself?
PATIENT: Sleep… well, I try to sleep. I go to bed at a normal time, I think. But I wake up a lot during the night. Just… little things. Have to go to the bathroom, or I’m just… restless. And then it’s hard to get back to sleep. And even when I do sleep through, I don't feel rested when I wake up. It's like… a waste of time, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty staying asleep, and not feeling refreshed even when you do sleep. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Sometimes I get headaches. Not terrible ones, just… a dull ache at the back of my head. And… this might sound silly… but I feel… cold. All the time. Even when it’s warm. I have to wear a sweater all the time, even in the summer. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me everything, Janie, and no, feeling cold all the time isn't necessarily "normal." It's important information. Do you have any pain anywhere else besides your head and muscles?
PATIENT: No, not really. My joints sometimes ache a little, especially my knees, but it's not like a sharp pain. Just… a stiffness. Like I've been sitting for too long. And it goes away if I move around a bit. It's not constant. Honestly, the biggest problem is just… this feeling of being worn out. Everything feels… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's... hard. I had high blood pressure, years ago. They put me on medication for it, but I stopped taking it a long time ago. My doctor at the time... he retired, and I just... never bothered getting a new one. And I had the flu a couple of times, but nothing serious. Honestly, I don't go to the doctor much. Never really have. I always just figured I could tough things out.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of high blood pressure that you were previously treated for, but haven't been on medication for a while. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed any. Oh, wait… I had my appendix out when I was a little girl. But that was a long time ago. I barely remember it. It was… before my husband, I think. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that counts, Janie. So, appendectomy as a child. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family… that's a hard one. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was young. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. But honestly, I don’t remember much about it. We didn't talk about health much. It wasn’t… a thing we did. And I don't really know much about my grandparents, they died before I was born. Sorry, I wish I could be more help. It’s all just… a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, Janie. We’ll work with what you remember. Just a history of heart issues in your mother and diabetes in your father. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Like I said, I stopped taking the blood pressure pills years ago. I haven’t taken anything regularly since then. Maybe some over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches sometimes, but that’s it. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I don't like the way they make me feel.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had any reactions to anything. I eat everything, and I’ve never had any trouble with pills or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. I don't even have seasonal allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, it's not very exciting. I live alone, in the same house my husband and I bought years ago. It's… a bit too big for just me now. I don't do much. I mostly stay home. I used to garden, but I don't have the energy for that anymore. I read sometimes, but I have trouble concentrating. I don't really see many people. Just… a few neighbors now and then. It's quiet. Very quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine at Christmas, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. Never have, never will. I'm a pretty healthy person, aside from this tiredness. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Alright, very good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please be quick? I have… things I need to do. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as quick as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Your heart rate is a little slow, but otherwise sounds regular. Breathing sounds are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 100/60. Pulse is 60 and regular. Now, I'll just check your temperature. Temperature is normal, 98.6. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Now, do you mind if I ask a few more questions?
PATIENT: No, go ahead. Just...try to be quick, please? I…I just want to know what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. It's a bit blurry sometimes, but I always figured it was just because I need new glasses. I haven't been to the eye doctor in years. It's not like I'm driving or anything. Just reading, and sometimes things… fade a little. Nothing major, if that makes sense. I just squint a bit more than I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you noticed any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said earlier, my clothes feel a little looser, but I haven’t been trying to lose weight. I haven't weighed myself, so I don't know for sure. It's just… not eating as much, I guess. It’s hard to keep track of things. Everything just feels… distant.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, have you been experiencing any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing. Not at all. I can eat everything just fine. Soup, meat, whatever. That hasn’t been a problem. I’m just… tired. Really tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… Well, they’re a little… irregular. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… not. It’s not a big deal, I just figured it was because I'm not eating as much. It’s nothing to worry about, really. Just… old age, I guess. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being so open with me, Janie. That’s very helpful. Based on what you've told me, and the results of the physical exam, it sounds like we need to do some further testing to figure out what’s going on. Your symptoms – the persistent fatigue, muscle aches, some memory issues, feeling cold, and changes in bowel habits – could be caused by a number of different things. I want to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and B12 levels. I also want to check your kidney and liver function. And I’d like to do a urine analysis, just to rule out any infection. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Honestly, I just want to know what's wrong with me. I just want to feel normal again. Will these tests… will they tell me what it is? Will they help me feel better?
DOCTOR: They will certainly give us a lot more information, Janie. These tests will help us rule out a number of possibilities, and hopefully point us in the right direction. We'll be looking for things like anemia, thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, and any signs of infection. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and develop a plan to get you feeling better. It’s important to remember that it might take some time to figure out exactly what’s going on, but we'll work through it together. I’ll have the lab draw the blood today. They'll need about 10 milliliters. It will take about 15 minutes. Do you have any questions about the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… get it over with, I guess. The sooner we know, the better. Will it hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: It will be a quick pinch, Janie, but it shouldn't hurt too much. They’re very skilled at drawing blood. They’ll use a small needle, and it’s over before you know it. You might feel a little bit of discomfort afterward, but that usually goes away quickly. I’ll write you a lab requisition, and the nurse will give you instructions on where to go and what to expect. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. I just… I just want to feel like myself again. I hope these tests help. I really do. Is it okay if I just… go home now? I think I’m tired. Even more tired than before.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Janie. You go ahead and go home and rest. The nurse will be in shortly to get the lab requisition and go over some instructions with you. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take care of yourself, and try to get some rest.
