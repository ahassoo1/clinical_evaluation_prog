DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It… it has to do with planning, I believe. My… ex-husband suggested I look into some paperwork, just in case. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… well, should anything happen. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, so I don't recall the specifics of what he mentioned. He used a term... Advance Directive, perhaps? Or POLST? It sounded important.
DOCTOR: Right. An advance directive… or a POLST form. Yes, it's… prudent to consider these things. Though, frankly, at your age… well. Let’s start with the basics. Are you experiencing any current health concerns?
PATIENT: No, not really. I… I feel quite well, actually. I mean, I'm tall, which sometimes causes a bit of clumsiness, but nothing a doctor needs to worry about. I work with my hands, etching and engraving… so my hands are generally alright too. It’s more… preventative, I think? I just want to be prepared. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: "Quite well," you say. And yet, you're here discussing end-of-life planning. Interesting. Very well. Let’s get a basic overview then. Any past medical issues I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Past medical issues… That’s… difficult. I had a childhood illness, I believe. Measles, perhaps? And… a broken wrist, years ago. Nothing serious. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in quite some time, I’m afraid. My ex-husband always handled those things. I really wouldn’t know where to begin. Is this… is this normal? To not remember these things?
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal. A lapse in medical recall isn’t uncommon, but it’s still important to have a clear history. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I… I think I had my tonsils removed when I was very young. But beyond that, no. I'm quite certain. I would remember something like that, wouldn’t I? Though, honestly, with everything… it's all a bit hazy. Is it alright if I just tell you about what I do know, and we go from there? Perhaps focusing on the paperwork my ex-husband mentioned would be best.
DOCTOR: Very well. We can focus on the paperwork. But I still need a basic understanding. Family history – are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… complicated. My parents… they lived in Mongolia for most of their lives. I didn’t see them often. I know my mother had… heart trouble, I think. And my father… he was very strong, but he passed away suddenly. I believe it was something to do with his lungs. But beyond that, I truly don’t know. We weren’t very close, and medical discussions weren’t common. I apologize for being so unhelpful. Is this going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: It… complicates things. Social history then. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been very careful with my health, even if I don’t always remember everything. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's it. And I try to eat a balanced diet, though sometimes my work keeps me from proper meals. It's rather solitary, this profession. Not a lot of socializing. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: And allergies?
PATIENT: No known allergies. I… I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I've been stung by bees a few times while working outdoors, but nothing more than a bit of swelling. No medication allergies either. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. Though, I haven’t taken much medication over the years. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache.
DOCTOR: Right. And currently, are you taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not currently. Just a multivitamin, occasionally. I try to stay healthy, as I mentioned. It's difficult with the long hours, but I do my best. Perhaps we could return to the original topic? The paperwork my ex-husband suggested… what exactly is an Advance Directive, and how does it differ from this POLST form? I’m starting to feel a little overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s get to the paperwork. An Advance Directive outlines your wishes regarding medical treatment if you are unable to communicate them yourself. A POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a medical order based on those wishes, to be followed by healthcare professionals. It’s… more concrete. But before we delve into that, let's do a quick physical exam. Just to have a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse… standard things. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? I hadn’t anticipated that. I thought we were just discussing paperwork. But… if it’s necessary. I suppose it’s sensible to have a baseline, as you say. Very well. Where do we begin? I must confess, I’m a little nervous. It’s been a long time since I was… examined.
DOCTOR: Just a simple check-up, Ms. Buoniconti. Please, have a seat. First, let’s take your blood pressure. And could you please remove your shoes?
PATIENT: Very well. I hope I won’t be too clumsy. I'm rather tall, you see. And sometimes my balance isn't what it used to be. Please, let me know if I need to adjust my position. It’s been a long time since I’ve done this.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a bit elevated – 140 over 90. Lung sounds are clear, but… slightly diminished at the bases. Not alarming, but worth noting. Heart rate is regular, no murmurs detected. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Very well. I hope they haven't deteriorated too much. I used to be quite agile, but… that was a long time ago. Is everything alright? You seem… concerned. I apologize if my memory is interfering with the examination. I'm trying my best to cooperate. Please, don't hesitate to tell me if I need to adjust my position or do anything differently.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… diminished, as expected. Not severely, but noticeably weaker. Strength is… adequate, but could be better. Any pain or stiffness in your hands?
PATIENT: A little stiffness sometimes, particularly in the mornings. It’s the nature of the work, I suppose. I do a lot of fine detail etching and engraving, so my hands are constantly in motion. Nothing debilitating, just a bit of… ache. I’ve learned to live with it. I use a warming balm occasionally, and that helps. But… it’s not a constant pain. More of a… weariness. Is that concerning?
DOCTOR: Hand strength is… slightly reduced. No visible signs of arthritis. It’s likely related to your occupation. Alright. That’s enough of a basic examination for now. We’ll need to discuss your wishes regarding end-of-life care. Do you have any specific concerns or preferences?
PATIENT: Finally. Back to the paperwork, then. I… I hadn’t given it much thought, to be honest. My ex-husband just said it was important to have something in place. I suppose… I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery. And I would prefer to remain as comfortable as possible. Beyond that… I’m not sure. It’s all a bit overwhelming. Perhaps you could explain the different options to me? What sort of decisions would I be making with these forms?
DOCTOR: Very well. The Advance Directive allows you to specify what medical treatments you want or don’t want if you are unable to communicate your wishes. This includes things like CPR, mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and dialysis. The POLST form is a more specific medical order, based on those wishes. It’s… simpler. Essentially, you're telling us what interventions you want and don't want in the event of a serious illness. Do you understand?
PATIENT: CPR… ventilation… feeding tubes… It’s a lot to take in. So, if I didn’t want to be kept alive by machines, I would specify that on the form? And the POLST form is… a more direct order to the medical staff? I apologize if I’m being slow. My mind isn’t what it once was. Could you perhaps give me an example? Let's say… I were to become seriously ill. What kind of choices would I be making with these forms? A real-life scenario, if you would. It would help me understand better.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s say you develop severe pneumonia and are unable to breathe on your own. With an Advance Directive, you could specify whether or not you want to be put on a ventilator. With a POLST form, you could specify a “Do Not Intubate” order, meaning we would not attempt to insert a breathing tube. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: A ventilator… so, if I didn’t want to be put on a machine to breathe, I would specify that. And the “Do Not Intubate” order… that’s a direct instruction not to insert a tube. What about… feeding? If I were unable to eat? Would I have a choice about that as well? And what if… what if I were to lose consciousness? Would the form specify whether or not I wanted to be resuscitated? It’s a lot to think about, I realize. It’s a little frightening, to be honest. Perhaps a simpler explanation, please? I am trying my best to understand, but it’s difficult to grasp all of these medical terms.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Buoniconti, the forms cover all of these things. Yes, you can specify whether or not you want a feeding tube. Yes, you can specify whether or not you want to be resuscitated. It’s all about outlining your wishes. I can explain each option in detail, but frankly, it’s a lot of information. Are you capable of understanding these concepts, or should I perhaps suggest a family member be present to assist you?
PATIENT: Please, Doctor. I am capable. It’s just… overwhelming. My ex-husband made it sound so simple, but it’s not. I’m not unintelligent, I just… my memory isn’t what it once was. I am trying my best to understand, truly. Perhaps if we could go through it slowly, one option at a time? Starting with the simplest choice? Something like… the feeding tube. What are the options regarding that? What are the pros and cons? I just need a little guidance, please. I don't want to burden anyone, but I'm afraid I need a little help grasping all of this.
DOCTOR: Very well. Regarding a feeding tube, the options are straightforward. You can choose to receive nutrition through a feeding tube if you are unable to eat on your own, or you can refuse it. The pros are that it provides nutrition and hydration, potentially prolonging life. The cons are that it can be uncomfortable, and it doesn’t necessarily improve quality of life. It’s really quite simple. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So, if I were to choose to refuse it… that means I wouldn’t receive nutrition or hydration if I were unable to eat. But… what if I were to be in pain? Would I still receive pain medication? And what if… what if refusing nutrition meant… a quicker death? Is that something I should consider? It’s a difficult decision, Doctor. It’s not something I’ve ever thought about before. Perhaps… perhaps I need a little more time to consider all of these options. Could I perhaps take this document home with me and review it?
DOCTOR: Fine. Take the document home with you. Review it at your leisure. But frankly, Ms. Buoniconti, I have other patients waiting. If you’re unable to make a decision, I suggest you consult with a family member or a palliative care specialist. Now, if there’s nothing else… I need to move on.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. Thank you… for your time. I apologize for taking up so much of your time. I truly appreciate your patience… even if I am a difficult patient. I will review this carefully. And if I have any further questions… I will consult with someone. Goodbye, Doctor.
