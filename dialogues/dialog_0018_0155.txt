DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tremor, that's what I'm here about. My hands... they shake. Been happenin' for... well, a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Everything's a bit fuzzy these days, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. It's perfectly normal for things to feel a bit fuzzy as we get older. Let's focus on this tremor. You mentioned it's been happening for a while. Can you describe the tremor to me?
PATIENT: Describe it... hmm. It's not constant, not all the time. More when I'm... tryin' to do somethin'. Like, holdin' a cup of coffee, or... buttonin' a shirt. Things like that. It's a shakin', a quiverin', really. Not violent, mind you. Just… annoying. Makes things difficult. I used to work with pipes, lots of little fiddly bits... couldn’t do that now, not reliably.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that description, Mr. Jezik. That’s helpful. And you said it interferes with tasks requiring fine motor skills, like buttoning a shirt or working with small objects. Has the tremor been getting worse over time, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Worse, I think. Definitely worse. Used to be just a little wobble, barely noticeable. Now… well, now my daughter has to help me with buttons sometimes. And I dropped a plate last week. Not a big one, thankfully, just a saucer. But still. It's gettin' harder to ignore, that’s for sure. I don't remember when it started getting worse, though. Sorry, my memory…
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. Don't apologize – memory lapses are common. We'll work with what you can recall. So, the tremor has progressively worsened, impacting your daily activities. Now, is the tremor present in both hands, or is it more pronounced in one?
PATIENT: Both hands, I think. But… the right one's worse, definitely. It started there, I believe. Or maybe it just seems that way 'cause I'm right-handed. Hard to say for sure. Everything feels a bit… mixed up, you know? I try not to dwell on it too much, makes it worse, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Jezik. It's good that you're aware of how focusing on it can make it feel worse. Knowing it’s primarily in your right hand, but present in both, is helpful. Now, have you noticed anything else associated with the tremor?
PATIENT: Associated with it… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes, when it’s really bad, I feel a little… stiff. Not pain, exactly, just… tight. In my hand and arm. And… oh, this is probably nothin', but sometimes I feel a little… shaky inside too. Like my nerves are all… wound up. It’s hard to explain. Happens mostly in the mornin', I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Jezik. The stiffness and feeling of being “shaky inside” are important details. And the fact that it’s more pronounced in the mornings is also useful information. Now, would you describe any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, I get tired easily. More than I used to, anyway. Used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now I need a nap in the afternoon most days. And… oh, sometimes my handwriting gets… messy. Worse than usual, I mean. It's always been bad, but now… it's practically illegible. But that could just be old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Jezik. Fatigue and worsening handwriting are good to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that's a tough one. My doctor… well, I had a doctor for years, but he retired. New one didn't seem to care much for details. I think I had high blood pressure at one point, but they put me on some pills and… I don't really remember much after that. No diabetes, I'm pretty sure. And my heart... felt alright the last time anyone checked. Honestly, Doctor, it's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. It's not uncommon to have difficulty recalling details from past medical care, especially with changes in doctors. We will do our best to piece things together. Do you recall any surgeries or hospitalizations you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, I think. That’s about all I can remember. Maybe some… dental work. Lots of fillings, over the years. Nothing major, not like a big operation. Hospitalized… I broke my arm once, when I was younger, fell off a ladder. But that was a long time ago. No recent hospital stays, not that I remember. I prefer to stay out of hospitals, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. That's perfectly understandable. Appendectomy as a child and a broken arm in the past. Now, thinking about your family, do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or children – who have experienced similar symptoms, such as tremors or movement problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother, she had… shaky hands too, towards the end. Not as bad as mine, I don't think. And my brother… he had some trouble walkin' when he got older. But that was from an accident, I believe. Nothing like this tremor. My daughter's healthy as a horse, thank goodness. She's the one lookin' after me these days. Honestly, I can't remember much about my father's health. He died when I was young.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Jezik. That's helpful. A history of tremors in your mother and walking difficulties in your brother. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. Can't remember the name of it. And sometimes I take a pain reliever for my knees, when they're botherin' me. Ibuprofen, I think it's called. Nothing else. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. Don't like the way they make me feel.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for that information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat just about anything. My daughter always worries about me, says I should be more careful, but I've always had a strong stomach. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. I think I'm pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your tremor and overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Sure, go ahead. I suppose it's gotta be done. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I have… things to do, you know? Not important things, but… things. Just get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. We'll keep it as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is 148/82, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you with your palms facing up?
PATIENT: There. You can see it, can't you? It's worse when I try to hold them steady. Makes me nervous just thinkin' about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see a resting tremor in both hands, more pronounced on the right as you mentioned. It appears to be a pill-rolling tremor. Now, could you please tap your thumb against your fingers, repeatedly and as quickly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… hard. Gets harder the longer I do it. Feel like I'm losin' control.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Now, could you please try to draw a spiral?
PATIENT: There. It's… not very good, is it? Used to be able to draw a straight line, but not anymore. It just… won't cooperate.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Jezik. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. This will just take a moment. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Your heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to briefly examine your gait, or the way you walk. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A murmur? Oh dear. Never heard anything about a murmur before. Alright, fine. Check my walkin'. Just try not to make it too complicated, please. I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Alright. I observe a mild shuffling gait with slightly reduced arm swing. Your balance seems stable, but you do appear a bit stiff. Thank you, Mr. Jezik. That’s all for the physical examination. Now, based on your symptoms and the examination findings – the resting tremor, pill-rolling characteristics, micrographia, shuffling gait, and the murmur – the most likely possibility is Parkinson’s disease. However, to confirm this diagnosis, we will need to order some further testing.
PATIENT: Parkinson’s… disease? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. Is that… is that what my mother had? That shaky hands thing? What kind of testing? And… what does this mean? Will I… will I end up in a wheelchair?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel distressed, Mr. Jezik. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder, but it's important to remember that it affects everyone differently. It’s possible your mother had Parkinson’s, but without a diagnosis, it’s difficult to say for certain. As for testing, I would like to order a DaTscan, which is a special type of imaging scan that looks at dopamine levels in the brain. Reduced dopamine levels are common in Parkinson's disease. We'll also need to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms with blood tests. Regarding your concern about a wheelchair, it's not a certainty that you will need one. Many people with Parkinson’s live full and active lives for many years with the help of medication and therapy. The goal of treatment is to manage your symptoms and maintain your quality of life. We'll discuss all your options and create a plan that's right for you. Would you like me to explain more about Parkinson's disease and treatment options?
PATIENT: Okay. A scan… and blood tests. Alright. Explain it to me, please. What… what are the symptoms? Besides the shakin' and the slow walkin'. And… what kind of medication? Will it have side effects? I just… I want to know what I’m dealin’ with here.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. It's good you want to be informed. Beyond the tremor and slow walking, Parkinson’s can also cause stiffness in your limbs and trunk, making it difficult to move and perform everyday tasks. You may also experience difficulty with balance and coordination, increasing your risk of falls. Some people experience changes in speech, such as a softer voice or difficulty articulating words. Others may have trouble with writing, as we observed with your micrographia. Constipation, sleep disturbances, and mood changes are also common. As for medication, the most common type of medication used to treat Parkinson’s is levodopa. It helps to replenish dopamine levels in the brain. However, it can have side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, and fluctuations in symptom control. We can adjust the dosage and try different medications to minimize these side effects. Other treatments include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. These therapies can help improve your strength, balance, coordination, and speech. It's important to remember that Parkinson’s is a chronic condition, but with the right treatment and support, you can manage your symptoms and maintain a good quality of life. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about any of these symptoms or treatments?
PATIENT: Levodopa… sounds complicated. And side effects… I don't want to feel worse just to try and feel better. Therapy… I suppose that makes sense. Keep me movin', keep me strong. What about… what about the future? Will this get worse over time? Will I… lose my independence? I don't want to be a burden to my daughter. That’s my biggest worry.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Jezik. It's natural to worry about the future. Parkinson’s is a progressive disease, meaning that symptoms generally worsen over time. However, the rate of progression varies significantly from person to person. Some people experience a slow and gradual decline, while others experience a more rapid progression. With appropriate medication and therapy, many people can maintain a good level of independence for many years. It's important to be proactive about managing your symptoms and to make adjustments as needed. We can discuss strategies to help you maintain your independence, such as assistive devices, home modifications, and support services. We can also connect you with support groups and resources to help you cope with the emotional and practical challenges of Parkinson’s. Your daughter’s support is valuable, and we can involve her in your care plan if you wish. It’s important to remember that you’re not alone in this. For now, let’s focus on getting a confirmed diagnosis with the DaTscan and blood tests. Then, we can create a personalized treatment plan that addresses your specific needs and concerns. Would you like me to order those tests now?
PATIENT: Alright. Order the tests. Let’s just… get it over with. And… thank you, Doctor. For explainin’ things. It’s… it’s still scary, but… at least I know what I’m facin’, now. And… maybe, later, we can talk about the support groups. For my daughter too, maybe. She deserves a break.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I understand it's a lot to take in, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Alright, I’ve ordered the tests. You’ll receive a call from the lab to schedule an appointment. The results typically take about a week. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms and let me know if anything changes. I'll also provide you with information about local support groups for both you and your daughter. We can discuss those resources at your next appointment. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Just… a lot to think about. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I'll wait for the lab to call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
