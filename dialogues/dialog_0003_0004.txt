DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for my shots, like we talked about. Routine stuff, you know? Keepin’ up with things.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the… preventative measures. Though, frankly, I find patients often have other concerns they neglect to mention initially. But very well. Before we proceed with the injections, I need to confirm some details. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies… not really. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes with pollen, but that’s about it. Nothing serious enough to worry about, I don’t think. Never had a bad reaction to a shot before, either.
DOCTOR: “A little sniffly” isn’t quite a comprehensive medical history, Ms. Fornes. But I suppose we’ll proceed. And you're currently taking no medications?
PATIENT: No medications, no. Just… my usual herbal tea when I’m feelin’ a bit under the weather. Nothing the pharmacy would know about, if that makes sense. My grandma taught me a few things, you know? For aches and such.
DOCTOR: Right. “Grandma’s remedies.” While I appreciate cultural practices, they are not always… quantifiable. Now, let’s move on. Have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... When I was a little girl, I had a really bad ear infection, needed a few visits to the doctor back then. And… oh! When my youngest was born, I had a pretty rough time recovering, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just the usual colds and flus. Nothing that kept me in the hospital.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never needed any. I’ve always been careful, I suppose. And good genes, maybe? My mom lived to be ninety-two, and she didn’t have any surgeries either.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… my dad had some trouble with his heart when he got older, needed to watch his diet. And my aunt, on my mom’s side, had diabetes. She wasn’t very good about takin’ care of herself, though. Other than that… not that I know of, really. We don’t talk about health much in my family. It’s kinda… bad luck to dwell on it, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. Now, briefly, could you describe your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I work, mostly outdoors, inspectin' buildings and such. Keeps me movin', for sure. I like to go fishin' when I can, and spend time with my grandkids. We go berry pickin' in the summer. Pretty normal, I think. I try to eat healthy, mostly salmon and vegetables, but I do have a sweet tooth, I'll admit. A little chocolate now and then doesn't hurt, right?
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, before we proceed with the vaccinations, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. Please sit on the examination table. We'll start with your vital signs.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I'm not too fond of doctors messin' around too much, if you get my drift.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Blood pressure is… 138 over 82. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Heart rate is 78 and regular. Lungs are clear, though you have a slightly raspy quality to your breathing. Throat is clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Overall, you appear to be in reasonably good health, despite the elevated blood pressure.
PATIENT: That's good to hear. The blood pressure, you think? Maybe it's just the walkin' around all day at work. It's kinda dusty sometimes, too, at those construction sites. I try to wear a mask, but... it happens. Is it somethin' I should worry about, though?
DOCTOR: It could be situational, Ms. Fornes. We’ll monitor it. However, I recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment for a more comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation. And I strongly advise you to prioritize consistent mask usage at work, and potentially discuss dust exposure mitigation strategies with your employer. Now, let us proceed with the vaccinations. Do you have any questions before I administer the shots?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… try to be quick, alright? And maybe tell me what you're givin' me? Just so I know. I don't like surprises, not when it comes to needles.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I am administering the standard influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. The influenza vaccine protects against the seasonal flu, and the pneumococcal vaccine helps protect against pneumonia. There. That is all. Keep the area clean and dry. If you experience any severe pain, redness, or swelling, contact the clinic immediately. Now, do you have any other concerns, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Alright, that wasn’t too bad, I guess. No, I don't think so. Just… try to be gentle next time, alright? Thanks, Doctor. I think that’s everything. I’ll make sure to keep an eye on my arm. Is there a sign-up sheet for a follow-up appointment? For the heart thing, you mentioned.
DOCTOR: Yes, the receptionist will schedule that for you. Frankly, Ms. Fornes, I have other patients waiting. I trust you will manage. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
PATIENT: .
