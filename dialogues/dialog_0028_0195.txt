DOCTOR: Good afternoon. I’m Dr. Memmolo. So, Janeth, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it's a bit silly, really. My daughter, she says I should come get a card. A "Get Well" card, she calls it. Not that I need one, mind you. I’m perfectly fine. But she worries so. Says it'll make her feel better if you write me something encouraging. You know, from the doctor. It’s all very…dramatic.
DOCTOR: Right. A…doctor’s note for reassurance. I see. Well, I suppose I can document a visit. Though, frankly, it's not the best use of my time. Still. Let's just go through the motions. So, you say you're "perfectly fine," but your daughter is concerned. Has anything specifically prompted her worry?
PATIENT: Prompted her worry? Honestly, probably just that I don’t fuss over every little ache like some people. She’s always been one to exaggerate. But...well, I did stumble a bit the other day, carrying groceries. Nothing serious! Just a little off balance. And I've been a bit more tired than usual, but that's just…age, isn't it? I still manage everything. I work, I cook, I clean. Don’t you think a little tiredness is normal?
DOCTOR: “A little” tiredness. Right. And this stumble…where exactly did this happen, and how did you recover?
PATIENT: Oh, it was just outside the market, down on Elm Street. Tripped over a crack in the pavement, that's all. I just...righted myself. Brushed myself off. No need to call anyone! Honestly, Doctor, my daughter makes it sound like I fell and broke a hip. I just wobbled a bit. Perfectly normal for someone my age. I’m still strong as an ox, you know. It was just a little…momentary lapse of balance. Nothing more. I think she watches too much television. All those medical dramas…it gets to her.
DOCTOR: Elm Street…right. And you’ve had no other falls, no injuries sustained?
PATIENT: No, none! Absolutely none. This was the only one. And it wasn't even a fall, really. More of a…controlled descent. I have very good reflexes, you know. I used to be a weaver, very nimble fingers, very quick reactions. It all comes in handy. My husband, he always says I’m the most practical woman he knows. He says I can fix anything. And I can! Honestly, Doctor, I think you're making a big deal out of nothing. It's just a daughter being overly cautious. Is this card going to be very expensive? Because my pension isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Let's try this a different way. Beyond the stumble and the tiredness, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in my appetite? Well... now that you mention it, I haven’t been eating as much rice as usual. It just doesn't sit right, you know? Not that I’m not hungry, exactly. Just...less enthusiastic about rice. I’ve been having more lentils, those seem easier to manage. And a bit of yogurt. My mother always said yogurt was good for everything. But I’m still eating, Doctor! I had a lovely vegetable curry yesterday. A very good one. My husband made it. He's a good cook, you know. But less rice, yes. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay. And any difficulty with…well, with walking?
PATIENT: Difficulty with walking? No! Not at all! I walk perfectly fine. I walk to the market every day, I walk to the temple on Tuesdays. I walk all over, you know? I might be a bit slower than I used to be, perhaps. But that's just age, isn't it? My daughter always says I walk too fast, actually. She says I need to slow down and enjoy the scenery. Honestly, Doctor, I think she just likes to dawdle. I have places to be, things to do. Walking is the last thing I’m having trouble with. I'm very agile, you know. I can still climb stairs without getting winded. Usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Routine things. Just so we can officially document this visit for your daughter’s peace of mind. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If it will keep her quiet. But don’t poke and prod too much, Doctor. I bruise easily, you know. And I have a very important batch of lentils soaking. They need to be just right for the curry tomorrow. My husband is expecting a good one. And please be gentle. Honestly, I don't see what good all this poking and prodding will do. But if it makes her happy... go ahead. Just… quickly, if you wouldn't mind.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/90. A bit elevated, but not drastically. Breathing is clear, no wheezing. Heart rate is regular, but a little fast. Reflexes are diminished, but that can be normal at your age. Your weight is 55 kilograms, and your height is 176 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 17.7, which is underweight. And your gait seems slightly unsteady. Do you feel weak?
PATIENT: Unsteady? BMI? Honestly, Doctor, all this talk is making my head spin. I feel perfectly fine, thank you very much. A bit tired, perhaps. But weak? No! I can still carry my groceries, I can still clean the house. I may be a bit thin, but I've always been slender. My mother was the same way. And as for my gait…well, I walk briskly, that’s all. I have things to do, you know? I don't have time to dawdle. And you say my heart is fast? Perhaps it's just because I’m worried about my lentils! Honestly, all this poking and prodding…I feel quite flustered now. And I still haven’t heard anything about the card. Is it going to be very fancy?
DOCTOR: Your daughter is concerned about your weight loss, unsteady gait, and diminished reflexes. We’ve noted your fast heart rate and elevated blood pressure. Given your weight and age, I recommend a blood test to check for anemia and vitamin deficiencies, and possibly a check-up with a neurologist to assess your gait and reflexes further. I’m going to order these tests, and I recommend you see a specialist. As for the card, I can write a brief note stating you were examined today and are generally stable, but I strongly suggest you follow up with these recommendations. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests? A neurologist? Honestly, Doctor, you are making a mountain out of a molehill! I told you, I'm perfectly fine. Just a bit tired, maybe. A bit thin. And my daughter worries too much. I do not need tests, and I certainly do not need to see a specialist. All this fuss…it’s giving me a headache. And what about the card? Will it at least say something nice? Something encouraging? Not just about tests and specialists! I came here for a card, Doctor, not a medical lecture. I think I’m going to go home and lie down. And I’m not paying for all these tests. It's ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I will write a note stating you were examined today, and that your daughter has been informed of her concerns. But I strongly advise you to reconsider. If you experience any dizziness, weakness, or falls, please seek immediate medical attention. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
