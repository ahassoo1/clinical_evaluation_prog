DOCTOR: Hi Marija, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Well, my husband… he insists I come. He’s been reading things online, you see, about… planning for the future. It sounds rather morbid, if you ask me, but he's quite insistent on these… forms. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… well, should something happen. I believe he called it an Advance Directive? Or a POLST form? Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to these things. I just want to get it over with, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It is good of your husband to be proactive, even if it feels a bit unsettling. Those forms – the Advance Directive and POLST – are really about your peace of mind, making sure your voice is heard if you’re unable to speak for yourself. We can definitely get through them. Before we jump into the paperwork, just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, my overall health. Well, I suppose it's…adequate. I'm tall, as you can see. Always have been. It makes finding clothes rather difficult. I don’t have any major complaints, thankfully. A little stiffness in my joints sometimes, but that’s just age, I presume. I don’t really do anything strenuous. Mostly reading, a bit of gardening… I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, quite a while, to be honest. My husband handles all that, usually. He worries too much, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And just to be thorough, have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And… oh, a small operation on my hand years ago, a ganglion cyst, I believe they called it. It was quite minor. Really, nothing to speak of. I’ve always been quite healthy, surprisingly, considering my… stature. It's rather inconvenient, being so tall, you know. All sorts of aches and pains, but nothing a little rest doesn't cure.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, ganglion cyst removal on your hand. Good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? What about them? My husband, of course. He’s… well, he's a worrier, as I’ve said. And I have a cousin, living in Casablanca. We don't see each other often. As for illnesses… my mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather… he died of something… old age, I suppose. It was a long time ago. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. It's rather depressing, isn't it? To focus on ailments and… mortality. It's precisely why I didn't want to come.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a bit morbid, digging into all of this. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications? Heavens, no. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. A little herbal tea for a cough, perhaps. Or a warm bath for aches and pains. I don't believe in filling my body with all sorts of chemicals. Allergies… hmm. I think I had a slight rash once, from a perfume, many years ago. But nothing serious. I’m generally quite robust, as I said. My husband keeps offering me things, vitamins and such, but I refuse. I eat a perfectly balanced diet, thank you very much. Mostly vegetables, and fish. And the occasional bit of chocolate, of course. But truly, I’m not one for medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, allergy to perfume only, prefers natural remedies. Right. Before we get to the forms, let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a brief look at your general condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? Is that necessary? I thought we were just filling out paperwork. Honestly, I’m perfectly healthy. But… fine. If you must. Just get it over with, quickly. I have things to do, you know. And please, be gentle. I bruise easily, being so tall and… delicate.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It will be quick and gentle, I promise. Just a standard check. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 130 over 82. Not alarmingly so, but something we'll keep an eye on. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. You do seem a bit stiff, as you mentioned. Any particular joints bothering you more than others?
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh dear. My husband will be insufferable. He always says I need to watch my salt intake. Honestly, it's probably just the stress of being here. As for the stiffness… my knees, mostly. And my lower back. It's just… age, I suppose. I don't do anything strenuous, as I said. Gardening, mostly. Bending over, planting things… It’s not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. I use a cream sometimes, but it doesn’t really help much. Honestly, I don't want to make a fuss. I just want these forms filled out and be done with it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're aware of it. Knee and lower back stiffness. There's a little crepitus in your knees, which is common with age and activity, but no significant swelling or tenderness. How is your ability to walk and climb stairs?
PATIENT: Walking is… fine. I manage. I walk to the shops, mostly. It's not a long distance. Climbing stairs… well, I avoid them when possible, if I'm honest. Our apartment is on the ground floor, thankfully. My husband keeps suggesting we move to a place with a lift, but I refuse. I like our garden. And I don't want to be dependent on machines. It's… undignified. Honestly, I’m not as spry as I used to be, but I manage. I don’t like making a fuss. Can we please get back to the forms now? This is all rather… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We can absolutely get back to the forms. These forms are about documenting your wishes for medical care, should you become unable to speak for yourself. The Advance Directive covers broader wishes, while the POLST is more specific for current medical conditions. It's important to consider what kind of treatment you would want, and what you would not want. Do you have any initial thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Wishes? What kind of wishes? I want to live, naturally. Everyone does. I don't want anything… drastic. I don't understand all this medical jargon. And frankly, I don’t want to. It's morbid. I just want to be left alone if I’m ill. Give me something for the pain, and let me rest. That's all. My husband keeps talking about “quality of life” and “end-of-life care,” but I don’t want to hear it. It’s all rather depressing. Honestly, I think these forms are unnecessary. Can’t my husband just make the decisions? He’s always been so good at these things. He’s very… decisive.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly reasonable to want to keep things simple. And yes, your husband can make decisions, but these forms ensure your wishes are known, even if there's any uncertainty. So, regarding resuscitation – if your heart stopped, would you want us to attempt CPR, or would you prefer a "do not resuscitate" order?
PATIENT: CPR? Oh, heavens, no. Absolutely not. I don't want to be poked and prodded. It sounds… barbaric. And all that breaking of ribs, I’ve heard. No, thank you. Just let me rest. If my time has come, let it come. I don’t want to be kept alive artificially. It’s undignified. Honestly, I don't understand why this is even a question. It seems rather obvious. Just… no resuscitation. Please. And no… poking and prodding of any kind. It’s rather… unsettling. Is that clear enough? Do I need to write it down? My husband will understand, naturally. He always does.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly clear. And what about mechanical ventilation?
PATIENT: Mechanical… what? A machine breathing for me? Oh, absolutely not. No, no, no. That sounds dreadful. Trapped in a hospital bed, hooked up to all sorts of wires… No, thank you. I want to be able to breathe on my own, if possible. If I can’t… well, then it’s time. I don’t want to be kept alive artificially. It’s… unnatural. Honestly, these questions are rather morbid. Can we please get this over with? I’m starting to feel quite faint. Is there any chance we can just skip to the signature line? My husband can fill in the rest. He’s very good at these things. He always knows what’s best.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marija. We can absolutely stop here. We’ve documented your wishes regarding resuscitation and your preference for comfort care. Your husband can certainly complete the rest of the form at his convenience. And if you change your mind about anything, you can always update it. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss this further?
PATIENT: No, thank you. No follow-up appointments. This is quite enough, thank you very much. My husband will handle everything. He always does. I just wanted to get it over with. Honestly, I’m quite exhausted now. Can I go now? I think I need a cup of tea and a lie-down. And please, don't call me about this again. It's rather… upsetting. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here’s the form. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you or your husband have any questions. Get some rest, Marija. And enjoy your tea. .
