DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh... well, it's about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. My wife set this up, honestly. I don't really… remember all the details, but it's to help me lose some weight, right? It's a big step.
DOCTOR: Surgery, yes. Right. Well, let's clarify. There are several surgical options for weight loss, and not all are appropriate for everyone. Before we discuss those, I need a comprehensive understanding of your current health situation. Your wife set this up, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, she did. She's… very organized. I just know I've been having trouble with… everything, really. Walking, mostly. And just feeling tired all the time. I don’t really know what kind of surgery it is. She just said it could help, and I trust her. Is there a form or something I should fill out? I'm not great at remembering things, so if there's something written down, that would be easier.
DOCTOR: We’ll certainly have plenty of forms. But first, I need to gather some information from you. It’s crucial. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm... medical conditions... That's a tough one. I think... maybe high blood pressure? The doctor mentioned something about that a while back. And I get heartburn a lot, if that counts. Honestly, I don't go to the doctor much unless I really have to. My wife usually handles all that. I… I don't remember specifics, sorry. Is there a way to look it up? Like, through a hospital or something?
DOCTOR: Let me see if we have any records on file. Ah, yes. Here we are. Bradlee Kochubey… diagnosed with hypertension approximately three years ago. Currently on… no medication listed. And some documented GERD, gastroesophageal reflux disease – that's the heartburn. Now, have you been taking anything for either of these conditions?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not for either one. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills… a long time ago, I think. They made me feel kind of dizzy, so my regular doctor said it was okay to stop. And for the heartburn, I just… take antacids when it gets bad. The over-the-counter kind. I really don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Does that make sense? I know it’s probably not ideal.
DOCTOR: It's… not ideal, no. Stopping medication without consistent monitoring is rarely advisable. Alright. Let’s move on. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Surgeries… uh… I think when I was a kid, I had my tonsils out. A long time ago, I barely remember it. And… maybe a mole removed? But that was tiny, just a little cut. Nothing major. Definitely nothing since I got married. My wife would have told me if there was, for sure. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… That's a little tricky. My parents… they’re back in Iraq. I haven’t seen them in a while. I have a brother, I think, but we don't talk much. As for health problems… honestly, I don’t really know. I never really asked. It wasn't something we talked about a lot. I know my mom had… something with her stomach, maybe? But I don't know what. It was years ago. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's… understandable. Let’s discuss your current lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife wouldn’t allow it. She’s very health-conscious. I do drink… sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe a glass of wine on the weekend. Nothing crazy. Just to relax. I don’t go out much, mostly stay home with my wife.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's get some physical measurements. We’ll need your height and weight, which I see are listed as 155 centimeters and 139 kilograms. And can you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right… the height and weight, I mean. I haven't weighed myself in a while, honestly. As for diet… It’s not great. My wife does most of the cooking, and she tries to make healthy things, but… I like to snack. Chips, mostly. And sweets. I just… crave them. I eat a lot of rice too. It’s just easier, you know? I don’t really cook for myself, so I eat whatever’s around. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's… not optimal. Now, before we proceed further, I need to conduct a physical examination. It’s essential to assess your overall health status before considering any surgical intervention. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable, okay? I’m not good with… pain.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the table. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is… elevated, as expected. 160 over 95. Pulse is 88, regular. Temperature is normal. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear, but there's some mild wheezing. Do you have any history of asthma or allergies?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not that I know of. I haven't really had problems breathing… until recently. Sometimes when I walk up the stairs, I get a little… winded. And a little bit of a cough. But I figured it was just because I’m out of shape. My wife said I should get it checked out, but I kept putting it off. I didn’t want to bother with it. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is… slightly tender to palpation. No masses are noted, but there's some degree of discomfort. Now, I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds. Bowel sounds are present, but somewhat diminished. And finally, I’ll examine your extremities for any signs of edema or neuropathy. Mild edema is present in both lower extremities. No signs of neuropathy are apparent. Alright. Based on this preliminary examination, your weight is significantly impacting your health. You have hypertension, mild asthma exacerbation, diminished bowel sounds, and edema in your lower extremities. We need to investigate the cause of the diminished bowel sounds and the edema further. Before we consider any surgical options, we need to rule out other potential underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… serious. So, surgery is off the table for now? What kind of tests do I need? And… will it cost a lot of money? My wife and I, we don’t have a lot of extra money. We haven’t even gotten health insurance yet, it’s been too expensive. I just… I want to feel better. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Like, diet changes or something?
DOCTOR: Surgery is not off the table entirely, but it is premature to proceed at this juncture. We need a comprehensive workup first. As for the tests, I recommend a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a lipid panel, a chest X-ray, and an abdominal ultrasound. This will help us identify any underlying medical conditions contributing to your symptoms. Regarding the cost… unfortunately, these tests can be expensive. Given your lack of insurance, you may want to explore options at a local hospital with financial assistance programs. As for immediate changes, a low-sodium diet, regular moderate exercise—when you are able—and avoidance of processed foods are crucial. However, these are merely palliative measures. We need to identify the root cause of your health issues before implementing any long-term treatment plan. I’m going to order these tests for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more comprehensive treatment strategy. I'll also give you a referral to a cardiologist for evaluation of your hypertension and a pulmonologist for your mild asthma. Are you able to schedule these appointments?
PATIENT: Wow… that’s a lot. A cardiologist… a pulmonologist… I’ll try to schedule them, but my wife handles all that. She’s better at keeping track of things. I… I don’t even know where to start. So, if I understand correctly, I need to get these tests done, then we talk about a real plan? And I should try to eat better and exercise, even before I get the results? I’ll do my best, Doctor. But I’m really scared, honestly. I just want to feel like myself again. .
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Blood work, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound. Cardiology and pulmonology consultations. And, as I said, dietary modifications and moderate exercise are crucial, irrespective of the test results. I understand your apprehension, Mr. Kochubey, but proactive management of your health is paramount. Here are the requisitions for the tests and the contact information for the specialists. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks, once the test results are available. Please bring all the results with you. Do you have any further questions?
