DOCTOR: Talofa lava, Ellan. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's about time someone around here offered a proper service. My neighbor, bless her heart, she’s been singing your praises. Said you were… accommodating. I need a certification for medical marijuana. My aches and pains are simply dreadful, you understand. It's a rather undignified state for a woman of my age.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of discomfort, and I appreciate you choosing me to help. And yes, I always aim to provide the best care I can. So, to start, can you tell me a bit more about these aches and pains?
PATIENT: Oh, where to begin? It’s everywhere, really. My knees, of course. They creak like an old ship. And my back… don’t even mention my back. It’s a constant throb. And these little twinges in my hands. Makes it difficult to do even the simplest things, you know? Gardening, needlepoint… terribly frustrating. I’ve tried those creams, the ones advertised on television, but they’re utterly useless. Simply a waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pain in your knees, back, and hands. And you’ve tried some topical creams without much relief. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… it was after the hurricane, I believe. That awful storm in 2020. I was helping my husband board up the windows, you see. A lot of heavy lifting, bending… strained something, I suspect. It’s never quite been the same since. Though, I suppose, one expects a certain amount of wear and tear at my age. Still, it’s quite debilitating. It interferes with my social life, you understand. Dreadfully inconvenient.
DOCTOR: So the pain started after the hurricane in 2020, following some heavy lifting and bending. And it’s been ongoing since then. Has the pain been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. Though, truthfully, there are far more "goes" than "comes" these days. Certain weather makes it worse, naturally. Dampness, cold… simply dreadful. And if I overdo it, even just a little bit – a bit too much time in the garden, perhaps – it flares up something fierce. It's a constant worry, really. One doesn't want to be incapacitated, you see. A woman has a reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse with damp weather, cold, and activity. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say your pain is usually at?
PATIENT: Hm. A scale, you say? Well, on a good day, perhaps a three or four. Manageable, but… present. But on a bad day? Oh, a solid seven, I’d say. Sometimes even an eight. It’s truly debilitating, Doctor. One simply cannot function. And I refuse to be bedridden, you understand. That simply won’t do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so typically a 3-4, but can get up to 7 or 8 on bad days. And it interferes with your daily activities. Now, have you seen any other doctors for this pain?
PATIENT: Well, I saw Dr. Alvarez, briefly, a few years back. He just kept prescribing those… pills. Painkillers, you know. They did nothing, of course, except make me feel sluggish and unwell. And I refuse to be dependent on pharmaceuticals. My neighbor, bless her heart, she said you would understand. She’s been quite clear about the benefits of… other options. Frankly, I find a natural remedy far more appealing. Besides, Dr. Alvarez didn't seem to take my concerns seriously. He dismissed me after five minutes, if you can imagine! Dreadful service.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ellan. It sounds like you didn’t have a very good experience with Dr. Alvarez. And I agree, it's always best to explore all options, including natural remedies, before relying on pharmaceuticals. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I have a touch of arthritis, the doctor says. Nothing serious, mind you, but it contributes to the stiffness. And my blood pressure is a little high, though I manage it with diet. And I had a hysterectomy years ago, of course. And… oh, and I'm slightly anemic. Nothing to write home about, really. I'm an older woman, Doctor. One expects a few… complications. It’s all very tiresome, frankly. I do try to stay active, though. Gardening keeps me going, as long as my back allows.
DOCTOR: Okay, so arthritis, high blood pressure managed with diet, previous hysterectomy, and some anemia. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones, for any of these conditions or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… for the blood pressure, the doctor prescribed something years ago, but I stopped taking it. Didn’t like the side effects. Made me feel… foggy. I take a multivitamin, of course. And occasionally, a little something for indigestion. But that’s it. I try to avoid pills as much as possible, you understand. I believe in natural remedies. And I find a good cup of chamomile tea does wonders for my nerves.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. Never had a problem with anything, thankfully. Though, I do get a slight rash if I use certain soaps. But that’s just a sensitivity, not an allergy, I suspect. Nothing to worry about. I've always been rather robust, you see. Though, lately… well, one feels a little more fragile, if I’m being honest. But allergies? No. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, to get a better understanding of your pain, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a quick look at your knees, back, and hands, to see how they’re moving and if there’s any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam, you say? Well, I suppose so. Though, I do hope it won’t be too… intrusive. I'm not one for being poked and prodded, you understand. And please be gentle. My back is quite sensitive. Just a quick look, you say? Very well. But do hurry, Doctor. I have a luncheon engagement later this afternoon. One mustn’t be late for bridge.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. Just a quick assessment. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's take a look at your knees. Can you sit on the edge of the examination table for me?
PATIENT: There. Though, I do hope this table is padded. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you understand. And please, do tell me what you’re doing as you go along. I don't like surprises. It makes me anxious. And don't bend my leg too far, Doctor. I might just scream.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. I'm just going to take a look at your knees, feeling around the joint to see if there's any swelling or tenderness. I’ll gently bend and straighten your leg to check your range of motion. Let me know if anything feels painful. Okay. I’m feeling a bit of crepitus – that’s a little bit of a grinding sound – and it’s a little bit tight bending and straightening your knee. There doesn’t seem to be any swelling. Do you feel any pain right now?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes! There! That’s quite uncomfortable. A sharp little twinge, right there. And it creaks, you know. Like an old ship, I tell you. Just like my other knee. Dreadful. Is that normal, Doctor? It doesn’t sound very good, does it? It's a worrying sound, frankly. And please, be gentle. You're pulling rather hard. My bones are quite brittle, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, I apologize for that. I will be much more gentle. The crepitus is common with arthritis, and the pain you’re feeling is likely related to that. Now, let's move on to your back. Could you please turn around so I can take a look?
PATIENT: Oh, my back... It's not very cooperative today. Please be careful, Doctor. I strained it years ago, you see. And it hasn't been the same since. Don't press too hard. And tell me what you're doing. I don't like being surprised, you understand. I'm a rather sensitive woman. And please, hurry. This table isn't very comfortable. I'm starting to feel a chill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. I'm just going to gently feel along your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. I'll also ask you to bend forward and to the sides to see how your back moves. Let me know if anything feels painful. Okay, there's a little tenderness when I press here in your lower back. It looks like your range of motion is a little bit limited. Is that painful when I ask you to bend forward?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, that’s quite… unpleasant. A sharp pain, right there. And it feels like something is… stuck. I can’t go very far, you see. It’s quite debilitating. And please, be careful! You’re pulling on my back! My spine is very delicate, you understand. I'm afraid I might just… break something. This is dreadful. Are you sure you’re a doctor? You're making me very anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, let’s stop there. I apologize for causing you pain. It sounds like there is some muscle spasm and tightness in your lower back. I am a doctor, Ellan, and I would never intentionally cause you harm. We’ll take things very slowly and gently. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Just let me hold them and examine them briefly. Can you make a fist for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Though they are rather stiff today, you see. The arthritis, you know. It flares up with the weather. And I can’t squeeze very hard. It’s quite painful. And please, be gentle! I don’t want to drop anything. I have a luncheon engagement, you see. I must be able to hold my bridge cards. This is all very… upsetting. Are you sure you can help me? I’m starting to doubt your abilities.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some mild swelling in your knuckles and a little bit of stiffness. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this arthritis for a while. The range of motion is a little bit limited, but no obvious deformity. Alright, Ellan. I’ve finished the physical exam. Overall, it looks like you're experiencing pain related to arthritis in your knees and hands, and some muscle spasm and tightness in your lower back. It sounds like this has been going on for a while, and it’s impacting your daily activities. Do those findings sound accurate to you?
PATIENT: Accurate? Oh, painfully accurate, Doctor. It’s a constant battle, you see. The aches, the stiffness… it’s simply dreadful. And it interferes with everything! Gardening, bridge, even just getting out of a chair! It's a very undignified state for a woman of my age. So, what do we do now? Are you going to prescribe me something… something that will actually help? I’m rather skeptical, frankly. But I suppose I’m willing to try anything at this point. As long as it doesn't involve any more… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ellan. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your quality of life. We have a few options we can explore. Given your history and the physical exam findings, I think it’s reasonable to consider a trial of medical marijuana to help manage your pain. However, before we proceed with that, I’d like to review your medical history one more time and discuss any potential risks or side effects. Also, I want to make sure we have ruled out any other underlying causes for your pain, such as a possible nerve impingement in your back. Would you be open to a quick MRI of your lower back just to be safe?
PATIENT: An MRI, you say? Oh dear. That sounds…invasive. And rather expensive, I imagine. And what about the radiation? Is it safe? I’ve heard dreadful things about radiation. And frankly, I’m not sure I need an MRI. It sounds like you’re just trying to run up the bill. I thought you understood my situation. I just want something to ease the pain! Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to think I should have just stayed home and taken a nap. It's all very…stressful. And I have a bridge game this afternoon. I simply must be able to concentrate. Is medical marijuana the only option?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ellan. You’re right to ask questions and be cautious. An MRI would help us rule out any serious underlying causes of your back pain, such as a pinched nerve or a herniated disc. It’s a non-invasive procedure – you lie still in a scanner, and it doesn't involve any radiation. However, if you’re not comfortable with an MRI, we can proceed with a trial of medical marijuana. It's a reasonable option given your history and the exam findings. I simply want to ensure we’re addressing the root cause of your pain and providing you with the most appropriate treatment. Are you willing to proceed with a trial of medical marijuana?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A trial, you say? Very well. But I warn you, Doctor, if it doesn't work, I shall be most displeased. And I expect you to explain everything very carefully. What form does it take? What are the side effects? And will it interfere with my bridge game? I simply must be able to concentrate. And please, no funny smells. I have a delicate constitution. A trial, you say? Very well. But I hold you responsible for any mishaps. Understand?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ellan. I will explain everything carefully, and we will proceed cautiously. Medical marijuana comes in various forms – oils, capsules, tinctures, and edibles. Given your concerns about smell and potential interference with your bridge game, I recommend starting with a sublingual tincture – a liquid that you place under your tongue. It has a relatively mild odor and provides a quicker onset of action. Potential side effects can include drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, and changes in appetite. It's important to start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed. It’s also important to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how it affects you. As for the bridge game, it's possible it could affect your concentration initially, but most patients find they can adjust to it with time. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Sublingual tincture, you say? And a low dose? Very well. But I warn you, Doctor, if I start feeling… lightheaded or anything, I shall hold you personally responsible. And no funny smells! I repeat, no funny smells! And it mustn’t interfere with my bridge game. I’m a rather competitive player, you see. Alright, proceed with your… tincture. But explain everything very carefully. What dosage should I start with? And how long before it takes effect? And what if it doesn’t work? I haven’t got all day, you know. I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon, followed by… bridge. Just explain it all. Slowly. And carefully.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. We’ll start with a very low dose – 2.5 milligrams of the sublingual tincture, taken under your tongue. Hold it there for 60-90 seconds before swallowing. It usually takes about 15-30 minutes to start feeling the effects. We will start with that dose and see how you feel. If you don’t feel any relief after 30 minutes, you can increase it to 5 milligrams. If you still don’t feel any relief, you can gradually increase it in 2.5-milligram increments, but do not exceed 10 milligrams at a time. It’s important to find the lowest dose that provides you with adequate relief without causing unwanted side effects. We will also monitor you closely to ensure it's not interfering with your cognitive function or bridge game. If you experience any unwanted side effects, such as dizziness, drowsiness, or anxiety, you should immediately stop taking it and contact me. I’m going to write you a prescription for the 2.5-milligram sublingual tincture. I will also give you a written handout with detailed instructions on how to take it, potential side effects, and when to contact me. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Hmm. 2.5 milligrams, you say? And 60-90 seconds under the tongue? Very well. And no more than 10 milligrams at a time? I suppose that’s reasonable. But what if it doesn’t work? Will it interfere with my digestion? I have a delicate stomach, you know. And one more thing. Will it show up on any medical tests? I have a check-up next month. I wouldn’t want any surprises. Explain it all, Doctor. Slowly. And carefully. I'm holding you accountable for this, you understand? And it must not interfere with my bridge game.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan, let's address those concerns. As for it not working, if 10 milligrams doesn’t provide you with adequate relief, we can discuss other options, such as increasing the dosage further under close monitoring, or exploring other forms of medical marijuana. Regarding your digestion, some patients experience mild nausea or changes in appetite, but it’s usually temporary and resolves on its own. If you experience any significant digestive issues, you should stop taking it and contact me. And regarding medical tests, yes, medical marijuana can show up on urine drug screens. It’s important to inform your doctor about your use of medical marijuana before your check-up. I will also include a note in your chart about your use of medical marijuana. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: A note in my chart, you say? Very well. I suppose that's reasonable. But what if my bridge partners find out? They might think I'm…impaired. I'm a rather competitive player, you know. I wouldn’t want them to think I'm cheating. And one last thing. Will it affect my ability to…concentrate? I need to be sharp for bridge. It's a very strategic game. And will it make me…sleepy? I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon, followed by bridge, you understand. I simply must be able to stay awake. Explain it all, Doctor. Slowly. And carefully. This is very important. And it must not interfere with my bridge game. I repeat, must not.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. We’ve discussed this extensively, and I understand your concerns about your bridge game. It's perfectly reasonable to be worried about your performance. Some patients experience mild cognitive impairment, such as difficulty concentrating or memory problems, but it’s usually temporary and resolves with time. It's more common with higher doses, which is why we're starting with a very low dose. If you experience any difficulty concentrating or memory problems, you should immediately stop taking it and contact me. It’s also important to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how it affects you. As for sleepiness, some patients experience mild drowsiness, but it’s usually temporary and resolves on its own. If you experience any significant drowsiness, you should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery. We can also adjust the timing of your dose to minimize any potential side effects. You should start by taking it a few hours before your bridge game, and see how you feel. I understand you’re a competitive player, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to minimize any potential side effects and help you maintain your performance. I'll provide you with my contact information, and I’ll be available to answer any questions or concerns you may have. Do you feel comfortable proceeding with the trial of medical marijuana at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A trial, you say? Very well. But I warn you, Doctor, if it doesn't work, or if it interferes with my bridge game, I shall be most displeased. And I expect you to be available to answer my questions at any time. I'm a rather demanding patient, you know. And one more thing. Will it affect my ability to…hold my cards steady? I need a firm grip for bridge. And will it make me…talk too much? I need to be strategic, you understand. Very well, Doctor. Proceed with your… tincture. But I hold you accountable for this, you understand? And it must not interfere with my bridge game. I repeat, must not. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a luncheon engagement. And then… bridge.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan. I understand your concerns, and I assure you that I'll do everything I can to help you. I'll be available to answer any questions or concerns you may have, and I'll monitor you closely to ensure you're not experiencing any unwanted side effects. Start with a low dose, and see how you feel. If you experience any difficulty holding your cards steady or talking too much, you should immediately stop taking it and contact me. And remember, we can adjust the timing of your dose to minimize any potential side effects. Well, enjoy your luncheon and your bridge game, Ellan. And please, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. It was nice meeting you.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I suppose we shall see. But I warn you, if it doesn't work, or if it interferes with my bridge game, I shall be most displeased. And one last thing. If I start feeling…odd, I shall hold you personally responsible. Bridge, you understand. It’s very important. Very important indeed.
