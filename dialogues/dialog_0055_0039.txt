DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. My regular doctor… passed away a few months back, bless his heart. And the new folks sent me over here for this cholesterol thing. Said it was a bit high on the tests. I don’t really understand all that stuff, to be honest. It just… showed up in the mail.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, these things happen. It’s quite common for numbers to… fluctuate. Cholesterol, of course, is a lipid – a fat – in your blood. It's not necessarily a cause for alarm, but it is something we should investigate further. I see here in your chart you are 88 years of age. And your weight is… quite low, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, 88. Feels older some days, I tell you what. And yes, I’m a bit of a lightweight. Always have been. Never had much of an appetite, even when I was a young man. My wife, God rest her soul, used to worry about it all the time, trying to get me to eat. I just… don't get hungry much. Is that a problem? Is that got something to do with this cholesterol business?
DOCTOR: It can be relevant, Mr. Bohnett. A consistently low appetite, particularly at your age, warrants attention. It could indicate a number of things, none of them particularly pleasant. Now, let's focus on this cholesterol for the moment. Do you happen to recall what the specific numbers were, or which type of cholesterol was elevated, if anything?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I just glanced at the paper and saw “high” and then a bunch of numbers. Honestly, it all looked like a foreign language! I remember it was on a little card stuck to a bigger report, but I tossed the report. Just kept the card 'cause it said I needed to come see someone. I'm afraid I'm not very good with remembering details like that... unless it's something about the old days, you know? I can tell you every detail about the fishing trip I took with my father in '58, though. Does that help?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate a good anecdote, Mr. Bohnett, I require more… concrete information to proceed. It's unfortunate you discarded the report. Very well. We will have to repeat the lipid panel. Before we do that, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've been lucky, I suppose. A bit of arthritis in my knees, which is just old age creeping up on me, and I had the flu pretty bad one winter, but that was years ago. Never been in the hospital for anything serious. My wife did have some trouble with her heart towards the end, but I don’t think that runs in the family. I’ve always been pretty active, walking and gardening mostly. I still try to get out in the garden every day, weather permitting. Is that important? Knowing about the garden, I mean.
DOCTOR: Activity levels are… noted, Mr. Bohnett. While a healthy lifestyle is commendable, it doesn’t preclude the possibility of underlying medical issues. Now, you mentioned your wife’s heart trouble. Was she on any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, she was. A lot of them, as I recall. Little pills, mostly. She had something… something about her rhythm being off, I think. And she took something to thin her blood. She went to the doctor a lot towards the end. I mostly just drove her and tried to remember what the doctor said. I wasn't very good at remembering medical terms, even then. I know she was very worried about getting a stroke, that's why she took the blood thinner. Does knowing what she took help you any? I’m really trying to be helpful here, but I feel like I’m just rambling.
DOCTOR: It's… acceptable, Mr. Bohnett. The details are vague, but the information regarding her rhythm issue and blood thinner is potentially relevant. Now, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've eaten just about everything over the years, and never had a reaction. My wife was a bit sensitive to some pollen, I think, but I’ve always been pretty sturdy. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I do get a bit of a sniffle sometimes in the spring, but that’s just the dust, I reckon. I did get stung by a bee once, when I was a boy, but I didn’t have any trouble beyond a bit of swelling and pain. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, a single bee sting decades ago is… not particularly pertinent, Mr. Bohnett. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees. Some sort of cream, you rub it on. Helps with the arthritis, a bit. I get it at the drugstore, can’t remember the name right now. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take one of those… what do you call them? Melatonin, I think. Just one, sometimes two, when I’m really restless. That's all. Nothing else. Oh, and I take a vitamin D pill in the winter, 'cause the doctor said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. But that's it, really. Just a few little things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed with the blood work, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination. It will be… routine. I will listen to your heart and lungs, and check your vital signs. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Sounds sensible. Never did mind a good check-up. Though I tell you what, Doctor, I’m not as spry as I used to be. Might need a little help getting up there.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bohnett. Allow me. Now, if you’ll just lie flat… Heart rate is regular, but slightly slow at 62 beats per minute. I detect a faint murmur, grade 1/6. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, though slightly diminished at the bases. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is weak and regular. I note some mild edema in the lower extremities. Well, Mr. Bohnett, the physical examination reveals some… minor abnormalities, but nothing immediately concerning. However, given your age and your reported symptoms, and your wife’s medical history, we will proceed with a complete blood panel to assess your cholesterol levels and overall health. A urine sample would also be prudent. I will have the nurse assist you with that.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds thorough. A bit of a lot, but I suppose that’s what doctors are for, isn’t it? A bit of poking and prodding. And a bit of peeing in a cup, if you don’t mind. I suppose it’s all for the best. Though I still don't understand what all this means. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is… premature to draw any conclusions, Mr. Bohnett. We are simply gathering information at this stage. The blood work will provide a more comprehensive picture of your health. The murmur is not particularly alarming, but warrants further investigation. I will have the nurse draw the necessary samples. Once the results are available – typically within a few days – we will discuss them in detail and formulate an appropriate plan of action. For now, there is no need for undue concern. However, it is essential that you follow up with me as soon as you receive a call from the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Not right now, anyway. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor, even if I don't quite understand everything. I just… appreciate you taking the time to look at me. And I guess I’ll just wait for the results, then. And I’ll be sure to call when you say so. Thank you kindly. Can I get dressed now?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bohnett. You may get dressed. The nurse will be in shortly to escort you out. .
PATIENT: Alright, thank you Doctor. .
