DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor Pitmon. It’s…it’s an itch, really. Everywhere, almost. Been going on for a little while now, and it's driving me a bit crazy. Not a sharp itch, just…constant.
DOCTOR: “An itch, everywhere, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty much. Hard to describe, you know? It’s not like a bug bite or anything. It’s…all over. Arms, legs, back…even my scalp sometimes. And it doesn’t really go away, it just…shifts around. It's been maybe three weeks now, I think. August 2nd already…time flies. I remember when it started, it was right after I got back from visiting my daughter in Florida.
DOCTOR: Right. Florida, you say. And it's been three weeks now… shifting around, not a sharp itch. Okay. Have you noticed anything specifically that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Let me think. Not really anything I can pinpoint. I tried switching laundry detergents, just in case, but that didn't help. And I haven’t been using any new soaps or lotions. I do spend a lot of time in the garden, so maybe something from there? But I always wear gloves. I’m really not sure, Doctor. It just…is.
DOCTOR: Gardening, gloves…Alright. And has this itch been accompanied by any rash, bumps, or changes in your skin color?
PATIENT: No, that’s the strange thing! No rash, no bumps, no change in color at all. That's why I figured it was worth coming in. It’s just…itchy. Plain and simple. My wife, God rest her soul, always said I worried too much. Maybe it’s nothing, but it’s driving me up the wall. It keeps me up at night, you know? I'm a light sleeper.
DOCTOR: So, no visible changes to the skin…just the itch itself, disrupting your sleep. Right. Let's go through some general health questions then. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything. I take a little something for my blood pressure, lisinopril, but that’s it. And I haven’t changed that at all. I get my prescriptions filled at the pharmacy down on Main Street – good folks there. They always double-check everything. I had a bit of a scare with my cholesterol a few years back, but that’s under control now too.
DOCTOR: Alright, lisinopril, no other medications. No known allergies. Good. Now, have you had any significant medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was routine, no complications. And I broke my wrist when I was younger, playing hockey. Still get a little ache in it when it’s cold. But nothing major, really. My wife, she handled most of the doctor appointments. I always let her worry about the details. She was good at that sort of thing. I miss her a lot, you know? It’s been five years now.
DOCTOR: Right. I understand. Gallbladder removal, broken wrist...And your family history, sir?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, like me. My father, he had… arthritis, I think. Nothing really… dramatic. My sister's healthy as a horse, lives in California. We don't talk much anymore, though. She's always been a bit… independent. I don’t really know much about her medical history. It's not something we discuss. Mostly just birthdays and Christmas cards. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational substances?
PATIENT: No, no smoking, never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, but I cut that out a few years ago. Doc told me it wasn’t helping the blood pressure. And absolutely no recreational substances, Doctor. Never been interested in any of that. A quiet evening at home with a good book is more my style. I'm a simple man, really.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no other substances. Alright. Let me ask you about your social situation. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do live alone. My wife, like I said, passed away a few years ago. I have a daughter, she lives in Florida, but she has her own family, her own life. She visits when she can, but it’s not often. I keep busy, though. Garden, read, volunteer at the library. Try to stay active, you know? It gets lonely sometimes, but I manage. I keep a clean house, at least. That helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you live alone, active lifestyle…Okay. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Just to rule out anything obvious. Can you please roll up your sleeves and lower the collar of your shirt?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Here you go. Just let me know if you need anything else. I'm a bit chilly, actually. This air conditioning is something fierce.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Skin appears normal. No visible rash, lesions, or excoriations. I don’t see any signs of anything obviously dermatological. Let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me…and exhale. Heart sounds regular. Lungs clear. No wheezes or crackles. Blood pressure is…138/82. Pulse is 72. Within normal limits, I suppose.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That's… reassuring, at least. So, what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’ve been reading online, and you know how that goes… all sorts of terrible things. I try not to worry, but it’s hard, you know? My daughter keeps telling me to relax, but it's just… constant.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Ferneding, I strongly advise against self-diagnosing online. It invariably leads to unnecessary anxiety. Based on your history and the physical exam, there’s no obvious cause for concern. It could be a mild form of eczema, or even just dry skin exacerbated by…well, whatever you’re doing. Or, and this is more likely, it could be psychogenic. Meaning, it's stress-related. You've experienced a significant loss recently, and these things manifest physically sometimes. I’d like to start you on a mild emollient lotion, apply it twice daily. And, frankly, I recommend you consider exploring some stress-management techniques. Perhaps talking to someone. We can also do some bloodwork to rule out any underlying conditions, but I don't expect it to reveal anything.
PATIENT: Psychogenic… so you’re saying it’s all in my head? I appreciate you being honest, Doctor, but I've always been a pretty calm person. I mean, losing my wife was hard, of course, but I thought I was coping okay. Gardening helps, reading helps… I don’t know. It just feels… real. Bloodwork sounds like a good idea, at least. Just to be sure. And I guess I could try the lotion. What kind do you recommend? Something without a strong smell, if possible. I have a sensitive nose. Maybe talking to someone wouldn’t hurt, but… it’s not really my style.
DOCTOR: Alright. CeraVe is a good option – fragrance-free, non-comedogenic. It’s available at most pharmacies. As for the bloodwork, I’ll write you a requisition. It’ll just be a standard CBC and metabolic panel. Rule out anything obvious. As for the…stress, I’m not suggesting it’s all in your head, Mr. Ferneding. It’s just that sometimes the body reacts to emotional stress in unusual ways. I’m not pushing therapy, but it is an option. I’ll also write a note for a referral to dermatology if it doesn’t improve with the lotion in a month. This is a common complaint and is rarely serious but we want to rule out anything else. Any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for your time, and for explaining things so clearly. The CeraVe sounds good, and I’ll get the bloodwork done right away. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s… comforting to know it’s probably nothing serious, even if it’s just my nerves. And thank you for the referral, just in case. I’ll keep you updated. Have a good day, Doctor Pitmon. .
DOCTOR: Very well. If it doesn't improve, or worsens, do not hesitate to schedule another appointment. Have a good day.
