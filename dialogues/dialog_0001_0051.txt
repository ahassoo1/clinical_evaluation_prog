DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Nini, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Pehrson, is it? Yes, yes. Well, it's a bit silly, really. My… someone – my daughter, I think – said I should come in and get my… blood type written down somewhere. Just in case. You know, for emergencies. I don't rightly remember ever having it checked, and I'm getting on, aren't I? A long time ago, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. A blood type. Okay. And is there anything else you're here for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, dear. Just the blood type. Though… now that you mention it… my knees have been a bit creaky lately. But that's just old age, I expect. Not a doctor's problem, is it? I just… wanted to be prepared, that’s all. My daughter gets so worried, you see. A very sensible girl.
DOCTOR: Well, we can note the knee pain. But frankly, a blood type request without any other medical concerns… it’s not exactly a productive use of my time. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I didn’t mean to cause trouble! No, no other symptoms… not that I recall. Just… tired sometimes. But who isn’t? I sleep alright, I think. Though I do sometimes… forget where I put my glasses. Is that a symptom? Honestly, I just want to be sure… in case something does happen. My husband… well, he passed a long time ago, and I want to make things easier for the children, you see. It's probably nothing, I'm just being an old worrywart.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s just get this over with. I'm going to order a basic blood panel, which includes your blood type. It’ll also give us a baseline for some other things, just to be thorough. We’ll need to take some blood. Have you eaten anything today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I had a little toast and coffee this morning. A very small piece of toast, mind you. It was… around nine, I think? Or was it ten? Time slips away so easily these days. Will the toast… interfere with the blood? I didn’t want to upset my stomach before coming here. Perhaps I should have skipped breakfast.
DOCTOR: It's fine. A small piece of toast isn’t going to ruin the test. Let's just get you back there and get the blood drawn. The nurse will ask you some questions while she's doing it. Don’t worry, it’ll be quick. Follow me.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s a relief. Thank you, Doctor. Lead the way, dear. I do hope the nurse is a kind one. Needles… they never did agree with me. Though I suppose it’s necessary, isn’t it? My daughter always says I'm a bit of a drama queen. Perhaps she's right.
DOCTOR: She’s perfectly capable. Just try to relax. We'll get this done quickly. She'll be right with you. I have other patients to see.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. I will try… though I make no promises! It’s a very nice room, isn't it? Not as scary as I imagined. Though, I still don’t like needles… but one can't avoid everything, I suppose. I just wish my daughter was here to hold my hand. She worries so.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's just get this over with. Nurse, we're ready for blood work. And Mrs. Nini, I'm going to ask a few basic questions while the nurse gets things set up. Any allergies to latex or anything?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me see. I don’t think so, dear. Not that I recall. I used to garden a lot, and I certainly didn't react to the flowers. Though, I did get stung by a bee once… a very nasty sting it was! But that was… a very long time ago. My husband… he always used to put cream on it. No latex allergies though, I don’t think. Though, I haven't used a balloon in years! I'm just a simple old woman, really. Is that enough information, dear? I do try to remember things, but it's harder these days.
DOCTOR: Fine. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just a little something for my waterworks, you know? Can't quite remember the name of it. A small white pill. I take it every morning, I believe. It helps me… sleep through the night. Though, sometimes I still get up once or twice… It's been years since the doctor prescribed it. She retired, you see. A very nice lady. Perhaps she knows my husband… a long time ago. No, no, I’m rambling again. Just the little white pill for my bladder. That's all, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nurse, get a full medication reconciliation. I need a list of everything she's taken in the last six months, including over-the-counter things. Honestly, this is going to take all day. Do you know anything about this medication?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I’m so sorry. I really don’t. I just ask my daughter to pick it up for me. She handles all the… paperwork and things. I trust her completely, of course. It's just… my memory isn’t what it used to be. My husband used to say I could forget my own name! Perhaps it’s a family trait. It’s probably just some harmless little pill for… well, you know. A woman's troubles. I just want to get the blood type sorted, and then I can go home and have a nice cup of tea. Is that too much to ask? I feel like such a bother.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm going to have the nurse take a detailed history while I see other patients. If you can't remember what you're taking, it's going to be very difficult to provide appropriate care. She'll be right with you. And please, try to focus. This isn’t just about the blood type.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Well… all right then. I suppose I will try. But it's so very hard when one’s mind isn't what it used to be. My husband… he always said I was a bit scattered. Perhaps I should just write things down, shouldn't I? But where is a pen… and paper… I’ll just sit here and… think, I suppose. A nice cup of tea would help, wouldn’t it? I'm probably just a hopeless case.
