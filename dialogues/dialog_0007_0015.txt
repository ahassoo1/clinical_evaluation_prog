DOCTOR: Hi Mikeisha, welcome. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Thank you. Um... my sinuses. They are… bothering me. A lot of pressure, yes. It’s been… a little while, I think. Not sure exactly how long. It feels like a long time though.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus pressure. I understand. And you said it’s been going on for a little while – would you say weeks, months?
PATIENT: Hmm… Months, I believe. Yes, months. Maybe… three or four? It’s hard to remember exactly. Things have been… busy. It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes better, sometimes worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months with fluctuating symptoms. And when it is worse, what does that feel like specifically?
PATIENT: Like… a heavy feeling. Right here, and behind my eyes. And… stuffy. Very stuffy. Hard to breathe through my nose sometimes. Not… fever, I don’t think so. Just… uncomfortable. And a little bit of… ache. A dull ache, not a bad pain. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Heavy feeling, stuffiness, and a dull ache. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside that?
PATIENT: Um… maybe a little tired. But I work long hours, so… it’s hard to tell if that’s from the sinuses or the job. And… sometimes my throat feels scratchy. But not always. I don’t… I don't know if that’s connected. It could just be… dry air, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional scratchy throat. Let’s talk about your past medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with allergies, asthma, or chronic sinusitis before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I’ve never really… been to the doctor much. Just for check-ups, mostly. And… when I get hurt at work. I don’t remember anyone saying anything about allergies or… asthma. Or that other thing you said… sinusitis? Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, sinusitis itself isn’t necessarily bad, but chronic sinusitis – meaning it lasts a long time – can be uncomfortable. Okay, so no prior diagnoses. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No… no surgeries. Nothing like that. Just… a few stitches here and there at work, when I get cut. But nothing… big. No big operations. I hope not! I don’t like hospitals very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mama, she had… I don’t remember exactly. Something with her stomach, I think. She passed away a long time ago. My husband’s family, they seem healthy enough. No one I remember having… problems like this. With their sinuses. It’s hard to say, really. We don’t see them very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Let's talk about your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. Sometimes I take… ibuprofen, for the aches at work. But that’s it. Nothing regularly. And I don’t think I have any… allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband always says I’ll eat anything. I don't think I've ever had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed and no known allergies. Just to be thorough, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoking. Never smoked. And… very little alcohol. Just a little wine sometimes, with dinner. My husband likes to drink beer, but I don’t very often. It makes me feel… funny. Not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, very limited alcohol consumption. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs, check your ears, nose, and throat, and maybe tap on your sinuses to see if they're tender. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. As long as it doesn’t hurt too much. My sinuses are already sore, you know? I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Okay. Lungs sound clear. Now, let me take a look at your ears… Ears look normal. No sign of infection. Now, let's check your nose… There’s some mild swelling of the nasal passages, but no obvious polyps. And finally, let me take a look at your throat... Throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Now, I'm going to gently tap on your sinuses to see if there's any tenderness… Hmm… tenderness over your frontal and maxillary sinuses. Not severe, but definitely present.
PATIENT: Ouch… yes, that’s where it hurts. Right there. And… a little bit here, on my cheeks. It’s not a bad pain, like a headache, but… uncomfortable. It feels… pressure-y. Is that bad, Doctor? What does that mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, so tenderness in your frontal and maxillary sinuses, with a pressure sensation. That, along with the mild nasal swelling and redness of your throat, points towards sinusitis. Given the length of time you’ve been experiencing these symptoms – three or four months – it sounds like you have chronic sinusitis. Now, chronic sinusitis can be caused by a lot of things – allergies, infections, nasal polyps, or even structural issues within the nasal passages. Because you haven't had a prior diagnosis of allergies and we haven't found any polyps during the exam, it's likely this is due to a long-standing inflammation. I'd recommend starting with a trial of saline nasal rinses twice daily to help clear out the nasal passages and reduce inflammation. We can also try an over-the-counter decongestant for a few days, but don’t use it for longer than five days. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week or two, or if they worsen, we may need to consider further testing, like a CT scan of your sinuses to look for any structural abnormalities, or refer you to an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Saline… rinses? And… decongestant. Okay. I can try that. What do the rinses… do? And where do I get the decongestant? Is it… expensive? I don’t have… a lot of money right now. And a CT scan… that sounds… scary. I hope we don’t need that.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take it one step at a time. Saline rinses simply help to clear out the mucus and debris from your nasal passages, which can reduce inflammation and pressure. You can buy a saline rinse kit at most pharmacies – they're relatively inexpensive, usually around $10-$20. Or, you can make your own using distilled water and non-iodized salt. I can give you instructions on how to do that. As for the decongestant, that helps to temporarily open up your nasal passages and relieve congestion. You can find over-the-counter decongestants – like pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine – at most pharmacies as well. They’re also relatively inexpensive – usually around $10-$15. As for the CT scan, don’t worry about that right now. It’s just a precaution, and we’ll only consider it if your symptoms don’t improve with the initial treatment. We’ll start with the saline rinses and decongestant, and see how you feel. Does that sound more reassuring?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… much better. Saline rinses and… decongestant. I can do that. The rinses sound… easy enough. I’ll try to remember to get them at the pharmacy. And the decongestant… I’ll be careful not to use it too long. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very well. I appreciate that. Could you… write down the instructions for the rinses? I forget things easily, you know. And the name of the decongestant, just in case.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here you go. This sheet includes detailed instructions for the saline rinses – how often to do them, how to mix the solution, and precautions to take. It also lists a few common over-the-counter decongestants – pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine – but please read the labels carefully and follow the dosage instructions. I also want to mention, since you mentioned difficulty remembering things, it's important to stay hydrated – drink plenty of fluids – and get enough rest. That can also help with your symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Thank you. This is… very helpful. No, I don’t think so. Just… stay hydrated and rest. Yes, I can try that. My husband is very good at making me rest. He worries about me. I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor Hernandez. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad I could help. If your symptoms don't improve after a week or two, or if they worsen, please don’t hesitate to come back and see me. And remember to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Thank you again. Goodbye.
