DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Pithan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doc, it's this cough. Been hangin' on for… a while now, I guess. And I’m just tired all the time. Seems like I get a sinus infection every other month too. It’s gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: A cough, tiredness, and frequent sinus infections. Right. “A while now” isn’t terribly specific, Mr. Pithan. Can you be a bit more precise?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started… maybe last fall? Around October, I reckon. It started as just a little tickle, you know? Thought it was just a cold. But it just… didn't go away. Then the sinus stuff started around January, I think. Maybe February. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. They all kinda blend together.
DOCTOR: So, the cough began around October of last year, and the sinus infections started in January or February. And these sinus infections… how often would you say they occur now?
PATIENT: Like I said, every other month, give or take. Sometimes a bit closer together, sometimes a little further apart. Usually starts with a stuffy nose, then headache, you know the drill. Feels like my head’s gonna split open. Then the green… stuff. Sorry, Doc. Not the most pleasant thing to talk about.
DOCTOR: It’s all part of the job, Mr. Pithan. “Green stuff”... nasal discharge, then. Any fever with these sinus infections?
PATIENT: Usually not a high one. Just kinda warm, you know? Not shiverin' or nothin'. Maybe 101, 102 max. It doesn't last long, either. Usually gone in a day or two, but the stuffiness and cough hang around forever. That cough is what's really botherin' me now, Doc. It just won’t quit.
DOCTOR: Right, a low-grade fever associated with the sinus issues. And the cough is persistent. Is this cough productive?
PATIENT: Productive? What does that even mean, Doc? Do you mean... do I cough stuff up? Yeah, I do. Mucus. Sometimes it’s clear, sometimes it’s yellow-ish. Depends, I guess. Look, I ain't a doctor, I just tell you what's happenin'.
DOCTOR: Yes, "productive" means you cough up something. Mucus. We've established that. And has anything – anything at all – made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, nothin’ really makes it better, Doc. That's why I'm here! Uh… being inside with the heat on seems to help a little, maybe? Makes the mucus a bit looser. And bein' outside in the cold definitely makes it worse. Makes it tighter, harder to breathe. I work outside, so that's a problem. Doesn't really fix it, just kinda changes it.
DOCTOR: So, cold air exacerbates the cough, and heat provides minimal relief. Any chest pain with the cough?
PATIENT: No, Doc, no chest pain. Just… tired. Really tired. And the cough just rattles my whole body sometimes, ya know? It’s more annoying than painful. It keeps me up at night, that’s the worst of it. I just want to be able to sleep through the night. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pithan. Let's do a quick listen to your lungs and check your sinuses. Then we'll see what we can figure out. If you'll just hop up on the table for me.
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Sounds good. Let’s get it over with, huh? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yeah, kinda tender right here, Doc. And a little bit on the sides, near my cheekbones. Not awful, but… definitely somethin'. It's kinda achy, you know? Not a sharp pain, just… pressure.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation over the frontal and maxillary sinuses. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but with some mild wheezing on exhalation. You said this started last fall, and you work outside… do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of, Doc. Never been tested for 'em. Grew up on the reservation, spent a lot of time outdoors. You get used to… stuff. A little hay fever sometimes in the spring, maybe? But nothin' serious. Never had to worry about it much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history and the exam findings… it could be a chronic sinus infection, possibly exacerbated by environmental factors and some mild reactive airway disease. However… we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Sounds… complicated, Doc. X-rays and blood work? Is it somethin’ serious? I just figured it was a bad cough and some sinus trouble. I don't like hospitals much. How long will it take to get the results? And… how much is all this gonna cost?
DOCTOR: It’s routine, Mr. Pithan. Just to cover all the bases. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to be certain. The X-ray will just give us a picture of your lungs. The blood work will tell us if there's an infection and how your body is doing. As for cost… I don’t have that information readily available, you'll need to check with your insurance provider. The results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter decongestants and saline nasal spray. And try to limit your exposure to cold air as much as possible. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab now. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: I guess not, Doc. Just… I hope it ain't somethin’ bad. I just want to feel normal again. Okay, over-the-counter stuff… saline spray… and stay warm. I think that’s everything. I’d like to get goin’ if you're finished here.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab results will be sent to my office, and someone will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they're available. Don't hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen. Next!
