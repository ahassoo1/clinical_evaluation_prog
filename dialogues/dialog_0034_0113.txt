DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you're here with us today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Seil, you say? Hmm. Yes, well… it’s this bladder of mine, really. Keeps bothering me. I seem to be going to the little boys’ room awfully often these days. It's… inconvenient, let’s put it that way. Not like the old days, not at all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, I don't know what's going on, that's why I'm here, isn’t it? But… it's just… more often. Especially at night. Waking me up. My wife gets annoyed, naturally. She says I disturb her sleep. Honestly, it’s probably just old age creeping in. Things just… wear out, you know? Like a tractor.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Segretto. It’s good you’re getting this checked out, even if it is potentially just age-related changes. Frequent urination at night, what we call nocturia, and increased frequency during the day are things we need to investigate. Could you tell me approximately how many times you’re getting up to urinate at night, and about how often during the day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… always with the numbers. I'm not good with numbers, Doctor. Let me think… At night… maybe two, three times? Sometimes more if I drink something before bed. My wife makes me a little chamomile tea, you see… helps me sleep. And during the day… oh, I'd say… a lot. More than usual. I used to be able to go hours, now it’s… constantly feeling like I need to go. It's… bothersome. Really bothersome.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. That gives me a better idea. So, two to three times at night and a noticeably increased frequency during the day. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself – color, smell, or difficulty with the stream?
PATIENT: Difficulty, you say? Well, it’s not painful, exactly. Just… sometimes it takes a little longer to get going. Like a rusty pump. And the color… hmm. It looks normal enough. Yellow, I suppose. Never paid much attention to it, honestly. I just go when I need to go. Smell… I don't know. I’m an old farmer, Doctor. I'm used to smells. Doesn't bother me any. Though my wife might have a stronger nose than I do.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a slightly slower stream, but no pain, and the urine appears normal to you. No changes in smell that you've noticed. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never been told that. High blood pressure… maybe a little, years ago, but the doctor put me on a little pill for it. I take it every day, mostly. And prostate… hmm. Now that you mention it, the doctor did say something about that a few years back. Something about it being enlarged. But he didn't seem too worried. Just told me to keep an eye on things. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details. Old age, you know? Things slip your mind. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. It’s perfectly normal to forget details. So, you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and were told you have an enlarged prostate a few years ago. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. The name… now that’s a good one. It’s a little white pill, I believe. Small one. I get it refilled every month at the pharmacy. I don't… I don't usually pay attention to the name, Doctor. My wife handles all that. She's the organized one, always remembering everything. Honestly, I just take the pill when she tells me to. It’s… embarrassing to admit, but it's the truth.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Segretto. Many patients prefer not to worry about the specifics of their medications. We can look it up in your records. Let me just access your electronic health record here. Okay, I see here you're taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that sounds right. Lisinopril. Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Now, I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long, long time ago. And… and I had a hernia operation, I believe. Maybe ten, fifteen years ago? Something like that. It was… unpleasant. Lots of pain. But the doctor fixed it, so that’s what matters. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve had a long life. A lot of aches and pains along the way.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendectomy and hernia repair in the past. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I eat everything, mostly. My wife tries to get me to eat more vegetables, but I'm a simple man. I like my meats and potatoes. Never had a problem with any medicine. I've taken all sorts of things over the years, for colds and aches and pains. Nothing ever bothered me. But then again, I don’t remember everything. This getting old is a real nuisance, you know? A real nuisance.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and he died young. Nasty habit. Drink… I used to, years ago. A beer with dinner sometimes. But not anymore. My doctor told me to cut back, so I did. And… recreational drugs? Doctor, I'm a farmer! I spend my days tending to my crops and livestock. I don't have time for… shenanigans. A simple life, that’s me. A simple, honest life.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Segretto. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… yes, alright. I suppose so. Just don't poke around too much, Doctor. These old bones aren't what they used to be. What will you be doing exactly? I like to know what’s going on, you see. A man’s got a right to know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I understand. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your abdomen. Then, I’ll do a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. Finally, I will perform a digital rectal exam to assess the size and texture of your prostate. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it’s important for evaluating your prostate. I'll explain everything as I go. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A… digital rectal exam? Well, now. That doesn’t sound particularly pleasant, Doctor. But… if it’s important, I suppose I can endure it. A man does what he has to, doesn’t he? But… you’ll be gentle, yes? And… you’ll explain everything? I don’t like surprises. This getting old is… undignified. Really undignified. But… alright. Do it. Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension, Mr. Segretto. It is a sensitive exam, and I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. I’ll explain each step as I go and stop if you’re uncomfortable at any point. First, let's get your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not significantly so. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Now I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now let's move on to examining your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Now, I'll need you to lie on your side for a moment to perform the digital rectal exam.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with. Just… be careful. And… try not to poke around too much, Doctor. Honestly, this is… most unpleasant. I’m a simple man, I tell you. A simple farmer. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Segretto, I’m finished with the exam. It was a little uncomfortable, I imagine, but you did very well. I did detect some enlargement of your prostate, which is consistent with your history. It doesn’t feel particularly hard or irregular, which is reassuring. Now, let's sit up. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings, it’s likely you’re experiencing benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. This is a common condition in men as they age, where the prostate gland enlarges and can cause urinary symptoms like frequent urination, especially at night. However, to rule out other potential causes, such as an infection or more serious conditions, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. The PSA test will help us assess your prostate-specific antigen level, which can be elevated in cases of prostate cancer. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Cancer? Now hold on just a minute, Doctor. Cancer? You didn't mention anything about cancer before! Just this… this enlarged prostate. And now you’re talking about tests for cancer? That sounds… serious. Very serious. Honestly, I came in here for a little bladder trouble, not… not a cancer scare. Is it definitely cancer, then? Do I need… surgery? Chemo? This is not what I signed up for, Doctor. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, please, let's not jump to conclusions. I mentioned the PSA test as a routine part of evaluating your prostate, not because I think you definitely have cancer. It's simply a screening test to help us rule out any more serious conditions. Many men with an enlarged prostate do not have cancer. The PSA test is a blood test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by the prostate gland. An elevated level can sometimes indicate prostate cancer, but it can also be elevated for other reasons, such as infection or inflammation. If the PSA level is elevated, we may need to do further testing, such as a biopsy, to determine if cancer is present. But again, that's just a possibility at this point. Let's start with the urine analysis and PSA test. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps, if any are needed. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. Do the tests. But… explain everything. Everything! I want to know the numbers. I want to know what they mean. I want to know all the possibilities. And… don't sugarcoat anything, Doctor. I'm an old man, I've lived a long life. I can handle the truth. But… please. Be clear. And… don't mention cancer again unless you absolutely have to. It's… upsetting. Just… do the tests. And explain everything. That's all I ask. Everything.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Segretto. I will absolutely explain everything to you in detail, and I won’t mention cancer unless it’s absolutely necessary. I'll be clear and honest with you every step of the way. We’ll start with a urine analysis to check for any signs of infection or other abnormalities. Then, we’ll do a simple blood draw to measure your PSA level. The lab results typically take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, you can continue to drink a reasonable amount of fluids, but avoid excessive caffeine or alcohol, which can irritate your bladder. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… questions. Well… what happens if the… if this PSA level is high? What does that actually mean? Do I need… a lot of tests then? And… will it hurt? And… how long will all this take? I’ve got crops to tend to, you know. Can’t be spending all my time at the doctor’s office. It's just… unsettling, this whole thing. A man wants to know what he’s facing, you see? Just tell me straight. No sugarcoating. Everything.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Segretto. Let’s take them one at a time. If your PSA level is elevated, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have cancer. Many things can cause an elevation, including infection, inflammation, an enlarged prostate itself, or even recent ejaculation. If the level is mildly elevated, we may repeat the test after a few weeks to see if it changes. If it remains elevated, we may consider further testing, such as a digital rectal exam again to assess the prostate’s texture more closely. We could also consider a prostate ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create an image of the prostate gland. If those tests suggest something more concerning, we may discuss a prostate biopsy, where a small sample of tissue is taken from the prostate gland and examined under a microscope. That is the only way to definitively diagnose or rule out prostate cancer. The biopsy does involve some discomfort, but it’s usually well-tolerated. We can discuss pain management options if needed. As for how long all this will take, it depends on the results of each test. But we’ll move as quickly as possible to get you answers and formulate a plan. We can schedule appointments that work around your schedule as much as possible. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Ultrasound… and biopsy… sounds… unpleasant. Very unpleasant. But… I suppose I have no choice, do I? If it's important, I’ll do what I have to. But… can you guarantee it won't hurt? And… how long does this biopsy take? And… will it interfere with my… with my activities? I need to tend to my crops, you see. Can’t be laid up in bed for weeks. A man’s got responsibilities, Doctor. A man’s got to know what he's facing. Just… be honest with me. Everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Segretto. It’s perfectly natural to be anxious about these tests. I can't guarantee it won’t hurt, but we can take steps to minimize discomfort. A local anesthetic is used during the biopsy to numb the area, and we can prescribe pain medication afterward to manage any discomfort. The biopsy usually takes about 30-60 minutes to perform. You’ll likely experience some mild discomfort or bleeding for a few days afterward, but it’s usually manageable with rest and over-the-counter pain medication. You may experience some blood in your urine or stool for a few days after the biopsy, and we’ll advise you to avoid strenuous activities for a week or two to allow the area to heal. We can discuss how this might affect your farm work and develop a plan to minimize any disruption. However, I want to reiterate that we’re not at the biopsy stage yet. We need to start with the urine analysis and PSA test to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Do you have any questions about the urine analysis or PSA test specifically?
PATIENT: No… I suppose not. Just… get it over with. Do the tests. And then… we’ll see. I've got to get back to the farm. Crops don't tend themselves, you know. Thank you, Doctor. For… explaining everything. Even the unpleasant parts. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. I understand. I'll have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they’ll schedule your blood draw. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And I wish you all the best with your crops. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, Mr. Segretto.
