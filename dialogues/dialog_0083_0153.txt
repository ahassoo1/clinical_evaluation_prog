DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Alanes, you said? Yes, yes... it's about a physical, I believe. Something about needing to be cleared for… work. Acting work. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. They just sent me over. Is that right? I don’t really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, I see here you have a request for a work physical for acting work. That explains it. No worries about the details being fuzzy; we can sort everything out. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about the type of acting work you do?
PATIENT: Acting… well, mostly small things. Ushering, sometimes. Lobby work. Taking tickets. That sort of thing. Not… not big roles, if that’s what you mean. Just… being around the performances, you know? It’s been a while. A long while, I think. I mostly just want to get this over with so I can… well, so I can get on with things. Do I need to tell you everything I’ve ever done? Because honestly, I can barely recall last week.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Krahn, you certainly don’t need to tell me everything. Just the relevant information. Since this is for work, knowing what the physical demands of the job are will be most helpful. Ushering and lobby work sound like they involve some standing and walking – is there any lifting, carrying, or repetitive motion involved?
PATIENT: Lifting… sometimes. Small things, mostly. Programs, boxes of tickets. Nothing heavy. And yes, a lot of standing. My feet… they used to ache. That’s all I really remember. And walking, definitely walking. Back and forth, back and forth. Repetitive… oh, yes, punching tickets, taking them, sorting them. It wasn’t strenuous, I don’t think. Just… a lot. It was a long time ago, though. Is this important? Will knowing all this change things?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Mr. Krahn, thank you. Standing, walking, and some light lifting – that gives me a good starting point. It's important to understand how your current health status might affect your ability to perform those tasks safely. To get a better picture, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Oh dear. That’s… that’s a tough one. I… I honestly don’t recall much. I had a doctor, of course, for many years. A good man. But it was… decades ago. I think I had the usual things. Colds, flu, maybe a bad back once or twice. I was divorced, you know. That was… stressful. Does that count as medical history? I'm really drawing a blank here, Doctor. I haven't been seriously ill in… well, I can’t remember. I'm afraid I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s very common for patients to have difficulty recalling details from the past, especially if it’s been a long time. We can work around it. Let's try a different approach. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, no, I don't think so. Not that I recall. The doctor never mentioned anything like that. I… I always felt pretty healthy, all things considered. A bit tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I don’t take any medications, not regularly. Maybe an aspirin for a headache now and then. Arthritis… no, my joints don’t bother me. At least, not that I remember. I really wish I could be more helpful. It's just… a lot of years have gone by, and my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is this taking too long? Should we just skip this part?
DOCTOR: No, it's not taking too long at all, Mr. Krahn. It’s important to gather as much information as possible, and you’re doing fine. Since you don’t recall any chronic conditions or regular medications, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. Maybe a bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but everyone gets that, right? No food allergies, no reactions to medications… I can’t recall anything significant. Honestly, I mostly just eat bland food these days. Easier on the stomach. I try to avoid anything too spicy. Does that count? No, I’m pretty sure I don't have any allergies. Just… a general dislike for strong flavors. Is that it? Can we move on now? This is starting to make my head hurt.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly move on, Mr. Krahn. No known allergies – that’s good to know. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – have had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh boy. That's another tough one. My parents… they're both gone now. A long time ago. I don't really remember much about their health. My mother… I think she had high blood pressure, maybe? And my father… he worked very hard, all his life. I think he had some breathing problems towards the end. I had a sister, but we weren't very close. I don't know anything about her health either. Honestly, Doctor, my family wasn’t one for talking about these things. It was more… keeping things to ourselves. I'm really sorry, I'm not much help with this. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing even a little bit can be helpful, but it’s not a requirement. Given the limited information, we’ll proceed with a thorough physical exam. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, let me see. I live alone, in a small apartment. Mostly quiet. I don’t really go out much these days. I used to enjoy… walking. And going to the theater, of course. But it’s been a while. I don’t smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, on special occasions. I try to eat healthy, but it’s mostly just… simple meals. I don't have any pets. It's a pretty uneventful life, Doctor. Not much excitement. Is that what you wanted to know? Do you need me to list my favorite colors? I'm afraid my life isn't very interesting.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Krahn, your favorite colors aren’t necessary. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, before we begin the physical exam, is there anything specific you are concerned about or any symptoms you have been experiencing, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Lately… my knees have been a bit stiff in the mornings. And my back aches sometimes, especially after standing for too long. But that's not new. It's just… getting old, I suppose. Nothing major. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness. Just the usual aches and pains. Oh, and I’ve been a little more forgetful lately, but… well, that’s probably just my age. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a worrier. I just want to get this physical over with so I can… well, so I can see if I'm still able to do this work. Is it alright if we just get on with it? I’m starting to feel a bit tired.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. We will get started. The stiffness in the mornings and back ache are good things to note. We’ll check those out during the exam. First, I'd like to check your vital signs: your blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate. Could you please sit back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. It’s been a long time since I had a proper check-up. Is it going to hurt? I’m not good with needles.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t hurt, Mr. Krahn. The blood pressure cuff just feels a little tight around your arm for a moment. And we’ll only do bloodwork if necessary, and we can certainly discuss options if you’re concerned about needles. Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but we'll monitor that. Your heart rate is 78, which is normal. Temperature is 98.6, also normal. And your respiratory rate is 16, which is good. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is everything alright? I feel a little… exposed. It’s just that it’s been so long since anyone has… listened to me like this. I hope I’m not too out of shape. I used to walk a lot, but I haven’t been doing much lately. I mostly just sit around and read. Is that bad? I hope my lungs are still working properly. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, Mr. Krahn, and your lungs are clear. I’m not hearing any wheezing or crackles. That's good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please relax your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Is that right? Do I need to do anything? I hope I don't flinch. I'm a bit jumpy these days. It's just that it’s been so long since anyone has… touched me like this. I hope everything is alright. Is it normal to feel a little… anxious? I don’t want to be a bother. I just want to get this over with and see if I can still do this work. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, Mr. Krahn, but that can be normal with age. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your knees and back. Could you please try to touch your toes for me, if you’re comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh… ouch. That’s about as far as I can go, Doctor. My back is a bit stiff. And my knees are protesting. It’s just age, I suppose. I used to be much more flexible. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t been able to do that for years. It’s just too painful. Is this alright? I hope I’m not making a fool of myself. I just want to see if I can still do this work. Is that too much to ask? I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s good to know your limitations. I’m feeling some mild tenderness in your lower back and knees. There's no swelling. You have a normal gait. Now, I'll just do a quick neurological exam. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Is everything alright? I hope I’m not missing anything. My vision isn’t what it used to be. I need glasses, you know. But I don’t want to… I don’t want to be a bother. Is it normal to feel a little… anxious? I just want to see if I can still do this work. Is that too much to ask? I don’t want to be a burden. I hope everything is alright. Are you sure everything is alright?
DOCTOR: Your eye movements are good, Mr. Krahn. No signs of any issues there. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Overall, you appear to be in generally good health for your age. We did note some stiffness and tenderness in your lower back and knees, diminished reflexes, and slightly elevated blood pressure. I want to run some bloodwork to get a better understanding of your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Bloodwork… Oh dear. Needles. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I… I don’t do well with needles. I get very faint. But… if you think it's important, I suppose I can try. But please, be gentle. And warn me before you… before you do it. I don’t want to… I don’t want to make a scene. I just want to see if I can still do this work. Is that too much to ask? Please, be gentle. And warn me. I'm really getting anxious now.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Krahn. It is not absolutely necessary, but it will give us a more complete picture of your health and help us determine if there are any underlying issues contributing to your stiffness and elevated blood pressure. And I promise to be as gentle as possible. You can look away if you prefer. I’ll warn you before I insert the needle, and we can take a break if you start to feel faint. If the results come back normal, we can focus on managing your back and knee discomfort with physical therapy and simple exercises. Would you like me to proceed with the bloodwork?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s best. But please, be gentle. And warn me. And if I start to feel faint… please, just stop. I just want to see if I can still do this work. Is that too much to ask? This is really making me anxious. Please, just be gentle. And warn me. And stop if I feel faint. Alright… let’s just get it over with. But warn me. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. I’m going to clean your arm with an alcohol swab now. This will feel cold for a moment. And now, I’m going to insert the needle. This will feel like a small pinch. You’re doing great. Just try to relax your arm. Almost done… And there we go. Okay, all finished. Just keep pressure on this for a few minutes. You did very well, Mr. Krahn. We'll send this sample to the lab, and we should have the results back in a few days. Now, while we’re waiting for the lab results, I recommend you start some gentle stretching and range-of-motion exercises for your back and knees. I’ll give you a handout with some simple exercises. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That wasn’t as bad as I feared. But I’m still a bit shaky. Exercises… yes, please. That sounds… manageable. Anything to keep me moving. I just want to see if I can still do this work. Is that too much to ask? I just hope the results aren’t… bad. I don’t want to be a burden. And thank you… for being so gentle. And for warning me. That helped a lot. So, exercises… yes, please. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. It was my pleasure. Here's the handout with the exercises. They're very simple, and you can do them at home. Start slowly and don't push yourself too hard. We’ll call you as soon as the lab results are back, and we can discuss them and create a plan to help you stay active and healthy. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you… for everything. You’ve been very kind. And patient. And gentle. I just hope… I just hope I can still do this work. Is that too much to ask? Alright. Thank you again. I think I’ll just go home and rest now. And maybe try some of those exercises. Thank you. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I understand your hope, and we’ll do our best to help you achieve that. Remember to take it easy and listen to your body. Have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon. Goodbye, Mr. Krahn.
