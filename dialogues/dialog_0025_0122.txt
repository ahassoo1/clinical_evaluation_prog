DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, precisely. I am noticing… lapses. Little things, mostly. I forget where I put my keys, or the name of a flower. Small things, but…more frequent now. And my blood pressure, it has been… elevated, the nurse said. I want to understand if these are connected.
DOCTOR: Lapses, you say. Elevated blood pressure… Well, plenty of people misplace their keys, Ms. Alvara. It doesn’t automatically mean something serious is going on. But we'll get to the bottom of it. Let's start with these “lapses.” Can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just yesterday, I was preparing tea for a friend, Irina. I knew exactly what kind of tea she liked – chamomile, with a little honey. But when I went to get the honey, I could not remember where I keep it. I know I have it… in the kitchen, naturally. But which cupboard? Which shelf? I walked around for five minutes, quite frustrated, before I found it. It was on the top shelf, where I always put it. It is… embarrassing. And it is not just the honey.
DOCTOR: Embarrassing, perhaps, but not necessarily alarming. These things happen as we get older. Still, we need to rule things out. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradually worsening over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It started… maybe six months ago? Small things then, too. Forgetting a word when speaking. Not remembering the title of a film I saw recently. Nothing major. But it has become more noticeable lately. Perhaps… two months ago, it became truly concerning. It is… unsettling. I do not like feeling… foggy.
DOCTOR: "Foggy," you say. Alright. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me consider. My appetite has been… smaller. Not a large change, but I do not feel as much hunger. And I… sleep less soundly. I wake up several times during the night. It is not pain, necessarily. Just… awareness. I am aware I am awake. My husband… he used to say I snored, but I have not heard that lately. He passed away two years ago, you see. It has been… difficult. Perhaps that is related to the sleep.
DOCTOR: Loss is… profoundly disruptive. Grief can certainly manifest in many ways, including changes in sleep and appetite. But we can’t simply chalk everything up to that. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high cholesterol, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No diabetes. My cholesterol, the doctor told me it was slightly elevated, perhaps ten years ago, but he said it was nothing to worry about. Just watch my diet, he said. I have always been… reasonably healthy, I believe. I walk every day, when the weather permits. I eat mostly vegetables and fish. I do not smoke, and I drink only a small glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. My blood pressure, though… that has been creeping up. That is new.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never. And I have only been in the hospital once. When I had my daughter, of course. A very long time ago. It was… uncomplicated. Everything was fine. I have not needed a hospital since then, thankfully. I try to avoid doctors, when I can. It is not that I dislike them, you understand. It is just… I prefer to be independent.
DOCTOR: Independent is commendable, but sometimes we need to address things proactively. Now, family history. Are there any instances of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's in your family?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. My mother, she… she became very forgetful in her later years. But we assumed it was simply old age. She lived to be ninety-two, you see. She forgot names, faces, where she put things. It was… gradual. My aunt, on my father’s side, she was diagnosed with something… a doctor said it was “senility,” but that was many years ago. I do not know the details. My father, he… he was always very sharp, very clear-minded. He remembered everything. He was a historian, you see. It is… complicated. It seems only my mother and aunt had… issues.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None. I do not take anything. I prefer to avoid medication, if possible. A little chamomile tea for sleep, occasionally. But no pills, no creams, nothing. I believe in… natural remedies, when I can. And I try to eat a healthy diet. It is… important to me. I do not like the idea of relying on drugs. They have… side effects, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure again, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. It’s standard procedure. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. Standard procedure. I suppose it is best to be thorough. I will sit on the examination table. Please… be gentle. It has been some time since I last had a proper examination.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Alvara. Nothing to worry about. Just a routine check. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm, and try to breathe normally. Systolic 152, diastolic 90. Elevated, as the nurse noted. Now, let's listen to your heart… Heart rate is regular, but a little fast. No murmurs detected. Alright, lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can follow your finger. It is… quite easy. I used to do eye exercises with my daughter, when she was a little girl. It helped her with her reading, you see. Is this… normal? The eye exercise, I mean. Not the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that's… good. Now, I’m going to check your coordination. Can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… a little difficult. My hands feel… unsteady. Is this normal? I have not done this since… school, I think.
DOCTOR: Slight ataxia noted. Not significant, but warrants further investigation. Now, let's check your gait. Can you walk a few steps for me, heel-to-toe?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can walk heel-to-toe. It is… challenging. I have not walked like this in many years. It feels… precarious. I hope I do not fall.
DOCTOR: Slightly unsteady gait, with mild balance issues. Alright, Ms. Alvara, that’s enough for now. We need to run some tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. I also want to get an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: An MRI? Is that… necessary? It sounds… rather drastic. I have never had an MRI before. Are you… concerned? What are we looking for, exactly? What if… what if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Alvara, I understand your anxiety, but we need to be thorough. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's better to rule things out. The MRI will help us see if there are any changes in your brain that could be causing your memory problems and balance issues. It’s a standard diagnostic procedure. As for what we’re looking for… we’re checking for things like strokes, tumors, or signs of Alzheimer’s disease. But, again, it doesn’t mean you have any of those things. We just need to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’m also going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They’ll be able to interpret the MRI results and provide a more definitive diagnosis.
PATIENT: A neurologist… Very well, Doctor. If that is what is necessary. But… how long will this take? And will the results be… painful? I confess, I am… frightened. This is all… rather overwhelming. And what if… what if the results are not good?
DOCTOR: The tests will take a few days to schedule and a few more for the results. The MRI itself is painless, although you’ll be in a rather loud machine for about 30-45 minutes. It’s important to lie very still. As for the results… we’ll discuss them thoroughly when they come in. I understand you’re anxious, Ms. Alvara, but worrying won’t help. We’ll take things one step at a time. Right now, I'm going to write you a referral to Dr. Chen, a highly respected neurologist. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. I also want you to keep a daily log of your symptoms – anything you forget, any changes in your sleep, appetite, or mood. It will be helpful for the neurologist. And please, try to get some rest. I'll also give you a list of resources for coping with memory loss and anxiety. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so, Doctor. Thank you. For… everything. I… I suppose I will wait to hear from Dr. Chen. And I will try to keep a log, as you suggested. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Alvara. Get in touch with Dr. Chen’s office as soon as possible. And try not to worry. .
