DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... the flushing. My face gets very red. Happens sometimes. Not all the time, you understand. It’s a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, the flushing. I understand it can be embarrassing. And you said it happens sometimes – can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. It's hard to say exactly. Not after exercise, not when I'm hot. Sometimes when I eat… spicy food, maybe? But not always. And sometimes… just happens. I'm sitting, watching TV, and then… red. It goes away after a little while. Maybe ten, fifteen minutes. I don’t really do much when it happens. Just… wait it out.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s not consistently linked to exercise or heat, sometimes with spicy foods, and occasionally happens seemingly at random while you're resting. And it resolves within ten to fifteen minutes. Do you notice anything else happening when you flush?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes my heart feels a little fast. Not racing, just… aware of it, you know? And… maybe a little warm in my chest. Not pain, not uncomfortable, just… warm. And I think… sometimes my hands feel a bit shaky. But not always. It's all a bit mixed up, I'm afraid. I don't keep track of everything. It just happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a faster heartbeat and a warm sensation in your chest, occasionally shaky hands along with the flushing. That gives us a little more to work with. Now, has this been happening for a long time, or is it a recent thing?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been going on… a while now. Maybe a year? Hard to say exactly. It didn't bother me much at first. Just thought it was something I ate, or… being tired. But it's been happening more often lately, so I thought I should get it checked. My wife… she would have made me come sooner. She always worried about everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked now. A year of intermittent flushing with those associated symptoms… alright. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of - things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was always pretty healthy. A little high cholesterol, the doctor said, a few years back. But nothing I needed to take pills for. Just… watch what I eat. That's what she said. And nothing else. I don’t go to the doctor much. Never really needed to. Until now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a history of mildly elevated cholesterol. And no other medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But that was a long time ago! Just a cast, and then it healed. I've been very lucky, I think. Always been strong. Well, until this flushing thing, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And you mentioned your wife – is there any family history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or anything similar on either side of the family?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. He died when I was young, of a heart attack. But that was a long time ago. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. She took pills for it. On my wife’s side… I don’t really know. We didn’t talk much about her family. It's been a while since I thought about them.
DOCTOR: Okay, a father with a heart attack and a mother with high blood pressure. That's helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just… whatever's in the food, I suppose. I don't like taking pills. Always worried about side effects. My wife tried to get me to take a vitamin D supplement, but I didn't. Never got around to it. I should have, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. And finally, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, environmental things like pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Sometimes my eyes get a little itchy in the spring, but that's just the pollen, I think. Nothing serious. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Unless you count dust, maybe. But who's allergic to dust?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Withycombe, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just take a general look. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your pulse is a bit faster than normal. I also detected a slight heart murmur. While not necessarily concerning on its own, it warrants further investigation. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel – just to get a better overall picture. I also want to do an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… serious. Is something wrong? The murmur… that doesn't sound good. What does it mean? I don't want to be… sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Withycombe. It is good that we're looking into this. A murmur doesn’t automatically mean something is seriously wrong. It just means there’s extra sound when your heart beats. Many things can cause it, some harmless, some that need treatment. The EKG and blood work will help us determine the cause. Elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address, but it's manageable with lifestyle changes or medication if needed. We’ll have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding excessive caffeine and salt, and try to get regular, moderate exercise if you're able. We can discuss the results when they come back and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… better. Avoiding caffeine and salt… I can do that. I used to walk more, before… well, before my wife passed. I can try to start again. A few days… that feels like a long time, but… if it helps, I suppose. Will the tests be painful? And… how will I get the results?
DOCTOR: The tests won’t be painful at all. The blood work is just a simple prick of the finger, and the EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest to record your heart's electrical activity. It’s completely non-invasive. As for the results, the lab will send them directly to the clinic, and my nurse will call you as soon as they're available, usually within three to five business days. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Chest pain, shortness of breath… okay. And they’ll call me… that’s good. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. It’s… a relief to know what’s going on, even if it’s a little scary. I appreciate you not… rushing me. Some doctors just… tell you things without explaining.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I understand it can be unsettling when you're unsure of what's happening, and I'm happy to take the time to explain things as clearly as possible. We'll figure this out together. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… the tests, and wait for the call. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburroough. I suppose I’ll see you in a few days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: Thank you. I will.
