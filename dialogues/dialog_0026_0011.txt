DOCTOR: Good morning, Armando. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. Why don’t you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. Look, I ain’t got all day. Just need somethin’ signed, a paper or somethin’. About…well, about gettin’ somethin’ done. A little fixin’ up, you understand. Don't need a whole lot of talkin’. Just the signin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No problem at all, Armando. I can certainly take a look at any paperwork you have. Just let me pull up your file here… Hmm. And while I'm doing that, perhaps you could tell me a little about what needs signing?
PATIENT: It’s right here. Some young man gave it to me. Said it was for…cosmetic. That’s what he called it. I just want to look a little better, you know? Ain't askin' for miracles. Just…sign the paper. I don't recall why I need it, exactly. Just that it has somethin' to do with…well, with lookin’ presentable. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. This is a consent form for a vasectomy. Do you…recall discussing this procedure with anyone?
PATIENT: Vas…what now? Look, I told you, I don’t remember a lot of things. Young man, fancy office…somethin' about makin' things…permanent. Sounded good at the time, I guess. Listen, I just want the paper signed. Is that somethin’ you can do, or am I wastin’ my breath? I got things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: Armando, it’s alright. We can take our time. This is a permanent procedure, and it’s very important that you understand what it involves before we proceed with anything. Do you recall when you spoke with this "young man"?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't recall! Sometime last month, maybe? Or the month before. They all blur together. Fancy suit, slicked-back hair…somethin' about a special offer. I just figured, why not? Seemed like a sensible thing at the time. Are you gonna sign the paper or not? I ain't got time for a twenty questions game. It's a simple thing, right? Sign, and I'm on my way.
DOCTOR: Armando, I understand your frustration, but I have a responsibility to ensure you fully understand what you are consenting to. A vasectomy prevents pregnancy. Do you have any children?
PATIENT: Children? Now that's a question. Let me think…well, there was… a woman, once. A long time ago. Maybe. I don't rightly remember. It was a different life, entirely. Look, this is gettin' ridiculous. You're askin’ me about things that happened decades ago! Just sign the paper, Doctor. I assure you, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important. It’s…a matter of dignity, you understand? A man deserves to look his best. Now are we done?
DOCTOR: Armando, I want to help you, but I'm concerned about your ability to fully understand the implications of this procedure. It's possible you may benefit from a brief cognitive assessment to ensure you are making a fully informed decision. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A what assessment? Are you implying…are you saying I'm not…right in the head? Listen, Doctor, I may be older, but I'm perfectly capable of makin' my own decisions! I don't need you runnin’ tests on me like some…some laboratory specimen! This is an insult! I came here for a simple signature, and now you’re talkin' about cognitive…whatever! I think I'll just go. I'll find another doctor who respects my intelligence. You know what? Never mind. I don't want the procedure anymore! Just leave me alone.
DOCTOR: Armando, please wait. I'm only trying to help. If you're feeling upset, we can pause and I can help you find resources to assist you. Perhaps a trusted friend or family member could accompany you for another appointment?
