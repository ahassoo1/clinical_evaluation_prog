DOCTOR: Hi Christen, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it simply, I've been awfully thirsty lately, and… strangely hungry as well. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to become quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of increased thirst and hunger. That's good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about that hunger?
PATIENT: Aye, well, it’s not like… craving anything specific. Just a general emptiness, you see? Even after a good meal, it doesn't quite go away. It's… unsettling, to be frank. And I find myself thinking about food quite a bit more than usual. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Christen. That's helpful. And about the thirst – how much more water are you drinking than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, a considerable amount more, Doctor. I used to maybe have a pint or so throughout the day. Now? I'm easily going through… at least a litre, perhaps more. And even then, I still feel parched. I keep a bottle with me constantly, to be honest. It’s a bit of a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a significant increase in fluid intake – going from around a pint to a litre or more a day – and you're still feeling thirsty. And this has been going on for a few weeks. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that you mention it, I suppose I have been going to the lavatory more frequently. And… feeling a bit more tired than usual, perhaps? Though, to be fair, work's been demanding recently. It’s difficult to say if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urination and some fatigue. It’s good you mentioned the work stress, that's important context. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your vision, any unexplained weight loss, or any sores that aren’t healing quickly?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that’s a good question. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, but my trousers feel a bit looser, if I’m honest. Nothing dramatic, mind you, but noticeable. Vision’s been fine, as far as I can tell, and no… no sores, thankfully. Is this… is this something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’ve noticed the loose trousers, that's helpful information. It’s too early to say definitively if it’s serious, Christen, but those symptoms – increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue – can sometimes point to a few different things, including diabetes. To get a better understanding, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and then order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests… very well. I’d rather know one way or another, to be frank. A physical exam… yes, please. Let’s get on with it, shall we? I trust you have a private room for this?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Christen. We have a private examination room. Okay, let’s start with your vital signs. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your general condition. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we begin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies to speak of. None that I'm aware of, at least. Go right ahead. I’ll do my best to remain still. Just… try to be quick, if you wouldn't mind. I have a rather busy afternoon ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6°F. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Finally, I’ll just take a quick look at your feet. Feet appear normal, no signs of ulcers or lesions. Everything appears within normal limits on the physical exam, but the symptoms you described warrant further investigation with blood tests. We’ll check your blood glucose, A1C, and a complete metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Yes, that sounds entirely sensible. Blood glucose, A1C, and a complete metabolic panel… Very well. The sooner we have some answers, the better, in my opinion. Where do we go from here? Do I need to… fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: You are right to want answers quickly, Christen. For the most accurate results, we will need a fasting blood glucose and A1C. That means no eating or drinking anything except water for at least eight hours before the blood draw. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. The complete metabolic panel doesn't require fasting. We'll get the blood drawn in the lab just down the hall. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have those, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, continue to monitor your thirst and urination, and try not to worry too much. We’re just gathering information at this point. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Aye, tomorrow morning will do just fine. Fasting… I suppose I can manage that. No food… it’s a small price to pay for some peace of mind. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your… calming manner. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I’ll see you tomorrow, then. Is there any paperwork I need to fill out before the blood draw?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Christen. I understand it can be anxious waiting for results, and I’m glad I can help put your mind at ease, even just a little. There is a standard lab requisition form to fill out, which you can complete in the waiting room before the blood draw. The lab technician will give you instructions on how to prepare. I’ll see you tomorrow morning. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or worsening symptoms – like excessive fatigue, blurred vision, or confusion – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic or go to the emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and attention. I’ll be sure to fill out the form and see you tomorrow. Have a good evening. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Christen. You have a good evening as well. I’ll see you tomorrow morning. .
