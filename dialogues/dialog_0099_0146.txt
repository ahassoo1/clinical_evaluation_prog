DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Overgaard, it’s… my muscles, mostly. They feel really weak. It's been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me, you know? Makes things… difficult.
DOCTOR: “A little while,” you say. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… around three months, maybe a little more? It started gradually, just feeling tired after normal stuff. Now, even simple things, like carrying groceries, are a real effort. It’s… frustrating. I don’t remember exactly when it started, just that it wasn't sudden. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… vague, yes. Three months of gradual weakness. And you said "tired after normal stuff.” Could you elaborate on what "normal stuff" entails?
PATIENT: Sure. Normal stuff like… walking up the stairs, doing a bit of work around the house, even just standing for a while. Things I used to do without thinking about it. Now, I get winded easily, and my legs feel like jelly afterwards. I work as an insurance appraiser, looking at damaged cars – lots of walking around, bending, that sort of thing. It’s getting harder to do my job, honestly.
DOCTOR: Insurance appraiser, walking around… Right. And is this weakness localized—meaning, is it just in your legs, or are you experiencing it elsewhere?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my legs, yeah. But… I’ve noticed it a bit in my arms too, when I'm lifting things. Not as bad as the legs, but it's there. Like, if I hold something for too long, they start to shake a little. Not constantly, but it happens. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a painful weakness, just… a lack of strength, you know?
DOCTOR: “A lack of strength.” And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a bit more tired overall, even when I’m not doing anything physical. And… I guess I’ve lost a little bit of weight, but I haven’t been paying much attention to that. I haven’t been eating as much, to be honest, just haven’t had much of an appetite. No fever, no dizziness, nothing like that. Just… tired and weak. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Weight loss, decreased appetite… Okay. And do you have any family history of muscle weakness, neurological conditions, or similar symptoms?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My father… he had some problems with his hands when he got older, some shaking, but it wasn’t really diagnosed. Just put down to old age. And my mother… she was healthy as a horse, really. No real medical problems on either side of the family that I’m aware of. Honestly, we didn’t talk about that stuff much. I don't know if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Not particularly. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched any of that. I don't smoke, rarely drink - maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a blue moon - and definitely no drugs. I try to stay healthy, as you can see. It’s just… this weakness is really throwing me off. I eat okay, try to get some exercise when I can, but this is… worrying.
DOCTOR: “Try to get some exercise.” And what does that entail, exactly?
PATIENT: Well, before this started, I used to walk a few miles a week. Just around the neighborhood, you know? And I'd do some light gardening, that sort of thing. Now, even a short walk leaves me completely exhausted. I haven't been able to do much at all lately. It's been… frustrating, to be honest. I feel like I'm losing my independence. I’m just trying to figure out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Let’s have a look at you. If you wouldn't mind standing for a moment, please. I’ll need to assess your strength and reflexes. Just relax, and I'll guide you.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just let me know. I’m ready when you are. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a few appointments later today.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you push against my hands with your arms?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels… harder than it used to be. I'm trying, Doctor, but it doesn’t feel as strong as it should. I don't know if that's helpful. It's... tiring.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And now, can you lift your arms out to the sides?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… difficult to hold them up. They feel heavy. It's not a sharp pain, just… a lot of effort. I can do it, but it takes concentration. And… they’re starting to shake a little now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s check your legs. Can you stand up and sit down five times, without using your arms for assistance?
PATIENT: Okay… I can try. Okay… that's… three. I'm getting tired, Doctor. It's harder than it looks. My legs feel like jelly. I don’t think I can do five.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. That’s sufficient. Now, can you walk on your tiptoes for ten steps?
PATIENT: Uh… that's… difficult. I can barely do it, Doctor. I feel like I'm going to fall. It's… really unstable. I'm not sure I should continue.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Sit down. Based on this preliminary examination, your symptoms and findings are… concerning. We need to rule out several possibilities. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a creatine kinase level to assess muscle damage. We'll also need to check your vitamin D levels. And, given your weakness and tremors, I want to order an electromyography, or EMG, to evaluate your nerve and muscle function.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… thorough. An EMG… is that… painful? And how long will all of this take? I'm just worried about the cost, to be honest. I don't have insurance, and I'm not sure I can afford a lot of tests. I just want to know what's wrong, you know?
DOCTOR: The EMG can be a bit uncomfortable, yes. It involves inserting small needles into your muscles to record electrical activity. But it’s usually quick and provides valuable information. As for the cost… I understand your concerns. I'll have the billing department see what options are available. Perhaps we can arrange a payment plan. But we need to get to the bottom of this. Your symptoms could indicate a variety of issues, ranging from vitamin deficiencies to more serious neurological conditions. It's premature to speculate without the results of these tests. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood samples now, and schedule you for the EMG. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Just… a bit worried, to be honest. But okay, let's do the tests. I'd rather know what's going on. I guess I should just… wait for the results? When do you think I'll have them? And where will I go for the EMG? I need to arrange a ride, you know. I don't drive much anymore.
DOCTOR: The blood work results should be back within a few days. As for the EMG… I’ll have my nurse schedule it with the imaging center downtown. They’ll contact you directly to confirm the appointment. And frankly, Mr. McKinnon, worrying won't solve anything. We're taking the necessary steps to diagnose your condition. I’ve also included a referral to a neurologist, just in case we need a more specialized opinion. My nurse will give you the paperwork. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I’ll… wait for the call about the EMG. And… I guess I’ll see what the blood work says. Thank you again. .
