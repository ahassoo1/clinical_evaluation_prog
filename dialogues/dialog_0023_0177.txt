DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Genard. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… well, it’s a little embarrassing to talk about. But things are… leaking. Down there. Been happening a little while now. Not sure why it's happening, honestly. I don't go around poking and prodding, you know? It's just… wet.
DOCTOR: Leaking, you say. And for how long has this been occurring, Mrs. Genard?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Maybe… a month? Two? Time just kinda slips away when you get old, you know? It ain't constant, not like a leaky faucet. Just… sometimes. Especially after… well, after things happen. If you catch my drift. It's not right, is it? Men shouldn't be leaking.
DOCTOR: Right. So, intermittent leakage, particularly after…urination or exertion, you're saying. And you've noticed this for approximately one to two months. It is unusual for a male patient to experience involuntary leakage. Let's try to get a clearer picture. Can you describe the amount?
PATIENT: Amount? Oh, now you’re asking a hard question, Doctor. I ain't measuring it with a cup! It’s not a flood, okay? Just… a little dampness. Enough to bother me, enough to make me change my shorts sometimes. More than just a few drops, less than… well, less than when you pee, if you understand. I don't know how much is too much, honestly. It just shouldn't be happening at all, should it?
DOCTOR: Of course, it shouldn't. "A little dampness," you say, enough to require a change of clothing. And only after urination?
PATIENT: No, not only after. Sometimes just… when I walk a lot. You know, getting to the market and back? Or after I… well, after I get excited. It ain't like it used to be, but still! It happens then too. It’s just… bothersome, is all. I never had this problem before. It’s… undignified. And I don’t want the wife next door thinking I'm… well, you know. She already thinks I’m a bit… slow.
DOCTOR: So, leakage occurs after urination, with exertion – walking – and after… sexual activity. It's good you've clarified those triggers. Now, Mrs. Genard, have you experienced any burning or pain with urination?
PATIENT: Burning? No, not really. A little… discomfort sometimes, when I gotta go really bad. But not like a fire, no. More like… an ache. And down there feels… well, just old, you know? Everything’s a little saggy these days. Maybe that’s it? Things just aren’t holding up like they used to. Everything leaks eventually, doesn't it? Even good pipes. But this is… embarrassing. Is this something serious, Doctor? Don’t tell me I gotta get poked and prodded!
DOCTOR: "Discomfort" with urgency, and a general sensation of… diminished support. We need to rule out a few possibilities before we conclude it's simply age-related. It could be something more serious. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about everything, aren’t you? Well, I go when I gotta go, same as always. Not much different. A little hard sometimes, gotta drink more water, the kids always tell me. But no blood, no… accidents. Nothing like that. Just… old man stuff, you know? Everything takes a little longer, a little more effort. Is this… is this about my prostate? I heard those things get big and cause trouble. Is that what this is? Don’t tell me I gotta get one of those… finger things up there!
DOCTOR: You're anticipating a digital rectal exam, then?
PATIENT: Well, I heard about ‘em! My cousin, he had trouble with his… with his plumbing, and they had to… well, poke around. I'm just asking! I don’t want that! Is that what you’re going to do? 'Cause if so, I might as well go home now. I'm too old for that kind of nonsense. Just tell me what's wrong, and give me something to stop the leaking. That's all I want. Simple. Is it something I caught? Is it… contagious? I don't want to give it to nobody.
DOCTOR: It is highly unlikely this is contagious. While a digital rectal exam is often necessary to assess the prostate, we can discuss other options first. Before we proceed further, let's clarify your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Old man stuff, you know? The doctor, back on Guam, he always said my sugar was a little high. Said I needed to watch the sweets, but… well, I like my mangoes. And my blood pressure? They gave me some pills for that once, but I stopped taking ‘em. Made me feel dizzy. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains. Everything hurts when you get old, you know? I ain't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Honestly, I just want this leaking to stop. It’s embarrassing, and it makes my shorts uncomfortable. Is there a pill for that, Doctor? A simple pill?
DOCTOR: So, a history of borderline high blood sugar and previous treatment for hypertension, discontinued due to dizziness. And you're primarily concerned with stopping the urinary leakage. It's… complicated, Mrs. Genard. Now, do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. I take a little something for my knees, it's supposed to help with the arthritis. Can’t remember the name of it right now. And a little vitamin D, the wife's daughter told me I was low. Besides that... nothing much. Just some tea, sometimes. Ginger tea, for my stomach. Honestly, I’m not a big pill taker. I prefer things natural, you know? I like my mangoes and my ginger tea. Is that what's causing this leaking, Doctor? Too many mangoes? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: It is… unlikely that mangoes are the primary cause. Now, Mrs. Genard, I need to perform a brief physical examination to better assess the situation. This will include checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and… a basic assessment of the pelvic region. We will discuss the possibility of a more comprehensive examination afterward. Are you agreeable to this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A brief examination, you say? Just checking? No poking and prodding? Just… listening? I suppose. But no funny business, you hear? I'm an old man, and I ain't used to strangers touching me. Just be quick about it, and don’t tell me I gotta get one of those… finger things up there. I'm still thinking about that. And please, don't tell me my mangoes are the problem. They're very good mangoes. Fine, go ahead, but be gentle, alright? I'm fragile.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the table. I will begin with your blood pressure. 150 over 90. As expected. Breathing is slightly labored, but within acceptable limits for age. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Now, I need to examine your external genitalia briefly to assess for any obvious abnormalities. Please lower your trousers. I will be as quick and discreet as possible.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking a lot. Lower my… my trousers? In front of a stranger? I don’t like this one bit. Is this absolutely necessary, Doctor? Can’t you just give me a pill? A strong pill? I don’t want you… looking at everything. It’s embarrassing, and it’s… well, it’s private. I’m an old man, and I’ve got my dignity, you know? Fine, but keep it quick. And no staring! This is… humiliating. I'm doing this for the leaking, remember? Just find the problem and give me a pill. Quickly, now.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will be as efficient as possible. The examination is complete. I observe some mild skin irritation, likely due to frequent moisture. However, this does not explain the urinary leakage. To determine the underlying cause, we will need to conduct further testing. This will include a urinalysis to check for infection, and a prostate-specific antigen blood test. And yes, unfortunately, a digital rectal examination will be necessary to assess the size and texture of the prostate. I understand your discomfort, but it is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment. We can discuss options to make it as comfortable as possible. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A digital rectal examination? You mean… the finger thing? I knew it! I just knew it! This is ridiculous! I’m too old for this nonsense! I come in here with a little leaking, and you want to… poke around? This is humiliating! No, I don’t want to hear any more about it! No tests! No poking! No prodding! Just give me something to stop the leaking! Can’t you just… I don’t know… prescribe something strong? I’m a simple man, Doctor, and I don’t want any trouble. I’m going home now. This is… undignified. I’m too old for this! Just forget it!
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I understand your discomfort, but refusing necessary testing will only delay proper diagnosis and treatment. Without knowing the underlying cause, I cannot safely prescribe medication. The leakage may be a sign of a more serious condition, such as an enlarged prostate, infection, or even… something more concerning. However, I respect your decision. I will document your refusal of testing. I strongly advise you to reconsider, but ultimately, the choice is yours. I can provide you with a list of local urologists who may be able to address your concerns. I will write a prescription for some absorbent pads to manage the leakage in the meantime. They will not resolve the underlying issue, but may provide some temporary relief. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
