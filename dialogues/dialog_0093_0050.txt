DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this cough. Been… a long time now, I think. A dry cough. Not much… not much to it, really. Just… bothersome. I don’t rightly remember when it started, to be honest. Things… slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovic. It's perfectly normal for memory to change as we get older. We’ll take our time. A long-lasting cough, even a dry one, is worth investigating. Could you describe the cough a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it… Well, it’s not a hacking cough, you know? Not like when you have the… the flu. It’s more of a… tickle, I guess. A tickle in my throat that makes me want to… clear it. And it happens… mostly when I’m… resting. Or maybe when it’s dry out. It’s hard to say. I used to work on cars all day, Doctor. Lots of dust and fumes. Could be something from that, maybe? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Pavlovic. A tickle that's worse with rest or dryness… and your history of automotive work is certainly relevant. We'll keep all of that in mind. Now, besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I get a little… short of breath sometimes. Not all the time. Just… when I walk up the stairs, maybe. Or if I’m doing something… strenuous. And… I get tired easier than I used to. Everything feels like a bit more effort, you know? But… I’m ninety years old, Doctor. I figure some of that just comes with the territory. Is that… is that normal?
DOCTOR: That's a fair point, Mr. Pavlovic, and it's good you're acknowledging the changes that can come with age. However, shortness of breath and increased fatigue, even if gradual, are worth investigating, regardless of age. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear… that’s… difficult. I saw doctors when I needed to, of course. But I don’t… I don’t remember much about what they told me. I had… something with my heart, maybe, a long time ago. They gave me pills, I think. And… I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder. But that was a long time ago. My wife, she used to keep track of all that. She’s… gone now, though. Everything feels so… fuzzy. Do you… do you have a way to look that up? Maybe at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Pavlovic, we do. Let me quickly check our electronic health record to see what information we have on file for you. It may take just a moment. Alright, it appears we have some notes from a visit about ten years ago. It indicates you were treated for mild hypertension, and managed with a low dose medication, which you were discontinued from. There's also a record of the wrist fracture you mentioned. Other than that, the record is quite sparse. That’s not uncommon, unfortunately. Now, about your family history—do you know if any of your close relatives have had any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, lung problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm… my mother… she lived a long life. But she had… something with her legs, I think. Swelling. My father… he worked hard all his life. Farmer. He died… fairly young, I think. Heart trouble, maybe. It was a long time ago. My wife's family… they were mostly healthy, as far as I know. Nothing… nothing that sticks in my mind, really. I'm sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. I just… don’t remember things like that. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovic. You’ve given me what you can, and that’s very helpful. It sounds like there may have been some family history of heart issues, but the details are understandably hazy. Now, let’s talk about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, no. Never smoked. My wife… she didn’t like it. And… it just didn't appeal to me. I worked around fumes enough with the cars, you know? Didn’t need to add more to my lungs. I used to drink a little… beer, maybe, with dinner. But I haven’t had much lately. Not much of an appetite these days. Mostly just… soup. And… tea. Does that… does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Pavlovic. No smoking is excellent. A little alcohol and a reduced appetite are noted. Finally, let me ask about allergies—are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with… pollen, or anything like that. My wife always said I had a strong constitution. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine, as far as I recall. Sometimes I get a little… itchy after I eat shrimp, maybe? But it’s not a bad itch. Just… a little uncomfortable. I mostly just avoid shrimp these days. It’s easier that way. Is that… is that considered an allergy? I’m not sure what counts these days. Everything feels so… different.
DOCTOR: A mild reaction to shrimp is possible, and we can make a note of that. Now, Mr. Pavlovic, with your permission, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. This will help me get a better sense of what might be causing your cough and shortness of breath. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Go ahead. I trust your judgement. I’m getting too old to question things much, anyway. Just… be gentle, alright? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pavlovic. I will be very gentle. Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Your heart sounds regular, though a little slow. I did hear some slight wheezing in your lungs, and your blood pressure is a little elevated. Your abdomen feels tender in a couple of spots, but nothing too concerning. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any infections. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work… Yes, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgement. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just… tell me what it means, alright? I don’t want to be left wondering what’s going on. I'm not very good with… medical talk. Just… simple explanations, if you wouldn’t mind. And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to keep coming back here if I don’t have to. It’s a bit of a drive, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pavlovic. I completely understand. I will explain everything in simple terms, and we’ll take our time. The chest X-ray will help us see if there’s any inflammation, fluid, or other abnormalities in your lungs that could be causing the wheezing and cough. The blood work will give us a broader picture of your overall health, check for any signs of infection, and assess your kidney and liver function. The lab usually takes a couple of days to process the results, and I’ll have them back by Wednesday. I’ll call you as soon as I’ve reviewed them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Wednesday… that’s… good. A few days isn't too long. Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly acceptable. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man like me. Things… things get forgotten, you know? It's a relief to have someone… looking into it. Is there anything… anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any home remedies you’d recommend? I used to drink a lot of tea with honey when I had a cold, but… it doesn’t seem to be helping much now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. I'm happy to help. It’s perfectly normal for memory to decline with age, and I assure you, your concerns are valid. In the meantime, continue to drink plenty of fluids – water is best, but tea with honey is fine as well. Rest as much as possible, and try to avoid any strenuous activities that might worsen your shortness of breath. If your cough gets significantly worse, or you develop a fever, please call my office immediately. I’m also going to write you a referral to a pulmonologist – a lung specialist – just to get another opinion. It’s always good to have a specialist weigh in, especially given your persistent cough and wheezing. Would you like me to help you schedule that appointment, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: A lung specialist… Yes, that sounds… wise. Another opinion never hurts, I suppose. If you could help me schedule it, that would be… wonderful. I’m not very good with phones these days. Everything feels so… complicated. And… thank you, Doctor. Really. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. It’s… it’s been a long time since someone took the time to listen. Just… simple explanations, alright? I don’t want to be overwhelmed with medical talk.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m glad I could ease your mind, and I absolutely promise to keep the explanations simple. That's my priority. Alright, there's a highly-regarded pulmonologist, Dr. Anya Sharma, located about thirty minutes from here. She’s affiliated with the regional hospital and accepts Medicare. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you with her?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… thirty minutes… Yes, that sounds… reasonable. If she’s well-regarded, that’s good enough for me. Go ahead and schedule an appointment, Doctor. Whatever time works best for her. I’m… fairly flexible. Just… let me know when and where. And… thank you again. Really. You’ve been… very kind. I don’t know what I’d do without doctors like you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pavlovic. I'm happy to help. Alright, here you are. You have an appointment with Dr. Sharma next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. The address is 123 Main Street, and the phone number is 555-123-4567. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
