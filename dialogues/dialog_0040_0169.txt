DOCTOR: Right, Derick Miner… 59, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Fifty-nine. Though I don't rightly feel it most days. Except for… well, you know. This puffiness. It's just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Puffiness. Okay. And where exactly are we seeing this puffiness, Mr. Miner?
PATIENT: Everywhere, really. My face, mostly. Makes me look like a… a bloated fish, I suppose. And my legs. Can barely get my boots on these days. It wasn't like this a few weeks ago, I tell ya. Just came on suddenly. Though, to be honest, I don’t remember exactly when. Old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Right. “Suddenly.” And you said… legs as well. Any pain with this puffiness?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, no. Just… heavy. Like I'm walkin' through mud. And achy, sometimes, if I’ve been on my feet too long. But I’ve always been on my feet, so it's hard to say what's new and what's just… me. You know? I do a lot of welding, it's not a job for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: Welding. Right. And have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Urine? Now hold on a minute. You want me to… talk about my pee? I mean, it looks like pee, I suppose. Yellowish. What kind of question is that? Never had any trouble with that before, if that's what you're askin'. It's a private matter, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard question, Mr. Miner. We need to rule things out. Has the amount changed?
PATIENT: Amount… hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe a little less, come to think of it. Not a huge amount, but… yeah. Less trips to the bathroom, I guess. Though, I've been drinkin' less water too, with it bein' so hot. Could be that. It's hard to keep track of these things, really.
DOCTOR: Any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not really. I get a little winded after climbin' the stairs, but that's always been the case. I ain't exactly a young man anymore, you know. I do a lot of heavy lifting at work, so I get a little out of breath then, too. Is this puffiness somethin' serious? It's worryin' my daughter, and I don't want to cause her trouble.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Miner, given your age, the sudden onset, and the decreased urination… it could be a number of things. We need to do some blood work. Rule out kidney issues, check your electrolytes… the usual. Let's get that ordered, and we’ll see what comes up.
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Well, if you think it's necessary. I don't like needles, never have. But if it'll put my daughter's mind at ease… alright. Just… don't take too much, alright? And what's this gonna cost me? I ain't got insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: The lab will give you a price list. It won't be… exorbitant. We’ll focus on the essentials for now. And frankly, Mr. Miner, delaying this won’t help matters. Let's get the tests done. Nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Don’t get your knickers in a twist. I’ll get it done. Just… tell her to be gentle, would ya? And… what if it is somethin’ serious? What then?
DOCTOR: We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, Mr. Miner. We'll have the results back in a few days. The nurse will be with you shortly. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't suppose so. Just… the blood work. And try to be quick about it. I got things to do, you know. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you presently. .
