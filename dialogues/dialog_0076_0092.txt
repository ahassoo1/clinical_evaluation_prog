DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds, good to see you… or, well, to meet you. I’m Dr. Ruocco. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Huh. Ruocco, you say? Never heard of ya. But, well… I been… short of breath. Feels like I gotta… work to get air. And my mouth… always dry. Like the desert, ya know? And my eyes too. Itchy and… not wet. It's been… a while now. Can't rightly say how long. Time just… goes.
DOCTOR: Right. “Short of breath,” dry mouth, itchy eyes… and you can’t pinpoint when this started. Honestly, at your age, things are… expected. Still, we need to get some details. When you say “short of breath,” is it when you’re doing something, like walking?
PATIENT: Walking? Hmph. Everything, mostly. Even just… sitting. Though, maybe not as bad when I'm just… being still. But even then, it feels like… somethin's tight. Like a band around my chest, kinda. Not pain, exactly. Just… there. And it's been… gettin' worse, I think. Though, like I said, time... it all blurs together. I don't pay it much mind, ya know?
DOCTOR: “Tightness,” okay. And it’s progressively worsening. Do you have any… chest pain at all?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Nah. Not really. Like I said, tight. Not hurtin’, just… uncomfortable. Like… a too-small shirt, maybe? I dunno. I ain't one for complainin', ya see? Always been tough. But this breathin'… it's gettin' old. Makes a fella feel… weak.
DOCTOR: Weakness. Alright. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me see… …Well, now that you mention it… maybe a little. Not much. But they do feel… kinda heavy sometimes. Like I been walkin' through mud. But I figured that was just… bein' old.
DOCTOR: Heavy feeling, slight swelling… typical. Any cough?
PATIENT: Cough? Sometimes. Not a bad one, though. Just… a little tickle. Mostly in the mornin'. Never been a smoker, ya know? Never touched the stuff. Bad habit. Always thought so. This cough… it ain't like a smoker's cough, if that makes sense. Just… a little somethin'.
DOCTOR: Right, no smoking history. Good. Okay, let’s do a quick listen to your lungs and heart. Then we’ll see. If you could just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Hmph. Listen to my lungs, eh? Never had much luck with doctors, ya know. Always pokin' and proddin'. But alright. Just… try not to poke too hard, alright? Old bones, ya see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your breathing is a little… wheezy. And there’s some… fluid in your lungs. Not severe, but it’s there. Heart sounds are… a little muffled. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. Never been one for pills and potions. Always figured… a little toughin' it out was better. But… wait a minute. …Doc gave me somethin' once, years ago. For… somethin' in my skin. Made me itch worse. That was… awful. Don't remember what it was called, though. Old doc, retired now.
DOCTOR: Itching… alright. And you don’t recall the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a lick. Small pill, white I think. Maybe. Time… it's a blur, ya see? I just remember bein' miserable. Itchy everywhere. Had to stop takin' it right away. Doc didn't seem too happy about it, but… I couldn't stand it. It was… torture.
DOCTOR: Right. Alright. Well, based on what you’re telling me, and what I’m hearing… it sounds like you’re likely dealing with some Congestive Heart Failure, complicated by a possible mild allergic reaction in the past. We’ll need to get some blood work done and possibly an EKG to confirm. But, for now, I’m going to prescribe you a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid.
PATIENT: Di-what-now? Look, doc, I don’t much like fancy words. You gonna give me a pill, or what? And what’s this… heart failure business? I feel… tired, sure. And short of breath. But I ain’t dyin', am I? Don't go tellin' me I'm dyin'. I ain't ready for that.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Guilds, “heart failure” doesn’t mean you’re dying. It means your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should. The diuretic… it’s a water pill. It’ll help your body get rid of extra fluid, which should make it easier to breathe. It’s a common condition, especially at your age. We'll manage it with medication. Don't make a fuss. Here. Take this to the pharmacy. It’s called Furosemide. Take it every morning. And schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks. Now, do you have any questions, or can we get on with it?
PATIENT: Furo-somethin'... Hmph. Sounds complicated. Two weeks, eh? Alright. But listen here, doc. If I start feelin' worse, I'm comin' back right away. Don't want no fancy words, just… fix me. And don't expect me to remember all this. My memory ain’t what it used to be, ya know? Alright, alright… I guess I'll go get this… furo-somethin' then.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Get the medication. And try to remember the dosage. If you have any problems, call the office. Next! .
PATIENT: Hmph. Rude. Fancy words… rude doc… furo-somethin’… .
