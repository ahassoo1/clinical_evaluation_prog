DOCTOR: Hi Tammie, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh. Hello, Doctor. It’s… my throat. It hurts. Really hurts when I… swallow, I think. I don’t… well, I just want to get this over with, if you don’t mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you want to be quick. We’ll do our best. So, your throat hurts, especially when you swallow. How long has it been hurting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it just… goes. A few days, maybe? I really can't recall exactly. It just started hurting, and then it was hurting. Is that helpful? It feels like a long time, but... I suppose it could be shorter. I don’t keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, it’s common to lose track. A few days is fine. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly constant. Dull ache, mostly. But when I try to eat… oof. Then it's a sharp pain. Like… swallowing glass. Not actual glass, of course. Just… feels like it. Really unpleasant. I've been mostly drinking water, because of it. Which isn't ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant dull ache with sharp pain when swallowing. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me think. No fever, I don’t think. I haven't bothered to check. And no… cough. Just the throat. And a bit tired, maybe? But I’m always tired. It could be… anything, really. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know what I need to do to fix it. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever or cough, just throat pain and some fatigue. Let's take a look. Could you open your mouth and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Is that sufficient? I really dislike having things poked around in my mouth, if you don’t mind me saying so. It feels… invasive.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your throat is a little red, and I see some slight swelling of your tonsils, but nothing that jumps out as obviously concerning. No white patches or pus that I can see. Now, let's feel your neck. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That’s… a bit sore. On this side. Just a little. It's not a sharp pain, but… it’s uncomfortable. Are you sure you need to do this? It feels… like you're rummaging around. Honestly, I don't understand what you're looking for.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness on the side of your neck. That suggests your lymph nodes are a bit inflamed, likely due to infection. It's good we checked. It sounds like you likely have a mild case of pharyngitis – a sore throat, often caused by a virus, but sometimes by bacteria. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. I… I don’t really know. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. Not since… never mind. I don't take any medicine, so I can’t have an allergy to anything, can I? I just try to tough things out. But if you need to know, I don't recall ever having a reaction to anything. Though… my late husband did have a bad reaction to penicillin, once. But that was him, not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and your husband had a penicillin allergy – good to know. Since you haven’t been to a doctor recently, and to rule out strep throat, I’d like to do a quick swab of your throat. It’s a little uncomfortable, but it takes just a few seconds. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A swab? You mean… in my throat? Honestly, Doctor, must we? I really do dislike things poking around in there. I suppose if you insist. But be quick about it, please. I have important things to attend to. And please, don’t make me gag. It’s terribly unpleasant. Really. Is it absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: It's a good precaution, Tammie, and it will help us determine the best course of treatment. It’s quick, I promise. Okay, all done. Now we just need to wait a few minutes for the results. In the meantime, have you had any difficulty breathing or swallowing anything other than when you're actively eating?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. That was unpleasant. It tickled. Breathing… no. No trouble breathing. Swallowing… just when I eat, like I said. Water is fine, mostly. Just… food. Solid food is difficult. And a little painful. Is there anything else you need to know? Perhaps we can just skip the waiting and tell me what I need to do. I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, the strep test is negative, which is good. That means your sore throat is most likely viral. Unfortunately, there's no quick fix for a viral infection – it just needs time to run its course. Here's what I recommend: rest as much as possible, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain. Lozenges and gargling with warm salt water can also provide some relief. Are you able to tolerate those medications?
PATIENT: Oh. So… nothing I can do? Just… wait? That’s… rather unsatisfactory, isn’t it? Ibuprofen… I think so. Yes, I’ve taken that before, for… headaches, I believe. And acetaminophen… perhaps? I really don’t recall. I don’t take much medication. Will those interfere with anything? I don't take any regular prescriptions, if that matters. Honestly, I just want to feel better. This is terribly inconvenient. Is there anything else, Doctor? A stronger pain reliever, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m not seeing any medications listed in your record. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen should be fine, just follow the dosage instructions on the bottle and don’t exceed the recommended daily limit. Since it’s likely viral, antibiotics won’t help. I’m printing out a care sheet with more detailed information on managing your symptoms. If your symptoms worsen – such as difficulty breathing, high fever, or severe pain – or don't improve within a week, please come back or see another doctor immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. A week? That seems… a long time. And “severe pain”? What constitutes “severe”? Honestly, Doctor, this is all very vague. I suppose… no, I don't think so. I just want to go home and try to get some rest. Hopefully, this will pass quickly. Thank you… I think. Is there a cost for this visit? I wasn't informed of any fees beforehand. Honestly, I'm not insured. So… how much do I owe? .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. Since you don’t have insurance, we can offer a reduced rate of $75 for the visit. It covers the consultation and the strep test. Here's my card with the payment details. If this is a hardship, we can discuss a payment plan. And “severe pain” would be anything that’s not relieved by over-the-counter medications, or if you’re having difficulty breathing or swallowing fluids. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest, Tammie, and I hope you feel better soon.
