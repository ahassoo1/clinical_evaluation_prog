DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNABB. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pitmon. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to put it plainly, I’m hoping for a bit of a… restart. I feel like I’m just not quite myself lately, and I’d like to get things back on track, if you understand. A little jumpstart to feeling better, you know? I’m 87 years young, and while I’m generally quite healthy for my age, I just want to make sure I stay that way.
DOCTOR: A "restart," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s hard to explain… not sick, not really. Just… tired, a bit slower, perhaps. And I don’t have the energy for my garden like I used to. It’s a little thing, but my garden is very important to me. I used to spend hours out there, but now… well, it's just not the same. I suppose it’s a bit of everything, really. Just wanting to feel more… vibrant again.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “vibrant” is… a subjective term. Let's try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, you are absolutely right, Doctor. Subjective indeed! Let me think… hmm. I suppose… I sleep alright, though I wake up a couple of times during the night. My appetite isn’t what it used to be; I don’t crave much these days. And I get… well, just a little bit breathless when I walk up the stairs. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. And sometimes my hands feel a bit… shaky. Is that making more sense?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, disturbed sleep, decreased appetite, some shortness of breath with exertion, and hand tremors. And this has been… how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It hasn’t been sudden, you see. It's crept up on me over… well, probably the last six months or so. Maybe a little longer. I noticed the tiredness first, I think. Then the appetite started to dwindle. The breathlessness and the shaking hands… those are more recent, perhaps within the last couple of months. It’s all very gradual, really. Not a sudden change. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Gradual onset… Alright. Let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me think… Well, years ago – probably when I was in my early sixties – I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure. They put me on medication for that, but I haven’t taken it in quite a while. My doctor at the time said it was well-controlled with diet and exercise, and it was, for many years. Apart from that… just the usual aches and pains that come with age, I suppose. Nothing serious, nothing that required much attention. I’ve been very lucky, truly. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension, managed previously. Anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! I had a gallbladder removed, goodness, must be thirty years ago now. And… I’ve had the flu a few times, of course, and a bad cold here and there. Nothing major. Oh, and I broke my wrist when I was a young woman – a silly fall while dancing! But that healed up completely. I try to remember everything, but my memory isn't what it used to be, you understand. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Gallbladder removal, decades ago. Now, any family history of… significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family history… That’s a bit tricky. My mother lived to be 92, but she didn’t talk much about her health. She was a very private woman. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, from a heart condition, I believe. And my brother… he had some trouble with his sugar levels later in life – diabetes, I think it was. But other than that, I’m not really sure. My family wasn’t one for discussing these things, you see. It was considered rather… unseemly, perhaps. I apologize; I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Right. And, if you don’t mind me asking, what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. I live alone, in the same house my husband and I built. I keep very active, as much as I can. I enjoy gardening, as I mentioned, and I used to walk every day, but I haven't been doing that as much lately. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, but my appetite… well, you know. I enjoy reading and spending time with my grandchildren when they visit. A fairly quiet life, really. Is there anything specific you'd like to know?
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I take a multivitamin every day, just to keep things topped up. And occasionally, if my arthritis is acting up, I take some ibuprofen. Nothing regularly, mind you. Just when I need it. Apart from that… no, nothing else. I don't like taking a lot of pills, if I can help it. I prefer natural remedies, you see, when possible. Do you think that's alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, certainly. Be careful, though. My knees aren't what they used to be. There we go. Is there anything specific you’re looking at? I hope I’m not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Heart sounds are… a bit faint, but regular. Lungs are clear. Thyroid feels normal. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are… diminished. And finally, I'll just take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Alright. Please sit down.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Everything alright, Doctor? Those reflexes... diminished? Is that a bad thing? I do feel a bit shaky sometimes, as I mentioned. I hope it's not anything serious. I’m a bit anxious when I don’t know what's going on, you see. Is my blood pressure alright? You said 130 over 80... Is that good? I used to keep such a close eye on it, but lately… well, things have slipped a bit.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but nothing alarming at this point. The diminished reflexes and some of your other symptoms… suggest a possible vitamin deficiency, or perhaps… something more going on. I'd like to order some blood tests, just to get a clearer picture. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function, vitamin B12 levels, and a complete blood count. We also need to rule out any underlying infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests. Yes, yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Anything to get to the bottom of it. I do trust your judgement. Vitamin deficiency… that would explain the shakiness, perhaps? And the tiredness? I suppose anything is possible. Thyroid… I’ve heard that can cause all sorts of trouble. Yes, please, go ahead with the tests. Where will I be going for them? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m a bit worried about all this, you see, but I know it’s best to be thorough. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the lab draw the blood today. It will take approximately one week to get the results back. In the meantime, I wouldn’t make any drastic changes to your diet or activity level. Continue taking your multivitamin as usual. Try to stay hydrated and get as much rest as possible. If your symptoms worsen—specifically, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or confusion—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, very well. One week for the results. Continue with the multivitamin, stay hydrated, get rest, and watch out for chest pain, shortness of breath, or confusion. I think I can manage that. It’s just… waiting is always the hardest part, you know? But I understand the importance of being thorough. And I trust you, Doctor Pitmon. Where exactly do I go for the blood tests? Is it here in the building? I do hope it won’t be too much trouble. My knees aren't the best. And is there anything I need to bring with me? Insurance card, perhaps?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. You'll need to bring your insurance card and a photo ID. They may also ask you for a list of any medications you are taking, but I don’t believe you’re on anything regular. The staff there will be able to assist you. And don’t worry about the walking; take your time. We'll discuss the results next week, once they are available. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, one more thing. Will I need to fast before the blood tests? I do enjoy a nice breakfast… and I don't want to do anything that would skew the results. And is there anything I should be thinking about while I’m waiting? Anything I can do to… prepare myself for what might be going on? I just want to be as prepared as possible, you see. It’s just… it’s been a while since I’ve had any serious health concerns, and I’m a bit anxious. Thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks—except water—after midnight tonight. As for what to think about… try not to worry too much. It’s likely something simple, and we’ll figure it out. But keep an eye on your symptoms, and if anything changes significantly, let us know immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Fast for eight hours, keep an eye on my symptoms… Yes, that’s perfect. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You’ve put my mind at ease, or at least a little bit more at ease. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I’ll see you next week then. Hopefully, I won't have to wait too long for the results. Thank you again, Doctor Pitmon. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Alright. You're welcome. Have a good week, Ms. McNABB. .
