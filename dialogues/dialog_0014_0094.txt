DOCTOR: Right. Airam Fontanazza, 33 years old… Hmm. Well, good morning. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… the paper said something about learning? I don't really know. My husband told me to come. He said it's important. I work with metal all day, so... not much time for… learning.
DOCTOR: Learning?
PATIENT: Yes. The paper… it had words. About… health stuff? I think? He said the company wants us to know more… about not getting sick, maybe? It's a lot of talk, if you ask me. I feel fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. So this isn’t… an illness you’re currently experiencing, it’s a company-mandated… health information session they’re calling a check-up?
PATIENT: Check-up… maybe? Look, I bend metal. Big sheets of metal. It's hard work. I don't need someone telling me how to… be careful. I am careful. I haven’t had any big problems, you know? Just… aches. Everyone gets aches.
DOCTOR: Your husband mentioned metal work... and your weight is listed as 136 pounds, height 151 centimeters. Are these aches new, or have they been ongoing?
PATIENT: Ongoing. For… years, maybe? It's just part of the job. Lifting, bending, cutting… it makes you sore. I take some pills sometimes, the red ones. My mother always said red pills are good for everything. I don’t remember the name, though. It's… complicated.
DOCTOR: Red pills... and you don't recall the name?
PATIENT: No. I just… take them when it hurts. My husband gets them for me. He knows what I need. I don’t really pay attention to names. It's a small bottle, plastic. And they’re definitely red. Is that… bad? Should I be remembering the name? He's always telling me I forget things.
DOCTOR: Well, it's always helpful to know what medications you’re taking, for safety reasons. Do you know the dosage?
PATIENT: Dosage? Like… how many? Um… one or two? Sometimes three when it’s really bad. I don't really measure them. I just… take enough until it feels better. Is that wrong? I don’t mean to be difficult. I just don't understand all this… paperwork.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. It's… not ideal to take medication without knowing the dosage. We need to figure out what those red pills are. Now, you mentioned bending metal. Where exactly are you experiencing these aches?
PATIENT: Mostly my back. Lower back, mostly. And my hands sometimes. They get… stiff. Especially when it's cold. Like they’re not my own. And my shoulders. Everything feels… tight. It’s hard to explain. It's just… old work pain. You know? Like an old house, everything creaks.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lower back, hands and shoulders. And the stiffness is worse in the cold. We should probably do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t expect anything fancy. I’m not very good at… standing still. There. Happy? It's probably just tired muscles. Long day yesterday. Big job.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just relax. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ow! No. No, I can’t. It hurts too much. See? This is what I mean. It’s just… bad. I shouldn't be doing this. I need to get back to work. I have things to do. Really, this isn’t helping.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to force anything. I can see you’re in discomfort. Your range of motion is limited, and you seem to be guarding your lower back. I'm going to listen to your breathing, and then we can talk about some options. It sounds like you have some chronic musculoskeletal pain, and we need to figure out the best way to manage it. But first, let's try to identify those red pills. Do you have the bottle with you?
PATIENT: No. I left it at home. My husband has it. He keeps it in the kitchen, I think. Near the… tea bags? He likes tea. I don’t know why he keeps it with the tea, it makes no sense. I can try to remember the name later, maybe? When I’m not… bending metal? It's hard to think when your back hurts. Really hard.
DOCTOR: Okay. Without knowing what you're taking, it's difficult to assess the situation properly. We really need to know the name and dosage. And because you’re experiencing chronic pain, and given your work… I’m going to recommend a referral to a physical therapist. They can help you with strengthening exercises and pain management techniques. Also, it would be very helpful if your husband could bring the medication bottle to your next appointment. We need to rule out any potential interactions or side effects. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Physical… what? Sounds like more work. I already work too much. But… if my husband thinks it's a good idea. He's usually right about these things. And if it gets me away from bending metal for a little while… Maybe. But I'm not promising anything. I have deadlines, you know? This job… it's important. Does it cost a lot of money? I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concerns. There may be some financial assistance programs available, and I can have my office staff look into that for you. We’ll get you a referral and information on costs. I’m also going to write you a note for work, explaining that you’re experiencing musculoskeletal pain and are being evaluated for physical therapy. This will allow you to take some time to rest and recover. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Rest… that sounds nice. But I still need to get the job done. My boss… he’s not very understanding. Okay. Fine. A note and… someone to help me move less? But if it doesn't work, I'm blaming you. I just want to get back to work. That's all. And I really need to remember the name of those pills. My husband will be mad if I don't. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the referral for physical therapy, and the note for your employer. The office staff will help you schedule an appointment and look into financial assistance options. Please try to bring the medication bottle to your next visit. And most importantly, listen to your body. If your pain worsens, seek medical attention immediately. I’m happy to see you get back to work, but your health is the priority. .
