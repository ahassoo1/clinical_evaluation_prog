DOCTOR: Good morning, Venna. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Beinborn. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Beinborn, you say? Pretty name. Well, I’m here 'cause my blood pressure’s been actin’ up. The nurse took it a minute ago, and she said it was high. That's what my regular doctor told me to check on, seein' as how it's been botherin’ me lately. Don't rightly know what all it means, but I figured I best get it looked at.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. High blood pressure is certainly something we want to address. It’s good you’re keeping track of it. And yes, Beinborn is what most people call me. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you started noticing this problem?
PATIENT: Hmm...when did I start noticin’ it... Well, it's been a few months, I reckon. Maybe springtime? It comes and goes, you know? Some days I feel fine, other days I get a kinda dull headache, and my neck feels stiff. And I get real tired easy. I just figured it was my age, to be honest. Ninety years is a long time to keep things runnin’ smooth!
DOCTOR: That’s fair, Venna. Ninety years is a long time! But even with age, it’s good to check things out. A dull headache and neck stiffness along with fatigue… those can be connected to high blood pressure, but we need to rule out other possibilities as well. When you say it “comes and goes,” how often would you say your blood pressure feels high?
PATIENT: Well, I don't have no way of knowin’ for sure, Doctor. I don’t have one of them machines to check it myself. I only know it when I go to the doctor’s office, or when the nurse checks it. Maybe two or three times a month I feel kinda bad like that. Sometimes less. It's hard to say, really. I just don't like feelin' poorly, and I want to be able to keep bakin’ for my grandkids. They love my pies.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you come in when you’re not feeling well, and wanting to keep up with baking for your grandkids is a wonderful reason to take care of yourself. Okay, so it sounds like maybe two or three times a month you experience those symptoms – headache, neck stiffness, and fatigue – and those times often coincide with feeling like your blood pressure is up. Do you notice anything specifically that seems to trigger those episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm...that’s a good question. Let me think... Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes it's after a busy day, maybe helpin’ out with somethin' around the house. But other times, it just comes on for no reason at all. I try to take it easy, but you know how it is... folks always need help with somethin'. And sometimes I get a little stressed when I worry about my daughter, she lives far away. Does worryin' count?
DOCTOR: Yes, worrying absolutely counts, Venna. Stress and anxiety can definitely affect blood pressure. It’s good you’re aware of that connection. So, it sounds like busy days and worrying about your daughter could be potential triggers. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, nothin' major, if that’s what you mean. I had the flu pretty bad a few years back, and my arthritis acts up somethin' fierce when it rains. The doctor gave me some cream for it, and that helps some. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, when I was younger. But other than that, I've been pretty lucky, I reckon. I always ate a good breakfast, that’s what my mama told me. And plenty of water.
DOCTOR: Okay, so flu a few years ago, arthritis, and gallbladder removal. That’s helpful to know. Do you take any medications regularly for your arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Just the cream for my arthritis, Doctor. It’s called… let me see… Diclofenac, I think it is. And sometimes, when it's really bad, I take a little bit of ibuprofen. But not every day, just when I need it. And maybe an aspirin now and then if I get a headache that won't go away. That's about it. I don’t like takin’ a lot of pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Diclofenac cream as needed for arthritis, ibuprofen occasionally for pain, and aspirin for headaches. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to nothin’. I eat just about anything. I used to help my husband in the garden, and he grew all sorts of things. I reckon I've tried it all. He was a good man, my husband. We always had a big garden.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Venna. No known allergies. And it sounds like you had a wonderful life with your husband. Now, before we move on, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, now... that's a tough one. My mama lived to be eighty-five, but she had a lot of trouble with her heart in the end. My daddy passed away when I was young, so I don’t remember much about his health. And I had a brother, but he moved away when we were kids and I never saw him much after that. I don't really know much about what kinda illnesses ran in the family, to be honest. We didn’t talk about that kinda stuff much back then. It was just... not done.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venna. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing about your mother's heart trouble is helpful, though. Alright, let’s talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Lord, no, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mama always said they were a terrible habit, and my husband didn't like 'em either. I drink a little bit of sweet tea sometimes, and a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but that’s about it. I’m not much of a drinker, never have been. I always preferred a good slice of pie.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Venna. So, no smoking, very little alcohol. And a preference for pie – I can certainly appreciate that. Now, just one more question about your lifestyle, and then we’ll do a quick physical exam. Do you exercise regularly, or have any hobbies that keep you active?
PATIENT: Well, not like I used to, Doctor. When I was younger, I loved to garden, but my arthritis makes it kinda hard now. I do a little bit of walkin’ around the house, and I still do most of my own bakin’, which keeps me on my feet. And I love to quilt! I’ve been makin’ quilts for my grandkids for years. But I wouldn't call it “exercise,” exactly. It's more just... keepin' busy. It's important to keep my hands movin’, you know?
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Venna. Quilting is good exercise for your hands, and staying busy is wonderful. Alright, if you don't mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I reckon you need to listen to my heart and all that. Just let me know if it's gonna hurt. I’m an old woman, you know, things creak a little.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna. I'll be as gentle as possible. It shouldn't hurt at all, but please let me know if you feel any discomfort. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is currently 160 over 95. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems stable, but your blood pressure is elevated, and I did note a slight murmur.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure...that's what I thought. And a murmur, you say? Is that bad, Doctor? My mama used to say murmurs meant somethin’ was wearin’ out. I'm an old woman, like I said. Things do wear out, don’t they? What do you think we oughta do about it? I'd like to keep bakin' for my grandkids, you know. It makes 'em so happy.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Venna. It’s good you’re proactive about your health. A murmur doesn’t always mean something is seriously wrong, but it does warrant further investigation. It can be a sign of changes in the heart valves, which are common as we get older. It doesn’t necessarily mean you won't be able to keep baking, but it’s important to understand what’s causing it. Given your elevated blood pressure and the murmur, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to check the electrical activity of your heart, and an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart, to get a better look at its structure and function. We'll also do some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out other possible causes for the high blood pressure. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests...more tests. Well, I reckon I can't avoid 'em forever, can I? If it'll help me keep bakin', and keep up with my grandkids...then yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. An EKG and an echo-whatsit, and blood work. Will they hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a pie crust to make next week. It's a blueberry one, their favorite.
DOCTOR: That’s the spirit, Venna. And no, none of them should hurt. The EKG is completely painless – we just put some stickers on your chest and arms. The echocardiogram is like a regular ultrasound – a technician will put some gel on your chest and move a wand around to get the pictures. The blood work will just require a small sample of blood. As for the results, it usually takes a few days to get everything back from the lab. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low dose of a blood pressure medication to help get things under control. It’s a medication called Lisinopril. It has some potential side effects, like a mild cough or dizziness, so we'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, you say? Medication... Well, I don't like takin' pills if I can help it, but if it’ll help my blood pressure and let me keep bakin’, I reckon I’ll try it. A low dose, you said? And you'll tell me what to watch out for, like that cough you mentioned? I don't want to be coughin' all over my pie crust! And what about my regular doctor? Should I tell him I’m takin’ this? He's been lookin' after me for years.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A low dose to start. And we’ll certainly discuss the potential side effects. The most common one is a dry cough, but not everyone experiences it. Dizziness is also possible, especially when you stand up quickly, so we'll want you to be careful. And yes, please do let your regular doctor know. It’s important for all your healthcare providers to be aware of the medications you're taking. I can send a copy of my notes and the prescription to his office, if you'd like. I’m also going to give you some written instructions about the medication, including potential side effects and what to do if you experience them. In addition, I recommend a low-sodium diet and regular, gentle exercise, like walking, to help manage your blood pressure. Would you like me to have my nurse print those instructions for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, that’d be wonderful, Doctor. Print those instructions, please. And send somethin' to my regular doctor too. He's a good man, Dr. Peterson. Been lookin' after me since my husband passed. A low-sodium diet… that might be hard. I like a little salt in my pies, to bring out the flavor. But I reckon I can try. And walkin’… I can manage some walkin’. As long as it don't rain. Arthritis, you know. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I feel a little better knowin’ we’re gettin’ this figured out. Now, can I go bake that pie?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. I'm glad I could help. And yes, absolutely, go bake that pie! Just remember to take it easy, and if you experience any concerning symptoms, please don't hesitate to call my office. Here are those instructions, and I'll have my nurse send a summary of our visit to Dr. Peterson’s office right away. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week after you've had the tests done to discuss the results. In the meantime, please focus on managing your blood pressure with the medication and lifestyle changes. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. You’ve answered everything I was worried about. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. And thank you for lettin' me bake my pie. It's a blueberry one, you know. Their favorite. Have a good day, Doctor. And God bless you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. It was a pleasure meeting you. Enjoy your blueberry pie – I'm sure it will be delicious. And you have a good day too. And God bless you as well. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
