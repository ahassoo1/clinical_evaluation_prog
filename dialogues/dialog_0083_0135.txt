DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Gerhard Radillo. I am here because… well, I have something coming from my ear. A little liquid, you understand? It is… discharging, yes? It started maybe three days ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A discharge from your ear. Thank you for explaining that, Mr. Radillo. Can you tell me a little more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… not much. A small amount. Mostly clear, I think. Sometimes, a little bit… yellowish. Not painful, not itchy. Just… there. It makes my clothes a little wet, if I lean my head. It is from my left ear, specifically. I remember clearly it was Tuesday when I first noticed it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Mr. Radillo. Not painful or itchy is good to know. And you first noticed it on Tuesday. Has this happened before, do you recall?
PATIENT: Yes, I do recall. Many years ago, when I was… younger. Perhaps when I was living in Mogadishu. I had a similar thing. But it was much worse then, with pain, and a bad smell. This is… different. Much milder. I was treated by a doctor then, but I do not remember his name. It was a long time ago, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to know you've experienced this before, even if the details are fuzzy. And it’s good that this instance is milder. Do you have any hearing loss or ringing in your ears currently, or have you noticed any dizziness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no hearing loss. I can hear you perfectly well. No ringing, either. And… no dizziness. I feel… steady. I walk normally. My wife… my ex-wife, she sometimes says I do not listen, but that is a different problem, yes? She is not here today. I do not think this is related.
DOCTOR: I appreciate the clarification, Mr. Radillo. It’s good to rule those things out. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have… what you call high blood pressure. The doctor told me many years ago. I take a pill for it, every morning. A small, white pill. It is called… amlodipine, I believe. I also had some problems with my sugar, a few years back, but the doctor said it is okay now, with diet and exercise. I walk every day, you understand? It helps with the blood pressure and the sugar. And my weight… it is a little much, yes? But I am trying.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're being proactive with your health, Mr. Radillo. Amlodipine for blood pressure and managing your sugar with diet and exercise is excellent. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I have eaten many different foods in my life, you understand? I have traveled. I have lived in many places. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. My ex-wife, she is allergic to cats, but that is not a problem for me. I do not have cats. I am fine. No allergies, yes?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the amlodipine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Only the amlodipine. Just one small, white pill every morning. I take it with my breakfast. Sometimes, I take a pain reliever for my back, if it is bothering me. But that is only when I need it. A small, blue pill. Ibuprofen, I think it is called. But not every day, you understand? Only when my back hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain. Thank you for letting me know. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your ear. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I trust your expertise. Please, proceed. I am ready for the examination. I hope it does not take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon. But I am flexible, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Radillo. I'm just going to use an otoscope to look inside your ear canal. It won't hurt, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay… I see some cerumen, which is normal earwax, and a slight redness of the ear canal. I also see a small amount of clear fluid. Your tympanic membrane – that’s your eardrum – appears slightly cloudy. It doesn’t seem to be bulging or perforated, which is good. Based on what I’m seeing, it looks like you might have a mild case of otitis externa, or an outer ear infection, perhaps with some cerumen impaction. Do you feel any tenderness when I gently press on the outside of your ear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. “Otitis externa.” Thank you for explaining. And… yes, actually. Now that you mention it, there is a little bit of… discomfort when you press here, on this part. Not much pain, but… noticeable. A little bit sore. It is a relief to finally know what is causing the problem, you understand? I have been worried about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s good we’re identifying the source of the discomfort. The tenderness on the tragus supports the diagnosis of otitis externa. Now, to be sure, I would like to check your hearing briefly with a simple screening test. It won’t be a comprehensive test, but it will give us a baseline. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly okay. Please, proceed with the test. I am happy to cooperate in any way that will help you understand the problem better. I hope it is not too complicated. My hearing is usually very good, you understand. But I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Radillo, the hearing screening shows a slight decrease in hearing sensitivity in your left ear, but it's not significant. It's consistent with the inflammation we're seeing. Based on your history and the exam findings, I'm confident in diagnosing you with mild otitis externa. It’s likely caused by bacteria or fungi, and the good news is it's usually treatable with ear drops. I recommend we start with topical antibiotic/steroid ear drops. Would you like me to write you a prescription for that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Ear drops, you say? Yes, please, write me a prescription. I would be very grateful. Topical antibiotic/steroid, yes? Will they be… difficult to administer? I am not very good with… small things, you understand. But I will follow your instructions carefully. I want to get rid of this problem as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: No, they shouldn’t be difficult at all, Mr. Radillo. I’ll give you a prescription for Cipro HC Otic drops. They come with a dropper, and you'll just need to tilt your head to the side, put a few drops into your ear canal, and stay tilted for a few minutes to allow them to work. I’ll have the nurse give you detailed instructions, and there are also helpful videos online if you'd like. I’ll also recommend keeping your ear dry—avoid swimming or getting water in your ear—and avoid using cotton swabs, as they can irritate the ear canal. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes perfect sense. Cipro HC Otic drops… tilt my head, a few drops, stay tilted. No swimming, no cotton swabs. Very clear instructions. Thank you. And how long should I use the drops for, Doctor? And is there anything else I should be aware of? Any side effects I should look out for? I like to be prepared, you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Use the drops twice a day for seven days. You should start to see improvement within a few days. If you don’t see any improvement after three days, or if your pain gets worse, please call the office. As for side effects, some people experience mild stinging or burning when they first put the drops in, but that usually goes away quickly. Rarely, some people can have an allergic reaction, with itching, swelling, or rash. If you experience any of those symptoms, stop using the drops and call us immediately. I'll also give you a handout with all of these instructions. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. You have been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. Seven days, twice a day. No swimming, no cotton swabs. Watch for stinging, burning, itching, swelling, rash. Thank you very much for your help, Doctor Alanes. I feel much better now knowing what is wrong and how to fix it. I will follow your instructions carefully. I believe this will solve the problem.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad I could help, Mr. Radillo. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the discharge instructions with you and give you the prescription. If you have any concerns after you leave, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and feel better soon!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well. .
