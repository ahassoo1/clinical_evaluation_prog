DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. It's this headache, see? Right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for… oh, let me think… about three days now, I reckon. Not constant, comes and goes. Feels like a tight band, kinda. Not the worst pain, but enough to make me a bit grumpy, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. A headache, localized to the back of the head, intermittent for three days. A “tight band” sensation, you said. Hmm. And has anything… different happened recently?
PATIENT: Different? Let me see… nothin’ major. My grandson, little Bao, started kindergarten last week. That’s been a bit of an adjustment, helpin’ him get settled, makin’ sure he doesn’t miss his mama too much. He’s a good boy, though. Strong-willed, like his grandma. And… oh! I helped my daughter fix her car last weekend. Changed the oil for her. Haven't done that in a while. My back was a little sore after that, now that I think about it. But that was just for a day, not like this headache.
DOCTOR: I see. So, grandson starting kindergarten, some physical exertion with the car repair… and the headache developed after those activities, or around the same time?
PATIENT: Around the same time, I think. Bao started school on the 27th of July, and the car was… let me see… the 28th, maybe the 29th. The headache started a couple days after that. Not right away, you know? It didn’t just boom happen after fixin’ the car. It was gradual, like a slow build-up. And it doesn’t feel like a muscle ache, not exactly. It’s more… inside my head, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual onset headache following a period of stress and physical activity. "Inside the head," not a typical muscle tension type of pain. Have you noticed anything else accompanying the headache?
PATIENT: Accompanyin’ it… well, I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But I’m 84, Doctor! Tired is kinda my default state these days. No nausea, no blurry vision, no dizziness. Just… the headache and a general feeling of being a bit run-down. And… oh, now that I think about it, I haven't been sleeping as well either. Tossin' and turnin’ a bit. Could be worryin' about Bao, I reckon. He’s a good boy, but kindergarten is a big step.
DOCTOR: Right. Fatigue, disrupted sleep, and the headache. We’ll need to rule a few things out, just to be safe. Have you ever had headaches like this before, Percell?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get the occasional tension headache, you know, like when I’m stressed, but those are usually in my forehead. This is different. This is… focused in the back, and it’s not just a tight feeling. It’s… harder to explain. It’s like a dull ache, kinda throbbing sometimes, but not a bad throbbing. And it doesn’t feel like it’s gonna split my head open, if that makes sense. I’ve had some pretty bad headaches in my life, workin’ in the fields when I was younger, but this isn't one of those.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, distinct from your usual tension headaches, not as severe as headaches you’ve experienced in the past. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with some pills. I haven’t taken ‘em in… oh, maybe six months now? He said I could try to get off ‘em if I watched my salt intake. I mostly have been, but sometimes I sneak a little extra fish sauce in my stir-fry. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, I reckon. Nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin’ like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. One of those cheap ones from the drugstore. My daughter keeps tellin' me I should be takin' more things, but I don't really believe in all that fancy stuff. Just the multivitamin, every mornin' with my breakfast. And a little ginger tea sometimes, for my stomach. But that's not a medicine, really. Just a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. My bones aren’t as nimble as they used to be, you know. And I might need a little help gettin’ up afterwards.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll assist you as needed. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently feel your neck for any tenderness or swelling. Pulses are present and regular. No significant tenderness or swelling noted. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. Everything seems within normal limits, but given your history and the recent headache, I'd like to check your blood pressure. Just to be safe.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. My blood pressure’s been pretty good lately, I thought, but I always trust your judgement. Don’t hesitate to tell me if you need me to do anything special. And… is that machine gonna squeeze my arm a lot? I don’t like things squeezin’ my arm.
DOCTOR: It will apply some pressure, but not excessively. It’s a quick procedure, and I’ll release it as soon as we have a reading. Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. It’s not critically high, but it is higher than we’d like. This, combined with your headache and recent change in medication, warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh. A little elevated, you say? That fish sauce again, probably. My daughter’s gonna kill me. But… what kind of investigation? Do I need a bunch of tests? I don’t really like hospitals and doctors, you know. And I haven’t been feelin’ too well lately, might just be my age. Is it somethin’ serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Percell. We don’t necessarily need a full hospital workup right away. I’d like to start with some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any infection. We can do that right here in the clinic. And, given your headache and slightly elevated blood pressure, I think it would be prudent to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Again, we can do that here. It’s quick and painless. These tests will give us a better understanding of what’s going on and help us determine the best course of action. It's better to be thorough, just to rule things out. It may be nothing serious, and could simply be related to your blood pressure and age, but we need to investigate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and… an EKG? Sounds like a lot. But… you’re right, I reckon. Better to be safe than sorry. My daughter always says that. Alright, Doctor. Let’s do the blood work and the EKG. Just… try to be gentle, okay? And… how long is all this gonna take? I have a dinner appointment with my grandson later, and I promised him I’d take him to get ice cream. He's been lookin' forward to it all week.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. The blood work will take about 15-20 minutes, and the EKG only takes a few minutes. We should have the results back relatively quickly, within an hour or so. I’ll do my best to get everything done efficiently so you can make your dinner appointment with Bao. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any salty foods and staying well-hydrated. Nurse Lin, could you please come in and prepare Mr. Gibbel for the blood work?
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds… manageable. No salty foods… I’ll try. It’s hard, though. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. And… tell Nurse Lin to be careful with the needle, okay? I don’t have the strongest veins.
DOCTOR: I will certainly let her know. She’s very experienced and gentle. We’ll take all the necessary precautions to make it as comfortable as possible. Nurse Lin, could you please assist Mr. Gibbel with the blood work?
PATIENT: Alright then. Let’s get this over with. Just… be quick, okay? And… try not to poke around too much.
