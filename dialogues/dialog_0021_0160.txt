DOCTOR: Alright, Candis, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Candis Hardenburgh. Look, I don’t have all day, so if we could just get right to it… I’ve been feeling awful, just… tired. Really tired. And I’ve been… well, eating dirt. Don’t look at me like that, it’s not a choice! My body just wants it.
DOCTOR: Eating… dirt?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt! Clay, mostly. It sounds ridiculous, I know, but it started small, just a little bit here and there. Now… well, now I actively crave it. And it's not like I’m out digging in the garden, mind you. I find it. It's… hard to explain. But it makes me feel… less awful, temporarily. And then the tiredness comes back worse, so I eat more. It’s a vicious cycle. Honestly, I just want to know what’s wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, this is… unusual. And craving non-food items, that’s… pica, I suppose. It can be a sign of a few different things. Usually deficiencies, but at your age… ...we need to rule out more serious causes. Let’s start with a full blood panel, check your iron, zinc, everything. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Besides being perpetually exhausted and having strange cravings? Honestly, no. Not really. My appetite’s been… off. Sometimes I don’t feel hungry at all, other times I just… pick at things. And I’ve been a bit more… forgetful, I suppose, but who isn’t at my age? It’s probably just old age catching up with me. Look, is a blood test really necessary? It feels like a lot of fuss over something… strange. I just need something to give me energy.
DOCTOR: “Strange” things are always worth investigating, Candis. Especially when they involve eating things you shouldn’t be. It’s not simply about energy, it's about finding the root cause. And yes, a blood test is necessary. It's standard procedure. It will give us a baseline and potentially point us in the right direction. It's quick, relatively painless… and frankly, it’s the only sensible thing to do right now. Honestly, dismissing things as "just old age" isn't a helpful approach to healthcare. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not particularly. A bit of a sniffle with pollen in the spring, but nothing serious. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time, honestly. I usually just try to push through things. It’s always worked before. But fine, do your blood test. Just… hurry it up, alright? I have things to do. And don't expect me to sit here and explain my entire life story. I’m not here for a chat.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll just need a basic history then. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, that’s about it. And a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but I just stayed in bed and drank a lot of tea. No hospitals, no anything serious. I’ve always been a healthy person, or was a healthy person, until… this. Honestly, I don't understand why it's so hard to just get a simple answer. Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: I am listening, Candis. It's just that “healthy person” isn't a diagnosis. And while tonsils out is good to know, it doesn’t tell me much. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? What do you want to know, their shoe size? Look, my mother had arthritis, and my father… he died of a heart attack, if that’s what you're interested. They weren’t exactly the healthiest bunch. But I haven’t seen most of them in years. Honestly, I doubt they’d be much help. Can we please just get this over with? This is ridiculous. Are you going to poke me with a needle now? Just… do it already.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any?
PATIENT: No. Never have, never will. I prefer natural remedies. Tea, a bit of rest… that sort of thing. I don’t trust those pills the doctors always push. Full of chemicals, I tell you. They just mask the symptoms, they don’t fix anything. Honestly, I’m surprised you even bother asking. Now, can we finally get to the blood test? I’m starting to feel faint just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No medications. Good to know. Now, before we do the blood work, I need to ask one last thing. Do you… regularly consume anything else unusual?
PATIENT: Unusual? What do you mean? Like what? I eat normal food… mostly. Occasionally a bit of chocolate. Are you suggesting I'm a… a strange person? Look, I told you about the dirt. That's the "unusual" thing! I don't go around eating rocks or anything. Honestly, you're starting to annoy me with all these questions. Just do the test and tell me what's wrong. It can’t be that complicated.
DOCTOR: It is complicated, Candis. And frankly, dismissing my questions as annoying isn't helpful. Now, I'm going to ask you one more time, very clearly. Besides the dirt, are you consuming anything else unusual?
