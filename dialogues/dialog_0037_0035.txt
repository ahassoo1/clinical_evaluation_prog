DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. They just won’t stop. Been going on for… oh, goodness, nearly a week now. It’s rather embarrassing, actually.
DOCTOR: A week, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, a whole week! Started right after I had a lovely bit of fish – snapper, it was. Fresh caught, you know? Maybe that had something to do with it? Though I’ve eaten snapper before without any trouble. It’s just… hic! …annoying, really. Especially when I'm trying to have a nice chat with folks.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can be quite disruptive. Okay, so it started about a week ago, shortly after eating some fresh-caught snapper. And you haven’t had this happen before, even with similar meals?
PATIENT: Not exactly like this, no. I’ve had hiccups before, of course, everyone does. But usually, they go away pretty quickly, you know? A glass of water, a little fright… something like that. This just… keeps going. hic! And it doesn’t seem to matter what I do. I even tried holding my breath like my granddaughter told me! Didn’t budge.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, usual remedies aren't working. And it's been consistently present for a full week. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think… hic!… No, not really. I’ve been eating normally, sleeping alright… maybe a little bit more tired than usual, but I put that down to my age, you know? I did have a bit of heartburn a couple of times, now that you mention it. But I usually just take a little something for that and it goes away. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some mild heartburn coinciding with the hiccups. And you're able to eat and sleep normally, aside from the tiredness and the hiccups themselves. Are you currently taking anything regularly for the heartburn?
PATIENT: Just over-the-counter stuff, Doctor. Those little pink tablets. Tums, I think they are? I don’t take them every day, only when I feel a bit of a burn coming on. Maybe two or three a week, at most. hic! It's not a constant thing, the heartburn. Honestly, I thought the hiccups would just go away on their own. It's really bothering me, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent Tums use for mild heartburn. It’s good you're trying to manage things, but a week of persistent hiccups warrants a little further investigation, especially with the heartburn. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your general health, if you don’t mind. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not a lot, thankfully. I had my gallbladder out years and years ago, when I was still living in Fiji. And my knees aren't what they used to be, you know? Arthritis, the doctor said. But other than that… nothing too serious. I used to be very active, always gardening and swimming, but these old bones don't allow for much of that anymore. hic! I’m generally a pretty healthy person, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, gallbladder removal quite some time ago and some arthritis in the knees. Do you take any medications regularly for your arthritis, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Just some ibuprofen when my knees are acting up, Doctor. Not every day, just when they're particularly sore. And a little vitamin D, my daughter started me on that a couple of years ago. She said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. hic! She worries about me, that one. Other than that… no, nothing regular. Just the ibuprofen and the vitamin D as needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent ibuprofen for knee pain and daily Vitamin D. Have you ever had any surgery other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think... hic! No, I don't believe so. Nothing else. Just the gallbladder when I was younger. And tonsils, maybe? When I was a little girl, but that was so long ago I barely remember it. It wasn't a big operation, I don't think. hic! Honestly, I've been very lucky with my health, all things considered. It's just these hiccups are driving me mad!
DOCTOR: Alright. No other surgeries to note. And you mentioned family – do you have any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, my mother had diabetes, later in life. And my brother, he had some trouble with his heart, but he didn’t look after himself like he should have. hic! Smoked too much, drank too much... a shame, really. My father was always very healthy, strong as an ox. I think I got my good bones from him. hic! Other than that... not that I know of. We didn’t have much access to doctors when I was growing up in Fiji, you see. We relied a lot on traditional remedies.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes in your mother and heart problems in your brother. Now, I’m going to ask about some of your lifestyle habits. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life, Doctor. My mother wouldn't allow it! She always said it was a terrible habit. hic! I always preferred the fresh air, you see. And I do enjoy a little drink now and then, a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but nothing excessive. Just a social drink, really. hic!
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking history and occasional social alcohol consumption. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, lived in different places, tried different foods. Nothing ever bothered me. hic! I can eat shellfish, nuts, everything. I really haven’t had any allergic reactions, thankfully. hic! I suppose I'm pretty lucky, all things considered. Now, are you going to figure out what’s causing these hiccups? They're truly awful!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mirriam, no known allergies, and a relatively healthy lifestyle. You've been very helpful with this information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on and rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. hic! I trust your judgment. Just please, please get rid of these hiccups! They're driving me absolutely bonkers. hic! Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just hop up on the table for me, and lie back comfortably. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope first. I'll also palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Could you take a nice, deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Here we are, Doctor. hic! Just let me know if you need me to do anything else. It's a little chilly in here, isn't it? hic! But I suppose that's to be expected. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds clear on your heart and lungs. No unusual sounds or wheezes. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness or masses. Your abdominal muscles are relaxed. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear, Doctor. hic! No tenderness is always a relief. I do worry sometimes, you know, getting older... things start to go wrong. hic! Reflexes, you say? Very thorough, you are! hic! Go ahead. I'm ready for whatever you need to do. As long as it gets rid of these pesky hiccups, that is! hic!
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are normal and symmetrical on both sides. Everything seems to be within normal limits physically. Given your history and the physical exam, it's likely these hiccups are idiopathic – meaning we don't have a clear cause. However, persistent hiccups can sometimes be a sign of something more serious, so I do want to be cautious. To rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel . This will check your electrolyte levels and rule out any underlying infections or other imbalances. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. “Idiopathic”? That sounds… serious. And tests? hic! Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then absolutely. I trust your judgment. hic! I just want to get to the bottom of this, and get rid of these awful hiccups! Blood tests, you say? Just let me know where to go, and I'll get it done. hic! I hope they don't take too much blood, though. I get a bit faint easily, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s good we’re being thorough. "Idiopathic" just means we haven’t found a cause yet, and in many cases, hiccups resolve on their own. The blood tests are just a precaution to rule out anything serious. And don’t worry, we'll take it slow and make sure you’re comfortable. The lab is just down the hall – I’ll have a nurse draw the blood for you. She’s very experienced and gentle. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and try some relaxation techniques. Sometimes, deep breathing exercises or meditation can help. If the hiccups persist for more than a few days after the tests, or if you develop any other symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever, please contact the office immediately.
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. hic! Relaxation techniques… I suppose I could try that. Deep breathing, you say? hic! It’s hard to relax when you’re hiccuping, but I’ll give it a shot. Chest pain or fever… goodness, I certainly hope it doesn’t come to that. hic! Thank you for being so thorough, Doctor. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. hic! I appreciate it. Just let me know when the nurse is ready, and I’ll go down to the lab. hic! Hopefully, they’ll have some good news soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. I'll let the nurse know to expect you. Her name is Sarah, and she's excellent. She'll explain the procedure to you, and we'll get the results back as quickly as possible, usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, if anything changes, or you have any concerns at all, don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before you head down to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. hic! You’ve been very helpful and put my mind at ease, at least a little bit. hic! I’ll go find Sarah now and get the blood tests done. hic! Hopefully, this will get to the bottom of things. Thank you again, Doctor Octavis. hic! I really appreciate it. hic! I’ll let you know how it goes. hic! Goodbye for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. And don’t worry, we'll figure this out. Take your time, and let Sarah know if you're feeling faint at any point. I'll see you soon, and we'll go over the results when they come back.
