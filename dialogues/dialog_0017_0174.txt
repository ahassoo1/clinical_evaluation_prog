DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's not waste time. You're 75 years old – things tend to move along faster at our age, you understand. Please, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, you are quite right. Time is precious. Well, to put it plainly, I haven’t been… myself lately. I’m feeling rather down, and it’s been going on for a few weeks now. It's… depressing, really.
DOCTOR: Depressing, you say. Weeks, you claim. Very well. Let’s try to be precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Precise… yes, alright. Perhaps… six weeks? It started after my grandson went off to university. A perfectly good boy, studying engineering. I just… miss him terribly, and it's brought up a lot of old feelings, I suppose. It’s foolish, I know, but… it’s difficult.
DOCTOR: Six weeks. Sentimental attachment to a grandson. Understandable, in a… limited capacity. Has this sadness affected your daily routine at all?
PATIENT: Affected my routine? Oh, yes. Quite a bit, actually. I used to be very active. Lifeguarding in the summer, ski patrol in the winter… kept me going. Now, I find it difficult to even get out of bed some days. I've lost my appetite, and… well, the motivation just isn't there. I mostly just sit and… think. Not very productive, is it?
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite, diminished activity… Are you sleeping normally?
PATIENT: Sleeping? No, not really. I wake up several times a night, usually thinking about… things. And when I do sleep, it’s not a restful sleep. I toss and turn… just a lot of restlessness. It’s rather uncomfortable, to be honest. It wasn’t always like this, you understand.
DOCTOR: Insomnia, then. And this… ‘thinking’ – what precisely are you thinking about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? It's not just my grandson, though he is a large part of it. It’s… my late husband, mostly. Regrets, you understand. Things I should have said, things I should have done. Old memories, really. And… feeling useless, now that I'm not working as much. It’s a lot swirling around in my head, Doctor. A great deal.
DOCTOR: Regret, nostalgia… common ailments of the elderly, unfortunately. Now, have you experienced any changes in weight, other than the loss of appetite you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. I haven’t weighed myself precisely, but my clothes are… looser than they used to be. I’d say I’ve lost at least ten pounds, maybe more. It’s not intentional, I assure you. I used to be quite proud of my figure, you understand. Not anymore, though.
DOCTOR: Weight loss, insomnia, loss of appetite... Very well. Now, have you noticed any difficulty concentrating or remembering things?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, yes. It’s not as sharp as it used to be, definitely. Little things, you understand? Forgetting names, misplacing things… it's not terrible, but it's noticeable. It’s been getting worse lately, alongside everything else. It's… unnerving, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Memory lapses, then. Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness, or thoughts of… ending things?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not! I wouldn’t dream of such a thing! Hopelessness… perhaps a little, sometimes. But ending things? Never. That’s… dreadful. No, Doctor, I just want to feel like myself again. I want to be able to enjoy my life, to feel useful, to see my grandson without feeling this… weight.
DOCTOR: Right. Very well. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Just for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. A small dose, the doctor said. I’ve been taking it for… oh, about five years now. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the one the pharmacist recommended. That's all.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… and Vitamin D. Any allergies to medications or anything else, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’m generally quite robust, you understand. Well, aside from all this, of course. My family always said I had a strong constitution. It's just… this feeling has me quite worried.
DOCTOR: Robust...Interesting. Have you had any significant surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, actually. I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. It was… unpleasant, but it healed well. And I had a knee replacement ten years ago, also on the right side. That was more serious, required some physiotherapy afterwards, but I recovered nicely. I was very active after that, as I mentioned earlier.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, knee replacement… satisfactory. And your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? My mother lived to be 85, but she had some heart trouble towards the end. My father passed away quite young, a stroke, I believe. My sister… she’s still alive, thankfully, but she has arthritis. Nothing else particularly noteworthy, you understand. It's a long family, so it's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Right. Adequate. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. A small glass of sherry with dinner occasionally, that’s all. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not! I’m a respectable woman, Doctor. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Derasmo. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to conduct a brief physical exam. It won’t be pleasant, but it's necessary to get a clearer picture of your condition. Please, lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. A physical exam… I suppose that's reasonable. Though, I must admit, I’m not particularly fond of doctors poking and prodding. But, if you deem it necessary… here I go, then.
DOCTOR: Please, lie flat on your back. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90… elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, but slightly muffled. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses palpated. Now, let me check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Throat is clear, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. All right, Mrs. Derasmo. Thank you. That will suffice for now.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. It wasn't as unpleasant as I feared, but I still prefer not being poked and prodded, you understand. What did you find, Doctor? Is something… seriously wrong? I’m rather anxious now. Please, tell me what your assessment is.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Derasmo, your physical exam reveals some expected findings for someone of your age. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not alarming. The rest of the exam was largely unremarkable. However, taken together with your reported symptoms – the loss of appetite, weight loss, insomnia, and feelings of sadness – it's my professional opinion that you are experiencing symptoms consistent with mild depression. It's not uncommon, particularly after a significant life event, like your grandson leaving for university. It's not a sign of weakness, but it does require attention.
PATIENT: Oh. Depression. I see. It’s… rather disheartening to hear, Doctor. I always considered myself a strong woman, you understand. To think I'm suffering from… depression. It’s not something one openly discusses, is it? What… what does that mean? What do I do about it?
DOCTOR: It means, Mrs. Derasmo, that your brain chemistry is slightly imbalanced. It’s not a moral failing. Now, the good news is, it's often treatable. I recommend starting a low dose of Sertraline – an antidepressant. It's generally well-tolerated. We'll also explore some lifestyle modifications. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and social interaction are crucial. I also suggest scheduling a follow-up appointment in four weeks to assess your progress. And, if your symptoms worsen significantly, please do not hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Sertraline… A medication… Oh dear. I always try to avoid medications, if possible. Are there… side effects? And regular exercise… I used to be so active, but now… it's such an effort. And social interaction… it’s difficult, without my husband. Will this medication make me feel like… myself again, Doctor? That's all I want, you understand.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Derasmo, all medications carry potential side effects. With Sertraline, the most common are nausea, insomnia, and decreased libido. However, these are typically mild and subside with time. And, while I understand your reluctance, avoiding treatment will only prolong your suffering. As for your activity level, start small. A short walk each day is a good starting point. And, I understand the loss of your husband is profound, but isolation will only exacerbate your symptoms. Consider joining a bereavement group or reconnecting with old friends. Ultimately, the goal is to restore your quality of life. And, while I can’t guarantee a complete return to your former self, Sertraline, combined with lifestyle modifications, will significantly improve your condition. Do you have any further questions before I write your prescription?
PATIENT: A bereavement group… Oh dear. I’m not one for… groups, you understand. And re-connecting with old friends… most of them have… passed away. It feels… lonely. Will this medication interact with my blood pressure medication, Doctor? I worry about adding more chemicals to my system. And… how long will it take to feel better? I haven't got much time, you understand.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Derasmo, Sertraline has a minimal interaction with Lisinopril, but we will monitor your blood pressure closely. It is unlikely to cause any significant complications. As for how long it will take to feel better, it varies. Typically, it takes 4-6 weeks to see a noticeable improvement in symptoms. However, it’s crucial to adhere to the prescribed dosage and attend your follow-up appointments. I am writing your prescription now. It is a standard dose of 50mg, to be taken once daily. I recommend taking it with breakfast to minimize nausea. Do you have any other questions, or can we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Fifty milligrams… Very well. I suppose… I don’t know what else to say. No, I… I don’t think so. No further questions. You’ve been very… thorough, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mrs. Derasmo. Here is your prescription. Please, schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist before you leave. I’ll see you in four weeks. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Yes. Four weeks. Very well. Thank you again, Doctor. .
