DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Dr. Dashevsky, is it? Yes, well, it’s not really a problem, you understand. My daughter, she said I should come. She worries too much. I just... I thought a card would be nice. A little encouragement, you know? From a real doctor. Makes it feel more official.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you’re hoping for a medical assessment, perhaps a note confirming your current health status for your peace of mind, and to reassure your daughter?
PATIENT: Well, “assessment” sounds a bit grand, doesn’t it? I feel perfectly fine! I just… it’s hard to explain. It’s not like I'm sick. It’s more… a feeling. Like people don’t always believe I’m as strong as I am. And a card from a doctor… well, it shows I am being sensible, taking care of myself. It’s for appearances, really. My daughter, she's very… particular.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Janeth. It’s perfectly reasonable to want reassurance and documentation, especially when it comes to family concerns. We can absolutely do a check-up to assess your overall health and provide you with a note. That way, we can address your daughter's concerns and also give you peace of mind. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a “check-up”… alright. But don’t go poking and prodding too much, dear. I haven’t got all day, you know. And no need for anything complicated. Just… confirm I’m not about to fall apart or something. And then the card. A nice, official-looking one would be lovely. Something with a flower, maybe? Not too bright, though. My tastes are rather refined.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Janeth. We'll keep it as simple and comfortable as possible. No unnecessary poking and prodding, I promise. And I'll see what we have available in terms of card designs – a flower, not too bright, refined tastes… noted. First, let’s just go through some basic questions about your overall health. Have you been feeling any pain or discomfort anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh, goodness, no. A little ache here and there, you know, like any woman my age. But nothing to complain about. Really. I keep myself active. I do a lot of… well, things. Around the house, mostly. I don't sit around feeling sorry for myself, if that's what you're asking. A bit of gardening, too. Keeps the hands busy. But pain? No, doctor. Not really.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. It sounds like you're very active, which is wonderful. Just to clarify, when you say "ache," where specifically do you feel that?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, really. Mostly in my… well, you know. My joints. My knees, sometimes. And my back, if I've been bending for too long in the garden. But it's just… age, I suppose. I don’t make a fuss about it. My mother had it much worse, you know. She was practically crippled by the time she was my age. So, I can't complain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re able to stay active despite some occasional discomfort. It sounds like you’re managing things well. To get a better picture, could you rate your typical level of pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain at all and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale? Really, doctor, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's not that bad. If I had to… maybe a two? On a good day. Sometimes three if it's been raining and my joints are feeling a bit stiff. Honestly, it’s barely worth mentioning. I just… get on with things.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Janeth. Even a two or three can be worth addressing to help maintain your quality of life. Alright, let’s move on to some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Not really. I eat what I like, when I like. My husband, he’s a good cook, bless him. We have a nice, regular diet. Lots of vegetables, mostly. And rice, of course. I’m not one of these people who fusses about with fancy foods. And my weight? Perfectly normal, I should think. I haven't been on a scale in ages. Too vulgar, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you'd say your appetite is normal and you haven't experienced any unintentional weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Exactly! No losses, no gains. Just… steady as she goes. Like a good ship, you see? Everything in its place. I don't believe in extremes. Or unnecessary medical poking and prodding, for that matter. Are we getting closer to this card, doctor? My daughter will be wanting an update. She checks her phone every five minutes, the silly girl.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting closer, Janeth. Just a few more questions, and then we can do a brief physical exam, just to get a general overview, and then we'll get that card sorted for you. Now, have you been feeling unusually tired or fatigued lately, even after a good night's sleep?
PATIENT: Tired? Well, who isn’t these days? Life is tiring, you know? All the things one has to do. Keeping the house tidy, looking after my husband… it takes it out of you. But I manage. I don’t sit around complaining about being tired. I just get on with it. And a good cup of tea always helps. But unusually tired? No, not really. Just… normal tired.
DOCTOR: “Normal tired,” alright. Now, how about your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, my sleep is… adequate. I don't have any trouble falling asleep, thankfully. My husband snores a bit, bless him, but I've gotten used to it. And I don't wake up in the middle of the night feeling anxious or anything like that. It’s not the best sleep you'll ever have, but it's… sufficient. Enough to get through the day, you see?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Sufficient sleep is important. Now, I'm going to ask about some specific body systems, just to get a complete picture. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that's a bit personal, isn't it? Really, doctor, must we? I mean, it's all rather… private. Honestly. I suppose… everything is… regular. As regular as it should be, I should think. I haven't been noticing anything unusual.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that was a bit too personal, Janeth. It's just a standard part of the check-up. “Regular” is good to hear. And how about your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly! You're turning me red! Is this really necessary for a card? Look, I go to the toilet when I need to. As normal. There's no burning, no pain, no… difficulties. Just… normal. Really. I’m starting to feel like a specimen under a microscope, doctor. Can we please move on? My daughter will be expecting an update any minute. She's very particular about these things, you know.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to tell me that this is too much, Janeth. My apologies. I got carried away with the standard questions. We can absolutely stop there. It sounds like you're in good health, and it's perfectly reasonable that you don’t want to discuss these details. Let’s do a quick, brief physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then we can get that card sorted for you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes! That sounds… much better. Just the basics. No poking, no prodding, no unnecessary examinations. Just listen and check, and then the card. I'm perfectly capable of telling you I'm fine without a thorough investigation. Honestly, sometimes doctors ask too many questions. It's exhausting. And do you have flowers? Something with a bit of… dignity. Not too bright, remember.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Janeth. Just the basics. And I'll see what flower options we have that fit your description - something with dignity, not too bright. Alright, if you could just sit back and relax, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that deep enough? I always feel like I'm puffing like an old steam engine when I do that. My husband says I always sound like a walrus. Honestly, sometimes I wonder what he’s thinking.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear, Janeth. Heart rate is good and regular. Lungs are clear as well. Now, let me just check your blood pressure. 130 over 80. That's perfectly normal. Everything seems to be in good order. So, to summarise, you're feeling well, you're active, you're sleeping adequately, and all your vital signs are within normal limits. That's wonderful! Now, let me get that card for you. One moment. How about this one?
PATIENT: Hmm… the rose is… acceptable. Not too garish. A bit pale, perhaps, but I suppose it will do. It’s certainly better than those brightly coloured monstrosities my granddaughter sends. Yes, that will do nicely. Thank you, doctor. It's a very… dignified rose. Will you write something official on it? Saying I'm in good health? For my daughter, you see. She likes things in writing.
DOCTOR: Certainly. How about this: “To Whom It May Concern: I have examined Janeth Micucci on August 2, 2025, and confirm that she is in good general health.” Is that suitable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… perfectly adequate. Very official. “To Whom It May Concern” is a nice touch. My daughter will appreciate the formality. Yes, that will do wonderfully. Thank you, doctor. You’ve been… very efficient, considering everything. And the rose is quite nice, actually.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janeth. I'm glad I could help. I'm always happy to provide reassurance and documentation for my patients. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… tell my daughter not to worry so much, will you? Honestly, she fusses over me like I'm made of glass. But thank you again, doctor. You've been… surprisingly understanding.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Janeth. I will certainly convey that message to your daughter if she contacts me. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Have a lovely day, and please take care.
