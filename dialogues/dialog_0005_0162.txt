DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, no need for the formalities. Lawton's fine. And honestly? I just… feel puffed up, alright? Like a balloon. It's annoying, that's what it is. I don't have time for this, so let's just figure out what's causing it and get it fixed. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: “Puffed up,” alright. Right. Well, “fixing” things requires knowing what things are, Lawton. And frankly, describing a symptom as just feeling “puffed up” doesn’t give me much to work with. Is this swelling all over, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? I told you, I don’t know. It’s my stomach, mostly. And… maybe my legs a little? Look, it’s just… bigger than usual, okay? I eat, and I feel like I’m going to pop. It’s uncomfortable, and it’s been happening on and off for… a while now. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. Is that good or bad? Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal, Lawton, not keeping track. It makes things harder. So, stomach and legs, on and off for a while. When you say “on and off,” how long does this puffiness last each time?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I operate a pile driver. I don't have time to measure how long I'm bloated! A day? Maybe two? Sometimes it's just after I eat, sometimes it lingers. It's… unpredictable, alright? I eat the same stuff I always eat, and sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. It's just… frustrating. And uncomfortable. Can we just skip to the part where you tell me what’s wrong and what to do about it? This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lawton. Let's try this again. You're asking me to diagnose you without any real information. It's not how this works. And frankly, dismissing symptoms and being vague isn’t helping. We need to establish a timeline, and figure out what might be triggering this. Do you notice any specific foods that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Foods? Honestly, doc, I eat. I don’t analyze what I eat. Steak, chicken, rice… whatever’s quick and easy. I need energy for the job, alright? It’s not like I’m sitting here sipping chamomile tea. Maybe… spicy food? Sometimes after that, I feel a little… full. But honestly, it could be anything. I don't know. Look, is it serious? Is this something I should be really worried about? Because if it is, just tell me straight. I don’t need a lecture about my diet.
DOCTOR: Spicy food is a start. Alright. Look, I'm going to need to ask some more questions, even if you find them annoying, because "feeling puffed up" could be anything from simple gas to something more serious. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Now we're talking about that? Look, doc, I'm a grown man. I don't need to discuss my… bathroom habits with you. It's… normal. Everything's normal. Can we just… skip that part? This is ridiculous. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming in here. It's just bloating, not the end of the world. Is there a pill you can give me for it, or what?
DOCTOR: Alright, Lawton. Look, I understand you're frustrated, but avoiding basic questions isn't helpful. And yes, I do need to know about your bowel movements. Are they regular?
PATIENT: Regular? What does that even mean? I go when I need to go, alright? Sometimes it's every day, sometimes it's every other day. It varies! I don’t keep a log! Look, I operate heavy machinery for a living. I don't have time for detailed bowel movement reports. Just… are you going to help me or not? I’m wasting valuable time here. And frankly, you’re being condescending.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s try this differently. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! No blood. Look, if there was blood, I'd probably mention it, alright? I'm not stupid. I just feel… full, and uncomfortable, and bloated. And you're asking me about blood! This is a waste of my time. Can we just get a blood test or something? Just tell me what's wrong! I have work to do. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Lawton. Given your… limited information and your insistence on avoiding basic questions, I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool analysis to rule out any obvious issues. It's the best I can do at this point. We'll also need to do a quick physical exam. Please step onto the scale and then we'll listen to your abdomen. And please, try to be more forthcoming. It helps me help you. It's not about condescension, it's about gathering information. Step on the scale when you're ready.
