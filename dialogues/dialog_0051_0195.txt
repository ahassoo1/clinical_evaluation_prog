DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Glazewski, you said? Hmm. Well, it's not really a sickness, you see. More… a matter of morale. My sister, she keeps saying I need a little… pick-me-up. She thinks a card from a real doctor would do the trick. A “Get Well” card, or something encouraging. You know, show her I’m alright. It’s silly, really, but she’s very persistent.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s not a medical complaint, per se, but a request for documentation to reassure your sister about your well-being. That’s perfectly alright, Janeth. We want to support you in whatever way we can. Just to be thorough, and to make sure there isn’t anything else going on, could you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Oh, goodness. Well, I work. I assemble… things. Small parts, mostly. All day. It’s… work. Not exciting, but it pays the bills. My hands ache a bit at the end of the day, but what woman my age doesn’t have aching hands? And I’m tired, of course. But isn’t everyone tired? I eat, I sleep… reasonably. I don’t go out much anymore. It's too much bother, frankly. What exactly are you trying to find out, Doctor? Is this a trick question?
DOCTOR: No trick questions at all, Janeth. I apologize if it feels that way. I’m just trying to get a full picture of your overall health. It’s important to rule out anything that might be contributing to how you’re feeling, even if it seems minor. You mentioned aching hands. How long have they been aching, and is it a constant ache, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. It's not new. Probably ten years, at least. Whenever I work a long shift, they ache. And if I try anything… like gardening, which I haven't done in ages, they really ache. It’s just… old lady hands, Doctor. I don’t need a special cream or anything. My sister is the one who worries about everything. Honestly, she fusses more than my mother did. She just thinks because I’m not… bubbly, there must be something wrong. Are we getting closer to this card, or are you going to ask about my feet next?
DOCTOR: We are getting closer, Janeth. I understand your sister is concerned, and it’s good she encourages you to take care of yourself. Let's move on. You mentioned being tired. Is this a new level of tiredness, or has it been consistent for a while?
PATIENT: Consistent. Always consistent. Since… well, since I started working, really. It's not a falling-down, can't-get-out-of-bed tired, you understand. Just… the kind of tired that makes you want to sit down after a long day. And then go to bed. It’s a normal tired. I don’t drink coffee, so it’s not like I’m crashing from that. Really, Doctor, are you looking for something specific? Is there a test for “normal tired”? Because I assure you, I qualify. This is getting ridiculous. I came for a card, not a full physical!
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Janeth. I apologize for taking so much time. I get into the habit of a thorough assessment. It's just my nature, I suppose. And you are correct, there isn’t a test for “normal tired.” Let's try this. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… a fever? A cough? No, nothing like that. I don’t get sick easily. I haven’t had a cold in… oh, goodness, years. Maybe a little bit of indigestion sometimes, but that’s just from eating too much spice. My husband makes a lovely curry, but it can be a bit… potent. No aches, no pains, no dizziness, no… anything. Really. Just tired hands and a sister who thinks I’m about to fall apart. Are we finally getting to the card? Honestly, I'm starting to think she sent me here just to annoy me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth. It sounds like, overall, you're describing a reasonably healthy state. No fever, no cough, no dizziness... just normal tiredness and some hand discomfort. To be perfectly clear, and for documentation purposes, it sounds like you're experiencing fatigue and mild hand discomfort which has been consistent for many years, and isn't significantly impacting your daily life, aside from the hand discomfort after activity. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes! Perfectly accurate. Finally. You know, sometimes I think people just like to hear themselves talk. Though, you seem like a nice enough young man, Doctor. It’s just… all those questions! Alright, so can we get to the card now? A nice “Get Well Soon” would be lovely. Or maybe something encouraging. “Keep up the good work!” That would please my sister immensely. She likes things… positive. Do you have a selection? Is it a complicated process?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Janeth. No complicated process at all. Unfortunately, we don’t actually have a selection of pre-made cards here at the clinic. However, I am more than happy to write a note on official letterhead stating that you have been evaluated and are in stable health, and that I encourage you to continue maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Would that suffice?
PATIENT: A note on letterhead…Hmm. "Stable health," you say? That sounds… official. And “continue maintaining a healthy lifestyle”? My sister will love that! Yes, that will do nicely. Though, perhaps you could add something about me being… resilient? She thinks I’m too quiet. Resilient sounds good. And maybe something about me working hard? Yes, hard-working and resilient. On letterhead, please. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… surprisingly accommodating. It's been… an experience.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Janeth. "Hard-working and resilient" it is. I'll add that to the note. Just a moment... Here you go. It states that you have been evaluated today, found to be in stable health, and are encouraged to continue maintaining a healthy lifestyle, noting your hard work and resilience. Hopefully, that will reassure your sister. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Perfect. That's… exactly right. Hard-working and resilient. She will be very pleased. No, Doctor, that is all. Thank you very much for your time and… patience. You're a good young man. Don't let all those questions get to you. And don't forget to encourage your patients to be resilient! I think I’ll go home now and have a nice cup of tea. Perhaps I’ll even tell my husband about my… evaluation. He’ll be amused. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Janeth. And thank you for the reminder. I will definitely keep that in mind. Take care now, and enjoy your tea. .
