DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh dear… what does bring me in? It’s… well, it’s this pain. A bad pain, low down. It comes and goes, you see. I believe… I think it has something to do with my… condition. The one I’ve been managing for some time now. It’s awfully difficult to recall precisely when it began, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. A pain low down, coming and going… and you mentioned a condition you've been managing. I understand it can be difficult to recall details. Perhaps we can start with the pain itself. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Describe it… hmm. It’s… a cramping, really. A deep, uncomfortable cramping. Sometimes it feels like a… a twisting, if that makes sense. And it’s not… constant. It’ll come on quite suddenly, and then… fade away. It’s rather unpredictable, which is what’s so worrying. It’s… quite distracting, to be frank. I do try to ignore it, but it’s… difficult.
DOCTOR: Cramping, twisting… comes and goes unpredictably. Distracting, you said. And where exactly are you feeling this pain, Alese?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where exactly… It’s… right here, I believe. Low down… both sides, actually. Though sometimes it feels more pronounced on the left. It's… a rather large area, isn't it? I do wish I could be more precise. It’s all a bit… hazy, you see. I apologize for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Alese. It’s perfectly alright. We'll get there. Both sides, lower abdomen, sometimes more on the left… And has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes of pain?
PATIENT: Trigger… hmm. That’s a good question. I honestly can’t say with any certainty. I’ve tried to be mindful of what I’ve been doing before the pain starts, but… I haven’t noticed a pattern, not really. Sometimes it happens after I’ve been… walking a great deal. Other times it seems to come on completely at random. I have been a bit stressed lately, perhaps that has something to do with it? Though… I always seem to be a little stressed, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Stress is certainly a factor we need to consider. Walking sometimes, but also at random… Alright. And you mentioned managing a condition for some time. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It’s… Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Or… SLE, I believe the doctors call it. I was diagnosed… oh, goodness, it must be nearly fifteen years ago now. It’s… a complicated illness, you see. Lots of different symptoms, and they come and go. I’ve been under the care of a rheumatologist for many years. I take medication, of course, to try to keep it under control. Though… it’s not always successful, as you can imagine. I’ve had… flares, you see. Bad flares. And I suspect this pain might be… related to one of those.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your history of Lupus here, and your rheumatologist’s information. Thank you for letting me know. And you're taking medication for it currently?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take… let me see… Hydroxychloroquine, and… Plaquenil, I believe it’s the same thing? And sometimes, when I have a flare-up, the rheumatologist prescribes Prednisone. A short course, usually. It helps, but… it has side effects, you see. Awful side effects. I try to avoid it when I can. I've been on this regimen for... oh dear, a long time. It all blurs together, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright, Hydroxychloroquine regularly, and Prednisone as needed for flares. I see. And any other medications you’re taking, for any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. Lisinopril, perhaps? Yes, that’s it. And… a little something for my cholesterol. Atorvastatin, I think it’s called. And… oh, I take a Vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were low. That's it, I believe. I really should make a list, shouldn't I? It's all so terribly… disorganized.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Alese. Many people have trouble keeping track of everything. We can certainly work on getting a more organized list. Alright, Lisinopril for blood pressure, Atorvastatin for cholesterol, and Vitamin D. And you mentioned flares of your Lupus. When was the last time you had a significant flare-up?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the last flare-up… Let me see… I believe it was… last autumn. October, perhaps? It wasn't as bad as some, thankfully. Mostly joint pain and… fatigue. I had to take a short course of Prednisone, as I mentioned. It cleared up relatively quickly, but… I’ve been feeling a bit… off ever since. And now this pain… I do worry it's another flare, but it’s… different, somehow.
DOCTOR: Alright. Last flare last autumn, treated with Prednisone, and this pain feels different. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then gently examine your abdomen to see if we can pinpoint the source of this pain. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, do whatever you think is best. I’m rather… trusting, you see. I leave it to the professionals. I do hope you can find out what's causing this discomfort. It’s rather… unsettling, not knowing.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back for me, please. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain, and where. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly… although… Ooh. Yes, there. That’s… tender. Not excruciating, but… definitely uncomfortable. It’s… a dull ache, really. And it seems to radiate… a little, to my left side. Not terribly far, but… yes. That’s where it hurts the most. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the lower left quadrant, with some radiation. Not acute pain, but definitely present. And any guarding or rebound tenderness?
PATIENT: Guarding… rebound tenderness…? Oh dear. I’m not sure I understand. Could you perhaps explain that in simpler terms, Doctor? I apologize for my ignorance, but… medical jargon is rather lost on me.
DOCTOR: Of course, no apology needed at all, Alese. Let me explain. Guarding is when your muscles automatically tighten up to protect the area when I press on it. Rebound tenderness is when it hurts more when I quickly release the pressure than when I’m actually pressing down. So, when I press here… and then release… does that cause more pain than the pressing itself?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Yes… yes, it does. It’s… a sharper pain when you let go. It’s not terrible, but… it’s definitely noticeable. It’s rather… unsettling, that it hurts more when you stop pressing. Is that… a sign of something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the lower left quadrant, with guarding and rebound tenderness present. Alese, given your history of Lupus, and these findings on the exam, it’s important we investigate this further. The pain and tenderness could be related to a flare-up of your Lupus, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and some inflammatory markers to see if there’s evidence of active inflammation. I’d also like to get a urine sample to rule out a urinary tract infection. And, just to be thorough, I think a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis would be beneficial to get a better look at things. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… rather extensive. Blood work, a urine sample… and a CT scan? Is that… absolutely necessary? It all sounds a bit… frightening. I do trust your judgment, Doctor, but… I’ve always been a little… anxious about scans. Is there any way we could… perhaps try something less… invasive first? I understand you need to rule things out, but… it all feels a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to feel that way, Alese. It does sound like a lot, and I apologize for overwhelming you. It’s true that we could start with just the blood work and urine sample, and see what those results show. However, given your history of Lupus and the findings on the exam – the tenderness, guarding, and rebound – there are some things we need to rule out. Things like diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, or even something more serious. A CT scan will give us the clearest picture and allow us to make an accurate diagnosis quickly. I understand your anxiety about scans. We can take steps to make you more comfortable. You'll be able to speak with the radiology technician beforehand, and they can answer any questions you have. The scan itself is painless, and it doesn't involve any radiation exposure that's harmful. But, ultimately, my priority is to make sure we don't miss anything. Would you be willing to proceed with the CT scan, knowing that it will give us the most information and help us get you the right treatment as quickly as possible?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it's just… I've never been very good with medical procedures. They always make me so… anxious. But you're right, of course. It's best to be thorough. And I do trust your judgment. Alright. Yes. Yes, let's proceed with the CT scan. But… could you perhaps explain the procedure to me in a little more detail? And… what exactly will they be looking for? Knowing what to expect… that would help a great deal. And... if something is found... what then?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Alese. I’m glad you asked. The CT scan is a non-invasive imaging test that uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of your abdomen and pelvis. You'll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. The machine will rotate around you, taking pictures. It's completely painless and usually takes about 15-20 minutes. As for what we’re looking for, we'll be checking for any signs of inflammation or infection in your bowel, any blockages, or any other abnormalities. We'll also be looking at your kidneys and other organs to make sure everything is normal. Specifically, given your Lupus history, we'll be looking to rule out any complications affecting your intestines, like vasculitis or inflammation of the bowel wall. If something is found, it doesn't necessarily mean it's serious. We'll discuss the results with you in detail and determine the best course of action. That could range from medication to further testing or, in rare cases, surgery. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let's focus on getting the scan done and getting a clear picture of what's going on. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Vasculitis… that sounds… unpleasant. Is that common with Lupus? And… what about the radiology technician? Will they be aware of my anxiety? I do tend to… get a bit flustered in medical settings. It would be helpful if they could… be patient with me. And… what should I wear? Should I change into something special? I always worry about getting dressed appropriately for these things. It all feels a bit… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Vasculitis can occur in Lupus, though it's not extremely common. It means inflammation of the blood vessels, and it can affect various organs. We'll be looking for any signs of it on the scan. And absolutely, I will make a note in your chart about your anxiety, and I’ll call ahead to the radiology department to let them know. They are very experienced in dealing with anxious patients and will be patient and understanding. You don't need to change into anything special for the scan. Just wear comfortable clothing, avoiding any metal zippers or jewelry. They’ll likely have you change into a gown, just for the scan itself. I'll also have the nurse come in and review the scan instructions with you before you go down to radiology, and she can answer any other questions you may have. We’ll make sure you feel as comfortable and prepared as possible. For now, let's get the blood work and urine sample ordered. The nurse will be in shortly to collect those. Do you have any other questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. And thank you for being so patient with me. It's… reassuring to know that you're taking my anxieties seriously. I suppose I should just… sit here and wait for the nurse then? And… try not to worry too much? It's easier said than done, of course.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Alese. Just sit back and relax. The nurse will be in shortly. And please, don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns at any time. We’re here to help. I’ll check back in with you after the nurse has collected the samples. In the meantime, try to take a few deep breaths and focus on something relaxing.
