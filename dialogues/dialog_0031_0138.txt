DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Rakosky, is it? Yes, that’s right. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But my daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness, on one side? And my family… we’ve had bad headaches, terrible migraines, for generations. That's what she was worried about, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly alright if things are a little difficult to recall. We’ll take our time. So, you’re experiencing some weakness, primarily on one side of your body, and there’s a family history of migraines. To help me understand a bit better, could you tell me when you first noticed this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when, you say? That’s… tricky. It comes and goes, you see. Not all the time. It feels like… a heaviness, mostly. Like my arm is tired, or my leg feels a bit clumsy. I suppose… within the last few months? Maybe six months? It’s hard to pinpoint. I remember thinking it was just getting old, you know? But my daughter, she insisted I come see someone. She’s a worrier, that one.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for symptoms to develop gradually, and it can be difficult to recall exactly when they started. “Within the last six months” is helpful. And it’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in; it’s always best to check these things out. When this weakness occurs, does anything trigger it, or does it seem to happen randomly?
PATIENT: Randomly, I think. I haven’t noticed anything specific. It doesn’t seem to be after any particular activity, or at a certain time of day. Sometimes I’ll be sitting and reading, and I’ll notice my hand feels a little… strange. Other times, I’ll be walking and my leg just feels… heavy. It’s just… there. It doesn’t last long, usually. Just a few minutes, maybe. Then it goes away. But it worries my daughter, so it worries me, too.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the weakness is intermittent, occurring randomly, and resolves within a few minutes. That’s helpful information. You mentioned a family history of migraines. Have you personally experienced migraines in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Terrible things, migraines. I’ve had them on and off since I was a young woman. Not as bad as my mother, though. She was bedridden for days sometimes. Mine… they come and go. A throbbing pain, usually behind my eyes. Sometimes with nausea, but not always. I used to take something for them… a little pink pill, I think? But I haven't had a really bad one in… oh, goodness, years now. It's the weakness that's new.
DOCTOR: Thank you. It’s good to know about your history of migraines. It sounds like you've managed them well in the past. The fact that the weakness is a new symptom is certainly worth investigating. Now, besides the weakness and the migraine history, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been a little more tired lately, I suppose. But who isn’t, at my age? And sometimes… sometimes my vision gets a little blurry. Just for a moment, though. Like looking through a fog, maybe? It goes away quickly. I also get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast. But I always figured that was just my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased fatigue, occasional blurry vision, and dizziness upon standing. Those are all good things to note. Let's talk about your medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any medications, besides whatever you used to take for your migraines?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take a little white pill for my blood pressure, that’s what the doctor prescribed. And a vitamin D supplement, my daughter makes me take that one. She says I don’t get enough sun. Oh, and something for my cholesterol, a tiny yellow pill. And… that’s it, I think. I used to take something for my arthritis, but the doctor took me off of it a few years ago. Said it wasn't helping.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, you’re taking medication for blood pressure, vitamin D, and cholesterol. And you previously took medication for arthritis. Do you know the names of any of these medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no, not really. I just have my daughter fill the little pill boxes for me each week. I don’t pay much attention to the names. They all look the same! I just know what color they are, mostly. The blood pressure one is blue, I think. And the cholesterol one is yellow, like I said.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Tofani. We can certainly look those up. It looks like you are currently taking Lisinopril for your blood pressure, Vitamin D 2000 IU daily, and Atorvastatin for cholesterol. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or latex?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. No, not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything. And I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to any medicine. My daughter always asks me that, too. She worries so much! I used to get a little itchy when I wore certain wool sweaters, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound like a true allergy. So, no known drug or food allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides the high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and arthritis we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh, years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. That was… a long time ago. And I had a hysterectomy, too. But that was… goodness, I don’t even remember when. Other than that… I used to have terrible heartburn, but that’s gone now. I think it was the coffee. I haven’t had a cup in years. Oh, and I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, falling off my bicycle! But that healed up just fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of gallbladder removal, hysterectomy, and a past broken wrist. You also had heartburn that resolved when you stopped drinking coffee. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a long story. My mother, she had terrible migraines, like I said. She was often bedridden. And my father… he had heart trouble. He died when he was fairly young, I think. My sister, she has diabetes. And my brother… he had some sort of trouble with his lungs. But I don’t remember exactly what. Everyone on both sides seems to have had some sort of ailment or another, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like there's a fair amount of medical history in your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has had a stroke or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now that you mention it… yes. My aunt, on my mother’s side, she had a stroke, I think. She couldn’t speak very well afterwards. And my cousin, he had something with his nerves… he couldn't move his arm for a while. It came back eventually, but it was… frightening. They said it was a pinched nerve, maybe? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tofani. That’s very helpful information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My mother always said smoking was terrible for you. I never even tried it. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit years ago. He said it was too expensive, and it smelled awful.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing much. My husband used to drink a bit more, but he passed away a few years ago. I don't really enjoy it on my own. Maybe once or twice a week, just a small glass.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional small glass of wine. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I usually wake up and have a little breakfast – toast and coffee, usually. Then I do a little housework, maybe some gardening. I like to read, and I watch a little television. I go to church on Sundays. My daughter comes over quite often to help me with things. I try to stay busy, you know? But I get tired easily these days. It's not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tofani. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just be gentle, please. My bones aren't what they used to be!
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, though your breathing is a little shallow. Next, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 135/85, and your pulse is 72. Now, I’d like to check your neurological function. Could you please tell me your name and today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh, my name is Alayne Tofani. And today is… let me think… it’s August the… the second, isn’t it? Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I think.
DOCTOR: Good. And now, can you please squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels a little… stiff, maybe? My left hand doesn't feel quite as strong as my right. It's just a little bit, though. I don't know if that means anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful to know. Now, could you please close your eyes and follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels a little… strange, you know? Like my eyes are getting tired. I hope I'm not doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly fine. Now, I'd like to check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it’s a little wobbly, isn’t it? I feel a little… off balance, you know? I don’t usually walk like this. I think I’m a little shaky today. Maybe I didn’t have enough breakfast.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tofani. Please sit back down. Based on the exam and your history, you're experiencing some weakness on your left side, some difficulty with your balance, and some slowness in your eye movements. The intermittent nature of the weakness, combined with the family history of migraines and the stroke, is concerning. I would like to order some imaging, specifically an MRI of the brain, to rule out any underlying cause for these symptoms. We’ll also want to check some blood work, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and a thyroid panel. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh dear… an MRI? That sounds… serious. Is it going to hurt? And blood work… I don’t like needles. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I trust you. Is it… is it something bad? My daughter will be very worried.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Tofani. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging study; it doesn't involve any radiation, and it doesn't typically cause any pain. You’ll lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it takes some images of your brain. It can be a bit noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. The blood work is just to rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms. It’s a quick procedure, and the discomfort is minimal. We're ordering these tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something bad. There are many possible causes for these symptoms, and we need to rule them out. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, or it could be something more serious. It’s best to be thorough. I will have my nurse schedule both the MRI and the blood work for you. We should have the results within a few days. I will call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe headache, difficulty speaking, weakness on one side of your body, or any changes in vision – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… a lot. Emergency room… that’s frightening. But I understand, Doctor. You’re right, it’s best to be careful. My daughter will be relieved to know you’re taking it seriously. I think… no, I don’t have any other questions right now. Just… please call me as soon as you have the results. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Tofani. I will certainly call you as soon as I have the results. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule the tests and answer any further questions you may have. In the meantime, please try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. And remember, if anything changes or worsens, don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Thank you for coming in today. I’ll be in touch soon.
