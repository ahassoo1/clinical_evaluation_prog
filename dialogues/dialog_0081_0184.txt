DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have all day, you know. It’s… well, it’s about how I look. I used to be a strong man. Pile driver work, see? But things… sag now. Not happy with it. Need fixing. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: “Fixing,” you say. I understand you’re concerned about some… changes in your physique. While I appreciate directness, Mr. Trendler, it’s important to clarify what you mean by “fixing.” Are you experiencing discomfort, weakness, or is this purely a cosmetic concern?
PATIENT: Cosmetic! What else would it be? I ain't broken, doc. Just… old. Everything’s going down. Like a house in a storm. And it looks terrible. I used to fill out a shirt, now… well, you can see. Don't need a lecture on getting old, just want to know if you can do something about it. And quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well. While my expertise lies in internal medicine – the proper functioning of your body’s systems – I can certainly assess the situation. However, purely cosmetic procedures are not within my scope of practice. But, let’s get some details. When did you first notice these changes?
PATIENT: Changes? When didn't I notice? Seems like it's been going on for… oh, I don't know, ten years maybe? Slowly, slowly. But the last year… it's sped up. Like a rock rolling downhill. Used to be a little bit of muscle, now it's just… soft. And hanging. Don't need a history lesson, just tell me if you can tighten things up. Can you, or can't you? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: “Tighten things up,” as you put it, can involve a number of approaches. Before we discuss those – and whether they are appropriate for you – I need to understand your overall health. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, no weight loss. Always been this size, give or take. Maybe a little less strong now, but not thin. I eat good, mostly. Jamaican food, you know? Rice and peas, jerk chicken… good, solid food. It’s not about weight, doc. It’s about… shape. Like a deflated balloon. You understand balloons, right? Not full anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand the analogy, Mr. Trendler. However, a change in body composition, particularly when it’s concerning to you, can sometimes indicate underlying medical issues. Have you noticed any fatigue, weakness, or changes in your appetite, aside from the concern about your… shape?
PATIENT: Look, I told you. I eat good. I’m not weak. I still walk around, I still do things. Maybe not pile driving anymore, but… I’m fine! Tired? Sometimes, everyone gets tired. Old age, you know? I don't need a doctor telling me I'm old. I know I'm old! Just want to know if you can fix the sag. That’s it. Is there something wrong with your ears, doc? I said sag. It's a simple word.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, dismissing potential underlying causes simply because you “know” you are old is not sound medical practice. While I appreciate your directness, I must conduct a proper assessment. Have you had any recent blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work? No! What for? I'm not sick. Just… unhappy with how things are hanging. You think I got time for blood work? I got appointments to keep, things to do. This is ridiculous. You’re a doctor, right? Fix it, or tell me you can’t. Simple as that. I don't need poking and prodding and tests. Just look at it! You can see it! And frankly, I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. However, I cannot ethically provide a treatment without understanding the root cause of the changes you're experiencing. A decline in muscle mass and changes in body composition can be indicative of several conditions, some of which require medical attention. I’m not dismissing your concerns, I'm attempting to practice responsible medicine. Given your… aversion to further investigation, I will document your cosmetic concerns. However, I will not be able to offer a solution at this time. I can, however, provide you with a referral to a plastic surgeon. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Plastic surgeon? Fine. Give me the name. But if they start asking me about blood work, I’m walking out. I just want it fixed. Not a whole song and dance. A name, doc. And quickly. I haven’t got all day. .
DOCTOR: Dr. Anya Sharma. She practices at City Center Aesthetics. She will be able to assess your concerns and discuss potential options. I strongly advise you to be forthcoming with her regarding your medical history, despite your reservations. Good day, Mr. Trendler.
