DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kur. Thank you for seeing me. I’m here regarding the requirements at my workplace… about wearing masks and other protective gear. It’s causing me some difficulty, and I was hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: An exemption, alright. And what specifically is causing you difficulty, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: Well, it's… it's hard to explain. It’s not a discomfort, exactly. More… a feeling. A strong feeling, when I have something tight on my face. It brings back… difficult memories, Doctor. From a long time ago. It makes it hard to concentrate on my work, and honestly, it’s unsettling. It affects my ability to do my job properly, and I want to be good at my job, you see.
DOCTOR: Difficult memories… I see. And when you say “tight on your face,” are we talking about all masks, or specific types?
PATIENT: It seems to be all of them, Doctor. Any kind of covering… even face shields feel… constricting. It’s not the breathing, it’s just… the sensation of being covered. I know it doesn’t make a lot of sense, and I apologize for not being able to explain it better. It’s hard to put into words, this feeling. It’s more… emotional than physical.
DOCTOR: Emotional, alright. And has this always been the case, Mr. Knabenshue, or is this a recent development?
PATIENT: No, it hasn’t always been. I didn’t have any trouble with things like hats or glasses, and for many years didn’t notice anything at all. It started… well, it started about a year ago, when the requirements at work changed. That's when everything began. Before that, I never gave it a thought. It seems directly connected to the masks, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A year ago… coinciding with the workplace changes. And just to clarify, is this feeling accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s the confusing part, I think. There’s no dizziness, no shortness of breath, no panic attacks. Just… this unsettling feeling. A sort of… tightness in my chest, almost, but it's more mental than physical. I can still think clearly, but it makes me… distracted. I lose focus easily, and I worry about making mistakes at work. It's primarily a feeling of being… overwhelmed. I don’t feel sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other physical symptoms. Let's take a look at your medical history. I see here you’ve had a routine physical annually, no major diagnoses noted. Any family history of anxiety or similar emotional responses to… stressful situations?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor, routine check-ups only. As for family history… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she was a very quiet woman. She didn’t talk much about her feelings. She seemed to carry a lot of… sadness, I suppose. Not a diagnosed condition, mind you, just… a personality. And my uncle, her son, he was very sensitive. Easily overwhelmed. But again, no formal diagnoses as far as I know. It wasn’t something we talked about much in my family. Mostly just… things we noticed.
DOCTOR: Alright, some family history of sensitivity and… unexpressed emotions. And have you experienced any significant trauma in your life, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: That’s a… difficult question, Doctor. Many years ago, when I was a young man, there were… hardships. Things happened that were… not easy. It was a different time, a different life. We don’t talk about it much, even within the family. It was a time of change and loss. I've done my best to move past it, to focus on the present. But perhaps… perhaps those things have left some lingering effects. I'm not sure if that's what you’re asking. It wasn’t a single event, if that makes sense, but a series of… challenges. I don’t like to dwell on the past, Doctor. It doesn't help to reopen old wounds.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. You don’t need to go into details if you're not comfortable. It sounds like you’ve experienced some difficult circumstances in the past, and that these may be contributing to your current emotional response. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any other underlying causes. Nothing extensive, just listening to your heart and lungs and checking your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds sensible. Anything to rule things out is fine with me. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and consider everything. It’s… comforting to know someone is trying to understand, rather than just dismissing it as… nonsense. I’m happy to cooperate fully with the exam. I believe I have no objections whatsoever.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat here, and we'll get started. Deep breaths, if you would. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears to be within normal limits.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, Doctor. Even if it doesn’t explain things, it’s good to know I’m not… physically unwell. So, where do we go from here? Is there something else you recommend? Perhaps… a specialist? Or some sort of… counseling? I’m willing to consider anything that might help, if you think it’s appropriate. I’m just… anxious to resolve this situation, before it affects my ability to do my job. It’s important to me, Doctor. Very important.
DOCTOR: Given your history and the unremarkable physical exam, it sounds like this is primarily an emotional response, likely connected to past experiences. While I can't definitively diagnose anything without further evaluation, it is possible this is related to anxiety, or a stress-related condition. A referral to a mental health professional – a therapist or psychologist – would be the most appropriate next step. They could help you explore your past experiences in a safe environment, and develop coping mechanisms to manage your emotional response. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A therapist, you say? I suppose I’ve always been hesitant to… delve into things. But if it might help, I’m willing to try. Can you recommend someone? Perhaps someone familiar with… the experiences of Indigenous people? I’m not sure if that’s important, but it might… help to have someone who understands, if that makes sense. And… what about my work situation in the meantime? Will I be able to… explain this to my employer? Is there any documentation you can provide? I'm worried about losing my job, Doctor. It's… all I have.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I can provide you with a list of therapists in the area, and I’ll make a note to include those with experience working with Indigenous populations. Here you are. Several of these therapists specialize in trauma-informed care. As for your work situation, I can write a brief note stating that you are under my care for a medical condition that may impact your ability to wear certain protective gear. It won’t detail the specifics of your condition – that’s confidential – but it should be sufficient to explain your need for accommodation. However, it's important to understand that the decision regarding accommodation ultimately rests with your employer. Here’s the note. I can also discuss with you potential strategies for communicating with your employer. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: That’s… very kind of you, Doctor. Both the list and the note. I appreciate your understanding and support. It’s a relief to have something concrete, something to show my employer. And yes, if you have any advice on communicating with them, I would be very grateful to hear it. It's… a daunting prospect, to be honest. They’re not always… understanding. They value… efficiency, above all else. So any guidance you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Perhaps… what should I emphasize? What should I avoid saying? I’m just… worried about making things worse.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. When speaking with your employer, focus on your ability to do your job safely and effectively. Emphasize that you are seeking a reasonable accommodation to allow you to continue performing your duties. Explain that you are under my care and actively working to address the underlying condition. Avoid dwelling on the details of your past trauma, as that's both personal and potentially unnecessary. Instead, frame it as a medical condition that is impacting your ability to tolerate certain gear. You can state that you're willing to explore alternative solutions, such as different types of masks or other protective equipment. And importantly, be prepared to provide documentation from me, and potentially from the therapist once you begin treatment. It may also be helpful to research your company's policies on disability accommodation, and your rights as an employee. Do you feel comfortable with that approach?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible and practical. Focus on my ability to work, seek accommodation, and avoid details. I can do that. And I will research the company policies, you’re right. It's always best to be informed. Thank you for your guidance, and for taking the time to listen and understand. It's… a great weight off my shoulders, to have a plan. I'm still anxious, of course, but… less overwhelmed. I truly appreciate your help, Doctor Kur. You’ve been very kind. I believe that’s everything. I’ll schedule an appointment with one of the therapists on the list, as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could help. Remember, it takes courage to seek help, and you’re taking the right steps. If you encounter any difficulties with your employer, or have any further concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. I wish you all the best in your treatment, and in your work. Take care, Mr. Knabenshue. .
