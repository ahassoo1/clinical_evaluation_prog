DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Limtiaco, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Ronnald Limtiaco. Though, honestly, folks just call me Ron. It’s… been a while since I had to fill out paperwork, so I’m a bit fuzzy on the details. I think I need something for… time off? For work. It’s… something about needing a leave, I believe.
DOCTOR: “Time off,” alright. And what exactly are we needing time off for, Ron?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… the tricky part, isn’t it? It’s… well, I’ve been feeling… not quite myself lately. A bit run down, you know? And my wife, bless her heart, she’s been worried. It’s hard to explain. Just… things aren’t working as smoothly as they used to. I mostly do religious work, directing activities and education... but even that’s been difficult. It’s not a specific thing, more… everything. I just need some time to… rest, I suppose. Is that enough to get something for FMLA, or disability? I’m not sure which one applies, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Not quite myself,” right. Vague complaints are… difficult. Let's try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Sorry. It's just... my memory isn't what it used to be. I get tired easily. Much more easily than before. And… sometimes I have trouble focusing. Like, I’ll be talking to someone and… the words just sort of slip away. It's embarrassing, really. And… I feel a bit… disconnected, I guess. Not sad, exactly, just… distant. Does that make any sense? My wife says I've been quieter, too. A lot quieter.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, some memory lapses, and a general sense of… detachment. And how long has this been going on, Ron?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. It feels like… several months, at least. Maybe six? It started gradually, I think. Just little things at first. Forgetting where I put my glasses, things like that. But it's gotten worse over time. Hard to say exactly when it started, to be honest. Time just… kind of blurs together these days. My wife would have a better idea, she keeps track of things. But I'd say, at least six months, maybe longer. Definitely not a recent thing.
DOCTOR: Six months of progressive symptoms… Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight, Ron?
PATIENT: Hmm… I haven’t really been eating much, I don’t think. Not like I used to. My wife makes wonderful food, but… I just don’t have much of an appetite. And I’ve probably lost some weight. I haven't weighed myself in a while, but my clothes feel a bit looser. Not a lot, but noticeable. I’m a tall man, you see… always been lean. But I think I’m a bit leaner now, if that makes sense. I haven’t been trying to lose weight, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Any problems with sleep, Ron?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Sleep. I have trouble staying asleep, mostly. I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and… just lie there. Thinking. Or not thinking, exactly, just… awake. And then it’s hard to get back to sleep. Sometimes I wake up early and can’t get back to sleep then, either. I’m not restless, just… awake. My wife says I toss and turn a bit, but I don’t really notice. I just… don’t sleep as well as I used to. It’s frustrating. Makes me even more tired during the day, of course. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, cognitive difficulties, memory lapses, detachment, weight loss, and sleep disturbance… It's a fairly broad symptom picture, Ron. Now, have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: Hmm... Headaches, not really. I get the occasional one, but nothing major. Like a normal headache, you know? Nothing that requires any medicine or anything. Dizziness… I don't think so. Maybe a little unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I always figured that was just getting old. Vision changes… that’s a tough one. I wear glasses, you see, and I haven't had my eyes checked in a while. So, things might be a little blurry, but I just assumed that was my prescription. I haven’t noticed any significant changes, if that makes sense. Nothing that’s alarming, anyway. I think I’d know if my vision was getting worse, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your medical history, Ron. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a hard question. It’s been a long life, you see. I had high blood pressure for a while, but I’ve been taking medication for that for years. It’s under control, as far as I know. And I had my appendix out when I was young, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… I don’t really recall anything significant. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. My wife keeps track of all my medical stuff, she’s much better at remembering things than I am. I suppose she could tell you more. I don’t want to leave anything out, but… my memory is just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hypertension, managed with medication. And no other significant medical history you recall. Any surgeries, other than the appendectomy?
PATIENT: Let me think... No, I don’t believe so. Appendectomy when I was a young man, that’s the only surgery I’ve ever had. Nothing else. I’m pretty sure of it. My wife would definitely let me know if I had forgotten something like that, you see. She’s very thorough. No, just the appendectomy. I'm quite certain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendectomy only. Now, Ron, any significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family... that’s another tricky one. My parents… they both lived long lives, but I don’t really remember any major health problems. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t recall the specifics. My father… he was a strong man, always healthy. I have a sister, but we haven’t spoken in years. I don’t know anything about her health. Honestly, I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. We weren’t really close, you see. My wife might have some information, she’s always been interested in genealogy. But I’m afraid I can’t be much help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family history known. Now, Ron, are you currently taking any medications other than your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I take the blood pressure pills, of course. And… oh, sometimes I take something for my joints. They get a little achy, you see. Just an over-the-counter thing, though. Not a prescription. Something for inflammation, I think. And… sometimes I take a vitamin. Just a multivitamin, you know? To stay healthy. Other than that… I don’t think so. I try not to take too many pills, if I can avoid it. I really should write these things down, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, over-the-counter joint pain reliever, and a multivitamin. And finally, Ron, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had any allergic reactions. I can eat anything, as far as I know. And I’ve never had a problem with any medications. I’ve always been pretty lucky, in that regard. I might get a little sniffle now and then, but nothing serious. No allergies, as far as I’m aware. No allergies to report. Although… my wife says I'm allergic to housework. But I don't think that’s what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ron. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a baseline. We'll start with your vital signs. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Anything to help, doctor. I haven’t weighed myself in ages, you see. I’m afraid I’ve gotten a bit… softer around the edges. My wife always tells me I'm just fine, but she's biased, of course.
DOCTOR: 111 pounds, Ron. And your height is 188 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: 111? Oh. Well, that’s… lower than I expected. I always thought I was heavier. But if that’s what the scale says… Yes, 188 centimeters is right. Always been a tall man. Though, I suppose I've shrunk a bit with age. 111 pounds… that does seem awfully low, doesn’t it? Perhaps the scale is wrong?
DOCTOR: The scale appears to be accurate. 111 pounds. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Neurological exam is grossly intact. Overall, your physical exam is relatively unremarkable, aside from your low weight. However, given your reported symptoms and low weight, I'm concerned about possible malnutrition and cognitive decline.
PATIENT: Malnutrition? Cognitive decline? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I knew something wasn’t quite right, but… I thought it was just old age. My wife has been worried about my memory, too. She keeps reminding me of things, you see. But I thought it was just a normal part of getting older. What does this mean, doctor? What do we do now? I just want to feel like myself again. And I don’t want to be a burden on my wife.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ron. Given your symptoms and physical exam findings, I recommend we run some blood tests to evaluate your nutritional status, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. We'll also need to perform a cognitive assessment to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. I also want to order a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you increase your caloric intake and try to maintain a regular sleep schedule. I’m also going to refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation. They can perform a more comprehensive cognitive assessment and determine if any further testing is needed. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a CT scan… a neurologist? Oh goodness. That’s… a lot. I… I don’t know what to say. It all sounds very serious. Will these tests hurt? And what if they find something… bad? I’m afraid of what they might find, doctor. My wife… she’ll be very worried. And I don’t want to worry her. I just want to feel better, doctor. Is that too much to ask? Will these tests at least help us figure out what’s wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ron. Let's address your concerns one at a time. The blood tests are minimally invasive; it's just a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. The CT scan is non-invasive as well; you'll lie on a table while a machine takes images of your brain. There's no pain involved. As for finding something "bad," that's always a possibility with any medical testing. However, we're running these tests to rule out potential problems and get a clear understanding of your condition. If we do find something, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a dire situation. Many conditions are treatable, and early detection is key. I understand your concern for your wife, and I assure you I will explain everything to her in a clear and compassionate manner. As for feeling better, that's our ultimate goal. These tests are the first step towards achieving that. I’m also going to recommend a consultation with a registered dietician, as your low weight is concerning. I'll have my nurse draw the blood today and schedule the CT scan and neurology appointment for you. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. It’s just… a lot to take in. A CT scan… a neurologist… a dietician… My wife is going to be busy. But if this is what we need to do to figure things out… then so be it. Thank you, doctor. Thank you for listening and for taking the time to explain everything. I appreciate it more than you know. I just… I hope we can get to the bottom of this soon. I want to feel like myself again. And I want to spend more quality time with my wife. That’s all I want. If you’ll excuse me, I think I need to sit down for a bit. This has been… a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ron. Take your time. My nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'll send the test results to your wife’s email as soon as they’re available. Get some rest, and we’ll talk soon.
