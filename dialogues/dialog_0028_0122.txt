DOCTOR: Right. Venus Alvara, 53 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Memmolo. Thank you for seeing me. It is… difficult to explain, but I am noticing… gaps. In my memory. It is new, and concerning. I have high blood pressure, and I worry if this is… related. I want to be very clear, I remember everything else, dates, names, but… little things. Like what I had for breakfast. Or why I walked into a room.
DOCTOR: Gaps, you say. And you’re concerned about a connection to your blood pressure… Alright. How long have these “gaps” been occurring?
PATIENT: Perhaps… three months, maybe? It started small, forgetting where I put my keys. Now… it is more often. I used to manage many properties, very detailed work. I could recall every clause in a lease agreement! Now… I write everything down constantly. It is… unsettling. Is this normal for someone with high blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Three months… and it’s impacting your ability to manage things… You say you used to manage properties. Are you still doing that currently?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Though… less than before. I have assistants now, helping with the details. I oversee everything, but… I worry about making mistakes. I am still very capable, I assure you. But the memory… it is a distraction. I do not want to rely so heavily on others, but I must be… practical.
DOCTOR: Practical. Right. And aside from the memory issues, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No headaches, not that I have noticed. No dizziness. My vision is… fine. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I attribute that to the stress of… everything. And the weather has been very warm. Is it important if I am… easily upset? My husband passed away two years ago, and sometimes… things just… overwhelm me.
DOCTOR: Easily upset… Grief can certainly manifest in many ways. We need to rule out anything more concerning, of course. Do you have a history of depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: No, never diagnosed. I was… sad, naturally, after my husband. But I am a strong woman, Doctor. I kept working, kept busy. I do not believe this is… sadness. It is… different. Like a fog. I can tell you what is wrong, what needs to be done, but recalling how I came to that conclusion… that is the problem. Is there a test for this? For the… fog?
DOCTOR: A "fog," you say. Yes, there are tests. We'll start with a basic neurological exam, just to get a baseline. Then, likely some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues... the usual things. It's probably nothing serious, but it's best to be thorough. If you'll follow me.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I appreciate your thoroughness. Blood work is fine. I prefer to know what is happening. My mother always said, “Knowledge is power.” Lead the way, Doctor. I am ready when you are. Though, if you do not mind, could you speak clearly? My hearing is not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Of course. Follow me. We'll start with your blood pressure, then a brief physical assessment. I'll ask you to follow some simple instructions. And yes, I will endeavour to be clear.
PATIENT: Thank you. I am… not very nimble these days. High blood pressure does… things to the body, you know. It is good you are checking my pressure. I take my medication regularly, as prescribed, but it does not always feel… sufficient. Perhaps the dosage needs adjustment?
DOCTOR: 148 over 92. A bit elevated, but not unexpected. Do you know what your typical readings are at home?
PATIENT: Usually… around 130 over 80, perhaps. Sometimes a little higher if I am stressed. But it rarely goes above 150. I have a machine, a good one, my son bought it for me. I check it twice a day, as instructed. But, as I said, the numbers are not my concern today. It is the… gaps. The forgetting. Is it possible this high blood pressure is… damaging something?
DOCTOR: Damaging something… prolonged hypertension can lead to vascular changes. We'll need to rule out other causes for your memory issues before we attribute it to that. Look straight ahead. Now, follow my penlight. Don't move your eyes, just follow the light.
PATIENT: I am following it, Doctor. Very steady, yes? I used to be a marksman, very precise aim. My husband… he was a hunter. He taught me. Is this to check… something with my brain? The nerves? It is alright, I do not mind. Just tell me what you are looking for. I prefer to understand everything.
DOCTOR: Assessing pupillary response, tracking eye movements. All appears normal so far. Now, I'm going to ask you to recall three words. I'll say them slowly, then ask you to repeat them back to me in a few minutes. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I am ready. My memory is… normally very good. I can recall dates, names, even the details of contracts I reviewed years ago. Three words, you say? Very well. Please proceed. I will focus intently.
DOCTOR: The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat those three words back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. I have them. Is there anything else? Do I need to spell them? Or perhaps use them in a sentence? I am prepared for a more… detailed test, if you require it. I do not want to… appear incompetent. This is very unsettling, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: No, that will do for now. Now, I'm going to assess your reflexes. Please sit back and relax. I'll gently tap certain points on your body, and you don’t need to do anything.
PATIENT: Very well. Relax… yes, I can relax. My husband… he was a doctor, you know. A general practitioner. He always said a good reflex test was a valuable indicator of overall health. Though, he specialized in… broken bones, mostly. It is good you are being so thorough. Please proceed. I will remain… still.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflex present and symmetrical. Achilles reflex also present. Stand on one leg for a moment… Now, touch your nose with your finger. Coordination appears… adequate. Now, to rule out any underlying issues, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. We’ll also need to schedule an MRI of the brain, just to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: MRI… yes, that sounds… comprehensive. Vitamin B12… I do not believe I have ever had that tested. And the blood count, of course. All very sensible. An MRI… is that to look for… something specific? A blockage? A… shrinking? I understand these things are necessary, but I prefer to be… informed. When will the results be available? And how long will it take to schedule the MRI?
DOCTOR: The MRI is to rule out structural abnormalities. It's standard procedure. It takes about 30 minutes. As for the tests, the blood work should be back in a few days. The MRI scheduling… could take a week or so, depending on availability. I will have my assistant contact you. It's likely nothing serious, but we need to be thorough. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not to my knowledge. A little hay fever in the spring, but nothing significant. My son… he has allergies, quite severe. Peanuts, shellfish… but I have never had a reaction to anything. Just the hay fever, a little sneezing. Is the MRI… painful? Will I need to be sedated? I prefer to avoid sedation if possible. And will the results be explained to me directly, or will I need to schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: No, the MRI is not painful. You'll lie inside a scanner, it's a little noisy. No sedation is usually required. The results will be discussed with you at a follow-up appointment. Scheduling the appointment now… I have you scheduled for next Thursday at 2:00 PM. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Next Thursday… 2:00 PM. That will work. No, I believe that is all for now. Thank you, Doctor Memmolo, for your… thoroughness. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, even if it is… concerning. I will await my son's call regarding the MRI. If I think of anything further, I will contact your office. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day.
