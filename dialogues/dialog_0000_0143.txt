DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Verrall, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Smith Verrall. It's... good to meet you, Doctor... Batara, is it? I think that's what the paper says. Sorry, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Batara, yes. Pinky Batara. And don't apologize. Everyone forgets things. Though, usually it’s important things they forget. Now, you're 66, I see. And… what brings you in today, Mr. Verrall?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… a bit complicated. My daughter, she’s… thinking about having a baby. And she said I should come talk to someone first. Something about… making sure everything is okay before she starts? I don’t really understand all of it, to be honest. It’s called… pre-pregnancy counseling? That’s the words she used.
DOCTOR: Pre-pregnancy counseling. Right. So you are coming in for counseling, not your daughter?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no. It’s… for her baby, yes. But I need to talk to you. She said it could be… things I pass on, maybe? I don’t… I don't know much about genetics or any of that. It was her idea, really. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: So, she’s concerned about potential inherited conditions. Understandable, I suppose. Alright, Mr. Verrall, let’s start with you. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was young, a long time ago. And… I had a bad cough a few years back, but it went away. Nothing major, I don’t think. I try to stay healthy, you know? I used to do a lot of walking. Not so much anymore. Is there something specific you are looking for? I get confused easily when there’s a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removed, cough that resolved. Good to know. And you say you used to walk a lot… any other health problems?
PATIENT: Not that I recall. Maybe… a bit of trouble with my back sometimes? Old age, I guess. And… I get tired easily now. But I think that's just getting older, not a real problem. I’ve never been a big fan of doctors, to be honest. I only go when I really have to. I don't remember any serious illnesses, though. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. Back pain, fatigue… We’ll note those. Now, has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, even aunts and uncles – had any serious health problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that's… difficult. My family… we don't really talk about that kind of thing. My parents are both gone now. And I haven't seen my siblings in… a long time. I think my mother… she had some trouble with her heart when she was older, but I don’t know exactly what. And… I think my uncle, on my father's side, he had something with his… I don’t know, his blood? But I was very young then. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory is just… not good.
DOCTOR: Right. Mother with heart trouble, uncle with a blood condition…vague, but we'll make a note. Now, Mr. Verrall, this is important: do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. I don’t think so. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything, that I remember. I haven’t taken much medicine over the years. A bit of aspirin for headaches sometimes. But no, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Should I be? I don't understand why that matters for... my daughter's baby.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you haven’t had any documented allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Like I said, I don’t take much medicine. Just… maybe some vitamins sometimes, but that’s it. And I forget to take those half the time! I really don’t like taking pills. Is there something… something wrong? Why are you asking all these questions? I'm starting to get a little worried now. Is this about something serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, I’m asking these questions because your daughter is planning a pregnancy. It’s important to gather information about your medical history to assess any potential risks to the baby. Even if you feel healthy, certain conditions can be inherited and impact a child’s health. Now, let’s focus. You said you used to walk a lot, but don’t anymore. What caused you to stop?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Right, the baby. Yes. Well, my knees started to bother me, really. Just… aching, you know? It got worse and worse until it was too painful to walk long distances. I tried some creams, but they didn't really help. Eventually, I just… stopped. I get around the house okay, but… long walks are out of the question. Is that what you wanted to know? Is that a problem for the baby? I'm sorry I'm not more clear, I just get so confused.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knee pain limiting mobility. It's good to know. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, then I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My father smoked, and he always told me it was a terrible habit. I stayed away from it. Never even tried it, not once. My daughter, she doesn’t smoke either. She’s very careful about her health. That’s why she's making me come here, I suppose. Is this all taking a long time? I'm starting to feel a bit tired.
DOCTOR: No smoking, good. And you are feeling tired?
PATIENT: Yes, a bit. Like I said, I get tired easily now. It's just… age, I think. I used to have so much energy. Now… not so much. It's just… a general tiredness, you know? I don’t have any other symptoms, just… worn out. I’m not complaining, mind you. Everyone gets old eventually. But it does make it harder to do things. Is that helpful? I hope I'm not bothering you with all this. I really don’t understand why this is so important for my daughter’s baby.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, and no other symptoms. Mr. Verrall, I understand your frustration. Your daughter is being proactive, and it’s good of you to come in. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological exam. It’s just a routine checkup. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… please be gentle. My knees… they bother me when I move too much. And… is this going to take much longer? I have… a bit of an appointment later this afternoon. It’s just a… social thing, nothing important. But I’d like to be on time.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me. And don't worry, I'll be gentle. We’ll take it slow. First, let's take your blood pressure. Can you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here. Just… let me know if it’s going to hurt. My arm gets a bit sensitive sometimes. It’s probably nothing, just… old age again. I’m really trying to be helpful, Doctor, but my memory is terrible. If I forget something, please just tell me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your arm, and breathe normally. Okay… 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Can you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that okay? I always worry I'm not doing it right. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time, like I said. Is my heartbeat… normal? I sometimes feel a bit… fluttery, but I always thought it was just nerves. I get anxious easily, you know? Especially when I’m at the doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay… heartbeat is regular, but there is a slight murmur. It’s not particularly loud, but we should investigate further. Now, I'm listening to your lungs. Take slow, deep breaths.
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is everything alright? A murmur… that sounds bad, doesn't it? I haven't felt sick, though. Just… tired, like I said. I sometimes cough, but it's just a little cough. Nothing major. My daughter, she'll be so worried if she hears about a murmur. She worries about everything. See? Just a little cough. Is it bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Your lungs are clear, but I did hear a slight wheeze. And you are right, you have a mild cough. Now, can you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that okay? I’m a bit nearsighted, you know. I need glasses to see properly. That’s probably why my eyes are… a little shaky. I haven’t had my eyes checked in a while either. I just keep forgetting. Is everything alright with my eyes? I’m starting to feel a bit anxious again.
DOCTOR: Alright, eye movements are a little slow, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. I'm just going to tap on your knees with this.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tap on my knees? I don’t like that. My knees are very sensitive, you know. Are you sure you need to tap them? I always thought my reflexes were… a bit slow. I’m not very athletic, never have been. I get nervous easily, you know. Is this going to hurt? Please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. I understand your apprehension. We'll be very gentle. I just need to check your reflexes quickly. Okay... reflexes are diminished, but that can be normal with age. Everything seems… within acceptable limits, but given the slight murmur and diminished reflexes, I'd like to order a few tests. We’ll start with a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG. And I want you to have a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. What for? Is something wrong? Is it serious? My daughter, she’ll be so worried if she hears about all these tests. I just wanted to talk to someone about making sure everything was okay for the baby. I didn't want a lot of… tests. Is this going to cost a lot of money? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, please try to remain calm. These tests are routine, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. I’m just being thorough, given the findings during the exam. The murmur could be harmless, and the diminished reflexes are common with age, but I want to rule out any underlying issues. Regarding the cost, I understand your concern about not having insurance. We have a social worker here who can assist you with finding financial assistance programs. We'll do our best to minimize the cost. Now, I want you to schedule these tests as soon as possible. Can you do that?
PATIENT: A social worker? Yes, that… that would be good. Thank you. I don't understand all this medical stuff, you know. And the money… yes, that's a worry. So, tests… as soon as possible. What kind of tests exactly? Where do I go? And will they… will they hurt? My daughter, she's always telling me to be careful. She worries so much. I just want to make sure everything is okay for the baby. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me write down the details for you. First, the Complete Blood Count and Basic Metabolic Panel – you can get those done at the lab just down the street – 123 Main Street. They’ll just need a blood sample. It's a quick procedure, a little pinch, that’s all. Then, the EKG and chest X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street – 456 Oak Avenue. The EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. The X-ray is painless, they just take a picture of your chest. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the appointments for you before you leave. And I’ll have the social worker contact you to discuss financial assistance options. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Stickers? A picture of my chest? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. What if they find something wrong? What if it's… serious? I just wanted to talk, you know? My daughter… she'll be so upset. Is it possible… is it possible to just skip the tests? Maybe everything is okay and we don't need them. I'm just an old man, you know. I don't want to cause my daughter any worry. And… is there anything I should do before the tests? Should I stop taking my vitamins? Should I eat something special? I just don't understand all this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, we’re not trying to alarm you. The tests are simply a precautionary measure, to ensure your health – and the potential health of your future grandchild. Skipping them would be irresponsible. I need to have a complete picture before giving any advice. Regarding preparation, please continue taking your vitamins as usual. You don’t need to eat anything special. For the EKG, avoid caffeine for a few hours beforehand. And please, try not to worry. The vast majority of the time, these tests reveal nothing serious. I’ll have the receptionist schedule these appointments for you, and the social worker will contact you shortly to discuss financial assistance. Now, is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: Financial assistance… yes, that’s good. Okay, no caffeine. And continue my vitamins. And the receptionist will schedule everything… That’s good. Just… just tell me one thing. Is there anything specifically you’re worried about? Are you worried about my heart? Is that why you want the tests? Because I don’t feel sick. I just get tired easily, like I said. And… and my knees bother me. But that’s just old age, isn't it? Please, just tell me if there’s something serious wrong. I need to know. Even if it’s bad news. My daughter deserves to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, I understand your desire for a straightforward answer, but I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without the test results. The slight murmur I detected during the exam warrants further investigation. The diminished reflexes also need to be evaluated. I'm not saying there is something seriously wrong, but I need more information before I can provide any reassurance. I understand this is stressful for you and your daughter, but jumping to conclusions will only cause unnecessary anxiety. Let's get the tests done, then we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. I'll have the receptionist schedule these appointments for you, and the social worker will contact you shortly to discuss financial assistance. Do you have any other questions before I have the receptionist come in?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… just schedule the tests. Tell the receptionist to be gentle. Please. And… and thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. I just want to make sure everything is okay for my daughter’s baby. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will. And please, try to relax. I'm sure everything will be fine. <stage>Calls out: “Nurse, could you please schedule these tests for Mr. Verrall?
