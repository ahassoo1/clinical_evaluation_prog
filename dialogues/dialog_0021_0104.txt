DOCTOR: Alright, Tammie. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Havird, is it? Yes. Look, I don’t have much time, honestly. My throat… it hurts. Been hurting for a bit now. Not sure why it hurts. Just… does. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: “A bit now” isn't terribly helpful, dear. We need some specifics if I’m going to be able to figure out what’s going on. When did it start hurting?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember. A week? Maybe more. It all feels the same these days. Things just… happen. I separate things at the plant all day, you see. Big machines. Important work. It’s not like I have time to keep track of every little ache and pain. Is it necessary to know exactly when?
DOCTOR: Well, yes, it is necessary. The timing can tell us a lot. Was there anything going on around the time it started?
PATIENT: Going on? I… I don’t follow. Like what kind of “going on”? My husband… he passed last year. That was going on. But that was a long time ago. And honestly, I doubt that has anything to do with my throat. Look, I just want something for the pain, alright? I have work to do. Important work. Things don't sort themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Grief can manifest in physical ways, but let's focus on the throat for now. Is it constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I suppose. When I yell at the machines, it hurts more. They don't always cooperate, you see. And… when I swallow. Especially dry things. Like crackers. I had a cracker yesterday, and it felt like… sandpaper. Is that helpful? Now, can we please get on with this? I have a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s have a quick look. Open wide. Say “ahhh.” And please, try to be a little more cooperative. We’re not exactly swimming in time here, are we?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? Honestly, it’s just a throat. It hurts. I’ve had worse. Now, is there anything you can give me? Something strong? I don’t have time for a lecture on hydration.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your throat is a bit red, some mild swelling. Tonsils look normal, no obvious exudate. No enlarged lymph nodes that I can feel. Sounds like pharyngitis, likely viral. Now, I'm not going to give you something "strong" just because you want it. That’s not how medicine works. I’ll write you a prescription for a throat lozenge with benzocaine to help with the pain. And I strongly suggest you drink plenty of fluids.
PATIENT: Lozenges? Really? Is that all? Well, fine. Whatever. Just… write it down. And quickly, please. I'm losing valuable time. Do I need to come back if it doesn't get better? Because I really don't have the time for follow-up appointments. Important things to sort, you know. .
DOCTOR: If it doesn’t improve in a week, or if you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain, then come back. But honestly, I doubt it will come to that. It's probably just a minor irritation. Now, is there anything else?
