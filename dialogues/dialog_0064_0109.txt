DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay to call you Doctor Smetak? My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not so bad at first, but getting worse. Like a… a tight band. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do call me Doctor Smetak. And yes, that makes perfect sense – a tight band sensation. Three days, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Maybe a little longer. Hard to say for sure, you know? Old man, I forget things sometimes. But definitely getting worse the last couple of days. Mostly in the back. Not on the sides, just… back of the head. And sometimes it feels… heavy, like something is weighing it down.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Brum. It’s perfectly normal to have a little trouble with dates as we get older. We’ll take our time. So, the pain is localized to the back of your head, and you’d describe it as a heavy sensation as well?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Back of the head. And heavy… like a rock sitting there. Not a sharp pain, you understand? More… dull. And it doesn't go away completely, even when I rest. I try to lay down, but it’s still there, just… quieter maybe. Does that help? I worked on the rail yard all my life, you know. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. And yes, a history of physical labor is definitely something we should consider. Working on the rail yard… that could certainly be a factor. Now, besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I haven’t been… sick to my stomach. No blurry vision. I have been a little tired, but I’m always a little tired these days. And… maybe a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast. But I thought that was just getting old! I don’t know if that’s important. My wife… she passed last year, and I haven't been sleeping as well since then either. But the headache… that's new.
DOCTOR: I see. So, no nausea or vision changes, some dizziness with standing, and you haven’t been sleeping well since your wife passed. I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Brum. That certainly can disrupt sleep and contribute to many things. The headache being new is important. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any numbness or weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. And no weakness. My arms and legs work fine. I still do a little work around the house, you know? Nothing heavy, but I can still manage. I can walk okay, too. No trouble with that. I just… get tired easier, that’s all. And this headache… it worries me a little bit. It’s just… different than anything I’ve ever had before.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No numbness, weakness, or trouble walking. And you're right to bring it to my attention because it is different than anything you've experienced before. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your reflexes, strength, and a few other things. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. I trust you. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this headache figured out. It’s… unsettling. I’m not used to feeling like this. Go ahead, do what you need to do. I'll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you, Mr. Brum. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. I’ll also do a quick neurological exam to assess your cranial nerves and coordination. Just relax and breathe normally. Alright, everything seems within normal limits so far – good strength in all your extremities, reflexes are intact, and heart and lungs sound clear. Your cranial nerves are also functioning appropriately. However, I did notice some mild tenderness to palpation at the base of your skull. It doesn’t appear to be anything alarming, but it's worth investigating further.
PATIENT: Tenderness… at the back of my skull? That’s where it hurts, you know. That makes sense. So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I worry sometimes, you know. Old man, things start to break down. Is it my bones? Or maybe… something else? I don't want to be a bother, but I’d like to know what you think.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Brum, and you’re not being a bother at all. It’s perfectly natural to worry when you’re experiencing new symptoms. The tenderness at the base of your skull, combined with your headache, could be a number of things. It could be related to muscle tension, perhaps from years of physical labor, or even just stress. However, given your age and the persistent nature of the pain, we need to rule out other possibilities. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a CT scan of your head. It’s a quick and painless imaging test that will allow us to get a better look at your brain and rule out any underlying structural issues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A CT scan… is that… dangerous? I don’t like things going inside my body, you know? I’ve never had one before. And will it… cost a lot of money? I don’t have much insurance these days. My wife… she took care of all that. I don’t want to be a burden. But if you think it’s important… then I guess I can do it. Just tell me what it involves. And how much it might cost.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Brum. It's understandable to be concerned about a test you’ve never had before. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your brain. The amount of radiation is very low, and the risks are minimal. It’s a very common and safe procedure. As for the cost, it can vary depending on where we have it done. Because you don't have insurance, we can look for facilities that offer a discounted rate or financial assistance programs. We have a social worker here at the clinic who can help you explore those options. I’ll have her speak with you after our consultation. The scan itself is painless. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. I strongly recommend the scan to rule out anything serious. It will give us peace of mind, one way or another. What do you think?
PATIENT: Peace of mind… yes, that sounds good. I don’t want to worry anymore. And if it helps… then I guess I’ll do it. A social worker… that would be good, too. I don’t know where to start with all this. Fifteen minutes… I can handle fifteen minutes. Okay, Doctor. Let’s do the scan. And please, tell the social worker to come see me after. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. You’re a good doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Brum. I’m glad to hear that. I’ll go ahead and write the order for the CT scan now. I’ll also have the social worker, Maria Rodriguez, come speak with you after our consultation to discuss financial assistance options. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage your headache while we wait for the scan results. It’s a medication called ibuprofen, which you can purchase over the counter. It's generally safe, but please follow the dosage instructions carefully. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. No, I can take most things. My wife always said I had a strong stomach! I don’t take much medicine these days, but I haven’t had any bad reactions before. Ibuprofen… I think I’ve taken that before. Yes, that’s good. Anything else I need to know? About the scan, or the medicine? I want to be prepared. And thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I’m glad I could help. Regarding the ibuprofen, take two tablets every 6-8 hours as needed for pain, but don’t exceed six tablets in a 24-hour period. It’s best to take it with food to avoid stomach upset. For the CT scan, you don’t need to do anything special beforehand. Just arrive at the radiology department at your scheduled appointment time. They will explain the procedure to you in detail and answer any questions you may have. It is possible they will ask about any metal implants you may have, so if you have any, please let them know. The results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. I will call you as soon as I have them to discuss the findings and next steps. Is there anyone I can contact if I can't reach you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No one to contact. My wife… she was my everything. I live alone now. That's okay, though. I'm used to it. I'll be here, waiting for your call. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours… that seems like a long time. But if that's what it takes… then I'll wait. You’re a good doctor, Doctor Smetak. I appreciate you taking the time with an old man like me. Is there anything I can do? Any questions you have for me? I want to be helpful, too.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Brum, you are being very helpful just by sharing your concerns and providing me with your medical history. I appreciate your openness. Actually, there is one small thing. Have you experienced any recent changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Not really. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but that’s just my old eyes, you know? I need new glasses, I think. But no sudden changes. No double vision. No spots. Just… old man vision. I've been meaning to get them checked for a while now, but I keep putting it off. Is that important, Doctor? Should I get my eyes checked before the scan?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Brum. And no, getting your eyes checked before the scan isn't necessary. Just the usual blurry vision from needing new glasses is fine. Alright, I think we’ve covered everything for now. I’m going to go ahead and finalize the scan order and have Maria come speak with you about financial assistance. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve answered everything. You’ve been very patient with me. I’ll wait for Maria, and then I’ll wait for your call. Thank you again. You’re a good man, Doctor Smetak. A very good man.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the scan results. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns in the meantime. Take care of yourself. .
