DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that's me. Hmm... what brings me in... well, it's… going to the bathroom. It's just… hard now. Not painful, exactly, just… takes a long time, and I don't get it all out, you know? It’s been… a little while now. I forget how long, exactly. My husband, he notices more than I do, probably.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. I understand. Difficulty with bladder emptying can be concerning, and it's good you're addressing it. When you say “a little while now,” could you estimate roughly how long this has been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh dear… estimating… Let me think. It feels like… since the winter, maybe? Or was it spring? I get so mixed up. It’s not new new, that’s for sure. Not just started yesterday. It's just… getting a little worse, maybe? I don't really keep track of those things, you see. My mind… it wanders.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Stoffregen. It's perfectly alright if you're not certain of the exact timeline. “Since the winter, maybe” gives me a good starting point. And it's helpful to know it seems to be gradually worsening. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a typical instance of going to the bathroom for me?
PATIENT: Well… I go when I need to, of course. But it… takes a while to start. I have to… push a little. And then it comes, but it’s not a strong stream, you know? Like a little dribble at first, then a bit stronger, but never really… empty. I have to go back again a little while later. And sometimes… I feel like I still have some left, even after I’ve tried. It’s… frustrating. My husband says I shouldn’t strain, but it’s hard not to, you know? When you really gotta go.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds quite bothersome. The sensation of incomplete emptying and the need to strain are both important details. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this difficulty, such as a feeling of urgency, frequency, or any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Hmm… urgency… sometimes, yes. I get a sudden need, and have to hurry. But that happens sometimes even when I can go easily, you know? So I don’t know if that’s… related. Frequency… probably. I go a few more times a day than I used to, I think. But again… my memory. No pain, though. Not burning, or anything like that. Just… difficult. And a little bit… embarrassing. It’s not a nice thing to talk about, is it?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. These concerns are very common, and you've done the right thing by bringing them to my attention. It is not embarrassing at all to discuss these things; it’s important for me to understand what’s going on to provide the best care. Now, let's move on to some other important questions. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical conditions… Let me think. My husband always takes me to the doctor, you see. He remembers all those things. I think I have… something with my blood pressure? He says I have to take pills for it, every morning. And… oh! My knees! They bother me something awful, especially when it rains. I go to physical therapy sometimes for those. But other than that… I don't really know. I just take what the doctor tells me to take, you know? I don’t pay much attention to the names of things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. That’s helpful information. High blood pressure and knee problems are important to know. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… no, I don't. It's a little white pill. I take it with my breakfast. My husband… he keeps track of all that. He fills the little pill box every week. I just… take them. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. My mind… it’s just not what it used to be, you know? I used to be so good with names and dates… now, everything just… blurs together.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Don't apologize at all. It’s common for memory to change with age, and you're doing the best you can. We can certainly access your medication list through your electronic health record. Okay, I see here you're taking Lisinopril for your blood pressure. And are you currently taking any other medications, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril, is it? That sounds right… My husband always makes sure I have enough. Let me think… supplements… No, I don’t think so. I take a little something for my knees sometimes, when they’re really bothering me… some kind of cream, you rub on. And I take Tylenol sometimes, for aches and pains. But that's about it, I think. Nothing special. Just the usual old lady stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. That gives me a good starting point. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My husband always asks me before I try something new, just in case. He’s very careful. I used to get a little itchy sometimes when I was a girl, but that was probably just the flowers, you know? I’ve never had anything serious, like trouble breathing or swelling up. No allergies, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh dear… hospitals… Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. And… oh! When I broke my wrist, many years ago. I fell off a ladder, trying to get mangoes. But other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty healthy, you know? I’ve never had to spend much time in the hospital. Just the usual little things, like the flu sometimes. Nothing serious. My husband would remember if I had any big surgeries, I think. He keeps track of all those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. That's good to know. Now, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That’s a hard one, Doctor. My mother… she had trouble with her heart, I think. And my father… he had something with his sugar, maybe? Diabetes, is that what it’s called? He had to watch what he ate. And… oh! My sister… she had trouble with her kidneys, a long time ago. But other than that… I don’t really know. We didn’t talk much about those things when I was growing up. It wasn’t something we shared, you know? Everyone just… kept to themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, to get a better understanding of the situation, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… It's pretty quiet, Doctor. I mostly stay home. My husband and I, we watch television, mostly. And I do a little bit of gardening, when the weather is nice. I used to be very active, you know? I loved to dance, and I went to church every Sunday. But now… I get tired easily, and my knees bother me. I don’t go out much anymore. I eat pretty well, I think. My husband does most of the cooking. He makes sure I get my vegetables. And I drink plenty of water. It's a simple life, Doctor. But it’s a good life.
DOCTOR: That sounds very peaceful, Ms. Stoffregen. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! Not me! Never have, never will. My husband, he used to have a little beer sometimes, when we went out dancing. But he stopped years ago. He said it wasn’t good for his health. No, Doctor, I don't smoke, drink, or take any of those… recreational things. I just like my tea, and a good television show.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen, thank you for answering all those questions so thoroughly. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes. I'll also need to perform a digital rectal exam to evaluate your prostate and assess the tone of your rectal muscles, as this can provide valuable information about your bladder function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical examination? Yes, that’s alright. I trust you, Doctor. Listening to my heart and lungs… that’s fine. Checking my abdomen… okay. But… a digital rectal exam? Oh dear. Is that… absolutely necessary, Doctor? It sounds… uncomfortable. I don’t want to be a bother, but… is there any other way?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s a very personal examination, and it’s perfectly natural to feel uncomfortable. However, a digital rectal exam is an important part of evaluating your symptoms. It allows me to assess the size and shape of your prostate, which can sometimes contribute to urinary difficulties, as well as evaluate the tone of the muscles in your rectum, which affects bladder control. It also allows me to check for any abnormalities. I assure you, I will perform the examination with the utmost care and sensitivity. It will be as quick and comfortable as possible. We can also stop at any time if you are uncomfortable. If you prefer, we can discuss alternative imaging tests, such as an ultrasound, but those tests may not provide the same level of detail. Ultimately, the goal is to determine the cause of your symptoms so we can develop the best treatment plan for you. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That sounds… very thorough, Doctor. And I trust your judgment, I do. It’s just… a little embarrassing, you know? I haven’t had one of those… ever. If it's really necessary… then alright. But please… be gentle. And quick, if you can. I don’t want to be a bother, but… I just don’t like the idea of it, you know? Perhaps… you can explain the procedure, just so I know what to expect? And if it becomes too uncomfortable, I can just… tell you to stop?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. I completely understand your apprehension. I will explain everything step-by-step, and we can stop at any point if you feel uncomfortable. During the exam, you'll lie on your side with your knees bent. I will apply a small amount of lubricant to a gloved, lubricated finger and gently insert it into your rectum. I’ll be feeling for the size, shape, and texture of your prostate, as well as checking the tone of the muscles surrounding your rectum. It may cause a brief feeling of pressure or discomfort, but it shouldn’t be painful. The exam usually takes less than a minute. I will communicate with you throughout the procedure and let you know what I’m doing. If you experience any significant pain or discomfort, please let me know immediately, and we can stop. Before we proceed, is there anything else I can do to make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… a little less frightening, hearing it explained like that. Less sudden, you know? Perhaps… just a moment to… prepare myself? And… could you tell me what you’re looking for specifically? If you find something… will you tell me right away? I don’t want any surprises, you know? Just… tell me what you’re looking for, and what it means, if you find anything. And please… be gentle. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. Take all the time you need to prepare. What I'm primarily looking for is the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. A normal prostate is about the size of a walnut and should feel smooth and firm. An enlarged prostate can sometimes cause urinary symptoms by pressing on the urethra. I’ll also be assessing the tone of the muscles surrounding your rectum, which are important for bladder control. I’ll be checking for any tenderness or irregularities as well. If I find anything unusual, such as an enlarged prostate, tenderness, or irregularities, I will explain my findings to you immediately. We may need to order further tests, such as a urine analysis or a prostate-specific antigen blood test, to get a more definitive diagnosis. We will discuss all of your options and develop a treatment plan that is right for you. I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible throughout the procedure. I will communicate with you every step of the way, and we can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Are you ready to proceed, or would you like a few more moments?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you’re sure it’s necessary… then let’s get it over with. But please… be gentle. And tell me what you’re doing, as you go. I don’t want to be surprised. Just… tell me what you’re doing, and what you’re looking for. And if it becomes too uncomfortable… I’ll tell you to stop. Let’s just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m going to position you on your left side with your knees bent. This will help relax your muscles and make the examination more comfortable. I’ll drape you with a sheet to maintain your privacy. Now, I’m going to apply a small amount of lubricant to a gloved finger. This will help it slide in easily. I’ll gently insert it into your rectum about an inch or two. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I'm now gently inserting my finger. Just breathe normally, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. I’m assessing the size and shape of your prostate gland now. It feels… slightly enlarged, but not significantly. The texture is… a little bit firm, but not hard. I’m checking the muscles surrounding your rectum now. They feel… a little bit weak. Is everything alright so far, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: It's… uncomfortable, yes. Not painful, exactly, but… awkward. And… a little bit cold. Slightly enlarged… and weak muscles… is that… bad? What does that mean? Is it something serious, Doctor? Just tell me… is it something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Stoffregen. You’re doing very well. It’s perfectly normal to feel some discomfort during the exam, and it’s good that you’re letting me know. A slightly enlarged prostate is quite common as men age. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it can sometimes cause urinary symptoms by pressing on the urethra. Weak muscles surrounding the rectum can contribute to difficulty with bladder control, but this can often be improved with exercises. At this point, it’s too early to say definitively what’s causing your symptoms. We’ll need to order some further tests to get a more complete picture. I recommend a urine analysis to check for infection, and a prostate-specific antigen blood test to assess the size and health of your prostate. Would you like me to order those tests for you today?
PATIENT: Oh… tests… yes, please. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. Tests… to find out what’s wrong. Yes, please order them. Is the blood test… painful? I don't like needles, you know. And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know… what’s wrong. And what we can do about it. Just tell me… what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll order the urine analysis and the PSA blood test for you right away. The urine analysis is quick and painless—you'll simply provide a sample in a cup. The blood test will involve a small needle prick in your arm, but it’s usually over very quickly. The nurse will draw the blood, and you may feel a brief stinging sensation. The results typically take a few days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll review them with you and discuss your options. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help manage your symptoms. Try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. And try to urinate when you feel the urge, rather than holding it in. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. No caffeine… and no alcohol… alright. And… urinate when I feel the urge. That makes sense. Just… wait for the results. And… then we’ll see. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, we’ll do everything we can to help you feel better. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, please feel free to rest and relax. If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to let me know. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… no, that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Just… thank you. I think… I just need to rest now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Please take your time. The nurse will be along shortly. If you need anything at all, don't hesitate to use the call button. Thank you for coming in today.
