DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Helaina. Honestly? It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but my daughter, Layla, she… she suggested I come in. Something about preventing HIV. She's very informed, bless her. I don’t really know much about it myself, but she was worried, and… well, here I am. Is this the right place for that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Helaina, you are absolutely in the right place. We provide comprehensive preventative care, and that includes discussing HIV prevention. It’s very wise of you to come in and get informed, and it’s excellent that Layla encouraged you to do so. There’s absolutely no shame in wanting to protect your health. To best understand your situation and provide the most appropriate information, could you tell me a bit more about why Layla is concerned?
PATIENT: Well, she said it’s gotten easier to protect yourself, with a little pill you take. She kept saying “PrEP” – is that what it’s called? – and that it’s for people who are… at risk. I'm single, Doctor, and it’s been a while since I’ve… well, you understand. I haven’t been with anyone regularly in years, but I did meet someone recently. A very nice man. And Layla just… she got very insistent that I talk to someone about this, just in case. She’s a worrier, that one. A good daughter, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is exactly what Layla was referring to. It’s a medication taken daily to prevent HIV acquisition. It’s a very effective method of protection, and it’s becoming increasingly common, and frankly, a very sensible preventative measure. It sounds like Layla is very thoughtful to have brought this to your attention, particularly given you’ve recently met someone. To determine if PrEP is right for you, and to ensure it’s safe, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your medical history and your current situation. First, could you tell me about any pre-existing medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I have a little bit of high blood pressure, controlled with medication, thankfully. And arthritis in my knees, which is just a nuisance, really. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think! I see my regular doctor every six months for check-ups, and everything is usually fine. I had pneumonia a few years back, but that was a one-time thing. Does that matter? Oh, and I have Medicare, if that’s important. Is there anything specific you need to know? I'm a bit of an open book, if you need details.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Helaina, that’s very helpful. Knowing about the high blood pressure and arthritis is important, and the pneumonia is good to have on record as well. Your Medicare coverage is also noted. Now, could you tell me what medications you are currently taking, including the dosage if you know it?
PATIENT: Let’s see… for the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, I think it’s 20 milligrams, once a day. And for the arthritis, it’s Ibuprofen, usually 600 milligrams, whenever I need it – not every day, just when my knees are acting up. Sometimes I take Tylenol too, if the Ibuprofen isn't enough. And that’s it, really. Just those three. I'm pretty good about taking my Lisinopril, it’s the one thing I don't forget. Do you need the names spelled out? I can grab the bottles if that helps.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly fine, Helaina. Lisinopril and Ibuprofen are common medications, and your recollection is very accurate. It's good you're consistent with the Lisinopril. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your sexual history, if you don’t mind. This is a confidential space, and your answers will remain private. We need to understand your level of risk to determine if PrEP is the appropriate course of action. Have you had any recent sexual encounters?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That's… a bit personal, isn't it? Well, yes. I met a man a few weeks ago. We’ve… been seeing each other. It hasn't been many times, maybe three or four. It's early days, still. We… use protection, usually. But Layla made me worry, and I suppose it's better to be safe. He’s… a lovely man, but I don't know much about his history. We haven't really discussed it, if I'm honest. Does that make sense? I feel a little foolish admitting all this.
DOCTOR: It doesn't at all, Helaina. It's perfectly reasonable to have those concerns, and you're doing the right thing by discussing this with me. It’s very common for people to not discuss sexual history openly, especially early in a relationship. The fact that you’re proactively thinking about protection is excellent. To clarify, when you say "protection," what methods have you been using?
PATIENT: Well… condoms. We've been using condoms each time. I always insist on them. But Layla said condoms aren’t… foolproof. And she kept mentioning things about testing… for everything. I hadn’t really thought about it, to be honest. I just assumed if we used a condom, we were safe enough. She made me feel like I was being naive, and… well, here I am, worrying about everything. It’s all a bit overwhelming, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're not being naive at all, Helaina. Layla is right to be cautious, and she's demonstrating a good understanding of risk reduction. Condoms are highly effective, but as she mentioned, they aren't foolproof. There's always a small risk of breakage or improper use. To give you the most accurate advice, I'd like to order some routine blood work, including an HIV test, to establish your baseline status. We will also check your kidney function, as that's important before starting PrEP, and screen for other sexually transmitted infections. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that's what you recommend. I’d rather be thorough, especially if I’m going to be… starting medication. And testing for everything else makes sense too, I suppose. I trust your judgement. Is it a lot of blood? I don’t usually do well with needles.
DOCTOR: It's a standard amount of blood, Helaina, typically just a few vials. We'll draw it from your arm. I understand your concern about needles, and we can take things slowly and ensure you're as comfortable as possible. The phlebotomist is very experienced and will do their best to minimize any discomfort. Excellent. I’ll write the order for the blood work now. It can be drawn here in the clinic, and it usually takes about 10-15 minutes. We’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Would tomorrow morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning would be fine, Doctor. As long as it doesn’t clash with my usual appointment with Dr. Ramirez. Let me see… I think I’m free after 10 am. And thank you for being so patient with me. My daughter, she's a very sensible girl, but I'm not used to talking about all this. It's… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. We have an opening at 10:30 am tomorrow. That should allow enough time for Dr. Ramirez's appointment as well. And you're very welcome. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when discussing these topics, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have, no matter how small. I'll get the lab order printed for you now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and explain the process. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm alright for now, Doctor. Just… relieved to be getting this sorted. Thank you again. And please, tell the nurse I’m a bit… nervous about needles. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Helaina. I will make a note of that for the nurse. She’s very gentle and understanding. Alright, then. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly. Please don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any concerns at all. We're here to help. .
PATIENT: .
