DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back… it’s been hurting. Lower part, mostly. It's not a new thing, you understand. Been going on a while now. Feels… weak, kind of. Like it might just… give out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Lower back pain that's been going on for a while, and you're describing a feeling of weakness. That is concerning. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about when the pain started?
PATIENT: Hmm, when it started… that's a tricky one. It didn’t just start one day, you see. It was more… slow. Years ago, maybe? A little ache here, a little ache there. I didn't pay much mind to it then. But it's gotten worse, definitely worse this last year. I think so, anyway. Time gets away from you, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It absolutely does, Mr. Vankampen. It's very common for things to develop gradually. So, over the last year, it's become more noticeable and bothersome. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well… it's not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a dull ache. Sometimes it feels like a… burning. And when I try to stand up straight, it feels like something is pulling. Like a muscle, maybe, but deep down. It’s worst when I've been sitting for a long time. Or if I bend over to pick something up. Oh, and sometimes it goes down my legs a little bit. Not all the way, just… a tingle.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with burning sensations, pulling feeling, worsened by sitting and bending, and tingling down your legs. That gives me a better picture. When you say tingling down your legs, can you tell me exactly where you feel that tingling?
PATIENT: Mostly in my… thighs. The front of my thighs, you understand? Not my calves, not my feet. Just… the big muscles in the front. And it’s not constant. Comes and goes. Sometimes I don’t feel it at all for a whole day, then it’ll bother me for a few hours. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… a little feeling. Not a bad pain, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Vankampen, you're explaining it very well. Tingling in the front of your thighs that comes and goes. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, lying down helps. Definitely. Takes the pressure off, you see. And… warm baths. A nice, warm bath. Makes everything feel a little looser. But it doesn’t last long, of course. As soon as I get up and start moving around, it comes back. I haven't found anything that really makes it go away, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down and warm baths provide some relief. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh boy. Where to start? I got high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I try to watch my salt, but… sometimes it’s hard. And my bones… they aren't what they used to be. The doctor said something about… osteoporosis? Is that right? He gave me some pills for it a long time ago, but I stopped taking them. Too many pills, you know? And I had my prostate looked at a few times. Nothing major, just… old man stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and you've had some prostate evaluations. Thank you for sharing that. Are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not right now. Like I said, I stopped taking the pills for my bones. And I try to avoid taking anything if I can, you know? I take a little aspirin now and then, if my head hurts, but that’s about it. I don’t like being on medication. It just makes me feel… worse, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just aspirin occasionally for headaches. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think... Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long, long time ago. And… I had a hernia operation years later. That's about it, I think. Nothing major in recent times. It was a long time ago, you understand. My memory isn't what it used to be, but I think that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy and hernia repair. Good to know. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Where to start with family… My father, he had problems with his heart. Passed away when he was fairly young, I think. My mother, she lived a long life, but she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. My sister, she had diabetes. And my brother… well, he just didn’t take care of himself, poor fella. Didn’t live long either. Not a very healthy bunch, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Vankampen. A family history of heart problems, arthritis, and diabetes. Finally, before we move on to an exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... Well, I'm retired now, of course. Used to be a fundraiser, traveling around, asking for donations. Good work, I liked it. Now, I mostly stay at home. I like to read, watch the news. Don't get out much anymore. I walk a little, if the weather is nice, but not much. And… I used to smoke, a long time ago. Stopped years ago, thank goodness. Best thing I ever did, that.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, enjoy reading and watching the news, some walking when the weather permits, and a history of smoking, but you've quit now. That's good to hear. Alright, Mr. Vankampen, thank you for providing all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I'm going to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of what's going on with your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Go right ahead. I’m ready when you are. I hope you find something out. It's been bothering me for a long time now, you understand.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Mr. Vankampen, I'm going to start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll take a look at your back and assess your range of motion. I’ll also be checking your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Please let me know if anything is painful during the exam. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150 over 90. And your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, could you please lie face down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That’s fine. A little high, you say? I try to watch my salt, but it’s hard sometimes. Oh… careful now. My back… it’s a bit tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vankampen, I'm gently feeling along your spine now. Can you tell me if any particular spot is especially painful?
PATIENT: Yes, right there. Right in the middle of the lower part. It’s been hurting for a while now. And… it feels kind of… tight. Like a knot. Oh, and… if you press there, it shoots a little pain down my leg. Not bad, just… a little tingle.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some definite muscle spasm and tenderness in that area. The pain radiating down your leg when I press on that spot is consistent with possible nerve irritation. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. Can you gently bend forward, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… That's about as far as I can go, Doctor. It hurts. It's a dull ache, but… it’s definitely there. Feels like something is… pulling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion, with pain on forward bending. Now, can you gently bend backwards, as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: That’s it, Doctor. That's about all I can do. It's not as bad as bending forward, but… it's still uncomfortable. Feels like something is… stuck. And it's a bit tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion with discomfort on backward bending as well. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs. Please keep your legs straight. Your reflexes are present and equal on both sides, which is good. Now, I’m going to do a quick sensory exam. Can you tell me if you can feel light touch on the top of your feet and the soles of your feet?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can feel it. Yes, on both feet. A little numb sometimes, but… I can feel it when you touch me. A little sharper on my right foot, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly diminished sensation in your right foot. Alright, Mr. Vankampen, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems to indicate some degree of lower back strain with possible nerve irritation on the right side, which could be causing the pain radiating down your leg and the tingling sensation. The diminished sensation in your right foot also warrants further investigation. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh boy. That sounds… serious, Doctor. Nerve irritation? What does that mean? Is it something I did? And… what can we do about it? Will I need surgery?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable to be concerned, Mr. Vankampen. Let's break it down. "Nerve irritation" simply means that a nerve in your lower back is being compressed or inflamed. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, and it's very common. It's often caused by muscle strain, poor posture, or even just the natural aging process. As for whether you did something specific, it's often difficult to pinpoint one cause. It could be a gradual process over time. As for surgery, that's certainly not the first step. In fact, most cases of lower back pain don't require surgery. We'll start with more conservative treatments. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any structural issues. I'd also like to consider an MRI, but let's start with the X-ray. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… alright, yes. That sounds… reasonable. Better than surgery, anyway. MRI sounds… scary. What will the X-ray show? And how long will it take to get the results? And… will it hurt? I don't like being poked and prodded, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The X-ray is a relatively simple procedure. It uses a small amount of radiation to create an image of the bones in your lower back. It can help us identify things like fractures, arthritis, or other structural abnormalities. It doesn't show the soft tissues, like muscles or nerves, which is why we might consider an MRI later if needed. It shouldn't hurt at all. You'll simply lie on a table while a technician takes a few images. They might ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds at a time. The results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours. Once I have the results, we can discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and applying heat or ice to your back. I also want to refer you to physical therapy. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles and improve your posture. Would you be interested in a referral?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… alright, yes. I suppose that’s a good idea. Strengthening my back… makes sense. Ibuprofen… I can try that. I’ve used it before. Not a big fan, makes my stomach a little upset, but… I can try. So… X-ray, then physical therapy, and ibuprofen. And then we see what the doctor says? That sounds… manageable. What about the MRI? Do I have to do that?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. X-ray, then physical therapy, and ibuprofen to start. We’ll reassess after we get the results of the X-ray. As for the MRI, you don’t have to do it right away. It's a more detailed scan, and we would only consider it if the X-ray doesn't give us enough information, or if your symptoms don't improve with conservative treatment. It can show soft tissues like nerves, discs, and muscles, which the X-ray can't. It's a little more involved than the X-ray—you’ll lie in a tunnel for about 30-45 minutes—and it's a bit louder, so some people find it uncomfortable. For now, let’s focus on the X-ray and physical therapy. I'll write you a prescription for the X-ray and a referral to a physical therapist. The receptionist will help you schedule the X-ray and your first appointment with the physical therapist. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Vankampen?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. It’s still a little worrying, of course, but… I feel better knowing there’s a plan. Thank you. And… thank you for not suggesting surgery right away.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I understand your concerns, and I'm glad I could alleviate some of them. My goal is always to provide the most conservative treatment possible. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before your appointments. Here are your prescriptions and referral. The receptionist is ready to assist you with scheduling. It was a pleasure meeting you today, and I wish you all the best in your recovery. .
