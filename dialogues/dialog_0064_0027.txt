DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get this over with. It’s this… burning. Keeps happening, especially after I eat. Food just… comes back up sometimes. It’s unpleasant, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to rush, Mr. Altine. We’ll get to the bottom of this. This burning sensation… can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's in my chest, obviously. Starts after a meal. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Though, I suppose heavier things… make it worse. It feels like… fire, going up my throat. And sometimes, the food just… reverses course. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be… disturbing. I eat a good, proper meal, you know? Not this… rubbish people eat these days. And this happens. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s a burning sensation in your chest, after meals, regardless of what you eat, and sometimes you experience some food coming back up. You mentioned it’s more pronounced after heavier meals… Is this something that’s been happening for a long time, or is it fairly recent?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been going on for… well, months now. Probably six, maybe eight. I just figured it was something I ate. You know, getting older. Things don’t work the same way. I didn’t think much of it until it started happening more often. My wife, she keeps telling me to come see someone. Women… always worrying about nothing. But it is getting a bit… bothersome, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. Six to eight months… and it’s been gradually worsening. It’s good you’re here now, Mr. Altine. Sometimes these things can be easily addressed, and sometimes it’s best to rule things out. Now, besides the burning and the occasional food coming up, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. Well, I do get a bit of… bloating. After I eat, my stomach feels… full. And sometimes, I get a bit of a cough. Not a bad cough, just… a tickle in my throat. And, now that I think about it, I belch a lot. More than I used to, anyway. Not exactly pleasant company, I’ll tell you that much. Other than that… no. I’m a pretty healthy guy, you know? Always have been. I don’t understand why this is happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, bloating, a tickle in your throat leading to a cough, and increased belching. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Altine. It helps me get a clearer picture. Now, just to be thorough, have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. Not at all. If anything, I’m carrying a bit too much weight. My wife’s always on me about it. I like a good meal, like I said. And I don’t believe in these… fad diets. It’s all nonsense. No, no weight loss. Quite the opposite, probably. I'm a solid fellow. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Mr. Altine. No weight loss is helpful. Now, have you ever had any issues with difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No. I eat a good, hearty meal just fine. I wouldn't be able to enjoy my food if I had trouble swallowing, now would I? It goes down perfectly well, thank you very much. Honestly, doctor, I'm not sure why I'm even here. It's a bit of heartburn, a bit of regurgitation, and my wife fretting. That's it. It’s not like I’m dying or anything.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It's good to know you aren't experiencing difficulty swallowing. Just to cover all bases, have you noticed any pain when you swallow, or perhaps any blood in your vomit or stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Absolutely not! I would know if I was bleeding. And no pain, no. It’s just… uncomfortable. Annoying, more like it. Look, I’m a practical man, doctor. I don’t need a lot of fuss. If it’s not life-threatening, can we just get this sorted? I have things to do. I haven't got all day to sit here answering questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. No blood, no pain. Thank you for clarifying. Now, just a few more questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No. Nothing. Always been as healthy as a horse, like I said. Good genes, I suppose. And a sensible lifestyle. I don't smoke, don't drink excessively, and I eat a proper diet. Well, apart from the occasional indulgence. But nothing serious. Never been to the hospital for anything… substantial. A broken arm when I was a boy, but that was it. Look, are we getting anywhere with this or not?
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical history. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgery?
PATIENT: Surgery? No. Never. I keep myself in good condition. Why would I need surgery? Waste of time, waste of money. I avoid doctors as much as possible, to be honest. They always want to poke and prod and… well, you know. No surgery. Not ever.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely not! I don’t take pills! I don't believe in all that nonsense. I’ve got a strong constitution. A bit of discomfort is part of life. Why would I poison my body with all those chemicals? No medications. Never have, never will.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing. I can eat anything, do anything. I'm a robust man. Dust maybe, like everyone else, but nothing serious. No food allergies, no drug allergies, nothing. Honestly, doctor, I think I’ve answered enough questions. Can we please get to the bottom of this now? What's causing this burning and regurgitation? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Thank you for providing all of this information. Based on what you've told me – the burning sensation after meals, occasional regurgitation, no weight loss, no difficulties swallowing, and no significant medical history – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Essentially, it means that stomach acid is flowing back up into your esophagus, causing the burning sensation and regurgitation. It's quite common, especially as we get older. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: GERD? Acid reflux? Is it… serious? And a physical exam? Look, I haven't got time for all of this poking and prodding. I told you, I’m a healthy man. I’m sure it’s nothing. Can’t you just give me something for the heartburn? Some pills or something? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Altine. GERD isn't typically life-threatening, but it can be quite uncomfortable and, if left untreated for a long time, can sometimes lead to complications. That's why it's best to address it. The physical exam is just a quick check – listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen – it will only take a few moments. It helps me rule out other possibilities, and ensures I'm making the best possible assessment. If you’re really pressed for time, we can certainly discuss medication options. However, I strongly recommend a quick examination first. It’s just a precaution. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, just get it over with. But quickly. I have a schedule to keep, you know. And if it doesn't take long. Don't go poking around unnecessarily. And I expect a quick answer. What am I supposed to do about this heartburn?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I assure you, it will be quick and thorough. If you could just lie down on the examination table, please. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then gently feel your abdomen. Take a few deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Get on with it then. The quicker the better. Don’t poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little. There. Not sharp pain, just… discomfort. Like a fullness. It's been like that for a while now. Don't press so hard, doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the upper abdomen. No masses felt. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it does seem like GERD is the most likely cause. The tenderness you feel could be due to some inflammation from the acid reflux. I'm going to recommend a trial of a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, to reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces. It’s a common medication. I'll also recommend some lifestyle modifications: avoid eating large meals, especially before bed, elevate the head of your bed, and avoid foods that trigger your symptoms, such as spicy or fatty foods, caffeine and alcohol. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: PPI… so pills then. Fine. I suppose. If it gets rid of this burning, then so be it. Lifestyle modifications? I already eat a sensible diet, as I told you. And don't tell me to avoid large meals, I like a good meal! But alright, I'll try it. How long will it take to work? And what are the side effects? I don’t want to be feeling worse than I already am.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. PPIs are generally very effective. You should start to feel some improvement within a week or two, but it can sometimes take up to four weeks to reach full effect. As for side effects, they are generally mild. Some people experience nausea, diarrhea, or constipation, but these are usually temporary. Less common side effects include headache or abdominal pain. If you experience any severe or persistent side effects, please let me know immediately. I'm going to prescribe you Omeprazole, 20mg, once daily, in the morning, before breakfast. I'll also give you a handout with more information on GERD and lifestyle modifications. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Omeprazole… alright. And the handout… fine. Look, I think that’s enough for today. I really need to get going. I have things to do, you know. Can I get the prescription filled at the pharmacy down the street? And is there anything else I need to know? I’d like to be done with this now.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can definitely get it filled at the pharmacy down the street. I’m sending the prescription there electronically now. It should be ready within the hour. And no, there isn't anything else at this time. Just follow the instructions on the handout, take the medication as prescribed, and let me know if you don’t see improvement after a few weeks, or if you experience any concerning side effects. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in six weeks to check on your progress. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Six weeks… alright. As long as it doesn’t interfere with anything I have planned. I suppose that’s acceptable. Look, thank you, doctor. I really appreciate you getting this sorted. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Altine. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
