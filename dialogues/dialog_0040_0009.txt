DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Good to meet you, I suppose. Now, you're 52… right. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Osga, it’s… my eyesight. It's been going. Not suddenly, mind you, but… diminishing. I suppose that’s the polite way to put it. It’s becoming rather inconvenient, frankly.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes… well, lots of things are. How long has this “diminishing” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. It’s not like a broken arm, you see. More gradual. Perhaps… the last couple of years? Maybe longer. I don't really keep track of these things. It wasn’t alarming at first, just… noticing things weren’t as crisp. Now it’s… well, now I have to practically hold a newspaper an arm's length away to read it.
DOCTOR: A couple of years, you say. And it's… progressed to needing to hold things close. Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. No pain, thankfully. Not particularly blurry, just… faint. Colors seem a little… washed out, maybe? Though that could just be the lighting in my apartment. It’s dreadful. I haven’t noticed any spots or floaters, if that's what you mean. No, nothing… dramatic. Just a general… lessening.
DOCTOR: Washed out colors... interesting. And no history of trauma to the eye?
PATIENT: Trauma? Heavens, no. I'm a fairly sedentary man, Doctor. I haven’t been in a fight since… well, a very long time. And I certainly haven’t had anything hit my eye. I wear glasses, have for… oh, goodness, almost forty years now. Aside from that, no. Perfectly unremarkable, as far as injuries go. Although, I did spend a bit too long staring at a computer screen in my younger days, if that counts.
DOCTOR: Forty years in glasses...and computer use. Right. What prescription are they currently?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a question. I honestly haven't the faintest. It’s been so long since I bothered with the details. I just… get them updated when things get bad enough. I go to that place in the mall, LensCrafters, I think it’s called. I’m afraid I don’t memorize numbers. They handle all that, you see. Perhaps they have a record? I wouldn’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright, well. Let's just do a quick exam then. It’s a basic check, nothing fancy. I need you to look straight ahead. Can you read the top line for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though I must say, I suspect it won't be a particularly illuminating experience for either of us. Let's see… is that an E? Yes, I believe it is. A rather blurry E, mind you, but an E nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Okay… and the next line?
PATIENT: Goodness. They are getting smaller, aren't they? Let’s see… I think that’s… F, P, T… oh, and an L? No, wait… is that a B? I’m really not entirely certain, Doctor. It’s all rather… indistinct. It’s like looking through a slightly smudged window.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Reduced red reflex bilaterally… and some mild drusen present. Alright. You’ve likely got some age-related macular degeneration starting. It's common. And your vision is… significantly reduced. We're talking around 20/70 in both eyes. The drusen explain the washed-out color perception.
PATIENT: Macular… degeneration? Goodness. That sounds… dreadful. And 20/70? Is that… bad? I mean, what does that mean precisely? I suppose I understand it’s not ideal, but… is there anything to be done about it? Will I go blind? Please don’t tell me I’ll go blind. I have… obligations. And reading is a… a comfort.
DOCTOR: 20/70 means you need to be 20 feet away to see what a person with normal vision can see at 70 feet. It's… suboptimal. As for going blind, not necessarily. It can progress, but often slowly. We can try some AREDS2 supplements – vitamins and minerals. It may slow it down. I'll write you a prescription. And honestly, you should probably get a referral to an ophthalmologist for a more thorough assessment. I'm a family doctor, not an eye specialist.
PATIENT: Supplements… vitamins. Right. And an ophthalmologist… yes, that sounds… sensible. I suppose. Are these supplements expensive? I’m on a… fixed income, you see. And frankly, I’m not convinced vitamins do much good. It all seems… rather vague. Is there anything else? Any… exercises, perhaps? Anything more… definitive than simply hoping for the best? I understand you’re not an eye specialist, but… a little reassurance would be welcome.
DOCTOR: The supplements aren't horribly expensive, I believe. The paper has some information on where to purchase them. As for exercises… no, there’s nothing you can do to reverse this. This is an age-related condition. I recommend scheduling an appointment with an ophthalmologist within the next month. That’s the best I can do for you right now. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: I suppose… not at the moment. Though I must say, Doctor, this isn’t terribly encouraging. Very well. Thank you for your… time. I suppose I’ll have to look into this ophthalmologist business.
