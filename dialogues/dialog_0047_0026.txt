DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It's…well, it's this tiredness. Just awful tiredness. Comes and goes, but when it comes… honestly, I could sleep for a week and still feel drained. It’s been happening more lately, and my husband, bless his heart, said I really ought to get it checked. He worries so.
DOCTOR: Right. Tiredness. That’s…vague, unfortunately. It could be a great many things. When you say it comes and goes, can you tell me roughly how often it happens?
PATIENT: Oh, “roughly” is right. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. But…maybe a few times a month? Sometimes less. It’s hard to say. It doesn’t follow a pattern, not that I’ve noticed. And it’s not just feeling sleepy, Doctor. It’s…like all my energy is just gone. Everything feels…heavy.
DOCTOR: "Heavy," alright. And is this tiredness interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. Used to be, I could manage everything. The house, the garden…even a bit of help with the commercial diving business, paperwork mostly. Now? Now I mostly sit. Even getting up to make a cup of tea is an effort. My son, he helps with a lot of things now, which is kind, but…I should be able to do these things myself. It’s… humiliating, really.
DOCTOR: Humiliating, yes, I understand. Alright, let's try to get a bit more specific. You mentioned paperwork for a diving business. Is that something your son is now handling entirely?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, mostly. My husband started it, and my son took over when he was…well, when he was able. I used to do the billing, you see. And some of the scheduling. But I’m… not sure I could even remember how to do that now. It’s been a while. A long while. Honestly, I don't know what I did all day sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. And aside from the tiredness and difficulty with tasks… have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Well, my muscles ache sometimes. Not all the time, but…a sort of dull ache, mostly in my legs and arms. And… I've been a bit clumsier than usual, I suppose. Dropping things, bumping into furniture. Nothing serious, mind you. Just…noticeable. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it comes and goes, like everything else! Some days I could eat a horse, other days… barely manage a biscuit. And I have lost a bit of weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. Though, honestly, I haven't weighed myself properly in ages. It's not something I dwell on.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any issues with your bowels or bladder?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Must you ask about those things? Really. Well… no. Nothing particularly different. Everything's…normal, if you must know. Though, at my age, “normal” is a relative term, isn’t it? I find it rather indelicate to ask such questions, frankly.
DOCTOR: It's necessary, Ms. Oitker, to get a complete picture. Alright. Let's move on. Have you been experiencing any dizziness or vision changes?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. I suppose you’re right, it's your job. Dizziness… sometimes, yes. Not falling-down dizzy, just… a bit lightheaded when I stand up quickly. And my eyesight… well, it's not what it used to be, is it? Everything's a bit blurry, even with my glasses. I just assumed it was old age creeping up on me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your reflexes. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll need you to remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Examination, is it? Very well. Though, I must say, I'm not fond of doctors poking and prodding. It always makes me feel rather vulnerable. But… fine. Here I go.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Reflexes are diminished in all extremities. Mild peripheral edema noted in the lower legs. Alright. Everything seems… fairly normal, considering your age. However, I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. It will check your thyroid, vitamin levels, and a complete blood count.
PATIENT: Oh, blood work? More poking and prodding, I presume? Honestly, Doctor, I feel like a specimen. But…if you think it’s necessary. My husband always says it’s best to be thorough. And he's usually right. So, alright. Whatever you think is best. Just… try to be quick about it, will you?
DOCTOR: Yes, well. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Oitker. The nurse will draw the blood before you leave. It shouldn’t take long. While we wait for the results, I would also like to ask about your medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medications... let me think. Well, there's the little blue pill for my blood pressure, I take that every morning. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take… what is that one called? Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue… something for the joints. My son usually manages the refills, so I don't always know the names. As for allergies… I don’t think I have any. I've never really had any serious reactions to anything. Though, I always avoid shellfish. But that's more a matter of taste, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a blood pressure medication and something for arthritis... Do you know the dosage of either of those?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dosages? Really, Doctor, you expect me to remember numbers? I barely remember what I had for breakfast! Let me think… the blood pressure pill is… small, blue, and I take one every morning. That's about all I can tell you. The arthritis one… even smaller, white, and I take it when my joints ache. My son keeps them in a little container, labeled, of course. Honestly, I leave the details to him. He’s much more organized than I am.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it seems we'll have to rely on the nurse to get a more accurate medication list. We'll proceed with the blood work and review the results when they come back. In the meantime, try to get some rest and stay hydrated. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I think that's all. Though, honestly, I still feel rather…unsettled. It’s just this tiredness, you see. It’s so debilitating. But… alright. I’ll try to rest. And I’ll have my son call if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will escort you to the lab. Have a good day, Ms. Oitker. .
