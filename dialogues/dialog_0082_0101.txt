DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Aldine Popova, pleased to meet you as well. Well, it’s this headache, see? Right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not constant, but it comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. A headache at the back of your head, coming and going… I see. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… must be about three weeks now, I reckon. Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to say exactly, you know? I don’t usually pay it much mind until it really starts to bother me. It’s not the worst pain, but it's… persistent. Like a dull ache, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, give or take. A dull ache at the back of the head. Okay. And would you describe it as being on one side, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly both sides, Doctor. But sometimes it feels a bit stronger on the right side, if I’m being honest. It's not sharp, though. Never sharp. Just… uncomfortable. Like someone’s puttin’ a bit of pressure there, at the base of my skull. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Popova. Pressure at the base of the skull, mostly both sides, sometimes stronger on the right. And does anything seem to trigger these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Not that I’ve noticed, really. I do a lot of work with my hands, you see – I’m a manicurist, been doin’ it for years. Maybe that has somethin’ to do with it? Sittin’ for long periods, bendin’ over… But I’ve been doin’ that for so long, I figured I’d be used to it by now. I don't think so, but I just don't know.
DOCTOR: A manicurist, for many years. That could certainly contribute, yes. Prolonged posture, repetitive movements… We’ll keep that in mind. Now, besides the headache itself, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really. No dizziness, no blurry vision. No nausea or anything like that. I haven’t been feelin’ any more tired than usual, and my appetite’s been alright. Now that you mention it, maybe a little stiff neck sometimes, but I just put that down to sleepin’ wrong. It doesn’t happen every time, though. Not often.
DOCTOR: No dizziness, vision changes, nausea, or fatigue. Occasional mild neck stiffness. That’s helpful, Mr. Popova. And just to be thorough, have you had any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My vision's been the same for years now. I wear glasses, of course, but the prescription hasn’t changed in a long time. I go for check-ups every couple of years, and the doctor always says it's alright. Everything’s still pretty clear, thankfully. I’d notice if that changed, you know? It’d make my work rather difficult.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s good to hear. And what about any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin’ like that. I've been feelin’ perfectly normal in that regard. No shivers, no sweats, no temperature at all. Just this headache, botherin' me when it feels like it. It’s not terrible, but it’s…persistent, like I said. It just won't quite go away, even with rest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. Now, I see here you’re currently uninsured. And you mentioned you’ve been a manicurist for many years. Any significant medical history that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor, no insurance. Been lucky so far, haven’t needed much. As for medical history… Well, I had the usual childhood things, you know? Measles, chickenpox. Nothin’ serious. I had my hip replaced about ten years ago now, that went well. Apart from that, I’m pretty healthy for my age, if I do say so myself. I try to eat well and stay active, even with the work. Nothing else I can think of. Oh! I had a bad bout of the flu last winter, but I recovered fully.
DOCTOR: Okay. Childhood illnesses, hip replacement ten years ago, flu last winter… And no known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. Painkillers, antibiotics… never a problem. I keep a little bottle of ibuprofen on hand for aches and pains, but I don’t use it too often. It helps a little, but it doesn’t really get rid of this headache.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, ibuprofen use… Alright, Mr. Popova. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. Go ahead. Anything you need, just let me know. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll take a look in your ears and eyes, and listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and strength. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let me take a look in your ears… Ears look clear. Now, your eyes… Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, a quick neurological exam… Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can. No problem at all. Steady as a rock, you see. Been doin’ a lot of detailed work with my hands for a long time now – keeps the eyes sharp! What’s next?
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you go, Doctor. As tight as I can. Is that alright? I don’t want to break your hand!
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfect, Mr. Popova. Good strength. Now, can you push against my hands with your legs?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? I'm tryin’ my best! I do a lot of walkin’ as well, you see, so my legs should be alright. Not as strong as they used to be, but still holdin’ up!
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knee with this little hammer. Good response. And now the other knee. Good response on this side as well. Alright, Mr. Popova. Everything appears normal on the neurological exam. Your strength and reflexes are good, and I didn't find anything concerning. Your ears and eyes look healthy as well, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing a tension headache. These are very common, often related to stress or muscle tension in the neck and shoulders. Do you feel any tension in your neck or shoulders at all?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, that's a relief to hear everything's normal. Yes, now that you mention it, my shoulders do get a bit tight sometimes. Sittin' over that manicure table all day, bendin' over… it takes a toll, I reckon. I usually just try to stretch 'em out, but it doesn't always help. I’ve been stressin’ a little bit lately too, with things goin’ on with the family. But it's nothin' major.
DOCTOR: That fits with a tension headache, Mr. Popova. Prolonged posture, repetitive movements, and stress can all contribute. I recommend trying some simple things at home first. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help, and applying a warm compress to your neck and shoulders might provide some relief. Also, try to incorporate some regular stretching and relaxation techniques into your daily routine. There are some great resources online for neck stretches and simple breathing exercises. Would you be willing to try that for the next couple of weeks and see if it improves?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I’m happy to try that. Ibuprofen I already have, and stretchin’ and relaxin’… I can definitely make time for that. Maybe I’ll get my wife to help remind me! If it doesn't get better, what then? Would I need to come back? And would you recommend any particular stretches, or is any stretchin' alright?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Popova. Yes, if it doesn't improve after a couple of weeks, please come back and see me. We can then discuss other options, such as physical therapy or a referral to a specialist if necessary. As for stretches, there are a few simple ones that can be very helpful. This one, gently tilting your head to each side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder, can relieve tension in the neck. And this one, slowly rotating your shoulders forward and backward, can help loosen up the muscles. Be gentle, don’t force anything, and stop if you feel any pain. I can print these out for you to take home, if you’d like. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please do print those out for me. That'd be a great help, thank you. And no, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. You’ve been very helpful and put my mind at ease. I really appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. Thank you again, Doctor. I'll give those stretches a try and see how it goes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could help. Here you are. Remember, listen to your body, and don't hesitate to come back if things don’t improve or if you develop any new symptoms. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. You have a good day as well. And… try not to work too hard, alright?
