DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away. It’s been bothering me for… oh, I’d say close to a month now. It’s worse when I lie down, you know? Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a month-long cough, worse when lying down. Alright. And is this cough…productive?
PATIENT: Productive? Oh, dear. You mean… do I cough anything up? Yes, a little. It’s… clear, mostly. Sometimes a bit bubbly, but not much color to it. Not like a cold, anyway. It just feels… wet. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Clear, bubbly sputum, not colored. Okay. And when did you first notice it starting to bother you?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was right after that heatwave we had in July. I remember because I had to close the kitchen early one day, just felt too tired to keep going. Then the cough started a few days after that. I figured it was just something I picked up, but it hasn't gone away like a normal cough would. My heart's been acting up a little too, but I always get that when it's hot.
DOCTOR: "Acting up," you say?
PATIENT: Well, it feels… fluttery. And I get short of breath easier. I have to stop and catch my breath just walking to the mailbox sometimes. It’s been worse with this cough, though. I used to just slow down a bit, but now it feels like it’s taking more effort to breathe even when I’m sitting still. Does that explain it better?
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet lately?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now that you mention it… my feet have been a bit puffy in the evenings. I thought it was just because of the heat, you know? But it's been happening more and more. I have to wiggle my toes to get my shoes on sometimes. It's not painful, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you having any chest pain with this cough or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It’s more like a… tightness. Like someone is sitting on my chest. It comes and goes, mostly when I’m trying to catch my breath. It’s not sharp or anything, just… uncomfortable and heavy. It doesn’t last very long, though. A few minutes, maybe. It’s mostly just scary, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you have any known history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Years ago, the doctor told me I have… congestive heart failure, I think that’s what he called it. It's been stable for a long time, though. I take a water pill every day to keep the swelling down, and another one for the heart. I’ve been taking the same ones for… oh, must be ten years now? I try to watch my salt, too. But I get forgetful, you know? Sometimes I slip up.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, specifically?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have… Furosemide, that’s the water pill, 40 milligrams every morning. And Lisinopril, for the blood pressure and heart, 20 milligrams, also every morning. Oh, and sometimes I take Tylenol for aches, but not every day. I have a little pill organizer, but I sometimes mix them up, if I’m honest. My daughter helps me with it when she visits, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. I remember being a little itchy once, many years ago, but it wasn't anything serious. My mother always said I had tough skin! I don’t usually bother with allergies unless it's something new. Is that a problem? I don’t want to forget something important.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a problem. Just trying to be thorough. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart. If you don’t mind?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold. My skin is a little sensitive these days. I always feel a chill, you know? Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath for me… and another… Okay. Listens for several moments. And now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Listens for several moments. I do hear some crackles in your lungs, particularly in the lower lobes. And your heart sounds a bit… irregular. I also notice some edema in your ankles.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? Crackles… irregular… Edema… That all sounds like the heart, doesn't it? I knew something wasn't right. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it worse than usual? I get scared when things sound like that. I just want to feel normal again, you know?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sadhu, it sounds like your congestive heart failure is likely being exacerbated. The fluid in your lungs and ankles is a clear sign of that. It’s not necessarily an emergency right now, but it’s certainly something we need to address promptly to prevent it from becoming one. We'll need to run some blood work, and I’d like to get an EKG to check the rhythm of your heart. We'll also order a chest x-ray to confirm the fluid in your lungs. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work… EKG… X-ray… It sounds like a lot. Yes, I understand. It's… the heart again, isn't it? And the fluid… I should have been more careful with my salt. I knew better. But it's hard to remember everything, you know? What will the tests tell you, exactly? And what will we do after that? Will I have to go to the hospital? I really don't want to go to the hospital, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The blood work will tell us your kidney function and electrolyte levels, which are important for managing heart failure. The EKG will assess the electrical activity of your heart, and the chest x-ray will show us how much fluid is in your lungs. Pauses, looks at the patient directly. As for the hospital… we’ll see what the tests reveal. It’s possible you may need to be admitted for closer monitoring and IV fluids to help with the congestion. But let’s not jump to conclusions. For now, let’s get these tests done and then we can discuss a plan. I'm going to have the nurse draw some blood. And then we’ll get you scheduled for an EKG and chest x-ray. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a lot to take in. I guess not right now. Just… the nurse will draw blood? Will it hurt? I bruise easily, you know. And… what if they can’t find a vein? I always get nervous with needles. And… will someone help me get to the x-ray? My knees aren’t what they used to be. I just… I get scared when things are complicated, you know?
DOCTOR: The nurse is very skilled, Ms. Sadhu. It will be a quick blood draw, and yes, she is careful with patients who bruise easily. They’ll use a small needle. As for finding a vein, they are quite adept. And yes, someone will absolutely assist you to the x-ray room. This is standard procedure. We have a team here to make sure you’re comfortable. Let me call the nurse now, and she'll explain the process to you in detail. Try not to worry, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being patient with me. It's just… getting old isn't easy, you know? Everything feels more difficult. Just… let me know when the nurse is ready. And thank you again. I really do appreciate it.
