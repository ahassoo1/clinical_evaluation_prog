DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Is good to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for, oh… maybe three days now? Not so bad at first, but getting worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum, a headache for three days, gradually worsening. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to say… it's not a sharp pain. More like… a heavy weight. Like someone sitting on my head, but just the back part. And sometimes… feels like little sparks back there. Not all the time, just sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Brum. A heavy, weighted sensation focused on the back of your head, with occasional sparks. Has anything specific seemed to trigger the headache or make it worse?
PATIENT: Not that I know. I been doing… same things. Work at the yard, you know? Moving the trains… small ones. Been doing that for long time. Maybe the sun? Was very hot yesterday. But I always wear my hat. A good hat. Not sure. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright. You work in the yard moving trains – that’s good to know. And you were out in the sun yesterday, wearing a hat. We'll certainly keep that in mind. Now, has this headache been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me think. No fever. No… dizzy. Not sick to my stomach. I eat okay. Sleep okay, mostly. Oh! Sometimes my eyes… they feel tired. Like I been reading too long, but I no read much these days. Just the newspaper.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no dizziness or nausea, appetite and sleep are generally good, and some eye fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Not really. Things look… normal. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I am old, you know? Eyes get old too. Not like when I was young man, sharp as a hawk! But no… no big changes. Just… old man eyes.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Brum. It’s common for vision to change as we age. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? No, never. Doctor told me long time ago, when I was young, my heart was good, strong. Diabetes… no. I eat sweets sometimes, but not too much. I no remember any other… I been pretty healthy, mostly. Worked hard all my life. That's good for you, I think. My wife… she had something with her stomach, long time ago. But that was her, not me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no history of high blood pressure or diabetes for you, and a strong heart as far as you know. Your wife had stomach issues in the past, but that was her medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But they just… wrapped it in cloth. No cutting. My wife… she had her appendix out, I think. Long time ago. But me… no surgeries. Never. I'm a tough old man!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Brum. No surgeries for you. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No medications. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. Never liked them. My wife… she took something for her pain, but I don't remember the name. Just a little white pill. But I… nothing. I drink my coffee in the morning. That's all. Maybe sometimes a little tea at night, if I can't sleep. But no pills. Never.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications currently, just coffee and occasional tea. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… No. Not that I know. I eat everything. My wife… she was allergic to cats, I think. But me? No. I been stung by bees a few times, working outside, but I no get too sick. Just a little swelling. But no allergies. I'm pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Brum. So, no known allergies. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he lived long life, but he had trouble with his legs when he got old. Maybe arthritis? Mother… she died when I was young, I don’t remember much. Had many brothers and sisters, most of them lived long life too. No… no one had anything really bad, I think. Just… old age problems. Nothing special. My wife’s mother… she had something with her heart, I think. But that was her family, not mine.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some leg trouble in your father, some heart issues in your wife's family, but generally a long-lived family. Now, Mr. Brum, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Do what you need to do. I trust you. Just tell me if anything… hurts too much. I am an old man, you know. Bones are not so strong anymore.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brum. We’ll take things slowly and gently. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes and strength. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need. I'm ready. I been waiting a long time for this. Just be gentle, like you said. Old bones.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140 over 90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we’ll document it. Your lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, but they are present and symmetrical. Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Diminished… what does that mean? Like… weak? I squeeze your hands. I am still strong! Maybe not as strong as when I was young, but still strong. Is good to keep working, you know. Keeps the muscles going.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Brum. Your grip strength is quite good for your age, so don’t worry about that at all. "Diminished" just means they are a little weaker than what we’d expect in a younger person. It’s perfectly normal. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves. I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Can you follow my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like… this? Is good exercise for the eyes, you know. Keeps them sharp. I look at the newspaper every day. Small print, but I can still read it! Is not so easy anymore, but I try.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Brum. Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, I’m going to palpate your head and neck to check for any tenderness or masses. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not so tender. Maybe a little… here. That's where the headache is, you know. But not really tender. Just… sore. Like a bruise, maybe? But I no remember hitting my head. Maybe when I was working, I bumped it on something? I don't remember. The yard is… busy. Lots of things moving around.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum, I do feel some muscle tension in that area. It’s likely contributing to your headache. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your neck. Can you gently turn your head to the left and then to the right?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Ooh… a little stiff. Not so easy anymore. Old man neck. I try to stretch it sometimes, but it doesn't help much. Is just… old age. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum, you do have some limited range of motion in your neck, and I can see you’re experiencing some discomfort. Based on the physical exam and your history, it appears you're experiencing a tension headache, likely related to muscle strain in your neck. It's common, especially with physical activity and age-related changes. However, given your age and the gradual worsening of the headache, I would like to order a CT scan of your head to rule out any other underlying causes. It’s a precaution, just to be safe. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A… CT scan? What is that? Is that… dangerous? I don't like too many tests. I just want the headache to go away. But… if you think it's important, Doctor… then okay. Do what you need to do. Just tell me if it hurts. And… how long does it take? I have things to do, you know. Work at the yard.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Mr. Brum. A CT scan is a quick and painless imaging test that uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of your brain. It doesn’t involve any injections or radiation that are harmful in the small dose used. It will take about 15-20 minutes to complete. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning. It will help us to rule out any serious causes for your headache, such as a tumor or bleeding in the brain. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and gentle stretching of your neck muscles. We'll also discuss some physical therapy exercises to help improve your neck mobility. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… yes, I think my wife used that sometimes. Okay, Doctor. If you think it's best, then we do the scan. Tomorrow morning is good. And the stretching… I will try. But my neck is so stiff. And the exercises… I will ask my neighbor, he's a strong man, maybe he can show me. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I understand your concerns, and we’ll take things one step at a time. We’ll get you scheduled for the CT scan tomorrow morning, and I’ll write you a prescription for ibuprofen. In the meantime, if your headache worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all. You explained everything very clearly. Thank you again. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I will try the ibuprofen and the stretching. And I will see you tomorrow. Is good to know someone is taking care of me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It’s my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Here's the prescription for the ibuprofen, and the order for the CT scan. The scheduling department will call you to arrange the appointment time. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. Get some rest, and I’ll see you then. Have a good day, Mr. Brum.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye bye!
