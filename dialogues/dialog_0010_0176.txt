DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been… over two days now, and it’s really getting to me.
DOCTOR: Over two days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, started late on the 31st, and they’ve been pretty constant since then. Not every second, but… enough to be incredibly annoying. I tried drinking water really fast, holding my breath… you know, all the usual things people suggest. Nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Right, the usual tricks. And you said they started late on the 31st… can you recall anything specific you were doing or eating around that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was a quiet New Year’s Eve, really. Just me and a friend, Nadia. We ordered in some… Egyptian food, actually. Koshari, and some grilled chicken. And I had a couple glasses of hibiscus tea, which I drink all the time. Nothing out of the ordinary, I don’t think. We were just chatting, watching an old movie… Oh! And Nadia brought a new dip, a spicy feta one. Maybe that? Though I’ve had feta before…
DOCTOR: Okay, spicy feta dip is good to note. And just to clarify, the hibiscus tea – you drink that regularly, and haven’t noticed hiccups after it before?
PATIENT: That’s right. I have it almost every day. Usually with breakfast. And no, never hiccups before. It’s a bit odd, isn’t it? It’s just… the hiccups came out of nowhere. I was mid-sentence telling Nadia about my niece, and hic… there they were. And they haven’t really left me since.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the hiccups, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else…? Let me think… No fever, no trouble breathing. I’m a little tired, maybe, but that’s just because I haven’t been sleeping well with the hiccups, you know? No pain anywhere, no nausea… Oh! My stomach feels a little… bubbly, if that makes sense? Not painful, just… unsettled. Like something’s moving around in there. Is that weird?
DOCTOR: No, that's not weird at all, Ms. Redeye. “Bubbly” is a good way to describe it. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor, you're asking everything! Um… yes, actually. I’ve been… a little more frequent, shall we say? And… looser. It started around the same time as the hiccups, I think. Now that you mention it… I just figured it was something I ate. It's been a bit embarrassing to talk about, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be a little awkward, Ms. Redeye, but it's important information. And I assure you, I've heard it all. So, let's just confirm - looser stools starting around the same time as the hiccups and the unsettled stomach?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. And all of it started… after eating with Nadia. The Koshari, the chicken, the hibiscus tea, and… that spicy feta dip. I feel like I'm pointing fingers at a poor dip here! But it is the only new thing I had that night. I really don’t think it was the Koshari, I’ve had that a million times.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, it sounds like a possible gastrointestinal irritation, potentially with some nerve involvement causing the hiccups. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listening to your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm just hoping we can figure out what's going on and get these hiccups to stop. They're driving me mad! I manage events, you know? It’s hard to talk to clients when you hic keep interrupting yourself.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can be very disruptive. Alright, if you could just lie back on the exam table for me, please. And I'll start by listening to your abdomen. Relax your stomach as much as you can. Okay. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds, although they are a little… hyperactive. No signs of any distension. And when I gently press, you’re a little tender in your lower abdomen, on both sides, but nothing alarming. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, a little. Not sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, really. And it feels a little… gassy. Sorry. It’s probably just the hiccups, isn’t it? Making everything feel worse. It’s just… relentless. I even tried holding my breath and drinking water upside down. You wouldn’t believe what Nadia thought of that!
DOCTOR: I can imagine. Well, you've certainly tried! It could be related to the hiccups, yes. But given the tenderness and the change in bowel habits, it’s a little more complex than just simple hiccups. I'd like to order a stool sample to rule out any infection or inflammation. Also, given your age and symptoms, I'd recommend a basic metabolic panel to check your electrolytes and kidney function. It's just a precaution. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever tests you need. I just want to feel normal again. A stool sample… right. Where do I even begin with that? And a blood test… I haven’t had one in ages. Will it be a big needle? I’m a bit squeamish, you see. And will I have to fast beforehand? I really don’t do well without breakfast.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Ms. Redeye. I completely understand. We have collection kits here in the clinic, and I'll walk you through exactly how to collect the sample. It’s not as unpleasant as you might think. As for the blood test, it's a standard needle, and we have skilled phlebotomists who are very gentle. And yes, you will need to fast for eight hours beforehand. I know it’s not ideal, but it’s important for accurate results. We can schedule it for first thing tomorrow morning, so you won’t have to fast for too long. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, tomorrow morning sounds… manageable. Eight hours… I can do that. Just no breakfast. And I’ll try not to think about the stool sample too much. Will I need to bring anything with me for the blood test? And when will I get the results back? I’m going to be very anxious until I know what’s going on. I have an event to plan next week, and I need to be on top of things. These hiccups are making it very difficult. It's a charity gala, and everything needs to be perfect.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Redeye. No need to bring anything for the blood test - we have everything we need here. The lab usually gets the results back within 48 to 72 hours. I'll call you as soon as they are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, eat bland foods, and avoid anything spicy or greasy. And I’ll write you a prescription for an antacid to help with the discomfort. Here's the prescription. And I’ll also give you the instructions for the stool sample. Take a deep breath – you've already taken the first step by coming in today. We’ll figure this out. Is there anything else I can help you with right now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very reassuring. No, I think that's everything for now. Just… hopefully, it's not anything too serious. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, at least. I’ll try to follow your instructions and… avoid spicy food. And I'll schedule that blood test first thing tomorrow. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And don't worry too much – we’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
