DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. Please, tell me – in as concise a manner as possible – what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Percell Gibbel, that's me. Well, it's this headache. Right in the back of my head. Been botherin' me for a few days now. Not the worst pain, but…constant. Like a dull ache, ya know? It’s right at the base of my skull.
DOCTOR: A headache, you say. For a few days. And you describe it as…dull. Constant. Right. And before we proceed, do you have any…other complaints?
PATIENT: Other complaints… hmm. Let me think. Not really. Just tired, I guess. Old age, ya know? But that’s just… bein’ old. Nothing with the headache, though. No blurry vision, no dizziness, no…numbness. Just the ache. It doesn’t seem to get much worse with light or anything, either. I can still see fine. Mostly just…annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything…changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed recently? Well… my grandson, he just started college. That was a big thing, sendin' him off. Lots of worryin' about him, makin' sure he's settled. But nothin' physically changed, if that's what you mean. Same routine, mostly. I still go to the market every other day, help my neighbor with her garden… regular stuff. Oh! And I got a new cushion for my chair. Does that count? It’s a bit softer. But I don’t think that’s it.
DOCTOR: A new cushion… I see. And you’ve had this headache for, you said, a few days?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe four days now. Started kinda slow, just a little somethin' at the back of my head. Didn't pay much attention at first, figured it was just stress about the boy leavin'. But it hasn't gone away, ya know? Just…stays there. Doesn’t get worse, just…is there. It's more bothersome at night, maybe? When things are quiet. Hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any… medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical problems... hmm. Well, my knees ain’t what they used to be, arthritis, the doctor told me years ago. But I manage. Take some over-the-counter stuff for it, that’s all. And my blood pressure was a little high a while back, but it's been okay lately. I haven't been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, a long time. Not unless somethin’ was really wrong. I try to stay healthy, eat my vegetables. I haven’t been taking any regular medication, though. Not for anything.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… oh! Years and years ago, I had my appendix out. When I was a young man. And… that’s about it, I think. Just the appendix. Everything else is still original, ya know? Well, mostly. No other surgeries. Nothing major, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I'm going to examine your head and neck. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, that's a little tender. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a bruise, almost. It's right there, at the base of my skull. It doesn’t hurt all the time, just when you press on it. Maybe that’s where the ache is comin’ from?
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is some tenderness to palpation at the occipital region. Range of motion is…within normal limits, though slightly limited. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No fever, no chills, no…night sweats. Just tired, like I said. But that's just bein' old, ya know? I sleep alright, though. Not much trouble sleepin’. Just the headache keeps me up sometimes. Thinkin’ about it, mostly. Worryin’ about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age, and the fact that you have no other concerning symptoms, this is likely a tension headache. I’m going to recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If it doesn't improve within a week, or if it worsens, you will need to follow up with a specialist. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Tension headache, huh? So, not somethin' serious? Just…stress? That’s good to know. Ibuprofen, you say? Yeah, I got some of that at home. Alright, I can try that. A week, huh? If it gets worse, see a specialist. Okay. Um… well, I guess my question is… is there anything else I should be doin’? Should I be tryin' to relax more? Any special pillows or somethin'? I just want to make sure I'm doin’ everything right. And… what kind of specialist should I see, if I do need to go? A neurologist?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Gibbel, you appear to be reasonably healthy for your age. Relaxation is always beneficial. As for a specialist… a primary care physician is sufficient for a referral if needed. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: A primary care physician… okay. That’s not too far from here. Alright, I think that answers my questions. I don't want to take up too much of your time, Doctor. I appreciate you lookin’ at me. I’ll try the ibuprofen and see what happens. Thank you. I guess I’ll be on my way then.
DOCTOR: Very well. Take care, Mr. Gibbel. And do try to manage your stress. Here is a summary of today’s discussion. Goodbye. .
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. I will. Take care yourself. .
