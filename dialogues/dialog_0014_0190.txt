DOCTOR: Well, hello Lilyanna. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, honestly. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, like I might fall over. It's been happening for… some time now, I believe. I don’t recall precisely when it started, unfortunately. It’s just… a wobble, I suppose.
DOCTOR: "Some time now," is… not terribly helpful, dear. But alright. A wobble. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, I apologize. You are quite right. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It… comes and goes, yes. More frequent lately, though. It’s not always there, but when it is, it’s… unsettling. Does that make more sense? I truly am sorry for being vague.
DOCTOR: It's... alright. Though I do need something to work with. And no need to apologize excessively. More frequent lately… is it worse with any particular activity?
PATIENT: Hmm. I work with a rotary drill, out on… a site, for oil and gas. It seems to be… exacerbated when I’m operating it, perhaps? The vibrations, I suspect. But even when I’m not working, it happens. Just… walking, sometimes. Or standing. It’s rather random, truthfully.
DOCTOR: A rotary drill… right. That does sound… unpleasant. And you said just standing or walking too?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. It’s… disconcerting, to say the least. Especially when one is accustomed to being… stable. I don’t believe it’s pain, exactly. More like… a loss of balance. A momentary… lightness, perhaps? It’s hard to articulate. And it’s frightening, honestly. I lost… someone, not long ago, and I worry about… well, falling.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get to the bottom of this, dear. You mentioned losing someone recently... I'm sorry for your loss, of course. But we need to focus on you right now. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this wobble?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Other symptoms… Hmm. I believe my vision has been… a little blurry, at times. Not constant, but… yes, blurry. And I’ve felt rather… fatigued, recently. A general weariness, you understand. It could simply be the work, of course, but… it feels different. It’s difficult to describe.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, fatigue… Right. And have you experienced any dizziness, or ringing in the ears?
PATIENT: Ringing in the ears… no, I don’t think so. No ringing. Dizziness… There has been a sensation of… spinning, perhaps, once or twice. Very brief, though. Not a constant dizziness, more like… a momentary… disorientation. Does that make sense? I truly am trying to be as precise as possible, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. Spinning… briefly. Have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Before…? I… believe I had a similar sensation, years ago. Not as frequent, and not as… pronounced. It resolved on its own, I think. I was much younger, then. It was before… before my husband passed, certainly. It feels… a long time ago. I am unsure if it is relevant, Doctor. My memory is, unfortunately, rather unreliable.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a brief episode years ago that resolved spontaneously... And this is all relatively new, starting a while back but getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. New, or rather, a recurrence… that is getting progressively worse. I apologize again for being… imprecise. I truly wish I could be more helpful. It's just… difficult to recall details, and I don’t want to mislead you. It feels as if… fragments are missing. Perhaps it's the stress, Doctor? Grief, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Right. Let's do a quick physical exam, then we can go from there. Just stand up for me, dear. I want to check your balance and reflexes. I’ll also take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Nothing to worry about, just a standard check.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As you wish. A standard check sounds… reasonable. I apologize in advance if I am… less than graceful. I do hope it won't take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing alarming. Lungs are clear, heartbeat is regular. Your balance is a bit off, as you said. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: As you wish, Doctor. I am aware of… a certain instability. It feels… rather sensitive, Doctor. Is something… amiss? I apologize for any difficulty. I am trying to cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are a bit diminished. So, a little unsteady, diminished reflexes, slightly elevated blood pressure… Honestly, dear, it could be a number of things. It could be something relatively minor, like dehydration or a vitamin deficiency. Or… it could be something more serious. Given your history, and frankly, your… vague recollection of things, I think we should order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. We should also consider a CT scan of your brain, just to rule out anything structural. Does that sound… acceptable?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? That sounds… rather significant, Doctor. Is it… necessary? I understand you are being thorough, but… the thought of… further investigation is… unsettling. Perhaps the blood work would be sufficient, initially? I am concerned about… radiation, and the implications of… what it might reveal. Perhaps there is another option?
DOCTOR: Look, dear, I understand your apprehension. But given your symptoms – the unsteadiness, the blurred vision, the diminished reflexes, and your… history of memory issues – we need to be cautious. A CT scan isn't something I'd order lightly. But it’s necessary to rule out anything serious, like a stroke or a tumor. The amount of radiation is minimal, frankly. And frankly, ignoring this could be far more dangerous. We need to know what's going on. I'll also prescribe a multivitamin, just in case. But the CT scan is non-negotiable. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: A tumor…? Oh, Doctor… that is… alarming. I… I don’t believe I have any allergies to… contrast dye. Not that I am aware of, anyway. My memory is… unreliable, as you know. But I have never experienced a reaction to anything, if that is of any help. Is there… anything I should expect? Will it be… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I am… rather anxious about this, Doctor. Truly.
DOCTOR: Alright, dear. Look, the scan itself isn't painful, just a bit noisy. You’ll lie on a table and a machine will take images of your brain. It’ll take about 20 minutes. As for the results, they usually take a day or two to come back. Honestly, you're worrying unnecessarily. It's likely nothing serious, but we need to rule things out. I'm going to order the blood work and the CT scan. My nurse will schedule the scan for you. In the meantime, try to relax and get some rest. And perhaps… try not to dwell on things. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Relax… try not to dwell… It is… difficult, Doctor. Will the scan… reveal everything? Is there… a possibility of… something irreversible? And… what if they find something? What… what are the next steps? I understand you cannot predict the future, but… a little reassurance would be… helpful. And… is there anything I should avoid doing until I have the results? Anything at all? I am… rather frightened, Doctor. Truly. .
DOCTOR: Look, dear, I have other patients waiting. The scan will reveal what it reveals. And yes, there is always a possibility of something, but dwelling on hypotheticals won't help anyone. Until the results are back, avoid strenuous activity. Don’t drive. And honestly, don’t Google your symptoms. My nurse will give you detailed instructions. If you experience any sudden changes – severe headache, weakness, slurred speech – go to the emergency room immediately. Now, if you'll excuse me… I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. Try to stay positive.
