DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. The… the paper said something about… learning? I don’t really remember. My husband made the appointment. He said I need to… know things. About… being healthy, I think. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. No problem at all. It sounds like this might be a general check-up, a bit of a wellness visit. Your husband was thinking it’s a good time to see how things are going. Don't worry about remembering specifics. We’ll figure it out together. So, to start… are you having any particular symptoms or concerns right now?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No, not really. I feel… okay. A little tired, maybe. But I always feel a little tired. Working with the metal… it’s hard work. It’s not like sitting in an office. People don’t understand that.
DOCTOR: Metal work, right. Physically demanding. Okay, “a little tired” is good to know. And it’s consistent, not new?
PATIENT: New? No, not new. Years. Since… well, since I started the job. It’s just… how it is. You get used to it. Is this… is this what doctors do? Just ask questions?
DOCTOR: We do a lot of listening, Ms. Fontanazza. Questions help me understand what's going on with you, so we can figure out the best way to help. It's not just asking questions, it's about putting the pieces together. Okay, back to the tiredness. On a scale of one to ten, with one being hardly noticeable and ten being completely debilitating, where would you rate it?
PATIENT: One to ten? That’s… a strange question. I don’t… measure my tiredness. It’s just… there. But… if I had to… maybe a… four? On a good day. Sometimes more, when the work is really heavy. It’s not like I can just… stop working.
DOCTOR: Okay, a four, and it fluctuates. That’s helpful. And you said you’ve been doing this work for years... Are there any other things you've noticed alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Alongside? Like… other problems? I get… aches. In my back, mostly. And my hands. It’s the metal, you know? Lifting and bending all day. It’s not a surprise. Old Man Hemlock down at the shop, he’s got terrible arthritis. I don’t want to end up like him.
DOCTOR: Back and hand aches... That makes sense with the type of work you do. We should definitely take a look at those. Do the aches come and go, or are they pretty constant?
PATIENT: They come and go. Worse at the end of the day, of course. And… when it’s cold. Cold weather makes everything worse. My husband says I should retire, but… what else would I do? He doesn’t understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse at the end of the day and with cold weather. That's good information. We'll talk about ways to manage that, hopefully keep things from getting worse. Now, just to get a broader picture... Have you had any other health problems in the past?
PATIENT: Health problems…? I… I had my tonsils out when I was little. And… I think I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. But that was a long time ago. Nothing serious, really. I don't go to the doctor much. Never really needed to.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils and arm, both a long time ago. Any surgeries besides those?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Definitely not. I… I don’t like hospitals. Or doctors, really. Too many… needles. And poking and prodding. My husband gets all the check-ups. He says it’s important. But I… I just get on with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. That’s good to know. Let's talk about your family. Are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family…? My mother… she had… problems with her stomach, I think. And my father… he had high blood pressure. He was always very… stressed. Running the shop, you know? It was a lot of work. They both… passed away a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach problems for your mother and high blood pressure for your father. Do you know if anyone else in your family had any serious health conditions?
PATIENT: Serious…? My aunt… on my mother’s side… she had something with her… heart, I think. But I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago. We didn’t see them much. They lived far away. Honestly, I don’t know much about their health. It wasn’t something we talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay. We're getting a general picture. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Not that I know of. I haven’t really taken much medicine in my life. Maybe… a little bit for headaches sometimes. But nothing… serious. I’m usually fine. I’m a strong person. I don’t get sick easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. My husband tries to get me to take vitamins, but I always forget. He leaves them on the kitchen counter, and then… they just sit there. I get enough from my food, I think. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Ms. Fontanazza, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better feel for things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical… exam? What does that involve? Is it… is it going to hurt? I really don’t like being poked and prodded. Is it necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Fontanazza. It's not about poking and prodding, I promise. It's just a quick check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a look at your back and hands since you mentioned the aches. It helps me get a better overall picture and rule out anything serious. It shouldn't hurt, and I'll explain everything as I go. We can take it slow, and if at any point you feel uncomfortable, just let me know and we'll stop. Would you like me to explain what I'll be doing, step-by-step, before we start?
PATIENT: Step-by-step…? Yes. That… that would be better. I don’t like surprises. Just… please don’t poke too hard. And… try to be quick, alright? My husband is waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take it slow, and I’ll explain everything. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It doesn’t hurt at all—I’m just listening for any unusual sounds. I'll need you to take a few deep breaths while I do this. Then, I’ll check your blood pressure, which involves putting a cuff around your arm—you’ll feel a little pressure, but it’s quick. Does that sound okay so far?
PATIENT: Deep breaths… and a cuff. I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… don’t be too surprised if my blood pressure is high. I worry a lot. My husband says I need to relax more. Just… get it over with, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could just sit here for me, that would be great. First, the heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Another deep breath… good. Sounds clear so far. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. This might feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t hurt. 140 over 90… a little elevated, as you said. We can discuss that in a bit. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to take a quick look at your back and hands, just to assess the aches you mentioned.
PATIENT: Tight… 140…? That’s… bad, isn’t it? My husband always tells me to watch my salt intake. But I like salty snacks. Fine. Look at my back and hands. Just… be careful. They’re sensitive. And… don’t poke. Please.
DOCTOR: It’s a little higher than we’d like, but not drastically so. We can certainly talk about ways to manage it. And I promise, no poking. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes. Right there. That’s… always sore. Especially after a long day. It feels… tight. Like a knot. It’s just… work. It’s always work.
DOCTOR: I see. There’s definitely some muscle tension there. And I can feel a bit of tightness. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ow! Yes. That one. And… this one too. It’s… a dull ache. It’s worse when I grip things. Like… when I’m cutting the metal. Or… tightening bolts. It’s just… part of the job. You get used to it, I suppose. But it doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. They’re not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: I see. There's tenderness in the knuckles, and a bit of stiffness. It sounds like you might have some early signs of osteoarthritis, related to the repetitive strain of your work. Now, do you notice any numbness or tingling in your hands or fingers?
PATIENT: Numbness…? Not really. Sometimes… they feel a little… cold. And… clumsy. Like I can’t quite grip things properly. But… not numb. Never numb. Just… weak. And… sore. Always sore. Is this… bad? Am I going to have to stop working?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Ms. Fontanazza. And we're not talking about stopping work right away. It sounds like you're experiencing some wear and tear on your joints, which is common with physically demanding jobs. We can explore options to manage the pain and stiffness, and try to prevent it from getting worse. Now, overall, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and you're experiencing some aches and stiffness in your back and hands. We'll need to discuss lifestyle modifications, and possibly some physical therapy, to help manage these issues. Before we get into that, do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? That sounds… complicated. And physical therapy…? Will that hurt? My husband always says I need to be more active, but… I’m always tired. What kind of lifestyle changes? Do I have to give up salty snacks? And… will this be expensive? I don’t have insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. It doesn't have to be complicated, and we'll take it one step at a time. Lifestyle changes can be as simple as incorporating a little more walking into your day, and watching your salt intake, yes. It doesn't mean you have to give up salty snacks entirely, just moderation. As for the physical therapy, it shouldn’t be painful, but it will involve some exercises to strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion. It will be tailored to your specific needs. And you’re right to ask about the cost. We can explore some options for low-cost physical therapy and talk about ways to manage your health without breaking the bank. The first step is getting a better handle on your blood pressure and helping with the aches and pains. I’d recommend starting with a low-sodium diet, trying to incorporate 30 minutes of light exercise most days of the week, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed. I also want to recommend a referral to a physical therapist. I can give you a list of places in the area that offer sliding-scale fees. Do you have any other questions before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: Light exercise…? When? I work all day. And… ibuprofen? Doesn’t that upset your stomach? My mother always said so. This is a lot. I don't know if I can do all this. My husband will be disappointed. He always wants me to take better care of myself. I just want the pain to stop. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Ms. Fontanazza. And you're right, it is a lot. We don't have to do everything at once. We can start small. Even 10-15 minutes of walking each day is a good start. And yes, ibuprofen can upset your stomach, so we can discuss other options if that's a concern. I understand you're worried about disappointing your husband, and about the pain. I’m here to help you manage that pain, and to work with you to find a plan that’s realistic and manageable. I'll write down all the recommendations for you - diet changes, exercise, over-the-counter pain relief options, and the list of physical therapy places. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you're doing and adjust the plan if needed. Do you have any questions about the recommendations, or anything else before we finish up today?
PATIENT: A follow-up…? I suppose that’s… alright. Just… please write everything down clearly. I forget things easily. And… thank you. For… not judging me. My husband always says I’m lazy. Can you… write down the name of the physical therapy places? And… maybe a reminder to try the walking? I’m really bad at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll write everything down very clearly, and I’ll include the names of the physical therapy places, along with their contact information. I’ll also add a reminder about the walking - start with 10 minutes a day, and gradually increase it as you feel comfortable. And please, don't worry about your husband. You're not lazy at all. You work very hard, and you're taking the first step towards taking better care of yourself, and that's something to be proud of. Here you go. This includes all the recommendations, the list of physical therapy places, and a reminder to try the walking. I’m also going to give you a brochure about managing high blood pressure. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you're doing. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Thank you. I… I think I can manage this. Maybe. A month…? Yes. That sounds alright. Well… I should probably go. My husband is waiting for me. Thank you again. For… everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fontanazza. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, take things one step at a time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you in a month. Take care.
