DOCTOR: Hi Mykeisha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Yoshino, nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having some trouble with my blood pressure, that’s why I made an appointment. It’s been a bit high lately, according to the machine at the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good you’re keeping an eye on it and even better that you came in to get it checked out. Pharmacy machines can be a little off sometimes, so let’s get a good reading here and talk about what’s been going on. First, can you tell me a little more about when you noticed it was high?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It was probably… around March, maybe April? I was checking it 'cause my sister, she's a nurse, and she was telling me I should, just to be safe. She was worried 'cause our mom had high blood pressure when she was older. So I started going to the pharmacy every couple of weeks to check it. It wasn’t always high, but enough times that I figured I should get it looked at.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around March or April, started checking regularly because of your mom’s history and your sister’s advice, and it’s been elevated on a few occasions. That's helpful. And when you say “high,” do you happen to know what the readings were, even roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, I do remember a couple. There was one time in May it was like… 145 over 90, I think. And then just last week, it was 138 over 85. Something like that. I wrote them down, but I didn’t really pay that much attention to the second number, to be honest. I just knew it wasn't what it should be.
DOCTOR: Okay, 145/90 in May and 138/85 last week. Those are definitely readings we want to investigate. It’s good you’re keeping track, even if you weren’t focusing on the diastolic number. Let me just take a look at your record here… Okay, I see you’ve been a Medicare patient since 2023, and there's not a lot of documented history. Just to get a fuller picture, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing diagnosed. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? And my knees ache a bit when it’s cold, but I just put that down to getting older. Nothing a little cream hasn’t fixed. I’ve never really needed to go to the doctor much, before this.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! It’s always best to be proactive, and it sounds like you generally have been. No prior diagnoses, generally healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even for tonsils or anything when I was a kid. I’ve been lucky, really. Just the usual colds and flu, like everyone else. I remember having the chickenpox when I was little, but that was it. Nothing serious. I think I pulled a muscle once, playing dominoes, but that didn’t even need a doctor!
DOCTOR: No surgeries or hospitalizations, just the usual childhood illnesses. That’s excellent. Now, let’s talk about family history. You mentioned your mom had high blood pressure. Did anyone else in your family—grandparents, siblings, aunts/uncles—have high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My dad, he had heart problems. He had a heart attack when he was about 65, and then he needed a bypass a few years later. And my aunt, on my mom’s side, she had diabetes. She lost a foot 'cause of it, it was really sad. And my brother, he’s been told his cholesterol is a little high, but he doesn't really do anything about it. He says he’s “built that way.” Men, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a good picture. History of heart disease in your father, diabetes in your aunt, and elevated cholesterol in your brother. That family history is important to know. Let’s move on to your current lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never been a smoker. My mom smoked for a while, but she quit years ago. I always thought it was a nasty habit. I don't even like being around people who smoke. It makes me cough.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No smoking history. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe three or four times a week? Nothing heavy, just a small glass. And I definitely don’t drink and drive, or anything like that. I’m not a big drinker, really. It’s just a little something to relax with.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a small glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. That’s good to know. And finally, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin every day, just a regular one. And sometimes, when my knees are really aching, I take some ibuprofen. That’s about it, really. Nothing else. I try to stay away from taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a daily multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and never had a reaction. I’ve never had any trouble with penicillin or anything like that. I get a few mosquito bites in the summer, but that’s about it. No allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Okay, Mykeisha, this is all very helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are. I just hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, first reading is 142 over 88. Let me take another one in a few minutes… Okay, 145 over 90. Consistent with what you've been seeing at the pharmacy, a little elevated. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look at your throat and ears… Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Ears appear normal. Okay, everything seems alright on the initial exam, but the blood pressure is elevated and warrants further investigation. Do you have any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing, like headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, sometimes I get a little headache, but that’s probably just from stress at work. And I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't? Nothing major, nothing I'd write home about. No dizziness, no chest pain, no vision changes. Honestly, if my sister hadn’t told me to check my blood pressure, I probably wouldn’t have even noticed anything was wrong. That’s why I came in, though, right? To get it checked out. What do you think it could be?
DOCTOR: You're right to get it checked out, and it’s good you haven’t experienced any alarming symptoms. The headache and fatigue could be related to stress, but we need to rule out other possibilities given your family history and the elevated blood pressure readings. It's too early to say definitively what’s causing it, but high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, can often be managed with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. It’s important to investigate it further to prevent potential complications down the road. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order some routine blood tests. These will check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar, among other things. I also want to do an EKG, which is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests and an EKG, alright. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what's going on and make sure I'm okay. How long will it take to get the results? And do I need to do anything special before the tests? Like fast or anything?
DOCTOR: Great. I'm glad you trust me. Yes, for the blood tests, I will need you to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. The EKG is quick and doesn't require any preparation. We can schedule those tests at the lab right across the hall. It usually takes about 3-5 business days for the results to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I want you to continue monitoring your blood pressure at home, if you have a monitor. If your blood pressure is consistently very high—above 160/100—or if you experience any new symptoms like severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or vision changes, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. So, just fast for 8-12 hours before the tests, keep checking my blood pressure, and come back when the results are ready. And go to the emergency room if anything gets really bad. Got it. Thank you, Dr. Yoshino. I feel a little better knowing we’re getting it checked out. I’ll go schedule those tests now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I'll have the nurse print out a lab requisition form for you, and some written instructions about the fasting and monitoring your blood pressure. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
