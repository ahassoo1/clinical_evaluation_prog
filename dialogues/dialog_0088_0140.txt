DOCTOR: Hello Mr. Schieber, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s… a bit embarrassing, really. It’s a soreness in my mouth. It’s white, and it’s… unpleasant. I haven’t had this since I was a child, frankly. I expect you’ve seen it all before, so let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s not uncommon to experience soreness in the mouth, and you're right, I do see it frequently. It’s good you came in to have it checked. When did you first notice the white soreness?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't recall the exact date. A week, maybe? Perhaps a little longer. I don’t pay much attention to these things. It just… appeared. It’s not like I have time to catalog every ache and pain. I’m a faller, you know. It’s demanding work.
DOCTOR: A week or so ago… alright. And is the soreness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Certainly constant. It’s most noticeable when I eat, of course. And… when I drink. Everything just… irritates it. It’s quite bothersome, really. I’m not one to complain, but it is interfering with my appetite.
DOCTOR: Okay, interfering with your appetite. And where exactly in your mouth is this soreness located?
PATIENT: Everywhere, mostly. The tongue, the insides of my cheeks… it’s a general coating. It’s not localized, if that makes sense. I assure you, it’s not a pleasant sight. It looks… messy.
DOCTOR: Alright, a general coating. Let's take a look, if you don’t mind. Could you open wide for me?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. I have a schedule to keep. Honestly, I don’t see what looking at it will accomplish, but if you insist. It’s probably just something minor.
DOCTOR: Okay… I see some white patches on your tongue and the inner lining of your cheeks. There's some mild redness as well. No obvious sores or bleeding. It does appear to be fairly widespread. Have you noticed any fever, difficulty swallowing, or changes in your taste?
PATIENT: Fever? Absolutely not. I don't have time for fevers. Difficulty swallowing… well, it's a little uncomfortable, yes. But I manage. And my taste? It’s fine. I still enjoy a good steak, thank you very much. It’s just… everything feels a bit… rough. Like sandpaper. Is that all there is to it? Because frankly, I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, some mild discomfort swallowing, and a rough sensation. Have you been taking any medications recently, or have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't believe in all that pharmaceutical nonsense. And illnesses? I work outdoors, of course I get the occasional scrape or cough. Nothing serious. I’m a robust man. I don't coddle myself with visits to the doctor over every little sniffle. This… this is just a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, and you generally stay healthy. Do you use any tobacco products, or drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Do I look like the sort? No. Absolutely not. I maintain a respectable lifestyle. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps. But I do not partake in… vulgar habits. I assure you. This is quite insulting, you know. Asking me these questions. It’s a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine. And, just to confirm, you don’t have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No allergies. Really. Are you quite finished? I have trees to fell, you know. This is becoming rather… tedious. I understand you need to ask questions, but I’ve answered everything I can. It's a bit of white stuff in my mouth. I’m a healthy man. What’s the diagnosis? And more importantly, what’s the cure?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've described and the examination, it sounds most likely like you have oral thrush, also known as candidiasis. It’s a fungal infection in your mouth. It can happen for a variety of reasons, even in healthy individuals. Sometimes it’s triggered by changes in your system, and sometimes it just occurs. Given your preference to avoid medication, we could try some lifestyle adjustments first. I recommend improving your oral hygiene – brush your teeth twice a day and floss regularly. Also, using a saltwater rinse several times a day can help. However, if it doesn’t improve within a week, we may need to consider an antifungal medication. It’s important to get it treated, as it can worsen and potentially spread. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Lifestyle adjustments… Fine. Saltwater, brushing… I suppose I can manage that. But I’m not promising anything. And I absolutely refuse any medication. I’ve told you, I don’t believe in that sort of thing. A week, you say? If it’s not gone in a week, I expect it to simply… disappear on its own. I have no intention of returning for a prescription. Is there anything else? Because frankly, this whole ordeal has been a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, we'll try the saltwater rinses and improved oral hygiene for a week. If it doesn't improve, I strongly recommend reconsidering the medication, but I respect your decision. Here are some instructions for the saltwater rinse: dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in one cup of warm water and swish it around in your mouth for 30 seconds, then spit it out. Do this after meals and before bed. I'll document everything in your chart. If you experience any difficulty swallowing, pain, or fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
