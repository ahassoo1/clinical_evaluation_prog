DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Segretto, yes, that’s right. It’s… well, it’s this bladder of mine. Been going a bit too often, if you catch my drift. It’s just… inconvenient, really. Never had trouble like this before, not that I recall, anyway. My wife, bless her heart, she's the one who made the appointment. She says I'm going to the bathroom every hour. Honestly, I don't even notice that much.
DOCTOR: I see. So, increased urinary frequency is the primary concern, and your wife has noticed it more than you have, perhaps?
PATIENT: Frequency, yes, that’s a fancy way of putting it. And she's got the eyes of a hawk, that woman. Always has. I… honestly, I don’t know if it’s that bad. Maybe I just drink more water now? Or… well, things change as you get older, don’t they? It could be nothing. She worries too much, always has.
DOCTOR: It's good she's attentive to your health, Mr. Segretto. Changes do happen with age, that’s true, and it’s always best to investigate new symptoms just to be sure. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about when this increased frequency started?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start… that’s a tricky one. Now, let me think. It’s been… a few months, maybe? Around springtime, I reckon. Or was it last fall? Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I used to be able to recall dates like they were yesterday, but now… It's all a bit of a blur. I suppose it wasn’t sudden, just… gradual. Like a slow leak, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very common for memory to be affected as we age. Don't worry about being precise, we’ll piece things together. I’m just looking at your records here… I see you’ve had regular check-ups with Dr. Evans. Have you mentioned this urinary frequency to him before?
PATIENT: Evans… Evans… a good doctor, Evans. But he’s mostly concerned with my blood pressure, you see. And my cholesterol. He always tells me to watch my salt intake. I don’t think I’ve specifically mentioned going to the bathroom more. He asks how I’m sleeping, how my appetite is, the usual. I doubt it’s come up. Honestly, I didn’t think it was worth bothering him with. It’s just a little inconvenience, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Besides the increased frequency, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… Let me see. Hmm. Well, sometimes… sometimes I have a bit of trouble starting, you know? Just a little hesitation. Not every time, mind you. And… oh, yes! I wake up once or twice a night to go. Used to sleep right through, like a log. Now… not so much. It’s not painful, not at all. Just… disruptive. My wife complains I keep her awake.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some hesitancy starting urination and waking up at night to urinate as well. Are you experiencing any burning or discomfort when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning? No, no burning at all. None whatsoever. It's not a painful thing, Doctor, I want to make that clear. Just… annoying. It feels… normal, really, when I’m actually going. It's just getting there sometimes, and then having to get up in the middle of the night. It’s just an old man thing, I reckon.
DOCTOR: It's good that there's no pain, Mr. Segretto. However, even without pain, these changes warrant investigation. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask you a few more questions about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Now, let’s see. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but that cleared up nicely. And my knees, they bother me somethin’ awful when the weather changes. Arthritis, the doctor says. Other than that… I was a pretty healthy fella, always working on the farm. Didn’t have much time for illness, to be honest. I used to be quite strong, you know. Built this house with my own two hands.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you were so active. Pneumonia and arthritis noted. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Ah, yes! I had my appendix out when I was a young man. Back in… oh, goodness, must have been the 1950s. And… and I had a hernia repaired a long time ago, too. That was… uncomfortable. But both of those healed up just fine. Nothing major since then, thankfully. I don't hold with unnecessary poking and prodding, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother, she had… well, she had something with her heart. Not sure what exactly. And my father… he was a strong man, but he did have trouble with his kidneys towards the end. He was always tired, you see. Not much else, to be honest. We weren't a family that talked much about our ailments. Just… tough it out, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. History of heart condition in your mother and kidney issues in your father noted. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, no allergies that I know of. I've always been able to take most things. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle sometimes with pollen, but nothing serious. My wife is the one with allergies, bless her heart. Always sneezing and wheezing. I’ve never been bothered much by them, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, yes! I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And something for my cholesterol, another little pill. My doctor keeps telling me to take a baby aspirin, too, but I forget most of the time. Honestly, Doctor, I’m terrible with remembering pills. My wife keeps them organized for me. She’s the one who really knows what I’m supposed to be taking.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful. So, medication for blood pressure, cholesterol, and occasionally aspirin. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief abdominal exam. It'll help me get a better sense of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Physical exam, eh? Well… alright. But don’t poke too much. I’m an old man, you know. Bones are a bit creaky. But yes, go ahead. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just… be gentle. And if I start rambling, just ignore me. My mind wanders sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And don’t worry about rambling; I’m used to it. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Okay. Your heart rate is a little on the slow side, which is fairly common. I'm hearing slightly diminished breath sounds, especially at the bases of your lungs. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a slight fullness in your bladder. No pain with palpation. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I think it’s best to order a urinalysis and a blood test to check your kidney function. We should also check your prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, to rule out any prostate issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Urinalysis, blood test, PSA… good heavens. Sounds complicated. But alright, Doctor. If you think it's best. Honestly, I don't know what half of those things are. But I trust your judgment. Just… try to keep it simple, alright? And don't poke too much. I'm an old man, remember?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I'll keep everything as simple as possible. The urinalysis is just a sample of your urine to check for infection or other abnormalities. The blood test will give us information about your kidney function and overall health. And the PSA test is a simple blood test to screen for prostate problems. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood and collect a urine sample. She’ll explain the process to you in more detail. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to drink a normal amount of fluids and avoid caffeine and alcohol. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Caffeine and alcohol… well, I do enjoy a little brandy in the evenings, but I can cut back. Alright. I suppose that makes sense. No, Doctor… not right now. I think you've explained everything pretty well. Just… try to hurry up with the results, alright? I don't like waiting around. And tell the nurse to be gentle. I’m an old man, remember?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I'll make sure the nurse is gentle, and I'll do my best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they’re available. Thank you for coming in today. If anything changes or if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… thorough. And gentle, for the most part. I suppose I’ll be seeing you again soon.
