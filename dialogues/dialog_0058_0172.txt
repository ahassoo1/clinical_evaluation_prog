DOCTOR: Alright, Candice, good morning. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here, really. Some… arrangement, I suppose. My husband insisted. Something about… settling in? We just moved, you know. From… well, it doesn’t matter where we moved from. It was a perfectly good place. A much better place, truthfully. But he wanted a change. So here I am. I suppose you’re supposed to ask me questions? Get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, settling in is important, and sometimes a check-up is a good place to start, even if you don't feel unwell. Though frankly, it's usually the patient who initiates these things. Let’s just run through a few things to get a baseline, alright?
PATIENT: Baseline? Is that some sort of… measurement? Honestly, I don’t understand why I need a “baseline.” I feel perfectly fine. As fine as one can be, considering… everything. And I assure you, I am not one for measurements. I used to be quite slender, you know. Before… well, never mind. Just ask your questions, dear. The quicker we finish, the better.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, a baseline is simply a record of your current health status. It helps us track any changes in the future. It's… standard procedure. Let's start with your current symptoms, if any. You said you feel “perfectly fine,” but are you experiencing anything at all – even something minor?
PATIENT: Oh, symptoms. Goodness. Well… my knees ache a bit, sometimes. Especially when the weather changes. It’s just old age, I suppose. And I get… rather tired. But everyone gets tired, don't they? It’s hardly a symptom. Though, truthfully, I haven’t been sleeping well. My husband snores, you see. Dreadfully. It’s quite disruptive. Is that… is that a symptom? Honestly, I just want a good night's sleep.
DOCTOR: Right. Knees, fatigue, sleep disturbance. And the snoring is… noted. It’s unlikely the snoring itself is a medical issue, but the lack of sleep is relevant. Do you have any other complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? Oh, goodness, where to begin? My neighbor’s dog barks incessantly. The grocery store always runs out of my preferred brand of tea. And the television programs these days… utterly dreadful. But I suppose you mean about my health? No. Nothing beyond what I’ve already mentioned. Really. I’m a perfectly healthy woman for my age. Or, at least, I was before… everything.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s move on to your medical history then. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… Now that’s a question. Honestly, it was so long ago… I had something when I was a girl, a fever, I think. And I broke my arm once, climbing a tree. A rather silly thing, really. I was always a bit of a tomboy. But beyond that… no. Nothing significant. I’ve always been very careful with my health. Though… my mother had something… a heart condition, I believe. But that was years and years ago. I can’t recall the specifics.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fever as a child, broken arm. Maternal history of… heart condition, unspecified. And you said you’ve been careful with your health. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, no. I refuse to take medications. All those chemicals… dreadful things. I prefer natural remedies, when necessary. A cup of chamomile tea, a warm bath… that sorts most things out. Though… the doctor once prescribed me something for my nerves. Years ago. But I didn't take it. It sounded… unpleasant. And frankly, I don’t see the point in relying on pills when a bit of common sense will suffice.
DOCTOR: Right. No current medications. Chamomile tea and… common sense. Very good. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’m not one for allergies. Although… I do get a bit of a sniffle sometimes in the spring. But that’s just the pollen, I suppose. It’s hardly a serious allergy. And I once had a bit of a rash after eating shellfish. But that was years ago, and I haven’t touched the stuff since. Honestly, I prefer a nice roast chicken. Much more sensible.
DOCTOR: Right. Mild seasonal allergies, shellfish sensitivity… years ago. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline, as we discussed. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Honestly. Is it absolutely necessary? I haven’t the slightest idea why I need to be… examined. I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. But… very well. If you insist. Get it over with quickly, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. And I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. It’s standard procedure. 140 over 85. Not ideal. Heart sounds… regular, but slightly fast. Lungs… clear, but some diminished breath sounds at the bases. Alright. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, and your blood pressure is slightly high. Your lungs sound a bit… congested. Nothing alarming, but it warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Congested? Goodness. I don't feel congested. Perhaps it's all the dust in this… rural area. Honestly, I prefer a city. Much cleaner. And my heart rate is fast? Well, I've always been a bit of a nervous person. All this… poking and prodding isn't helping, you know. Is there anything else you need to do? Because frankly, I’m starting to feel quite faint. And I haven't the slightest idea what "warrants further investigation" even means.
DOCTOR: "Warrants further investigation" means we should look into why your heart rate and blood pressure are elevated. It could be due to a number of factors, and we need to rule out anything serious. Now, I'd like to order some basic blood work. It will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and complete blood count. And, given your age and elevated blood pressure, I'm also going to recommend an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An EKG? Blood work? Goodness gracious. It sounds… invasive. And costly, I presume? Honestly, I’m starting to regret agreeing to this whole… arrangement. I feel perfectly fine, you know. A bit tired, perhaps, and my knees ache, but those are just… normal aches and pains. Are you certain this is necessary? I’ve never had an EKG in my life, and frankly, I don’t intend to start now.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Engelhaupt, I understand your reluctance, but these tests are standard procedure for someone your age with these findings. High blood pressure is a serious condition, and we need to rule out anything concerning. It’s not about whether you feel fine, it’s about identifying potential problems before they become serious. Refusing these tests is… not advisable. It’s a basic precaution. The EKG is non-invasive – it simply records your heart’s electrical activity. And the blood work will give us a comprehensive overview of your health. Frankly, it’s irresponsible not to investigate this further. Do you want me to explain the risks of untreated high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Untreated high blood pressure? Honestly, I find your tone rather… condescending. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions regarding my health. And I do not appreciate being lectured. My husband insisted on this visit, you see, and frankly, I’m starting to suspect he simply wants to get rid of me. He's always been a bit of a… control freak. Very well. Order your tests. But I want a full explanation of the costs upfront, and I expect a detailed report of the findings. And if it turns out to be nothing, I expect a full apology for the inconvenience. Now, get on with it.
DOCTOR: Right. I will order the blood work and EKG. The lab and EKG technician will explain the costs upfront. I'll also have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available, to discuss them in detail. The results will take approximately 5-7 business days. And the nurse will provide information on how to access them online, should you wish to review them before your appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That will be all. Though, I must say, this has been a most… unpleasant experience. I sincerely hope the results are negative, and I can finally put this ordeal behind me. And please, do try to be more… considerate with your patients in the future. A little kindness goes a long way. Oh, and tell your nurse to remind me about the costs. I do not wish to be surprised.
