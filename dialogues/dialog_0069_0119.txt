DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, truthfully. It’s a problem with… a friend. A male friend. And it’s… leaking. Something is leaking from him, and it’s not… pleasant. I’m not quite sure what to do about it. He’s very distressed, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wartick. It’s alright, no need to be embarrassed. These things happen, and we can certainly figure this out together. When you say "leaking," can you tell me a little more about where it's leaking from, and what it looks like?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, it’s… down there, of course. From him, you understand. It’s… yellowish. And a bit… thick, I suppose. Not like water, definitely not. And there's a… smell. A rather unpleasant smell. He tried to clean it up himself, but it just… kept coming. It's been going on for… oh, I don't know, maybe a week now? It’s quite worrying. He’s not usually… like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Ms. Wartick. That's helpful. A yellowish discharge with an odor, lasting about a week… that gives us something to work with. Is he experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. He did mention a bit of… burning. When he, well, goes to the bathroom. And he says it’s… uncomfortable. Not terribly painful, but definitely… noticeable. He’s also been rather… irritable lately. Snapping at me, which is very unusual. He's normally such a sweet man. Could that be connected, do you think? It’s all very distressing, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wartick, those symptoms definitely could be connected. Burning with urination and irritability… Okay. Has he noticed any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever. He feels a bit… tired, perhaps. But he’s always been a bit of a napper, you know? And no chills, thankfully. And no, he hasn’t complained of any pain. Just the… discomfort. And the leakage, of course. Honestly, Doctor, it's quite shocking. He’s usually so meticulous about his… hygiene. This is very out of character. I worry it’s something… serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wartick. It's good that he doesn't have a fever or abdominal pain, but the discharge and burning sensation warrant investigation. Given his symptoms, it sounds like we need to consider a possible infection. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? He would have to be the one for that, wouldn't he? I… I’m not sure he'd be comfortable with that. And frankly, neither am I, discussing such things. Is there absolutely no other way? Perhaps some sort of… test? A urine sample, perhaps? I just… it all feels so… intrusive.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask, Ms. Wartick. I completely understand your discomfort and his potential reluctance. A physical exam would be the most helpful way to assess the situation, but we can absolutely start with a urine sample. That will give us some initial information to work with and help determine the next steps. It can help us identify if there is an infection present. We can also discuss the possibility of a referral to a urologist if he's more comfortable with a specialist conducting a more thorough examination. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A urine sample… yes, that sounds much better. He can manage that. Though, honestly, the thought of him having to… collect it… it’s a bit awkward. He's a very private man. But yes, let's start with that. And a referral… perhaps that would be best. He's terribly shy, you see. Perhaps a specialist would be less… startling. Do you have a form for the sample? And for the referral, of course.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. I have both forms right here. This one is for the urine sample collection – it explains the proper procedure to ensure an accurate result. And this one is a referral form for a urologist. We can fill out the basic information now, and then the urologist’s office will contact him to schedule an appointment. Would you like me to help you with the form?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be most kind, Doctor. I’m not very good with these things, truthfully. His name is… Reginald Wartick. R-E-G-I-N-A-L-D. And his date of birth is… November 12th, 1938. Is that how it goes on the form? I always get the month and day mixed up. And his insurance is Medicare, of course. He’s a very… careful man, you see, always making sure everything is in order.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect, Ms. Wartick. November 12th, 1938. And Medicare is all we need for the insurance information. Okay, and what's his primary care physician's name?
PATIENT: Hmm… Dr. Abernathy. Yes, Dr. Eleanor Abernathy. She’s very good, Reginald always says. A bit… brusque, perhaps, but very knowledgeable. She’s at… the City General Hospital, I believe. On Elm Street. I’m not entirely sure of the number, honestly. He handles all the appointments himself. Oh, and his phone number is 555-1234. That hasn’t changed in… decades.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Here's the completed referral form, and this is the container for the urine sample. He'll need to collect a "midstream" sample – the instructions are on the side of the container, but essentially, he should start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream, and finish urinating. It’s important to try and collect a clean sample. Once he has the sample, he can bring it to the lab here at the clinic, and they’ll get it tested. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend he drinks plenty of fluids, and avoids any caffeine or alcohol, which can irritate the bladder. If he experiences any fever, severe pain, or worsening symptoms, he should seek immediate medical attention. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think so. Midstream… lots of fluids… no caffeine. It all sounds… very sensible. He’ll do his best. Thank you for being so patient with me. This whole thing is rather… unsettling. And thank you for not… making me feel foolish. I appreciate that very much. I suppose we'll just wait for the results, then. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wartick. I understand your concern, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or if his condition worsens. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Take care, and please encourage Reginald to rest and stay hydrated.
