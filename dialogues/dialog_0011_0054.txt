DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh... cough, yeah. Been coughing a lot. And tired. Really tired, like all the time. Also, my nose... always stuffy, then runny. Happens a lot. I don't... remember exactly when it started, just... a while.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Tati. A cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion… that does sound bothersome. When you say “a while,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough... hmm. Maybe... six months? Or more? It’s hard to say. Work keeps me busy, you know? Tire shop... lots of lifting, dirty. I don't really pay attention to dates, sorry. It just... got worse slowly.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Tati. A busy work schedule can certainly make it difficult to keep track of things. Six months or more, gradually worsening… that’s helpful information. Now, regarding the cough – is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Uh... yeah, bringing stuff up. Like... mucus. Sometimes clear, sometimes... yellow-ish. Not always, but often. Especially in the morning. It’s... not nice. Sorry. And it makes my chest feel tight sometimes.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Tati. Describing your symptoms is the most important thing. Yellow mucus can be indicative of an infection, but it’s not always the case. And the chest tightness is something we’ll want to investigate further. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats associated with this cough and fatigue?
PATIENT: Fever... I don't think so. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but not like... shivering cold. No chills, no. And... night sweats? I sleep pretty hot, always have. So... hard to tell if it's sweat or just... hot. Sorry, I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Tati. You're doing just fine. It’s better to be thorough, even if it’s difficult to pinpoint specifics. Let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any shortness of breath, or any pain when you breathe?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath... sometimes, yeah. When I'm really working hard, lifting heavy tires. But I thought that was just... from the work. Pain... not really. Just... tired. Chest feels heavy sometimes, but not painful. It's... hard to explain. Like someone is sitting on my chest.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sensation of heaviness is important to note. Do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Asthma... no. Never been told that. Bronchitis... maybe? A long time ago, when I was a kid? I don't really remember. My mother... she took care of me. Pneumonia... I don't think so. I've been sick before, of course, but nothing serious. Just... normal colds and flus. Sorry, I'm not good with remembering things.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Tati. We'll try to piece everything together. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoke. My wife doesn't like it. And... it doesn't seem good for you, right? I drink sometimes, a little beer with dinner, but that's it. Not much.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Tati. Now, regarding your fatigue – is it constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's... mostly all the time. But worse in the afternoon. After work, I just want to sleep. Even on weekends. My wife says I sleep too much. It’s… hard to do things. Even just… walking around feels tiring. It’s not like before.
DOCTOR: I see. A persistent fatigue, especially worsening in the afternoon, and impacting your daily activities. We need to investigate the cause of this. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh... no, Doctor. I don't think so. I go to the clinic sometimes for check-ups, but they always say I'm okay. Just... normal. My wife takes me when I need to go. I don’t really ask many questions. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Tati. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries... hmm. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football. They fixed it, I think. But that was a long time ago. Nothing else, I don't think. Just the arm. It's okay now. I can lift tires, see? It doesn't hurt.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history... my father... he had problems with his heart, I think. He died when I was young. My mother... she was okay, mostly. Just... old age. She had a cough sometimes, but nothing like this. My wife's family... I don't know them very well. Sorry, I don't really keep up with those things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tati. That’s alright. A history of heart problems in your father is something we should keep in mind. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just… sometimes I take a painkiller for my back, after lifting tires. But not very often. Just when it’s really bad. It's… the normal one, you know? From the shop. Sorry, I don't know the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tati. No regular medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies... no, I don't think so. Sometimes my skin gets itchy, but that's just from the dirt at the shop. Nothing serious. My wife says I'm pretty tough. Sorry, I don't know much about allergies. I just... get on with things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tati, thank you for answering all of my questions. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… don’t take too long, okay? I need to get back to the shop. Tires are waiting. But I appreciate you seeing me. Sorry for not being very helpful with the remembering.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tati. I’ll be as efficient as possible. And you’ve been very helpful, providing the information you do remember. First, let’s listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out… and again… Okay. I hear some mild wheezing in your lungs, which could be contributing to your cough and shortness of breath. Now, let me check your heart rate and blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your pulse is slightly fast, but not significantly. Now, could you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Just… don’t poke too much, okay? It’s a bit sensitive. I’ve been coughing a lot, you know.
DOCTOR: Your throat is a little red, which is consistent with a cough, but there's nothing alarming. Now, let me take a look at your ears. Your ears look normal, thankfully. Alright, Mr. Tati. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you are experiencing symptoms of a respiratory infection, possibly bronchitis or a reactive airway disease like asthma. The wheezing I heard in your lungs supports this. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray… and blood? Okay. If you think it's necessary. But… how much will it cost? I don’t have insurance, you know. My wife… she worries about money. And… I need to get back to the shop soon. But… if it will help, I’ll do it. Just… let me know how much first, okay? I need to call my wife.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Tati. It’s wise to be mindful of costs, especially without insurance. Let me check the approximate costs for you. Okay, a chest X-ray will be approximately $150, and a complete blood count will be about $80. So, the total would be around $230. We can also discuss payment options, and I can provide a receipt for you to submit to any potential assistance programs your wife may be aware of. I can also write a note detailing your symptoms and the need for these tests to explain to potential financial assistance resources. Would you like me to proceed with ordering those tests, or would you prefer to discuss other options first?
PATIENT: $230… That's… a lot. My wife will not be happy. Hmm. Is there… anything else we can do? Like… medicine? Just something to stop the cough and make me less tired? I really need to get back to work. The tires… they won’t fix themselves. I don’t want to spend $230 if we can avoid it. If the medicine doesn't work… then maybe the tests? But… $230 is a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tati. It’s reasonable to want to explore less expensive options first. While the X-ray and blood count would provide a more definitive diagnosis, we can certainly try a symptomatic treatment plan to see if it provides relief. I can prescribe you a cough suppressant to help with the coughing, and recommend an over-the-counter decongestant to help with the nasal congestion. I also recommend getting plenty of rest and drinking lots of fluids. However, I want to be clear: Without the X-ray and blood count, we won’t be able to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, such as pneumonia or other lung conditions. If your symptoms worsen, or don’t improve within a week, it's important to come back for further evaluation, including the X-ray and blood count. Would you like me to write a prescription for the cough suppressant, and discuss some over-the-counter options for the decongestant?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah. Cough suppressant sounds good. And… tell me about the decongestant. What kind? I don’t want anything too strong. I need to be able to work. And… if it doesn’t get better in a week… then I’ll come back. $230… my wife… she’ll be relieved. Thanks, Doctor. You understand. It’s hard to get time off. Tires, you know? They don't fix themselves. What kind of cough suppressant are we talking about? And how much will that cost? Just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Tati. I completely understand your situation. I'm going to prescribe you guaifenesin and dextromethorphan, a combination medication that helps to both loosen mucus and suppress the cough reflex. It's generally well-tolerated and shouldn’t cause significant drowsiness. The cost should be around $15-$20 at most pharmacies. For the decongestant, I recommend pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine. Pseudoephedrine is more effective, but it’s kept behind the counter because it can be used to make methamphetamine, so you’ll need to show identification to purchase it. Phenylephrine is available over-the-counter, but it’s generally less effective. Either one should cost around $10-$15. I’ll also provide a printed sheet with instructions on how to take the medication and potential side effects. It’s important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, just to be absolutely sure before I finalize this prescription?
PATIENT: No allergies. I told you that, right? No allergies. Just… dirt. Sometimes my skin gets itchy from the dirt at the shop. But that’s it. No medicine allergies. Okay. So… $35 total? For the cough stuff and the decongestant? My wife… she can manage that. Thanks, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate it. I need to get back to the shop. The tires… they’re waiting. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tati. That's correct – approximately $35 total. And you’re very welcome. I'm glad I could help. Here’s the prescription and the information sheet. The pharmacy should be able to fill it right away. Please remember, if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a week, come back for further evaluation, including the chest X-ray and blood count. And don’t hesitate to come back sooner if you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Thank you for coming in today, and I wish you a speedy recovery. Please drive safely, and get back to those tires. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s everything. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your understanding. Tires… they’re waiting. Oh, and… tell your wife thank you too. She worries a lot.
