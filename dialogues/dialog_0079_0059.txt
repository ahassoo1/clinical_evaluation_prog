DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you’re nineteen years of age. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, um... yes, nineteen. It's... well, it's my speech, I think. It’s been a bit… off. Hard to explain, really. It feels like I'm not saying things clearly, sometimes.
DOCTOR: "Off," you say. An imprecise term, unfortunately. Could you elaborate on that, Ms. Swaby?
PATIENT: Elaborate... yes, alright. It’s like… the words get jumbled, I suppose. Not all the time, you understand. And it’s not like I can’t get the words out, just… they don’t always come out how I mean for them to. It's a bit frustrating, honestly. I don't recall when it started, exactly... maybe a few weeks ago? Or was it months? It's all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, or months... yes, a rather significant timeframe. And the “jumbling” – is this consistent, or does it occur more frequently under certain circumstances?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Um… I don't think it's consistent, no. When I'm tired, definitely worse. And, well, when I'm… busy, with work, I think. Construction is a lot, you know? Lots of shouting, and… moving around. It's hard to say for sure, really. It doesn’t happen all the time, just… at odd moments. I haven't noticed anything specific that causes it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Construction work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Construction Managers, that's what it says on the paperwork, isn’t it? I help coordinate things on the site. It's… a lot of responsibility, to be honest. Long hours, lots of people to keep track of. It’s physical work too, not just paperwork. Though, truthfully, I'm not quite sure why I’m telling you all of this. It just… feels relevant, somehow. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Relevant information is always useful, Ms. Swaby. Do you experience any difficulty understanding what others say, or is the issue solely with your own speech?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no trouble understanding others. Thankfully. It’s definitely me speaking that's the problem. People look… confused, sometimes. Or ask me to repeat myself. It's not constant, but it happens. It’s just… embarrassing, more than anything, you know? I’m usually quite clear with my instructions on the job site, and I need people to understand me. It's a bit worrisome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Worrisome, yes, I understand. Now, have you experienced any changes in your hearing, dizziness, headaches, or weakness in any part of your body?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. No, no changes in my hearing, I don't think. And no dizziness, either. Headaches... well, I get headaches sometimes, but everyone gets headaches, right? They’re not new, just… regular headaches. As for weakness... no, nothing like that. I'm on my feet all day at work, lifting things, climbing around. I haven’t noticed any difference in my strength, thankfully. Though, I do get very tired, as I mentioned. But I think that’s just from the work.
DOCTOR: Fatigue is certainly a plausible explanation, given your profession. Do you take any medications currently, Ms. Swaby?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not regularly. Just… sometimes, for a headache, I'll take… ibuprofen, I think it is. Or something like that. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter. And I haven't been taking it more recently, if that’s what you’re wondering. I really don't like taking pills if I can avoid it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Ms. Swaby?
PATIENT: No, sir, not that I know of. My mother always said I was a very hardy baby. Never had any reactions to anything. We... we didn’t have much in the way of fancy foods growing up, so I haven’t really had the opportunity to be allergic to many things, if that makes sense. It's all a bit… hazy, to be honest, recalling things from when I was little.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, Ms. Swaby, to assist with a proper evaluation, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will involve a neurological assessment, checking your reflexes, coordination, and perhaps a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on, if that’s alright. A neurological assessment… that sounds… thorough. Yes, please, go ahead. I'll just sit here, won't I? Let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you would just sit on the table, please. Now, could you tell me your date of birth, just for verification?
PATIENT: Oh, um... let me think. It’s… August 14th, 2006. Yes, that's correct. I think. It’s just… been a long day already, and my head feels a bit fuzzy. I hope that's alright. It's all a bit... strange, this feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby, let's start with your cranial nerves. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that alright? I'm trying not to blink too much. It feels a bit… strange, looking like that. I hope I’m doing it correctly.
DOCTOR: <stage>I observe her eye movements carefully. "Good. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Like that? Is that what you wanted? It feels… stiff. I usually smile more naturally, I think. Though, truthfully, I haven’t had much to smile about lately, with all this stress at work. Is that alright? Should I smile wider? I feel a bit silly, doing this.
DOCTOR: That is fine, Ms. Swaby. Now, can you please stick out your tongue?
PATIENT: Like that, Doctor? It feels a bit awkward. It just… hangs there, doesn't it? Is there something wrong? I'm a bit worried now, if I'm being honest. It doesn't feel quite right.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed.
PATIENT: Like that? Is that alright? It feels a bit strange, being poked and prodded like this. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… odd. I hope you’re finding something out, Doctor. This is all a bit worrying, truthfully. I just want to be able to speak clearly again, and get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Is that alright? Is it strong enough? I'm trying my best, Doctor. I've been doing a lot of physical work lately, so my hands are usually quite strong. I hope that helps. Is there anything else you need me to do? I’m starting to feel a little… anxious, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Now, I’d like you to touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger. We’ll repeat this a few times.
PATIENT: Oh… that wasn’t very good, was it? It feels a bit… off. My hands feel shaky, and I’m having trouble controlling my movements. I apologize, Doctor. I’m usually quite coordinated. Is there something wrong? I’m starting to feel quite worried now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Thank you for your cooperation. I’ve completed the examination. Now, based on your history and the findings of this physical examination, I’m concerned about possible neurological involvement. The slight weakness and diminished reflexes on your left side, coupled with the coordination issues, are concerning. However, this could be due to a number of factors, including stress, fatigue, or a more serious underlying condition. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some further testing. This will include an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities, as well as blood work to check for any underlying medical conditions. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… serious. An MRI… and blood work? Structural abnormalities? Underlying medical conditions? Is it… is it something bad, Doctor? I just want to be able to speak clearly again, and get back to work. I’m… I’m not sure I understand. Would the tests… would they hurt? I… yes, I suppose I’m agreeable to whatever you think is best. If it will help figure out what’s wrong. But… what are we looking for exactly? And… how long will it take? I just feel… overwhelmed, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Swaby. It is better to be thorough and rule out any potential causes. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the brain. It does not involve any radiation and is generally very safe. The blood work will simply involve taking a sample of your blood to check for any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. We are looking for any structural abnormalities in the brain, such as tumors or lesions, as well as any signs of inflammation or infection. The blood work will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or autoimmune disorders. The results of these tests typically take a few days to come back. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I would like to recommend that you get plenty of rest and avoid any strenuous activity. I also recommend avoiding any stressful situations, as stress can exacerbate your symptoms. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Plenty of rest... avoid stress... that’s easier said than done, Doctor. No tumors... or lesions... that’s… good to hear. But… inflammation? Autoimmune disorders? I don't understand any of this. What does that mean? And… how long will I have to wait for the results? A few days… is that a couple of days, or… a week? I just want to know what’s wrong, and get it fixed. Is there anything I can do… right now? To make it better? I feel… lost, if I’m being honest. And a little scared.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Swaby, and it is perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed in this situation. Inflammation simply means that there is some irritation or swelling in the brain, which can be caused by a number of factors. Autoimmune disorders are conditions in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues, which can also affect the brain. However, these are just possibilities, and we need to wait for the test results to determine the exact cause of your symptoms. “A few days” typically means three to five business days for the results to come back. I will contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help manage your symptoms. Getting plenty of rest and avoiding stress are the most important things. You can also try to stay hydrated and eat a healthy diet. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, can help manage any headaches or discomfort. I will also provide you with a referral to a neurologist, who is a specialist in brain disorders. They can provide a more comprehensive evaluation and help determine the best course of treatment. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: A neurologist… okay. That sounds… serious again. Ibuprofen… yes, I've been taking that. It helps a little, but not much. Is there anything else I can do… besides rest and avoid stress? That’s… difficult, Doctor. I have a job. People are relying on me. I can’t just… stop everything. And… what if it is something serious? What’s the worst-case scenario? I know I shouldn’t ask, but… I need to know. Just… be honest with me, Doctor. Even if it’s bad news. I think… I think I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Please, do sit down, Ms. Swaby. It's important you're comfortable. I understand your concerns, and it's natural to want to prepare for the worst. However, it’s also important to remember that we haven’t received the test results yet. Jumping to conclusions won’t help and will likely only increase your anxiety. Regarding the worst-case scenario, it’s difficult to say definitively without knowing the cause of your symptoms. Potential causes, if structural, could include a tumor or stroke, but these are significantly less common. If it’s related to inflammation, it could be caused by an infection or autoimmune disorder, which can often be treated with medication. The severity of these conditions varies greatly depending on the underlying cause and the extent of the damage. However, it’s crucial to remember that many conditions that cause neurological symptoms are treatable, and even reversible. That’s why it’s so important to get the test results and determine the exact cause of your symptoms. I will provide you with a referral to a neurologist, as I mentioned. They can perform a more comprehensive evaluation and discuss all of your treatment options. I will also give you information on support groups and resources for individuals with neurological conditions. In the meantime, please try to remain calm and avoid stressing yourself out. I understand that’s easier said than done, but it’s important for your overall health and well-being. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as severe headache, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Emergency room… okay. I’ll remember that. Severe headache, weakness… A tumor… a stroke… autoimmune… It sounds so… frightening. I… I don't think I can remember all of this. And… I don’t even know what an autoimmune disorder is. I just want to go home. And… sleep. Is it alright if I just… go home now? I don't think I can handle much more. I'll take the referral, and… the information. But… I just need to go home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Swaby. Please, go home. It’s clear you’re not feeling well, and it's important to prioritize your health. Take as much time as you need to rest and recover. Here is the referral to a neurologist, Dr. Eleanor Vance. Her office number is listed on the packet. Don't hesitate to call them and schedule an appointment. They can answer all of your questions and provide a more comprehensive evaluation. The information packet contains resources on neurological conditions and support groups. I will also call you in a few days to check on you and see how you are doing. Please remember that you are not alone in this, and I am here to support you in any way I can. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, please do not hesitate to go to the emergency room. Take care, Ms. Swaby. And please, don’t worry. We will figure this out together. .
