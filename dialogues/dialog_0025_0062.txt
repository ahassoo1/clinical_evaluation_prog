DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor Fourney. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks, and I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps alternative arrangements. It’s… well, it’s causing me some difficulty.
DOCTOR: Masks, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. You see, my work involves… direct contact with people who are often in vulnerable states. And while I understand the need for protection, the masks themselves… they present a challenge for me. Not a physical one, precisely, but… it affects my ability to properly do my job, and to connect with folks. It’s hard to explain, but it’s important to me to be fully present and responsive, and the mask feels like a… barrier.
DOCTOR: "Properly do your job"?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I work as a Protective Service Worker. It involves a lot of… reading people, understanding their emotions, building trust quickly. It’s often with individuals who have experienced trauma, or are in crisis. The mask… it makes it harder to see their expressions, to hear their tone of voice clearly. Small things, perhaps, but they are vital when trying to assess someone's well-being, and to let them know I am truly listening and present with them. It’s about building rapport, and feeling safe enough to share. Do you understand what I mean?
DOCTOR: So, you’re saying a piece of cloth is interfering with your… intuition?
PATIENT: That’s… a way to put it, Doctor. Perhaps "intuition" is too strong a word. It’s more that it interferes with my ability to accurately perceive non-verbal cues. My training emphasizes those cues – body language, facial expressions, subtle changes in tone. They are how I determine the best course of action, and how I ensure the safety of those I am assisting. It’s not just about hearing what someone says, it’s about seeing and feeling what they are truly communicating. It's very important work, and accuracy is paramount.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get some background. You're 47, Medicare, and… Protective Service Worker. Any relevant medical history that might explain a sensitivity to… facial coverings?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing that I am aware of. I've always been in good health, thankfully. No allergies, no breathing issues, no… sensitivities that I know of. I’ve never had a problem with wearing things, generally. It's not the wearing of the mask itself, but what it obscures—the ability to see and connect. I’ve considered the possibility that it’s a… psychological resistance, perhaps, but it’s genuinely affecting my work performance, and more importantly, my ability to serve those who need it. I’ve always prided myself on being fully present for folks, and I’m concerned this is hindering that ability.
DOCTOR: So, you want a medical exemption because… you feel it's harder to do your job?
PATIENT: That’s… a simplified way to put it, Doctor, and I apologize if I’m not explaining it clearly. It’s not simply a feeling. It’s based on my professional training and years of experience. My effectiveness is directly tied to my ability to read non-verbal cues, and the mask obstructs that. It’s about providing the best possible care and support to vulnerable individuals, and ensuring their safety, and the safety of others. I’m not asking for special treatment, I’m requesting a discussion of alternative arrangements that would allow me to continue performing my duties effectively, while also respecting the need for caution. Perhaps there are other protective measures I could take? Or adjustments to my work environment? I am open to suggestions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Let’s run through a standard review of systems. Just to be thorough. Starting with your head… any frequent headaches?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No frequent headaches, thankfully. I do occasionally experience a mild tension headache, like many folks do, especially when stressed, but nothing debilitating or regular. I haven't noticed any correlation between the headaches and wearing a mask, though. No dizziness, vision problems, or ringing in the ears either. My hearing is good, as far as I know. I’ve always had a clear head, so to speak. It's more a matter of what reaches my head, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Eyes?
PATIENT: No problems with my eyes, Doctor. I have regular check-ups, and my vision is 20/20. No blurry vision, floaters, or sensitivity to light. I wear glasses for reading, as you can see, but that's just a normal age-related change. I’ve never had any issues that would prevent me from accurately perceiving facial expressions, and it’s something I’ve always prided myself on. It’s not that I can’t see, it’s that what is obscured makes it more difficult to assess situations effectively. I hope I'm explaining myself clearly? It’s a subtle difference, perhaps, but it’s vital to my work.
DOCTOR: And you’re certain this isn’t just… anxiety about wearing a mask?
PATIENT: Doctor, I appreciate you asking, and I’ve certainly considered that possibility. It’s true, the masks are… unsettling, in a way. They change the dynamic of interaction, and make it harder to connect. But I don't believe it's simple anxiety. I've spent my career in situations that truly induce anxiety – dealing with crisis situations, assessing safety risks, interacting with individuals in distress. This feels different. It’s a functional impairment, not an emotional one. It affects my ability to accurately gather information, to build trust, and to provide effective support. I can remain calm and focused despite the mask, but it doesn't change the fact that it obstructs my ability to perform my job effectively. Perhaps a better way to put it is… it feels like I'm working at a disadvantage, and that disadvantages those I am trying to help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Nose and throat… any congestion, runny nose, sore throat?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those things. My nose is clear, and my throat is fine. I haven't had a cold or any respiratory issues in years, thankfully. I maintain good health, and I'm careful to avoid illness. I do occasionally experience dry sinuses in the winter, but nothing significant. And, again, none of those things are affected by wearing a mask. The issue isn't a physical discomfort, but rather the obstruction of visual and auditory cues. I apologize if I'm repeating myself, but I want to be as clear as possible about the nature of the problem. It’s not a medical ailment, but a functional impairment related to my work environment.
DOCTOR: So, let me get this straight. You want a medical exemption from wearing a mask because it interferes with your ability to… read faces for your job?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… a concise way to put it, and I appreciate you attempting to summarize my explanation. It’s more nuanced than simply “reading faces,” but yes, that’s at the core of it. It's my ability to accurately assess non-verbal cues – facial expressions, body language, tone of voice – which are vital to my work as a Protective Service Worker. It’s how I ensure the safety of those I assist, how I build trust, and how I determine the best course of action. The mask obscures those cues, and that creates a functional impairment. It’s not a physical ailment, but it affects my ability to perform my job effectively and ethically. I understand it may seem… unusual, but it’s a genuine concern, and I’m hoping we can find a solution that respects both the need for caution and my ability to provide effective support to those who need it. Is there anything else I can clarify? I'm happy to go into more detail about my training, or the specific challenges I'm facing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, with all due respect, this is highly unusual. I've been practicing medicine for thirteen years, and I've never encountered a request like this before. It sounds to me like you're experiencing some discomfort with a change in your work environment, and you're attributing it to an inability to "read faces." I’m not seeing a medical basis for an exemption.
PATIENT: I understand your skepticism, Doctor, and I truly appreciate your honesty. It is unusual, and I recognize that puts you in a difficult position. I wouldn’t be requesting this if it weren’t a genuine concern that affects my ability to perform my job ethically and effectively. It’s not simply discomfort with a change in my work environment; it’s a functional impairment directly related to my professional training and years of experience. Perhaps I can explain it this way: imagine a detective trying to solve a case without being able to see the expressions on witnesses’ faces. It would severely hinder their ability to gather accurate information and determine the truth. My work is similar, albeit on a smaller scale. I am constantly assessing safety risks and building trust with vulnerable individuals, and that requires me to accurately perceive non-verbal cues. I'm not asking you to agree with my assessment, but I would appreciate you considering the possibility that there may be a medical basis for it, even if it’s not a traditional one. Perhaps we can explore alternative solutions, such as increased ventilation, or adjustments to my work environment, that would allow me to continue performing my duties effectively while also respecting the need for caution. Is that something you would be willing to consider?
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, I’m going to be frank. I’m not comfortable providing a medical exemption based on what you’ve described. It's not a medical condition. It sounds like you need to adjust to a new workplace protocol. I suggest you discuss your concerns with your employer and explore alternative solutions with them. I can document your concerns about a change in workplace protocols, but I will not be providing an exemption.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. While I am deeply disappointed with your decision, I respect your professional judgment. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns, even if you were unable to provide the outcome I was hoping for. I do appreciate you offering to document my concerns about the change in workplace protocols. That may be helpful in my discussions with my employer. Thank you again for your time, Doctor Fourney. Perhaps we can revisit this discussion in the future, should my situation change. Is there anything else you would like me to do, or any further documentation I can provide?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Knabenshue. I've documented your concerns. I recommend you speak with your employer. If you experience any actual medical symptoms related to wearing a mask – such as difficulty breathing, dizziness, or anxiety – please contact my office immediately. Otherwise, I don’t believe there’s anything further I can do for you at this time. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. Thank you for your time and consideration. I will speak with my employer and explore alternative solutions. And I will certainly contact your office if I experience any actual medical symptoms. Thank you again. Have a good day to you as well, Doctor Fourney. .
