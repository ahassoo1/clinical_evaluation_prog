DOCTOR: Right. Demondre, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Demondre Heindel. Good to meet you, Doctor… Batara, right? I think I saw your name on the door. Just kinda wanted to come in, see what this place is all about, you know? Never really been to a doctor much before.
DOCTOR: Yes, Batara. Pinky Batara. “See what this place is all about?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. I work on the boats, keepin' things runnin' smooth with the engines and all. Mostly just routine stuff, but… figured it couldn’t hurt to get a check-up, see if everything’s okay. Been feelin' alright, just… curious, I guess. Is that weird?
DOCTOR: Curious isn’t weird, Mr. Heindel. It’s… unusual for someone your age to come in without a specific complaint. Most people only bother when something is actively wrong. But alright. Let’s not waste time then. Tell me, are you experiencing any symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, no. Like, nothin' I’d call a symptom. Sometimes I get a little tired after a long shift, but that's kinda expected, right? Workin' on the water is hard work. And my back gets a little sore sometimes from bendin' and liftin', but… that goes away with a good rest. Nothin’ serious, I don't think. Is that what you mean by symptoms? Things that feel wrong?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s precisely what I mean. Fatigue, aches… those can be symptoms, Mr. Heindel. Though, often they are simply… the normal consequences of exertion. Still, we need to be thorough. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… not that I know of. I had the usual kid stuff, chickenpox and all that, but nothin' serious. I broke my arm once when I was little, climbin' a tree, but it healed up good as new. Never been to the hospital for anything big. My ex-wife, she had a lot of problems, but… that's a whole other story. Does that help? I don't really remember much about doctors, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Chickenpox” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Heindel. I’m asking about actual medical conditions. High blood pressure, diabetes, asthma… anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, okay. Sorry. I get it. No, nothin' like that. Never been told I got any of those. My blood pressure's always been good when they check it at work, for the boat stuff. Never had any trouble breathin', and I don't think I got diabetes. I eat pretty healthy, mostly fish and stuff. I mean, I like sweets, but… not too much. Is that… a good enough answer? I'm tryin' to be helpful, I promise. Just never really had to talk about this stuff before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Past surgical history then. Have you ever had any operations?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Just the broken arm, and they just put it in a cast. No cuttin' or nothin'. Pretty sure of that. I remember it bein' a bright blue cast, actually. My mom let me pick the color. Does that… count as medical history? I'm startin' to feel kinda silly now. Is this what doctors do? Ask a lot of questions? I thought you’d, like… listen to my heart and stuff.
DOCTOR: “What doctors do” is assess your overall health, Mr. Heindel. And that requires questions. Before I listen to your heart, I need to understand your background. Now, family history. Are your parents still alive?
PATIENT: Yeah, my mom's still around. She’s doin’ okay, lives down in Florida now. My dad… he passed away a few years back. Heart trouble, I think. He was a fisherman, like me, spent his whole life on the water. Always said it was a good life, but hard on the body. I don't know much about what kinda heart trouble he had, exactly. My mom doesn't talk about it much. Does that help? I feel bad I don’t know more, but… we weren’t super close.
DOCTOR: “Heart trouble” is… vague, Mr. Heindel. Was it a sudden event?
PATIENT: I think so. Mom said he went out on the boat one morning, like any other day, and… didn't come back. They found him, I guess, but she didn't tell me the details. She just said his heart gave out. It was quick, she said. I was still pretty young then, didn’t really ask a lot of questions. It was… hard. I’m sorry I can't be more helpful. It's been a while, and I was kinda numb, you know? Is it okay if I just say I don't know sometimes? I don’t want to make this harder than it needs to be.
DOCTOR: “I don’t know” is… unhelpful, Mr. Heindel. But, alright. Let’s move on. Social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Mom always said they were awful, and I guess it just stuck. Never really felt the urge, either. I like the smell of the ocean, not smoke. I do… sometimes have a beer with dinner, but not every night. And not too many. Is that okay? I'm tryin' to be honest here, I promise. Just want to get this check-up done and make sure everything's alright. Is there a reason you're askin' all these questions? I thought you were gonna listen to my heart and stuff.
DOCTOR: I am asking these questions to obtain a comprehensive understanding of your health status, Mr. Heindel. A physical exam alone is insufficient. Now, alcohol. How many beers, typically?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Sorry. Usually just one or two, maybe three on a Friday night if I'm not workin'. Sometimes none at all, if I'm tired. I don’t really drink to get drunk, just kinda… relax with it. I don't do any other drugs, if that's what you're askin'. Never had any interest in that stuff. Is that good enough? I’m startin' to feel kinda nervous now. I didn't think a simple check-up would be this complicated. Are you sure you need to know all this?
DOCTOR: It is necessary to gather this information, Mr. Heindel. Now, allergies. Are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all kinds of stuff, different foods and all that. I’ve been stung by a jellyfish a few times swimmin', but that just hurt, it didn’t make me sick or anything. And I get mosquito bites, but… everyone does, right? I'm tryin' to think really hard, but I honestly can't remember ever being allergic to anything. Does that mean I'm lucky? Or just not payin' attention? I feel like I'm failin' this test, or somethin'. Are you gonna quiz me next?
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. None at all. Never needed any. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back when it's really sore, but that’s it. Over-the-counter stuff, like you can buy at the store. I don’t have any regular prescriptions or nothin'. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat good, get enough sleep when I can. I thought that was enough. Are you mad at me? You seem… frustrated. I just wanted to make sure everything was okay, but this is makin' me kinda anxious. Is there somethin' wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. Enough with the questions for now. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and perform a basic neurological assessment.
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. So… this is the part where you listen to my heart and stuff? I always wondered what that feels like. Is it cold? I hope it doesn't hurt.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t hurt, Mr. Heindel. Though I doubt it will be a particularly pleasant experience. Heart rate is regular. Murmur absent. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. No neurological deficits noted. Overall, your physical examination is unremarkable. However, given your family history of heart trouble, I recommend an electrocardiogram to assess your cardiac function further.
PATIENT: An electrocardiogram? What’s that? Is it gonna hurt? And what does “unremarkable” mean? Is that good? I thought if everything was okay, you’d, like, tell me I was healthy. This is kinda confusing. Should I be worried? I’m startin’ to feel really anxious now. I wish I hadn’t come in.
DOCTOR: “Unremarkable” means there are no obvious abnormalities detected during the physical exam, Mr. Heindel. It doesn’t necessarily mean you are perfectly “healthy,” simply that I haven't identified any immediate concerns. An electrocardiogram, or ECG, is a simple, non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It does not hurt. Small sensors will be placed on your chest, arms, and legs. It takes about five minutes. Given your father’s history, it is prudent to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. It is better to be cautious than to ignore potential risks. Now, do you consent to the ECG?
PATIENT: Okay… a cautious thing. That sounds… good. I guess. If it doesn’t hurt. And it won't take long. I mean, I got things to do later. But… if it’s important, I guess I can wait. Sensors, you said? Like… stickers? Will they leave a mark? I just don’t like things stickin’ to me. And will you explain what it means afterwards? If something is wrong, I want to know. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Yes, they are stickers. They will leave a small mark, easily removed. And yes, I will explain the results. Though I doubt you’ll understand all the technical details. Have a seat. The technician will be in shortly to perform the ECG. And try to relax, Mr. Heindel. Your anxiety is not helping. I'm documenting your consent and ordering the ECG now.
PATIENT: Okay. Relax. Right. Is this gonna be a long wait? I hope the technician is nice. And… what if something is wrong? What happens then? Will I need… surgery? Or… something worse?
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, you are catastrophizing. It is highly unlikely that anything is seriously wrong. Let’s wait for the results of the ECG before jumping to conclusions. Worrying will not change the outcome. The technician will explain the procedure when they arrive. Do you have any other… unnecessary questions?
