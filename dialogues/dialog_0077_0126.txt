DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Erxleben. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it simply, I’ve just been… awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, no matter how much I eat. It's been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to become quite bothersome. I was hoping you could have a look at it.
DOCTOR: I see. Increased thirst and hunger… for several weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Several weeks. It’s not… a dramatic change overnight, more like it's gradually gotten worse. I find myself drinking a lot more water than usual, and I still feel parched. And I’ll eat a good meal, feel satisfied for maybe an hour, and then I’m hungry again. It's quite disruptive, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, yes… understandable. And are you noticing any other changes, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. I suppose I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but I chalked that up to… well, life, really. Being divorced and all. I haven't been sleeping particularly well, but I didn't necessarily associate that with this thirst and hunger. Is that relevant? I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, yes. We need to consider everything. Have you noticed any changes in your urination—frequency, amount, or colour?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yes, actually. I’ve been going to the toilet more often, I suppose. More often at night, particularly. As for the colour… I don’t usually pay much attention, but it seems… lighter than usual, perhaps? I really couldn’t say with any certainty. I’m afraid I'm not very observant when it comes to things like that. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. And just to be thorough, Mr. Erxleben, do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… let me see. My mother’s side… my grandmother, I believe, had something… but I was quite young when she was ill, and it was a long time ago. I don’t recall the specifics. It wasn’t something openly discussed, if I’m being honest. My father’s side… no, not that I’m aware of. I'm not certain, though. I wouldn’t be able to give you a definite answer, I’m afraid. Would checking her records be possible? I wouldn’t know where to begin.
DOCTOR: We can certainly attempt to access her medical history, though it may not be possible given the time and location. In the meantime, would you mind if I performed a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. A physical exam sounds perfectly reasonable. I’d appreciate you taking a look, to be honest. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I have a few things I need to get back to, if you don't mind. Work, you understand. Shipping and receiving waits for no one.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Erxleben. Let’s begin. If you could please step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. 93 kilograms, I believe. Though I haven't weighed myself in a while. I've… put a bit on, haven't I? It's the stress, I suppose. And perhaps too many biscuits with my tea.
DOCTOR: Yes, a little weight gain. But we’ll address that later if needed. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 88 and regular. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Finally, I'll just take a quick look at your throat and check your skin. Throat is clear. Skin appears normal. No obvious signs of infection or dehydration.
PATIENT: Alright. That doesn’t sound… terribly alarming, does it? I appreciate you taking the time to examine me. What’s the next step, Doctor? Is it blood work, perhaps? I’d prefer to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if that’s feasible. I have deliveries to coordinate, you see. And inventory isn't going to manage itself.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't sound terribly alarming at this stage, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t investigate further. Blood work is indeed the next step, yes. Specifically, I’d like to check your blood glucose level, as well as a complete metabolic panel. This will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. The lab is just down the hall. They should be able to take the sample right away. It will take a few hours to get the results back. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol swabs?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. No, none at all. Latex or alcohol swabs are perfectly fine. A few hours… I suppose I can manage. I’ll make some calls to the depot and try to rearrange a few things. Hopefully, this won't cause too much disruption. Thank you for expediting this process. I'll head down to the lab now then. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any specific instructions?
DOCTOR: No, nothing specific. Just try to relax if you can, and avoid sugary drinks in the meantime. I'll review the results as soon as they become available, and we’ll discuss them then. I’ll have the receptionist contact you once they're ready. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate your efforts to get this sorted out quickly. I’ll see myself to the lab then. Hopefully, this won’t be too serious. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
