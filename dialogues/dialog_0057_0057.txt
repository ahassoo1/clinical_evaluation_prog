DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too. I am here because… well, I have cancer. It’s been… a difficult time.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear that, Chellsea. That must be incredibly difficult. Thank you for sharing that with me. To help me understand what’s going on and how I can best support you, could you tell me a little more about your diagnosis?
PATIENT: Well… my husband, he took me to the hospital a few months back. I was… very tired, and losing weight without trying. They did some tests, and… that’s when they told me. It’s in my… chest, I think. They said a word… lymphoma? I don't remember everything very well. It’s been a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Lymphoma, yes. That's a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It's good you went to the hospital when you did. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot already. Do you know what type of lymphoma they said you have?
PATIENT: I… honestly, no. They said a lot of things. I remember something about… stages? And… treatments? I was so scared, I didn’t really listen to all of it. My husband… he passed away a few weeks after, and… everything just got blurry. I don’t really remember the details. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Chellsea, please don’t apologize at all. Losing your husband so soon after your diagnosis… that’s an unimaginable amount of grief and stress. It’s completely understandable that you wouldn’t remember everything. We can go over everything from the beginning, and I'll make sure you understand each step. Do you have any records from the hospital with you today?
PATIENT: I… I think I do. I brought a folder with all the papers they gave me. It’s in my bag, right here. It’s a bit messy, I’m afraid. I haven’t really… looked through it much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We’ll sort through it together. Would you mind if I take a look?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Please, go ahead. It’s all in there, I think. Everything they gave me. I just… I hope it makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s see… here’s a pathology report… Hodgkin Lymphoma, Stage II… and a treatment plan outlining chemotherapy and radiation… Hmm, and some imaging reports – a chest X-ray and a CT scan. It looks like you were initially seen at St. Joseph's Hospital on March 15th. This confirms the diagnosis of Hodgkin Lymphoma, and it looks like they started you on treatment. Have you been continuing with the treatment plan since your husband passed?
PATIENT: No… I stopped. After he… after my husband died, I couldn’t… I just couldn’t go back. It felt… pointless. And I was so overwhelmed with everything… the funeral arrangements, and… everything. I haven’t been to the hospital since. I just… I didn't know what to do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Chellsea. That's a perfectly natural reaction to such immense loss and grief. It takes incredible strength to even think about continuing treatment under those circumstances. It’s not pointless to pause and grieve, not at all. Given that you've stopped treatment, and it's been a few months since your initial diagnosis, it’s important for us to reassess things. We need to see how the lymphoma is responding, if at all, and determine the best course of action moving forward. Would you be comfortable with me performing a physical exam today?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s… alright. A physical exam sounds… good, I think. I just… what will it involve? I’m a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Of course. It will be a relatively straightforward exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and, most importantly, I’ll be feeling for any swollen lymph nodes, particularly in your neck, armpits, and groin. We’ll also check your spleen to see if it’s enlarged. I’ll also ask you a few questions about any symptoms you’ve been experiencing – like fevers, night sweats, weight loss, or fatigue. It shouldn’t be painful, but please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… okay. I understand. I have been… very tired, and I’ve lost some weight, like they said before. And sometimes… at night, I get really hot, even when it’s cold. I haven’t told anyone about the night sweats… I thought it was just… stress.
DOCTOR: Thank you for telling me, Chellsea. Those symptoms – the fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats – are all consistent with lymphoma, and it’s important that we investigate them further. It’s good you've shared that with me. Okay, if you don’t mind, let's start with listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. However, I do feel some slight swelling in the lymph nodes in your neck, on both sides. It’s not dramatically enlarged, but it's definitely present. Your spleen is also mildly enlarged, which can sometimes occur with lymphoma. Based on the physical exam, and what you’ve told me about your symptoms, it’s important that we order some further tests to assess the extent of the lymphoma and determine the best course of treatment. Would you be comfortable with a complete blood count, a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and a bone marrow biopsy?
PATIENT: A bone marrow biopsy… That sounds… painful. What does it involve? And… are those tests very expensive? I have Medicare, but… I don’t want to get a huge bill.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Chellsea. A bone marrow biopsy does involve a small amount of discomfort, but we can provide local anesthesia to minimize the pain. A small needle is used to extract a sample of bone marrow from your hip bone. It’s usually a quick procedure, but it can be uncomfortable afterwards. We’ll ensure you’re as comfortable as possible. As for the cost, with Medicare, you will likely have some coverage, but there may be co-pays or deductibles. Our billing department is very experienced with Medicare, and they can provide you with a detailed estimate of your out-of-pocket costs before the tests are performed. They can also explore any potential financial assistance programs that you may be eligible for. Before we proceed with the tests, are there any other concerns or questions you have?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it. It’s just… a lot to take in. I just want to… feel better. And… I want to know what’s going on, so I can… make a plan. I suppose the tests are necessary. Yes… let’s do the tests. Please.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good decision, Chellsea. Knowing what we’re dealing with is the first step towards feeling better, and creating a plan. I completely understand. Okay, I’m ordering the complete blood count, the CT scan, and the bone marrow biopsy. I’ll also need you to sign a consent form for the bone marrow biopsy. The lab will contact you to schedule the CT scan and the bone marrow biopsy. The complete blood count can be done here in the clinic today, if you’re comfortable with that. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help with any discomfort you may experience after the bone marrow biopsy. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the test results, and formulate a treatment plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Yes, scheduling the tests and the follow-up… that makes me feel… a little better. Thank you, Doctor. The pain reliever sounds helpful too. I… I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. It’s my job. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns at all, before or after the tests. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Here's the consent form for the bone marrow biopsy. Please take your time reading it, and let me know if you have any questions. The lab will also go over it with you before the procedure. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Sieh. I… I’ll read it carefully. I think I just need a moment to… process everything.
DOCTOR: Of course. Take all the time you need, Chellsea. And remember, we’re here to help. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. It was nice meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Take care.
