DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Good morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get straight to it. I want to have a baby. A healthy one. And I want to make sure... well, make sure everything is alright before I even try. I’m not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, proactive is... sensible. Alright. You're wanting a preconception evaluation. A bit unusual to come in before trying, frankly, but we can certainly accommodate. First, let's get some background. Have you been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Ugh, pregnant? Yes. Once. A very long time ago. It… didn't work out. My husband, ex-husband, wasn't… suitable. And honestly, it wasn’t a pleasant experience. That’s why I’m being so careful this time. I don't want a repeat. Is that enough information, or do you need a full life story?
DOCTOR: One pregnancy, terminated, I presume?
PATIENT: “Terminated”? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds so… clinical. It ended. It wasn't a good fit. And frankly, it's none of your business how it ended. I'm here about future pregnancies, not to rehash the past. Are we going to talk about what I want or spend the whole day dissecting my personal life?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We’ll focus on the future. Let’s move on then. Any significant medical issues?
PATIENT: Significant? What does that even mean? I’m… generally healthy. I mean, I get the occasional ache, who doesn’t? I have Medicare, so they check me up regularly enough. Nothing major. I’ve always been strong. I fix bicycles all day, you know. It’s physical work. That should tell you something.
DOCTOR: Bicycle repair. Right. And any family history of… anything?
PATIENT: Ugh, family. Don’t even get me started. My mother had… problems. Something with her stomach, I think. Spent a lot of time in the hospital. My father was… stern. And very concerned with appearances. That’s all you need to know. Honestly, I doubt their genetics are relevant. I’m a much stronger specimen. Are we getting anywhere, or are we just cataloging my ancestry?
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll skip the detailed genealogy then. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don't believe in filling my body with… chemicals. I might take something for a headache now and then, but that’s it. I prefer to deal with things naturally, if possible. And frankly, I'm very careful about what I put into my body. It needs to be pristine. For… obvious reasons.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, anything at all?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I'm a sensible woman. I don’t go around eating things I know will upset my stomach. And I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I mean, I might sneeze a bit in the spring, but that’s just pollen. Is this really necessary? It feels like you’re interrogating me.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Ms. Shteynberg. To ensure a safe pregnancy. Now, let’s get a basic physical. Blood pressure first. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to get physical. Fine. Just… be gentle. I haven't got the patience for rough handling. Get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: 130/80. Not ideal, but within acceptable range for now. Heart sounds regular. Lungs clear. Anything unusual you've noticed in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Unusual? No. It's a perfectly functional abdomen. I use it all day. Though sometimes it aches a bit, like I said. From the bicycles, you know. Is this going to take much longer? I have a shop to run. And frankly, I don't enjoy being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll order some basic bloodwork. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function. And a Vitamin D level, just to be thorough. We'll also need a urine sample. And I'd like to schedule you for a transvaginal ultrasound to assess your uterine lining and ovaries. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Transvaginal… ultrasound? Honestly, Doctor! Must everything be so… invasive? I came here for information, not a… examination. Look, I suppose bloodwork is acceptable. But the ultrasound… Can’t you just… look at it another way? And frankly, I don’t have time to be scheduling things. I run a business! Is this absolutely necessary, or are you just following a checklist?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, a transvaginal ultrasound provides a significantly clearer image than an abdominal ultrasound. It’s the standard of care for preconception evaluation. We need to assess the health of your uterus and ovaries. It’s essential. I'll have the nurse schedule it for you. It will take approximately 20 minutes. And yes, it is necessary. Do you have any further questions about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Twenty minutes, you say? Look, I don't like it, but I suppose… I suppose I'll have to. Just… make it quick. And be gentle. I expect a very discreet and professional environment. I don't need… unnecessary chatter. And I expect clear explanations of the results. No vague medical jargon. Understand? And tell the nurse to be efficient. I have a shop to run, you know. This is taking up valuable time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. I will ensure your requests are accommodated. The nurse will be in shortly with the lab requisition and to schedule the ultrasound. We will discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
