DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… my throat. It hurts. Very annoying, really. I need to get this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you’d like to get this addressed promptly. “Hurts” can mean a lot of things, Ms. Ottaviani. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It… aches. Like something is scratchy. And swallowing is… difficult. Honestly, it’s just a bother. I don't usually complain, you know. It’s probably nothing. I just… need something for it.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s an ache, scratchy feeling, and difficulty swallowing. Has this been happening suddenly, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: Oh… I… honestly? I can’t quite recall. A few days, maybe? It all feels rather… the same, to be frank. Everything is blending together these days. It just started being bothersome, that’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few days of increasing discomfort. And just to clarify, is it painful to swallow everything, or are certain foods or liquids more difficult than others?
PATIENT: Everything, really. Water, toast, even… soft things. It’s just… unpleasant. Why does it matter what I swallow? It hurts regardless, doesn’t it? I don’t have time for a detailed food diary, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are right to point that out, Ms. Ottaviani. It's good to be efficient. Knowing if certain things are worse doesn’t change the pain, but it can help us understand what might be going on. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No. I don’t think so. Perhaps a little… tired. But that’s just life, isn’t it? I work very hard. It’s probably just exhaustion. Honestly, I doubt it’s anything to do with my throat. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Okay, just a little fatigue. And you don't believe it's related to your throat. Alright. Have you had a fever, chills, a cough, any nasal congestion, or body aches?
PATIENT: A fever? Goodness, no. I haven’t been taking my temperature, Doctor! How would I know? And no, I don’t have… whatever you just said. A cough? No. Congestion? No. I just have a sore throat, as I’ve already explained multiple times. Are you listening? This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Ottaviani. You are absolutely right, and I am listening. I just need to gather enough information to best understand what’s going on. Let's move on. Have you been exposed to anyone recently who has been sick, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No. Not that I recall. I keep to myself mostly. I work with machines, Doctor, not… people. Exposure isn’t really a concern. Frankly, I prefer it that way. Now, are we getting anywhere with this, or am I simply here to answer a questionnaire?
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent exposure to illness. Now, have you had strep throat before?
PATIENT: Strep… throat? Honestly, Doctor, I have no idea. I'm not one to keep track of every little ailment I've had in my life. I go to work, I take care of my responsibilities, and I certainly don't document my medical history. Is this a common thing? Because if it is, I'm frankly surprised I haven't heard of it. Now, please, let's focus on fixing this throat, shall we?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known history of strep throat. And I understand your desire to get this resolved quickly. To help me assess things, would you mind if I take a quick look at your throat?
PATIENT: Look at my throat? Must you? Honestly, it feels rather invasive. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't you just… prescribe something? I assure you, it's a sore throat. It’s hardly a complex diagnosis. But if you must, get it over with quickly. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Ottaviani. It is a standard part of evaluating a sore throat, and it will only take a moment. It helps me rule out other possibilities and ensure I prescribe the most appropriate treatment. If you could open your mouth wide for me, please, and say “Ah.”
PATIENT: There. Done. Quickly, please. Honestly, it’s quite unpleasant. Is that enough? Can we be finished now? I haven't got all day, you know. This is… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I do see some redness in the back of your throat, and your tonsils are slightly swollen. I don't see any white spots or pus right now, but there is some inflammation. Given your symptoms and what I’m seeing, it’s difficult to say for certain without a quick test, but it could be a viral pharyngitis, commonly known as a sore throat. However, to be sure and rule out strep throat, I’d like to do a rapid strep test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A test? Honestly, Doctor. More poking and prodding? It’s just a sore throat! I told you, I work with machines. I don’t have time for tests. Can’t you just give me something for the pain? An antibiotic, perhaps? I’m sure that would do the trick. I haven’t got all day for this. Honestly, this is… ridiculous. Just… prescribe something. Anything. But quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. However, antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections, like strep throat. Prescribing them for a viral infection won’t help and can actually contribute to antibiotic resistance. The rapid strep test is a quick swab of the back of your throat – it takes just a few minutes to get a result. It’s the best way to know for sure if you need an antibiotic. If it’s negative, we can focus on managing your symptoms with pain relievers and supportive care. If you are truly opposed to the test, I can prescribe a pain reliever for symptomatic relief. However, I must advise you that without knowing if it’s strep, there’s a risk it could worsen if left untreated. Would you like me to proceed with the pain reliever only, understanding that risk?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Fine. Give me the… pain reliever. I haven’t got time for this debate. Just… write the prescription. And make it a strong one. Honestly, this is… I just want to get this over with. And don’t bother explaining it again. I understand the risks, or I don’t, and frankly, I’m not sure I care at this point. Just the prescription, please. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. Here is a prescription for ibuprofen 600mg. Take two tablets every six to eight hours as needed for pain and inflammation. It is important to take it with food to avoid stomach upset. I also recommend drinking plenty of fluids and getting rest. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or a rash, please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. I’ve wasted enough time here already. Thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
