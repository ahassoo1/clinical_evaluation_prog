DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, doctor. Sham, you said? Hmm. Well, honestly, I don't rightly remember why I'm here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. She worries something awful. Said I needed to get this... checked. Something about not wanting any "interventions." Sounds dramatic, doesn't it? I’m perfectly fine, thank you very much. Don’t need anyone poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sometimes it’s good to have a check-up even if we feel alright. Your daughter sounds very caring. I see here you're 83 years old... and that you live out in the rural area. Do you have any recollection at all about what she was concerned about?
PATIENT: Eighty-three, is it? My goodness, time flies. And yes, I live…somewhere out that way. It's all fields and trees, really. Not much to remember about it, if you ask me. She mentioned something about my…feet? Yes, my feet. Said they were looking a bit…neglected. Honestly, I haven’t really looked at my feet in ages. Why would I? They get me where I need to go. She keeps going on about circulation and…complications. Honestly, the girl makes a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Alright, feet…circulation. That’s something we can certainly take a look at. And it’s good your daughter is paying attention. Even if everything seems fine, it’s always best to rule things out. Have you noticed any pain, numbness, or tingling in your feet recently?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh, well, I’m eighty-three, dear. Something always aches somewhere. It’s just…old age. I wouldn't say it's anything unusual. Numbness…sometimes, maybe? It's hard to say. I wear these thick socks, you know. Always have. Could just be the socks. Tingling…I don’t think so. I mostly notice the cold. My feet get cold easily. That’s the worst of it, really. A nice warm pair of slippers fixes everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Cold feet, some occasional numbness…and generally feeling alright. Let’s have a look at your feet then, if you don't mind. Just a quick exam to check the circulation and sensation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam, you say? Oh, honestly. I really don’t see the point. But…if you insist. My daughter would have my hide if I refused. Just…be gentle, alright? I have sensitive skin. And don't go poking around too much. I don't want to startle anything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Very gentle. I’ll just take a look and feel your pulses. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright…I’m just looking at the color and texture of the skin now. It's a little dry, as you can see. And the temperature…yes, they are quite cool. Now, I'm checking the pulse in your foot. It's…weak. Very weak, actually. And here…even weaker. I'm going to check sensation now, with this little tool. Just tell me when you feel this.
PATIENT: Weak, you say? Well, I told you they were cold! And now you’re poking at me with…what is that thing? Honestly, I don’t like this one bit. It feels…prickly. Barely feel a thing, to be honest. Like a feather tickling, and not a very good feather at that. My daughter always said I didn’t have much sensation in my toes. Said it was something my mother had, too. Probably just inherited it. Don't fuss too much, dear. It’s not like I’m expecting to feel anything exciting.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Very limited sensation…and weak pulses. This is concerning, Ms. Gunasekara. It suggests there may be reduced blood flow to your feet, which we call peripheral artery disease. It’s more common as we get older. It's important to investigate this further. I'm going to order a couple of tests – an ankle-brachial index, which compares the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms, and a simple blood test to check your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Blood tests? Oh, for heaven’s sake. Now you’re just trying to scare me. Reduced blood flow…peripheral artery…whatever you said. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. A little cold, maybe, but that's easily fixed with a good pair of socks. I don’t want any tests, thank you very much. My daughter's going to be thrilled to hear you’re trying to poke and prod me unnecessarily. I told you, I don't need any interventions. I'm going home. Honestly, I've wasted enough time here already. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, I understand your reluctance, but this isn't about "poking and prodding." It's about making sure we rule out anything serious. Reduced blood flow can lead to pain, ulcers, and even infection. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help us decide on the best course of action. I strongly recommend at least the ankle-brachial index. It’s non-invasive and relatively quick. If we find something concerning, we can discuss specialist referral, but at least we'll have information. I wouldn't recommend these tests if I didn't think they were important for your health. What do you say?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're ordering me? Specialist referrals? Ulcers? Infection? You're just trying to frighten me into submission! Honestly, the things doctors say these days…It’s all about making money, isn't it? Sending me to all sorts of specialists for unnecessary procedures. My daughter…well, she always said I shouldn't trust doctors. I suppose she was right. No. Absolutely not. I'm not having any tests. I'm going home, and I suggest you stop trying to scare a perfectly healthy eighty-three-year-old woman. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, I respect your decision, but I am concerned. I strongly advise you to discuss this with your daughter. Ignoring potential problems won’t make them go away. Here’s some information about peripheral artery disease and its symptoms. Please, read it over. I will document your refusal of testing. If you experience any new pain, numbness, or changes in your feet, please seek immediate medical attention. That’s all I can do for you today. .
