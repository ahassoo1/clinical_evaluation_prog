DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though I must say, this establishment is…rather modern. Not at all what I’m accustomed to. I suppose you want to know about work. It’s…tiring. Simply tiring. I’ve been a teacher for…a very long time, and frankly, the students these days…well, it's not what it used to be. I'd like to get this over with as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're seeking documentation for work related to your continued employment as a teacher. We can definitely work towards that. To get started, could you tell me a little more about how the work is tiring?
PATIENT: Documentation? Is that what this is? Honestly, I haven't the foggiest idea what you mean by "documentation." And “how” is it tiring? It’s…everything. The paperwork, the lack of respect, the…the noise. It’s all very disruptive to a proper learning environment. Though, truthfully, I can’t recall specifics. It’s all a bit of a blur these days. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to recall specifics. We're just trying to get a clear picture of what's making your work challenging so we can document it accurately. Let’s try this. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms – like headaches, fatigue, or muscle aches – that might be related to your work?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Good heavens, no. I’m a perfectly healthy man for my age. Though, my back does ache a bit sometimes. Old age, you understand. Not from the…the students. Though, I suppose prolonged sitting at a desk isn’t ideal. But really, it’s more a matter of…principles. A lack of discipline, that’s what it is. Are you writing all of this down? It seems rather excessive.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am making notes, Mr. Schlatterer, to ensure I have a complete picture. The back ache is helpful to know, even if you think it’s just from age. It's good to document everything. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Changes in…sleep? Appetite? Really, Doctor, are you questioning my lifestyle? I eat a sensible diet and sleep when I’m tired. Perfectly normal. Though, I suppose I haven’t been as hungry lately. And sleep…well, it’s not quite as restful as it used to be. But that’s to be expected at my age. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I have a luncheon planned, you know. I’d like to be finished promptly.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting there, Mr. Schlatterer. Thank you for your patience. It sounds like you've been experiencing some decreased appetite and perhaps some difficulty with restful sleep. That’s helpful to know. Now, switching gears slightly – have you noticed any changes in your mood or concentration lately?
PATIENT: Changes in my mood? Are you suggesting I’m…emotional? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly composed. Though, I admit, I have been…rather irritable lately. And concentration…well, the constant distractions are hardly conducive to focused thought. But that’s not my fault, you understand. It’s the environment. Truly dreadful. I'm beginning to question the competence of this clinic, frankly. Are you a fully qualified physician?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer, and I assure you I am a fully qualified physician. I'm simply asking these questions to get a complete picture of your overall well-being, and any changes you’ve noticed. You mentioned irritability. Has this been a recent change, and would you say it's impacting your daily life or interactions with others?
PATIENT: “Impacting my interactions”? Goodness. Yes, it’s been…recent. And of course it’s impacting my interactions! I have to constantly correct their behavior, their…lack of respect! It's exhausting, simply exhausting. I used to be able to handle it with a firm tone, but now…now it takes so much effort. Though, truthfully, I can’t recall any specific instances. It’s all a bit of a blur, as I’ve said. Look, is this going to be much longer? I really must be going. My luncheon…it’s with important people.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you’re experiencing increased irritability and difficulty with your usual level of patience, which is understandably exhausting. It's common for prolonged stress to manifest in these ways. Let's do a quick physical check just to rule out any underlying medical causes contributing to your fatigue and irritability. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A “physical check”? Really, Doctor? I assure you, I’m in perfectly good health. But fine, if it means expediting this process… Do get it over with quickly, if you would. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. And I’m not particularly fond of being prodded and poked. This is all rather undignified. Let’s just…get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. We’ll keep it brief. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at your age. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular, and lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a bit diminished, also common with age. Ears and throat appear normal. Everything appears generally within normal limits for your age, Mr. Schlatterer, but the elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes are things we should monitor.
PATIENT: “Monitor”? Good heavens. As long as it doesn’t involve any…prodding. Frankly, Doctor, I’m not convinced any of this is necessary. I simply need a document stating that I'm fit for continued employment. Is that possible? I have a luncheon, you know. Important people. And I really must be going. This has been…a rather unpleasant experience, all things considered. Can we please just get to the document? I’m wasting valuable time. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand your desire to get back to your luncheon. Based on our conversation and the brief physical exam, it appears you're experiencing some fatigue, decreased appetite, increased irritability, and slightly elevated blood pressure. These could be related to the stress of your work environment and the challenges you're facing. I can certainly provide a document stating you are fit for continued employment, with a recommendation for follow-up with your primary care physician to monitor your blood pressure and address your symptoms of fatigue and irritability. Would that be acceptable?
