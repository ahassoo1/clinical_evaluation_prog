DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is fine. Look, I’m here for this… exam. For the army. They want me to get checked out before they let me sign up. Seems silly, but you gotta do what they say, right? Don’t see what a doctor’s gonna do, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Right, the army physical. Perfectly understandable. They have quite a checklist, and it's good you're getting it sorted. Just to be clear, is this your first time signing up, or are you re-enlisting?
PATIENT: First time. Always wanted to go, but life… got in the way. Wife, job, you know. But now's the time. I’m in good shape, always been. Work with my hands all day, building stuff. Strong as an ox, I tell ya. Not like these kids these days, glued to their screens. So, what kinda tests are we talkin' about? Don’t wanna waste my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, well, we’ll need to go through a fairly standard physical exam, covering your general health. That includes checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiration rate – and a look at your heart, lungs, abdomen, and musculoskeletal system. We’ll also need to discuss your medical history – any past illnesses, surgeries, allergies, medications you're taking. And a urine sample will be necessary. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Urine sample? Really? Seems a bit much, doesn’t it? I mean, I feel fine. Never been sick a day in my life, practically. And medications? Just the occasional painkiller for my back when I lift something heavy at work. But that’s it. Look, I’m a practical man, Doc. Is this necessary for the army, or just routine stuff? Don’t wanna sit here all day answering questions about things that don't matter.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Hartness. The army has specific requirements to ensure everyone is physically and medically fit for duty. The urine sample checks for things we can't detect otherwise – kidney function, diabetes, possible infections, and drug use, unfortunately. It’s standard protocol, and we have to follow it. Think of it as a preventative measure, ensuring you're in optimal health for your service. Let's start with your medical history, then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? No. Dad had that, but I take care of myself. Diabetes? Absolutely not. Sweet tooth, maybe, but I'm not that irresponsible. Asthma? Never. I work outside all the time, fresh air is good for ya. Surgeries… had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. And like I said, maybe a painkiller now and then for my back. Ibuprofen, mostly. Does that cover it? Can we move on now? This is takin' a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Tonsils as a child, occasional ibuprofen for back pain. Any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never had a problem with anything. Dust doesn't bother me, pollen doesn't bother me. I work in a workshop, it's dusty as anything. Built tough, I guess. Look, Doc, I appreciate you doin' your job, but I'm a busy man. I got things to do, work to finish. Are we gettin' anywhere with this, or are we gonna be here all afternoon?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. We're making progress. Just a few more questions, then we can move on to the physical exam. What about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Dad had that high blood pressure, like I said. Mom was fine, healthy as a horse 'til the end. Grandpa on my mother's side had something with his heart, I think. Can't remember exactly what. Old age, mostly. Nothing major, as far as I know. They didn't go to doctors much back then. They just… got on with it. Is this important? This feels like a lot of questions for a simple check-up.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Hartness. Family history can give us clues about potential risks. Knowing about your grandfather’s heart condition is helpful. Do you know what specifically he had – heart disease, heart attack, stroke?
PATIENT: Look, I told ya, I don't know. It was a long time ago. He just… got sick, and then he wasn't around anymore. No one talked about specifics back then. They didn’t have all these fancy names for things. He was an old man, it was his time. Honestly, Doc, I'm not a doctor. I'm a builder. I fix things with my hands, not remember medical histories from decades ago. Can we just skip this part? It's not gettin' us anywhere. I'm perfectly healthy, I know I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I understand your frustration. We can move on. Let’s talk about your social history, then. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never touched a cigarette in my life. Waste of money, bad for ya. Drink? A beer or two with the lads on a Friday night, that's about it. Nothing heavy. Recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I’ve got no time for that nonsense. I’m a practical man, Doc. I’ve got responsibilities, a wife, a job. I need to be clear-headed, not… spaced out. Is this getting us closer to actually doing something? I feel like I'm being interrogated here.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. That's good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Could you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. Here we go. Just tell me what you need to know. And don't take all day, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, 53 kilograms. That's… quite low for someone your height, 187 centimeters. Let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Please take a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fifty-three kilograms? That can't be right. I'm a solid build, always have been. Maybe the machine's broken? I work hard, I’ve got muscle. Go on, then. Get it over with. But I’m tellin’ ya, somethin’s off with that scale.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 110/70, which is good. Your pulse is 72, also within normal range. But you're right to question the weight. 53 kilograms is significantly below a healthy range for your height. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Unintentional weight loss? No! I haven't lost any weight. I eat like a horse! Always have. Big breakfasts, hearty lunches, good dinners. I work up an appetite, that's for sure. This is ridiculous. Maybe I should get weighed at my regular doctor’s office. This can't be right. I’m a strong guy, Doc. You can see that, can’t ya?
DOCTOR: I can see you're physically fit, Mr. Hartness, but the weight reading is concerning. It’s important we investigate this further. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing this. Could you describe your typical diet in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Look, I told ya, I eat good! Big plate of eggs and bacon for breakfast, usually. Toast, maybe some fruit. Lunch is usually a sandwich – ham and cheese, or roast beef. Big portions. Dinner's proper food – meat and potatoes, vegetables, that sort of thing. Wife cooks good. I don’t skip meals, that’s for sure. I need fuel for work, you know? I don't eat fancy stuff, just good, honest food. This is getting me nowhere. I came here for an army exam, not a diet consultation!
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. Let’s move on to a quick examination of your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Everything sounds clear, but given your low weight, I'd like to order a blood test and a urine analysis. These will help us rule out any potential underlying medical issues. It’s standard procedure, and it’s better to be safe than sorry, especially with your plans to join the army. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood test? Urine analysis? Now you're just tryin' to waste my time! I told ya, I'm perfectly healthy! What are you lookin' for, exactly? Some fancy disease I've never heard of? This is ridiculous. I'm starting to think this whole thing is a waste of time. I came here to get cleared for the army, not to get poked and prodded like some… delicate flower. Look, Doc, I appreciate your concern, but I'm tellin' ya, somethin's not right here. This is a waste of my time, and frankly, it's a bit insulting. If you're not gonna clear me, just say so.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, please. I'm not trying to waste your time. I’m a doctor, and my job is to ensure you’re in optimal health. Your low weight is a red flag, and I need to investigate it properly. It doesn’t mean you have something wrong with you, but it’s my professional responsibility to rule out potential issues. The blood test and urine analysis are routine procedures and will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. And frankly, the army will require these tests anyway. It's better to get them done now, so we can address any concerns upfront. Are you insured at all?
PATIENT: Insured? No! What do you think I am, rich? I work hard for my money, I don't have time for fancy insurance schemes. Look, Doc, I'm tellin' ya, this is a waste of time and money. I'm perfectly healthy. I've never been sick a day in my life. I lift heavy things all day, I eat good food, I'm strong as an ox. What more do you want from me? I came here for an army exam, not a medical interrogation! This is ridiculous. Just clear me, Doc. Please. I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration and your financial concerns. But I cannot ethically clear you for the army without a proper assessment. It's not about doubting you, it's about ensuring your safety and the safety of others. Look, I can see you're determined to join the army. I want to help you achieve that goal, but I need to do my job properly. Let me see if we can find a low-cost option for the blood test and urine analysis. There might be community clinics or programs that can help. Just give me a few minutes to see what I can find. In the meantime, could you tell me about any changes in your bowel habits or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Changes in… what now? Look, Doc, I don't talk about that stuff with strangers! This is gettin’ ridiculous. I'm a practical man, I fix things with my hands, I don't sit around discussin' my… bowel habits with doctors. And I'm tellin’ ya, nothin’s changed! I eat good, I work hard, I'm healthy. Stop askin’ me these silly questions! Just clear me, Doc. Please. I've got things to do. If you're not gonna help me, I'm leavin’. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, please wait. I understand your frustration, but I cannot simply clear you without addressing these concerns. Your health is too important. I'm genuinely worried about your low weight and the potential underlying cause. Look, I'm going to be upfront with you. Given your insistence on not pursuing further testing, I cannot ethically sign off on your army physical. It would be irresponsible of me to do so. I'm putting your well-being first. I can provide you with a list of local clinics and resources where you can get a low-cost assessment. If you get that done and provide me with the results, I'd be happy to review them and discuss your options. But I cannot sign off on this exam today. I'm sorry. Perhaps it’s best you speak with your primary care physician about this as well.
