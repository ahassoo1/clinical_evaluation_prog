DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Yes. Well, I told the nurse, didn't I? About the… the face. I’m getting a little work done. Just a tightening, you understand. Not a full… overhaul. A man wants to keep up appearances, doesn’t he? And frankly, it’s about time. I’m here for whatever clearance you need before they… proceed. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Right. So, a pre-operative assessment for a facial tightening procedure. I see. And who is performing the procedure?
PATIENT: Dr.… Albright. Yes, that’s it. Albright. He’s… quite good, apparently. Expensive, naturally. But one pays for quality, doesn’t one? I don't see why that matters to you, though. Are you going to ask me about every little detail? I’ve already told the receptionist everything.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Orwin, to gather the necessary medical history myself. It helps ensure your safety. “Everything” to the receptionist and a thorough medical evaluation are…not the same thing. Now, have you had any previous surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Goodness, no. Not unless you count my tonsils when I was a boy. That was… a long time ago. Everything was different then. No, I’ve always been a healthy man. Terrazzo work keeps you fit, you know. Heavy lifting, bending… it’s honest work. I certainly haven’t been under the knife for… vanity reasons before. This is a first. Now, can we just get this done? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant surgical history besides tonsillectomy. And you feel generally healthy despite the physical demands of your work. Any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I can eat anything. Drink anything, really. Used to enjoy a good beer after work, but I don’t indulge as much these days. Getting old, you see. Things just don’t… taste the same. Dust, maybe? From the terrazzo. But that’s not an allergy, is it? It just makes me cough. Are you writing all this down? It seems awfully detailed for a simple tightening.
DOCTOR: I am documenting your medical history, Mr. Orwin. Even seemingly minor details can be relevant. So, no known drug allergies. Currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications? A man my age doesn't need medications. I take a little fish oil for the joints, maybe. Keeps things moving, you know. And sometimes a little something for my indigestion. Just when I eat something rich. But that’s it. Nothing serious. I pride myself on being a natural man. All this modern… reliance on pills. It’s a disgrace.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fish oil and a PRN medication for indigestion. Do you know the name of that indigestion medication?
PATIENT: Name? Honestly, no. It’s… blue. The little tablet is blue. And it comes in a small bottle. My wife used to handle all that. She knew everything. Now… I just ask the pharmacist for “the blue one”. Is that good enough? Really, this is ridiculous. I’m a perfectly healthy man!
DOCTOR: Alright. “The blue one” for indigestion. And you said your wife used to manage your medications?
PATIENT: Yes, well, she passed a few years back. Cancer. Nasty business. She was a very organized woman. Knew all my… particulars. Now I just sort of… muddle through. It’s not as though I’m constantly popping pills, you know. Just when I have a particularly rich meal. This questioning is rather… intrusive, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. I apologize for the… thoroughness. It’s simply my due diligence. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes…?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Now there's a topic. My mother lived to be ninety. A very strong woman. Heart trouble, I think. Towards the end. My father… a farmer. Worked hard his whole life. Died of… old age, I suppose. Nothing dramatic. Honestly, we weren't much for discussing ailments. A man just… got on with it. Is this all necessary? I have a luncheon, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Maternal history of heart trouble, paternal history unremarkable. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, can you tell me about any chronic conditions you may have – arthritis, high blood pressure, high cholesterol…?
PATIENT: Look, I told you. I'm a terrazzo worker! I bend, I lift, I work. My joints ache sometimes, yes. But that's just… age and the job. High blood pressure? I haven't been told that. And cholesterol… I eat a sensible diet. Fish, mostly. No, I don’t have any chronic conditions. I am a perfectly healthy eighty-one-year-old man who wants to get a little work done. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Perfectly healthy, despite some joint aches. Alright. Very well. Let's proceed with a quick physical exam, then. Just to confirm what you’ve told me. Could you please sit up straight and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I haven't got all day. And be gentle, alright? I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds regular, rate approximately 78. Slight crackles auscultated bilaterally in the lower lung fields. Blood pressure 142/88. Slightly elevated blood pressure. Abdomen soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Pulses are regular and palpable in all extremities. Now, do you experience any shortness of breath, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Well, sometimes. After a particularly strenuous day, maybe. Lifting those heavy slabs of terrazzo… it takes it out of a man. But I wouldn't call it shortness of breath. More like… a little winded. I’ve always been a bit… stout, you know. Never been a runner. Is that what you’re asking? And are you going to poke around much longer?
DOCTOR: “A little winded” after exertion. Alright. Do you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Sometimes, yes. After I’ve been on my feet all day. They get a bit puffy, I suppose. But nothing dramatic. Just a little… water retention. My wife used to say it was the salt. She always worried about the salt.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, the crackles in your lungs, and some peripheral edema, it is my recommendation that you consult with your primary care physician for a more thorough evaluation before proceeding with the facial tightening procedure. It’s important to rule out any underlying cardiac or pulmonary issues.
PATIENT: Cardiac? Pulmonary? Are you serious? All this over a little tightening? I've lived a long life, worked hard, and I'm perfectly healthy! This is ridiculous. I specifically scheduled this appointment to avoid running around to a dozen different doctors. I just want to get this done. Are you telling me I can't have the procedure?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. However, as your physician, my primary concern is your safety. The symptoms I’ve detected – the elevated blood pressure, crackles in your lungs, and edema – warrant further investigation before undergoing any elective surgery. It's not about denying you the procedure, it's about ensuring you are a suitable candidate and minimizing any potential risks. I cannot, in good conscience, clear you for surgery without a proper assessment from your primary care physician. I can provide you with a referral, if you wish.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… fine. A referral. Yes, give me a referral. But I’m telling you, this is a complete waste of time. And I expect this whole thing to be expedited. I’ve got a luncheon, you know. And I’m not waiting months to get this sorted. I want a name. A doctor who understands that I'm a healthy man who just wants a little work done.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Orwin. I’m recommending Dr. Eleanor Vance, a cardiologist located just a few miles from here. She’s known for her thoroughness and efficiency. I’ve included a summary of my findings. I strongly advise scheduling an appointment as soon as possible. Once you’ve been cleared by Dr. Vance, you can contact Dr. Albright’s office to reschedule. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Vance. Fine. And I expect her to be reasonable. This is… exceedingly inconvenient. But, alright. I'll make an appointment. But don’t expect me to be happy about this. I suppose that’s all, then. And thank you for… wasting my time.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Orwin. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions. And I wish you the best in scheduling your appointment with Dr. Vance. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
