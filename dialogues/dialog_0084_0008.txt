DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh...right. My ear. It feels...full. Like something's blocking it, you know? Been that way a little while now, I think. Honestly, dates...they slip my mind these days. It's just...plugged. Is that...is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, “plugged” is a good start. And it's been going on for “a little while,” you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little while. Not sudden, thankfully. More...gradual. Weeks, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. Things aren't as clear as they used to be. I mostly notice it when it’s quiet. Like, I can’t really hear everything on the radio as well. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. So, it's been gradual onset over weeks, and you've noticed difficulty hearing, particularly with quieter sounds, like on the radio. Is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, I think. Yes, definitely the left. The right one seems fine. I haven’t… well, my wife used to point these things out, but… it's just the left. Sorry, I’m rambling. It’s the fullness that bothers me most, I suppose.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all. Fullness is a good way to describe it. And just the left ear. Okay. Have you noticed any pain with it?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not a bit. Just… blocked. Like when you go up high in a plane, you know? That pressure feeling? It’s not exactly the same, but...similar. Just less…popping, I guess. No pain, though. Definitely no pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just a feeling of fullness in the left ear, similar to the pressure you feel on an airplane, but without the popping. Have you noticed any ringing in either ear, or any dizziness or nausea?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. I hadn’t really noticed. Let me think. Sometimes, maybe? A very faint… hum? It’s hard to say if it’s the ear, or just… things around the house. No dizziness, no nausea. Definitely not. I get a bit… unsteady sometimes, but that’s just my age, I reckon. Nothing to do with the ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible faint hum, but you're not sure if it's related. No dizziness or nausea. And the unsteadiness you experience is unrelated. Have you ever had ear infections, or any ear surgery?
PATIENT: Ear infections… when I was a boy, maybe? A long time ago. Nothing serious, I don’t think. My mother always had a remedy for everything. And no surgery. Never had any surgery on my ears, or anywhere else, really. Just a bit of a bad knee now and then, but nothing that needed cutting. I'm fairly certain, anyway. It was a while ago. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It's good to know. Okay, possible ear infection as a child, but nothing significant, and no surgery. Have you been exposed to any loud noises recently – like at a concert or with power tools?
PATIENT: Loud noises… Not recently. I used to work with tractors, years ago, but I always wore ear protection. And I mostly stay home now, puttering around the garden. Nothing really loud. Maybe the grandchildren sometimes, but that's not the same, is it? It's more… cheerful noise. No, I can’t think of any recent loud noises. I try to avoid them. It’s bad for the… well, everything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent exposure to loud noises. Let’s do a quick exam of your ears. I'll use an otoscope to take a look. Can you lean forward a little for me?
PATIENT: Alright, lean forward. Yes. I'm not very good with these things, Doctor. I always feel a bit… awkward. Just tell me if I need to do anything. I just want to get this sorted, if possible. My hearing isn't what it used to be, and it makes it hard to… well, never mind. Just do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax. I'm looking… Hmm. There appears to be some cerumen – earwax – buildup in the ear canal. It's quite impacted, actually. That could be the cause of the fullness you're experiencing. Right ear looks clear. Now, I'm going to do a quick hearing test to get a better idea of how well you're hearing. It involves putting headphones on and responding when you hear tones. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Earwax, you say? Yes, that sounds… plausible. I don’t clean my ears much. Always thought it was best to leave it alone. So, earwax… alright. And a hearing test… yes, fine. Headphones are fine. Just tell me what to do. I’m a bit… slow these days, so you might have to repeat yourself. But yes, alright. Let's get on with it. I just want to be able to hear the radio properly again.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'm going to start with your left ear. I'll play some tones at different volumes, and I just want you to raise your hand when you hear something, anything at all. It doesn't matter how faint. Ready?
PATIENT: Alright, ready. Left ear, you said? Raise my hand… yes. Let’s get it over with. I’m not very good at these things, Doctor. Be patient with me.
DOCTOR: Okay… good… very faint… hmm… okay… Now, switching to the right ear. Okay, that’s the right ear done. Based on the test, you have some hearing loss in the left ear, particularly at the lower frequencies. This is consistent with the cerumen impaction. The right ear seems to be within normal limits. So, the likely cause of your fullness and difficulty hearing is earwax buildup in your left ear. We can remove it. There are a couple of options: we can use ear drops to soften it up and then irrigate it, or I can manually remove it with specialized instruments. The instruments are quicker, but some people find them a little uncomfortable. What do you prefer?
PATIENT: Instruments… uncomfortable, you say? Oh dear. I don’t like the sound of that. Ear drops… yes, ear drops sound much better. Softer up… that sounds…gentle. Yes, definitely ear drops, please. I’m a bit of a… wimp, I suppose. I just want it gone, but without any… fuss. Ear drops, if you please, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, ear drops it is. I'm going to prescribe you some cerumenolytic drops – that's the fancy name for earwax-softening drops. You'll need to put 5 drops in your left ear twice a day for 5 days. After that, you'll need to come back in so I can irrigate the ear to remove the softened wax. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. My wife always handled the medications. I just… took them. I don’t think so. No, I don't believe so. But I do get a bit… itchy sometimes. Is that an allergy? No, probably not. Just my skin. No, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. It's just… difficult to remember these things. Five days, you said? And then come back? Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Five days of drops, twice a day, then come back for irrigation. I'll give you a written prescription and instructions. I also recommend avoiding using cotton swabs in your ears, as they can push the wax further in. Do you have any other concerns today?
PATIENT: Cotton swabs… yes, I always used those. My mother said they were good for cleaning. I’ll stop using them, then. No, I don’t think so. No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just the ear. And hopefully, the radio. Thank you very much for your help. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I'm glad I could help. Here's your prescription. If you experience any pain, dizziness, or new hearing loss after starting the drops, please call the office immediately. Otherwise, we'll see you in 5 days for the irrigation. Have a good day, and enjoy listening to your radio!
