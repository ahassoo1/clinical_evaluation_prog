DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Lason. Welcome. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, it’s about these… spells, I suppose you’d call them. My wife, Srey, she keeps saying I’m confused. Says I ask the same questions twice, forget where I put things. It’s… bothersome. I haven’t always been like this, you understand. It’s new.
DOCTOR: Right. “Spells,” you say. And your wife is noticing some… changes in your memory?
PATIENT: Changes? That’s a polite way to put it. She acts like I’m losing my mind! I set tile for forty years, built things with my hands. Perfectly good things! I’m not… senile, if that’s what you’re thinking. I just… misplace things sometimes. Everyone does. It’s this heat, probably. Makes a man foggy.
DOCTOR: Foggy, yes. Well, forty years of tile work is certainly impressive. But even with the heat, forgetting things repeatedly is something we should look into. Tell me, Mr. Lason, can you give me an example of something you've recently forgotten, or a question you asked more than once?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want examples? Just yesterday, I asked Srey three times where I left my slippers. Three times! They were right by the door, where they always go. And the day before, I couldn’t remember what we were having for dinner. She had already told me! It’s… frustrating, is what it is. I feel like she treats me like a child.
DOCTOR: Alright. Repetitive questioning and… difficulty recalling recent information. And this is a fairly new development, you said?
PATIENT: Yes! Very recent. It started, oh, maybe a month ago? Two months, tops. Before that, my head was clear as a bell. I could tell you the exact dimensions of every tile I’ve ever laid. Now… now I have to ask Srey for simple things. It's humiliating, frankly. I don't understand what's happening to me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything else changed besides the memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Srey says I’ve been more… irritable. Snappish, she calls it. But she’s always saying something about my temper. And… now that I think about it, I haven’t been sleeping as well. Wake up in the middle of the night, can’t get back to sleep. Just… lying there. But that could be the heat, too. It's a hot summer.
DOCTOR: Irritability and some trouble sleeping. Alright. Let’s do a quick check of your vital signs, and then I’d like to do a very brief cognitive assessment, just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Cognitive assessment? What does that even mean? Is that one of those tests where you ask silly questions? Because I assure you, my mind is perfectly sharp. But… fine. Do whatever you need to do. Just don't expect me to be impressed. I set tile, remember. Requires a good head for measurements and angles.
DOCTOR: It's a very simple test, Mr. Lason. Just a few questions to help us understand what might be going on. It’s not about silly questions, it’s about seeing how well your memory and thinking skills are functioning. First, let’s get your blood pressure and pulse. Please have a seat and relax.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But don’t expect miracles. I've been perfectly capable my entire life. Just get it over with. And be quick about it. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 148 over 86. Pulse is 72, regular. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions. Try to answer to the best of your ability. First, do you know the current date?
PATIENT: Of course I know the date! What kind of question is that? It’s… August 2nd, 2025. See? Perfectly fine. Don’t waste my time with these… trivialities.
DOCTOR: August 2nd, 2025. Good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: What city? Are you serious? Look around you! This is… Maplewood. What kind of doctor’s office forgets where it is? It's a perfectly respectable suburb. Honestly, the questions you're asking... It's insulting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Let's try a slightly different question. I'm going to name three things. I want you to repeat them back to me after I finish. Ready?
PATIENT: Fine. Get on with it. Just hurry up. I haven’t got all day. Let's hear your three things.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, and penny. Go ahead when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Apple… table… and… hmm. It's on the tip of my tongue… table… apple… and… Blast it! What was the third one? It was a small, shiny… a coin, maybe? I can’t remember! It’s infuriating!
DOCTOR: Penny. Yes, the third word was penny. Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards.
PATIENT: Spell “world” backwards? Are you deliberately trying to embarrass me? I can spell perfectly well! It's… d-l-r-o-w. There! See? Perfectly capable. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’ve had enough of these silly tests.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Mr. Lason. Based on this brief assessment, and what you've told me, there does seem to be some concern for memory loss. Now, I want to be thorough. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation.
PATIENT: A neurologist? Are you saying I'm losing my mind?! I already told you, I set tile for forty years! A good head for spatial reasoning, precise measurements! What do I need a neurologist for? This is preposterous! What's wrong with just saying I'm a little stressed? Srey worries too much, that’s all. I don't need tests and referrals and… specialists. I'm wasting my time here. I think I'll just get a second opinion.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your frustration. But dismissing these symptoms as just stress isn't the best course of action. It's important to rule out any medical causes. I’m not saying you're “losing your mind”, simply that we need to investigate. I strongly advise you to consider the referral. I can provide you with the names of several reputable neurologists in the area. And I'll order the blood work now, regardless. It's better to be safe. I also want you to be aware that if you experience any sudden changes in your condition – confusion, weakness, difficulty speaking – you should go to the emergency room immediately. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Do whatever you want. But don't expect me to be happy about it. Give me the names. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time and money. Just stress, that's all. Srey… she gets under my skin sometimes. .
