DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin. There are patches. Discoloration. It’s quite bothersome, really. Not what one expects at my age, you know?
DOCTOR: "Not what one expects," you say. Right. And where exactly are these “patches,” Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t look at me like that. It’s on my hands, mostly. And a bit on my arms. It’s… not a uniform tan, if you catch my meaning. It’s… uneven. And frankly, it looks rather… common. I keep good hands, you understand. I’m an archivist.
DOCTOR: An archivist, you say. Fine motor skills are important, I presume. Let's get a proper look, shall we?
PATIENT: Well, obviously. Delicate work, you know. One can't be fumbling about with… everything. There. Be careful now. I’ve just had them moisturized.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. Varied pigmentation. Not particularly inflamed, no scaling. When did you first notice these areas, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It wasn’t sudden, you understand. It… crept up. Probably… six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It was after that trip to visit my husband’s family. Though I was very careful with the sunblock. They live near the Black Sea, you know. Though the quality of their sunscreen… I wouldn’t trust it.
DOCTOR: The Black Sea… Right. And have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain associated with these areas?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I don’t do itching. That’s… vulgar. It's just the appearance that's the problem. It’s unsightly, really. And quite distracting when one is handling… important documents. It’s simply not a good look for a professional, you understand.
DOCTOR: You mentioned a recent trip. Have you experienced any other symptoms – fatigue, joint pain, sensitivity to light – anything at all that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I'm perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I wouldn’t be visiting you if I wasn’t. Though my husband does complain about my energy levels sometimes, but that’s just because he prefers a quieter life. It’s hardly a medical concern. It’s the skin, Doctor. Focus on the skin.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s review your medical history. According to this record, you have no prior dermatological issues reported. Any known allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I eat everything. Everything sensible, of course. Though I do prefer Ukrainian cuisine, naturally. Though I recall a slight reaction to some lavender soap once. But that was decades ago. And it was probably just a poor quality product. It certainly wasn’t a true allergy.
DOCTOR: No current medications listed either. And family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… My mother had… well, she had a bit of everything, if I’m honest. A delicate constitution, you know. Nothing specific that would be relevant here. Mostly just… worries. And a fondness for dramatic ailments. It wasn’t a very scientific household, I’m afraid. Best not dwell on it.
DOCTOR: So, to summarise: patchy skin discoloration on your hands and arms, onset approximately six months ago, no itching or pain, no known allergies or significant medical history. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Perfectly accurate, Doctor. Though you’ve rather glossed over the unsightliness of it all. It’s truly… distracting. And not at all befitting a woman of my… station. It’s a matter of presentation, you understand. A professional appearance is crucial.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. While a definitive diagnosis requires further investigation, based on the presentation, it could be post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, potentially triggered by mild sun exposure, or even contact dermatitis from an unknown irritant. It’s unlikely to be anything serious. However, I recommend a skin biopsy to rule out other possibilities, such as vitiligo. And I'll prescribe a topical corticosteroid to see if that reduces any inflammation, though I doubt it will make much difference.
PATIENT: A biopsy? Goodness. That sounds… invasive. And frankly, unnecessary. Are you certain that’s required? I’ve never had a biopsy in my life. And I doubt I need one now. It’s just a bit of discoloration, Doctor. Not a… a growth. And a corticosteroid? Those have… side effects, don't they? I prefer a more… natural approach, if possible. Perhaps a good hand cream? I’ve always had good results with Ukrainian rosehip oil.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, while I appreciate your preference for “natural approaches,” a proper diagnosis is paramount. A biopsy is a standard procedure, minimally invasive, and will provide definitive answers. I understand your concerns about corticosteroids, and we can discuss a low-potency option with limited systemic absorption. However, dismissing necessary investigation based on a preference for rosehip oil is…unwise. I strongly recommend we proceed with the biopsy and a short course of topical treatment. If you are unwilling to follow a standard medical protocol, I suggest you seek a second opinion.
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re being difficult. A second opinion? Really? I came to you for a diagnosis, not a lecture on medical protocols. Honestly, I expected more… sensitivity. And less… condescension. Very well. A biopsy. But I want it done quickly, and I expect minimal discomfort. And I will not be using any of those… potent corticosteroids. A very mild cream, if absolutely necessary. And I expect you to explain every step of the process in detail. I do not like surprises. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Bartock. A biopsy it is. We will schedule it for next week with Dr. Petrova – she's quite gentle. We'll use a local anesthetic to minimize discomfort. And yes, I will explain every step of the process. As for the corticosteroid, a very mild hydrocortisone 1% cream is the least potent option and may offer some relief. However, if it causes any irritation, discontinue use immediately. I'm making these concessions to address your concerns, but I must reiterate that this is not an optimal approach. Here is the referral to Dr. Petrova and the prescription for the hydrocortisone. Please schedule the biopsy as soon as possible. I'll expect a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. Do you have any further questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No, I think that will be all. Though I do expect a detailed explanation of the entire process before the biopsy takes place. And I trust Dr. Petrova is familiar with… delicate skin. Very well. I suppose we’ll see what Dr. Petrova has to say. Thank you, Doctor. Though I must say, I’m rather disappointed with this entire experience. And do make sure Dr. Petrova washes her hands thoroughly. One can never be too careful. .
