DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I’m Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I… I requested to come in to get checked for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, and I thought it was time.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. A responsible decision, I suppose, though I must say, at your age, it's… unusual to be concerned about this for the first time. But, alright. Let’s get some details. Can you tell me a little bit about why you’re concerned about HIV now?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, it’s not that I’ve been… doing anything, if that’s what you mean. It's just… my husband and I, we’ve been married a long time. Very long. And recently, we’ve been… talking about things. About our health, about the future. And it just made me realise I’ve never had this check. Never. And with everything you hear on the news… one can’t be too careful, can one? It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, really. I should have done this years ago.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, it’s always good to be proactive about your health, regardless of when you decide to start. Though, frankly, waiting this long… still. Let’s just get through this. Have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… blood transfusions… No, I don't believe so. Not that I recall, anyway. I had a rather difficult childbirth with my youngest, but I don't think they gave me a transfusion. It was a long time ago, though. Everything is a bit… hazy now. Perhaps my husband would remember? He has a better memory for things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever shared any needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens, no! Absolutely not! I've never… I don’t even know anyone who would do such a thing. Is that… is that a common way to get it? I hope you’re not suggesting… Well, never mind. It’s just… a very unpleasant thought. My husband and I both lead very respectable lives.
DOCTOR: Just routine questions, Ms. Shaub. I assure you. Now, let's talk about your husband. Has he ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: That's a good question, actually. We've never discussed it, not specifically. We've always been… careful, you see. We've been together for so long, and we’ve always used protection. Well, most of the time. But we haven't talked about getting tested, no. I suppose I should ask him. He’s been a bit… distant lately, so perhaps it’s a good time to have a proper conversation with him. Would it be wise to get him tested as well?
DOCTOR: It would be highly advisable, Ms. Shaub. Given your long-term relationship, it’s the only responsible course of action. Especially if you haven't discussed this before. We need to rule out any potential exposure, for both of your sakes. Now, before we proceed with the bloodwork for you, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I think so. I get a terrible rash if I eat shellfish – prawns, especially. And I had a rather nasty reaction to penicillin when I was a child. My mother always said I was very sensitive to it. Nothing else comes to mind, but I am generally quite… delicate. Does penicillin include all antibiotics, Doctor? I forget these things, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, shellfish allergy and a penicillin reaction. That’s good to know. Penicillin is just one type of antibiotic, thankfully. We’ll avoid that one. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I take a small dose of amlodipine for my blood pressure, the doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And I sometimes take paracetamol for headaches, but that’s it, really. Nothing regular. And a multivitamin, every now and then. I try to eat healthy, you see, but sometimes… well, one needs a little boost.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine and occasional paracetamol. Alright. And finally, have you travelled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not recently, no. The last time I travelled was… oh, let me think… it must have been about ten years ago now. My daughter took me to visit her in America, but that was a long time ago. And I haven’t been anywhere since then. Just staying here with my husband, mostly. Do I need to tell you where exactly I went in America? It feels rather irrelevant, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: No, that's quite alright. Okay, Ms. Shaub. We have enough information for now. I'm going to order a standard HIV test. It will be a blood draw. We’ll also do some basic liver and kidney function tests, just to get a general overview of your health. I’ll have the nurse come in and take a sample. It will take about a week to get the results. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, a week? That seems a rather long time to wait, doesn’t it? But alright. No, I don’t think so… well, just one. What if… what if it is positive? I mean, what does that mean? Will I be… terribly ill? I haven't really thought this through, you see. I just wanted to get tested, and now… it feels a bit frightening.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shaub, it’s highly unlikely, given your history. But if the test comes back positive, it doesn't automatically mean you're "terribly ill." HIV is manageable these days. Very manageable, with medication. We would discuss treatment options, which would involve antiretroviral therapy. It slows down the virus, prevents complications… it allows people to live long, healthy lives. However, it's crucial to know your status so we can start treatment immediately if necessary. Worrying about it won't help. Let's just get the test done, and we'll deal with whatever comes up. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Medication… that sounds… reassuring, I suppose. It's just… it's a lot to take in. A week seems such a long time to be wondering. Alright. Yes, I understand. Just get the test done. And then… we'll see. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I should tell my husband, shouldn't I? Perhaps it’s best if he comes with me when I get the results.
DOCTOR: That would be advisable, yes. It's best to face this together, if possible. I’ll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood. She’ll explain the process. Don't hesitate to ask her any questions you may have. I'll see you both in a week.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I'll just… wait here then. .
