DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's this itching. Everywhere, really. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, and it's driving me a bit crazy. Not painful, just… constantly itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant itching for a couple of weeks. I see. And is it all over your body, or are there specific areas that are worse than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It feels all over, but I think it's worse on my back and legs. My arms are pretty bad too, actually. It’s hard to tell, to be honest, because I keep scratching at everything! I haven't noticed it on my face, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, worse on the back, legs, and arms, but not on your face. And have you noticed any rash, bumps, blisters, or changes in the skin’s appearance along with the itching?
PATIENT: No, no rash or anything like that. That’s what’s so strange about it! The skin just looks… normal. Red sometimes, from the scratching, obviously, but not like a rash. Just… itchy, normal skin. It’s really perplexing. I keep thinking it’s just dry skin, but lotion doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no visible rash, just redness from scratching, and lotion isn’t providing relief. Let's try to narrow things down. Have you started using any new soaps, detergents, lotions, or other products recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… new products… hmm. No, not really. I’ve been using the same things for years, practically. Old Spice soap, a basic unscented detergent… nothing fancy. My wife, God rest her soul, always picked everything out, and I just… kept using it after. I haven’t changed a thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been exposed to anything unusual lately – new plants, animals, or been travelling anywhere?
PATIENT: No travelling, definitely not. I haven’t left the state in… well, a long time. As for plants or animals… I do a little gardening, mostly tomatoes and peppers. And the neighbor’s cat sometimes wanders into my yard, but I don't really touch it. Nothing out of the ordinary, really. This is what’s so frustrating! I can't figure out what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to take some blood pressure medication, but the doctor took me off it a few years back. Said my numbers were good. Otherwise, nothing. I'm pretty boring when it comes to allergies, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, off blood pressure medication a few years ago. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. One of those cheap ones from the drugstore. I figured it couldn’t hurt. And… occasionally I take an ibuprofen for aches and pains, but that’s it. Very low maintenance, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Now, have you had any other medical conditions in the past, like eczema, psoriasis, or anything similar?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My health has been pretty good, all things considered. A little arthritis in my knees, but that's just getting old, I suppose. My wife always said I was a sturdy Russian oak! But… nothing with my skin before this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… That's a tough one. My parents both passed away a long time ago, and I didn't have a lot of close relatives. My mother had… some sort of stomach trouble, I think. And my father… well, he worked in the mines, so he had a lot of aches and pains. I don’t really recall anything about skin problems in either of them. Sorry I can't be more helpful there. It wasn't something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, let’s move on to some lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Gave that up years ago. A little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that's it. And absolutely no drugs, Doctor. Never touched the stuff. A quiet life is good enough for me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your work and daily activities?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a dispatcher – not police or ambulance, more like… trucking companies, things like that. Mostly on the phone, coordinating deliveries. It's pretty sedentary, to be honest. I sit at a desk all day. When I’m not working, I like to garden, read… keep busy around the house. Nothing too strenuous. A pretty simple life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I just want to take a look at your skin and check a few things. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. I'm just going to examine your skin, starting with your back. Please relax. Skin appears normal in color and texture. No visible rash, lesions, or welts. Mild dryness noted. Now, let's take a look at your arms… Similar findings on the arms – normal skin with mild dryness. No rash, lesions, or welts. Now, legs… A few areas of mild excoriation consistent with scratching, but no primary skin abnormalities. I don’t see anything obviously concerning on the surface, Mr. Ferneding. Your pulses are good, and I don’t detect any swelling. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline. Heart sounds regular. Lungs clear. It’s possible this could be a simple case of dry skin exacerbated by something environmental, but the persistence and lack of visible rash makes me want to rule out other possibilities. Have you changed laundry detergents recently?
PATIENT: No, like I said, Doctor, I haven’t. Same detergent for years. My wife always bought the unscented kind… hypoallergenic, I think. It’s… strange. I’m starting to wonder if it’s something in my head. Maybe I'm just stressed about things. It's just… relentless.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s frustrating, Mr. Ferneding, and it’s good you’re considering all possibilities. Stress can definitely manifest physically. However, let’s not dismiss other causes just yet. Given the lack of a clear cause and the persistence of the itching, I’d like to order some basic blood work. We'll check your complete blood count, liver function, kidney function, and thyroid levels. These tests can help rule out underlying medical conditions that might be causing the itching. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it might help figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Blood work is fine. I just want to get some relief, you know? It’s driving me a bit mad.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll have the lab technician draw some blood. It shouldn’t take too long. We’ll get the results back in a few days, usually three to five business days. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a topical steroid cream, a mild one, to help relieve the itching. Apply it thinly to the affected areas twice a day. And continue to use a gentle, unscented moisturizer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A cream to help with the itching would be wonderful. And I'll get some unscented moisturizer too. Three to five days… I can wait. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and run some tests. It makes me feel a little better just knowing we’re trying to figure it out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I'm glad I could help. And if the itching gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms like fever, fatigue, or weight loss, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here's a lab requisition form for your blood work and a prescription for the topical steroid cream. The lab is just down the hall. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That all sounds very clear. Thank you again for your help. I’ll head down to the lab now and get that taken care of. I appreciate your kindness. It's good to know someone is listening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. Get well soon. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
