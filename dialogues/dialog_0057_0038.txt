DOCTOR: Hello Evann, good afternoon. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Sieh. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, to be frank, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I was advised to come in and… discuss planning for the future, I believe? Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… things change. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, and a friend suggested I get some forms sorted. An Advance Directive, perhaps? Or a POLST form, she mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright, Evann. It's very responsible of you to think about this now. It sounds like your friend is suggesting we discuss advance care planning – making sure your healthcare wishes are documented, just in case you're unable to speak for yourself in the future. An Advance Directive and a POLST form are both tools we can use for that. To start, let's talk a little bit about what's important to you. Can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: My overall health… that is a good question. I… I work with my hands, etching and engraving. It keeps me quite active, though my joints do ache sometimes. I don't recall any… major illnesses. I see a specialist for my hands, occasionally. Nothing serious, just preventative care. I have private insurance, so that handles most things. Beyond that… I’m afraid I struggle to recall specifics. I try to eat well, and I do get enough sleep, I think. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, thank you. Knowing you're active with your work and generally healthy is a good starting point. And it's good you have a specialist for your hands. Do you remember the name of that specialist, or the clinic they work at?
PATIENT: That… that is proving difficult. The name… it’s on the tip of my tongue. They are near the city center, I believe. A modern building… lots of glass. I see Doctor… Miller, perhaps? No, that doesn’t sound right. It’s a male doctor. I’ve been going there for several years, but the name… it’s frustratingly elusive. I apologize. My memory is… patchy, at best. I do have the cards somewhere, I’m sure, but they are not readily accessible at the moment.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Evann. These things happen. It’s perfectly alright. We can always try to track down the information later. Let’s focus on you for now. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. I… I believe I was briefly admitted many years ago, for a rather severe bout of influenza. It was quite debilitating, but it was a long time ago. Beyond that… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing requiring a lengthy stay, at least. I’ve always been fortunate enough to recover quickly from minor illnesses. I have a… a vague recollection of tests being run, but the details are hazy. It was before I came to this country, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And you said before you came to this country – do you mind if I ask where you are originally from?
PATIENT: Of course not, Doctor. I am originally from Mongolia. I moved here… oh, it must be nearly twenty years ago now. It was a significant change, but a good one. I miss my family, naturally, but I’ve built a life here, and I am grateful for the opportunities I’ve been given. I’ve always been a practical person, and adapting to new situations is simply… necessary. Though, it does seem to have… affected my recall of earlier events, perhaps.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Evann. Big life changes can definitely have an impact. Knowing your background is helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My parents… they passed away some years ago. It was… quite a long time ago now. I have a sister, though. She still lives in Mongolia. We correspond occasionally, through letters and… more modern means, when possible. We don’t speak often, due to the distance and… differing lifestyles. It’s difficult to maintain a close relationship under the circumstances. I haven’t seen her in person for many years.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your parents, Evann, and that you don’t get to see your sister often. It sounds like you’ve experienced a lot of change and distance in your life. Have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Thankfully, I haven't. I've always been quite careful, and I've been fortunate enough to avoid the need for any significant surgical interventions. Just the routine check-ups, and the occasional treatment for minor ailments. I’ve always believed in preventative care, as I mentioned earlier. I prefer to avoid drastic measures whenever possible. The thought of surgery… it’s not something I dwell on fondly.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't believe so. I've never experienced any severe reactions to medications or food. I do get a mild rash sometimes, if I use certain soaps or detergents, but it's not a true allergy, just a sensitivity. Nothing life-threatening, certainly. I've always been cautious about trying new things, so I’ve likely avoided many potential allergens simply through careful selection. I don’t recall ever needing to carry an EpiPen, or any similar device.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Currently taking… just a mild pain reliever, occasionally. For my hands, when the arthritis flares up. It’s nothing prescribed, just ibuprofen, from the shop. And sometimes, a vitamin D supplement, during the winter months. The sun isn't very strong here, and my friend suggested it might be beneficial. Otherwise, no. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible, and I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I don’t like taking unnecessary medications, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, to get a clearer picture of your overall health, would you mind if I asked a few questions about different body systems?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly acceptable. Though, I must warn you, my recollections are… fragmented. I shall do my best to provide accurate information, but please forgive any inconsistencies or omissions. I am often unsure of specific details, and I may require prompting.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No need to apologize. We will take it slowly, and I will guide you through the questions. Let's start with your heart. Have you ever had any chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain… palpitations… hmm. No, not that I recall. I do get a little breathless sometimes, when I exert myself, but I attribute that to my age and… the occasional lack of exercise. My work is quite physically demanding, but it doesn’t involve a great deal of cardiovascular activity. I haven’t experienced any sudden or severe chest pain, or any irregular heartbeats. I occasionally feel… a little tired, but that is likely due to overwork, and not any underlying medical condition. I have never been diagnosed with any heart problems, as far as I am aware.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. How about your lungs?
PATIENT: My lungs… I haven’t experienced any difficulty breathing, beyond the occasional shortness of breath I mentioned earlier. I haven’t coughed up any blood, or experienced any chest infections recently. I do get a little wheezy sometimes, during the winter months, but I attribute that to the cold air and… the occasional dust from my work. I haven’t smoked in many years, and I haven’t been exposed to any significant lung irritants, as far as I am aware. I haven’t been diagnosed with any lung problems, either. Though… I did have a rather severe bout of influenza many years ago, as I mentioned previously. It did affect my breathing somewhat, but I recovered fully, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let's move onto your digestive system. Do you have any problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Digestive system… hmm. Occasionally, I experience a little indigestion, after eating a heavy meal. And sometimes, a little constipation, if I don’t drink enough water. But nothing severe, certainly. I haven’t experienced any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain recently. I do get a little bloated sometimes, but I attribute that to my diet and… the occasional stress. I haven’t experienced any blood in my stool, or any significant changes in my bowel habits. I haven’t been diagnosed with any digestive problems, to my knowledge. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant stomach upset many years ago, while traveling. But that was likely due to the food, and not any underlying medical condition. I try to eat a healthy diet, and I avoid overly processed foods.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, let's talk about your neurological system. Have you had any headaches, dizziness, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty with speech or memory?
PATIENT: Neurological system… That is… a more difficult question. I do get occasional headaches, yes. Tension headaches, I believe. And sometimes, a little dizziness, particularly when I stand up quickly. My vision… it has deteriorated slightly with age, but nothing significant. I wear reading glasses, as you can see. As for weakness, numbness… no, not that I recall. Though… my hands do ache sometimes, but that is due to my work, and not any neurological condition. Difficulty with speech… no, not recently. Though… I do struggle to recall details sometimes, as we’ve discussed. My memory is… patchy, at best. But that is likely due to stress and… the passage of time, and not any underlying neurological condition. I haven't experienced any sudden changes in my mental state, or any seizures. Though… I do occasionally feel… a little confused, but that is likely due to overwork and… lack of sleep. I apologize for my vagueness. It is… frustrating for both of us, I imagine.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Evann. You’re doing just fine. It’s very helpful to know about these things, even if the details are a bit hazy. And it’s good that you're aware of these changes. Now, let’s talk about your musculoskeletal system—your bones, muscles, and joints. You mentioned your hands ache. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, my hands… It’s a persistent ache, particularly in my knuckles and wrists. It flares up after a long day of etching, or if the weather is cold and damp. It’s not a sudden, sharp pain, but more of a dull, throbbing ache. It restricts my movement somewhat, and makes it difficult to grip things. I've been seeing a specialist for several years now, as I mentioned earlier, and they’ve recommended various exercises and… preventative measures. I try to follow their advice, but it’s difficult to maintain a consistent routine. It hasn’t interfered with my work significantly, but it is… a constant source of discomfort. I haven't experienced any sudden injuries, or any significant swelling or redness. I do take ibuprofen occasionally, as I mentioned earlier, to alleviate the pain. It's… a consequence of my profession, I suppose. I accept it as part of the process.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is helpful. And finally, let's talk about your genitourinary system. Do you have any problems with urination, such as frequency, urgency, pain, or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: That is… a rather personal question, Doctor. I… I haven't experienced any significant problems with urination. Occasionally, I need to get up during the night, but I attribute that to age and… drinking too much water before bedtime. I haven't experienced any pain, urgency, or blood in my urine. I haven’t been diagnosed with any urinary problems, either. I apologize for my vagueness. It is… not a topic I readily discuss. I assure you, I maintain a healthy lifestyle, and I haven't experienced any alarming symptoms. I do try to drink plenty of fluids, and I avoid overly processed foods. Is that sufficient? I… I would prefer to move on, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Evann. That is perfectly alright. We can absolutely move on. Now, I’ve asked a lot of questions, and I appreciate your patience. You mentioned seeing a specialist for your hands. Do you happen to have any records from them, or any medication list that we can review?
PATIENT: Records… I believe I do have some records somewhere, but they are… not readily accessible. My apartment is… somewhat disorganized, I confess. And a medication list… no, I don’t believe so. I usually just purchase ibuprofen over-the-counter, and I don’t keep a detailed record of my purchases. I apologize for my lack of preparedness. I shall attempt to locate the records, but I cannot guarantee their availability. It may require some… considerable effort. I do recall the name of the specialist, now. It’s Dr. Alistair Chen. He practices near the city center, in a modern building with a lot of glass. I believe his clinic is called… Hand & Motion Specialists. That is… the best I can recall at the moment. Would you like me to attempt to locate their contact information? I have a computer, but I am not particularly proficient with it.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Evann. Knowing Dr. Chen's name and the clinic name is very helpful. I can certainly look up their contact information and see if they have any records we can obtain with your permission. Before we do that, let’s talk a bit about why you came in today – discussing advance care planning. Do you have any specific wishes you’ve already thought about, regarding your healthcare?
PATIENT: Specific wishes… hmm. It’s… a difficult topic. I haven’t given it a great deal of consideration, to be frank. I suppose… I would prefer to be kept comfortable, should I become seriously ill. And I would prefer… not to be kept alive artificially, if there is no hope of recovery. I believe in a… dignified end, if such a thing is possible. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. As for specific treatments… I haven’t given it much thought. I trust the doctor’s judgment, ultimately. I suppose I would want my sister to be informed, should anything happen. She is… the closest relative I have. Beyond that… I haven’t formulated any concrete wishes. It’s… rather overwhelming to contemplate, to be honest. I’m simply hoping to ensure my wishes are known, and that my sister is spared any unnecessary distress. Would an Advance Directive or POLST form help with that? I confess, I’m not entirely sure what they entail.
DOCTOR: That's a very thoughtful and honest response, Evann. It's perfectly alright not to have all the answers right now. An Advance Directive is a legal document that outlines your wishes for healthcare treatment if you're unable to speak for yourself. It can cover a wide range of decisions, including life-sustaining treatment, pain management, and end-of-life care. A POLST form is a medical order that specifies your wishes regarding specific treatments, and it’s usually used for people with serious illnesses. Given your wishes, I think an Advance Directive would be a good starting point. It allows you to be very specific about what you want and don't want. We can go through it together, and I can help you understand all the options. Would you like me to provide you with the form, and we can begin the process now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be… most helpful. I confess, I find the entire process rather daunting, and I would greatly appreciate your guidance. If you could provide me with the form, and explain the options in a clear and concise manner, I would be most grateful. I trust your judgment, and I’m confident that we can create a document that accurately reflects my wishes. Perhaps we can start with the basics, and I can ask questions as we go along? I apologize in advance for my… lack of medical knowledge. I simply want to ensure my wishes are known, and that my sister is spared any unnecessary distress. Would it be possible to… take notes, as we go along? I find it helps me to retain information.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Evann. Absolutely. That's exactly what I'm here for. We'll take it slowly, and I'll explain everything in plain language. And yes, please feel free to take notes – it’s a great idea. Here's the form. It's divided into sections, and we can go through each one together. The first section is about appointing a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions for you if you're unable to. Do you have someone in mind for that role?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… hmm. My sister, I suppose. She is… the closest relative I have, and I trust her judgment, ultimately. Though… she lives in Mongolia, and we don’t speak very often. Perhaps… it would be better to appoint someone local? Someone who can be readily available, should anything happen. I confess, I haven’t given it a great deal of thought. Would it be possible to… list multiple proxies? Perhaps my sister as the primary, and a local friend as the secondary? I do have a friend, named Anya Petrova. She is… reliable, and I trust her implicitly. She works at the library, near my apartment. Would that be permissible? I apologize for my indecision. It’s… a difficult decision to make, and I want to ensure the right person is appointed.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. Listing multiple proxies is absolutely permissible. In fact, it’s a very good idea to have a backup in case your primary proxy is unavailable. So, we can list your sister as the primary healthcare proxy, and Anya Petrova as the secondary. Now, the next section asks about your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment. This includes things like mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, and resuscitation. Do you have any thoughts on these treatments?
PATIENT: Life-sustaining treatment… hmm. That is… a rather difficult topic. I suppose… I would not want to be kept alive artificially, if there is no hope of recovery. I believe in a… dignified end, if such a thing is possible. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. As for specific treatments… I trust the doctor’s judgment, ultimately. I suppose… if there is no chance of regaining consciousness, or if I am in constant pain, I would prefer to be allowed to… pass peacefully. I don’t want to be kept alive simply for the sake of it. I confess, I find the entire concept rather… unsettling. Would it be possible to… specify that I do not want any heroic measures taken? I don’t want to be resuscitated if my heart stops, or if I stop breathing. I simply want to… be allowed to pass peacefully, with dignity. I apologize for my… lack of clarity. It’s… a difficult topic to articulate.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Evann. You're articulating your wishes very clearly. It's very important to be specific, and you're doing a great job. We can definitely document that you do not want any heroic measures taken, and that you prefer to be allowed to pass peacefully if there is no hope of recovery. There’s a specific section for that, where we can check the appropriate boxes. The next section is about pain management. Do you have any preferences regarding pain relief?
PATIENT: Pain management… hmm. I suppose… I would want to be kept comfortable, should I become seriously ill. I don’t want to be in pain, if it can be avoided. I trust the doctor’s judgment, ultimately. I suppose… if I am in pain, I would want to be given whatever medication is necessary to alleviate it, even if it hastens my death. I don’t want to suffer needlessly. I confess, I find the entire prospect rather… frightening. Would it be possible to… specify that I do not want to be denied pain relief, even if it has side effects? I simply want to… be comfortable, in my final moments. I apologize for my… lack of clarity. It’s… a difficult topic to articulate. And, I confess, I am becoming rather tired. Perhaps we can take a break shortly? I simply want to… ensure my wishes are known, and that my sister is spared any unnecessary distress.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Evann. You're articulating your wishes very clearly, and it's okay to take breaks when you need them. We can absolutely document that you want to be kept comfortable, and that you do not want to be denied pain relief, even if it has side effects. We are nearing the end of the form. The remaining sections are about organ donation and some general notes. Would you like me to briefly explain those sections, or would you prefer to finish this later?
PATIENT: Perhaps… later, Doctor. I confess, I am becoming rather overwhelmed. I believe we have covered the most important aspects, and I am grateful for your guidance. I would like to review the form carefully, before signing anything. And, if possible, I would like to share it with my friend, Anya Petrova, to get her feedback. Would that be permissible? I simply want to… ensure everything is in order, and that my wishes are accurately documented. I apologize for my… indecision. It’s… a difficult process, and I want to make sure I’m making the right choices. Perhaps we can schedule another appointment, to finish this later? I simply want to… be certain, before signing anything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Evann. Absolutely. That is a very wise decision. It’s important to take your time and feel comfortable with everything. You can absolutely review the form at your leisure, share it with Anya Petrova, and schedule another appointment to finish it when you’re ready. Here’s a copy for you. Take as long as you need, and don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. We can schedule another appointment for next week, if that works for you. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… most kind. I believe that is all for today. I am grateful for your patience and guidance. And thank you for… listening to my concerns. I simply want to… ensure my wishes are known, and that my sister is spared any unnecessary distress. I shall schedule another appointment for next week, after reviewing the form with my friend. Thank you again, Doctor Sieh. You have been… most helpful. I believe that is all for today.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Evann. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. I look forward to seeing you next week. Have a good day.
