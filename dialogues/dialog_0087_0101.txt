DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Pleasure’s all mine. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back o’ mi head, ya know? Been botherin’ me for a little while now, it has. Not constant, but… noticeable when it comes on.
DOCTOR: Alright, a headache at the back of your head. And you say it's been going on for a “little while”?
PATIENT: Mm-hm. Maybe… three weeks now? Hard to say exactly, I don’t keep track o’ things like that unless it’s really botherin’ me. It started off just now and then, like after a long day workin’ with mi hands, but it’s been happenin’ more often lately. Even when I'm restin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, increasing in frequency even with rest. And you mentioned working with your hands… can you tell me a little more about the type of work you do?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. I’m a manicurist and pedicurist, ya see. Been doin’ it for… well, a long time now. Fifty years, come next February! Lots o’ bendin’ and lookin’ down, precise work with mi fingers. It’s good work, keeps me busy, but I reckon it takes a toll on ya after a while. Sometimes mi neck gets stiff too, alongside the headache.
DOCTOR: Manicurist and pedicurist for fifty years… that’s remarkable. And you’ve also noticed stiffness in your neck along with the headache. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your headache at its most intense?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It's not a terrible pain, never really been one for complainin’. I'd say… a six, maybe seven on a bad day. It’s more of a dull ache, a pressure really, than a sharp pain. Doesn’t stop me from doin’ things, but it’s definitely… there.
DOCTOR: Alright, a six to seven, dull ache, pressure at the base of the head. Do you notice anything that specifically makes the headache worse, or anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Now that ya mention it… bendin’ over for too long, definitely. Like when I’m filin’ someone’s toenails, or paintin’ a detailed design. That’ll bring it on quick. And… stress, I suppose. If I’m really busy, lots o’ customers, feelin’ rushed… it makes it worse too. To make it better… well, restin’ helps. And a nice warm towel on mi neck. Mi wife, she’s good at that, bless her heart. Sometimes a cup o’ tea too, but that's more for comfort, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, bending, stress worsen it, rest and a warm towel provide some relief. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really. No blurry vision, no dizziness. No nausea or anything like that. Sometimes mi shoulders feel a bit tight, same as mi neck, but I put that down to the work. Oh! And… I've been feelin' a bit tired lately, now that I think on it. Just a general… weariness, ya know? But I’m eighty-seven years old, Doctor, so that could be anythin’.
DOCTOR: Right, eighty-seven years old… perfectly reasonable to feel some weariness. No blurry vision, dizziness, or nausea. Just the neck and shoulder tightness, and increasing fatigue. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never really had much need for them, thankfully. I've taken a bit o' painkiller here and there for aches and pains over the years, but never anything regularly. And never had a bad reaction to anythin’ if I recall correctly. Mi wife keeps track of things like that too, she'd remember if I did.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications at all, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. I try to stay away from 'em as much as possible, if I can help it. Just a bit o' Vitamin C now and then, for a boost, but that's it. I believe in lettin’ mi body do its own healin’ if it can. Plus, I don't really like feelin' like I'm dependent on anythin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, no allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll just check your blood pressure, pulse, and then take a look at your neck and shoulders, and do a basic neurological exam. Just to rule out anything serious. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Sounds perfectly alright to me, Doctor. Go right ahead. I ain't afraid o' a little look-see. Just let me know if anythin' feels uncomfortable, ya? I'm an old man, but I still got all mi senses.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not overly concerning for your age. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I'm going to feel your neck and shoulders. Please let me know if anything is tender. Do you feel any pain here?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, that's a bit tender right… there. And here too, a little bit. Not sharp pain, just… tight. Feels like a knot, almost. Like someone's been squeezin' it for a while now. It’s worse when you press on it, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, tenderness at the base of the neck bilaterally, more pronounced on the left, and in the right shoulder blade area. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your neck. Can you slowly turn your head to the left, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Mm-hm. That’s about as far as it’ll go, Doctor. Feels a bit stiff, ya see? Not painful, just… limited. Like somethin’s blockin’ mi movement. It's been gettin' worse gradually, over the past few weeks, just like the headache.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion in the neck, consistent with the reported stiffness. Now, I’m going to check some reflexes. This is just a quick test, nothing to worry about. Reflexes are normal. I'm also going to do a quick neurological exam, just to be thorough. All appears normal here as well. Based on my examination, it seems likely you're experiencing tension headaches related to muscle strain in your neck and shoulders, likely from the repetitive nature of your work. It's not uncommon with your profession.
PATIENT: Ah, that’s good to hear it ain’t nothin’ too serious, Doctor. Tension headaches, ya say? From all the bendin' and workin’ with mi hands? Makes sense, I reckon. Fifty years is a long time to be doin’ anythin’, especially with such precise work. So, what do ya think I should do about it? Anythin' I can take, or… ?
DOCTOR: Yes, tension headaches are very common with occupations that involve repetitive movements and sustained postures. We can try a few things. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed for the headache. Heat or cold packs can also be helpful, whichever feels better to you. I also suggest gentle stretching exercises for your neck and shoulders several times a day. I can provide you with a handout outlining some simple exercises. However, given your age and the fact that this has been ongoing for three weeks, I’d also like to order some X-rays of your neck, just to rule out any underlying arthritis or structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-rays, ya say? Well, I ain’t scared o' a little picture-takin', Doctor. If it’ll put mi mind at ease, and make sure there ain’t nothin’ too serious goin’ on, then yes, go right ahead. I’m happy to do whatever ya think is best. And yes, please, that handout with the stretchin’ exercises would be grand. I’ll try mi best to do ‘em regularly. Mi wife always tells me I need to take better care o’ meself!
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the radiology department schedule those X-rays for you. They will likely call you within the next day or two to arrange an appointment. In the meantime, please continue with the over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and try those stretching exercises. Here’s the handout. It's important to listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain. I'd like to see you back here in two weeks to review the X-ray results and assess your progress. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Two weeks gives me time to get those X-rays done and try out these exercises. I appreciate ya takin’ the time to look at me, and not brushin’ me off as just an old man. Thank ya kindly. I’ll be sure to call if anythin’ gets worse before then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Here's a contact number for the clinic. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Right then. You too, Doctor Soodeen. Thank ya again for everything. I will. Have yerself a good day as well. .
