DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, it's about my weight. I've been… carrying a little extra lately, and it's starting to bother me. I was hoping to talk about maybe some medication to help me lose a few pounds.
DOCTOR: "A little extra," you say. And how long has this been…bothering you, Mr. Osumi?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… probably the last year or so, I'd say. It just crept up on me, you know? Not a sudden thing. But it’s making it harder to get around, even with my work. I make models, wood carvings… requires a bit of moving, bending. It’s not as easy as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And approximately how much weight would you say you’ve gained over that year?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. I haven’t… really weighed myself consistently, to be honest. Maybe… fifteen, twenty pounds? It’s hard to say exactly. I just know my clothes don’t fit like they used to, and I get winded easier. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Osumi. But we really need a baseline. Do you happen to know your weight from, say, a year ago?
PATIENT: Hmm… a year ago… You know, my wife, God rest her soul, she used to weigh me. But that was… before. I don’t recall the exact number. I suppose I could have written it down somewhere… but I haven’t looked. I apologize. I’m not very good with numbers.
DOCTOR: Well, we'll need to get a current weight then, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. That makes perfect sense. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Right this way. Just step on, and I’ll record the number. Please remove your shoes.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just a moment… these old bones aren’t as nimble as they once were. Here we go…
DOCTOR: 80 kilograms. That’s approximately 176 pounds. And your height is listed as 170 centimeters—about 5’7”. So, your BMI is… 27.7. That places you in the overweight category. Now, before we discuss medication, I need to ask some further questions. Have you tried any diet or exercise programs in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. After my wife passed, I wasn't eating right, to be honest. I tried to get back on track, walking a bit. My daughter, she tried to get me on some of those… what do you call them… meal plans? With the pre-packaged food. Didn’t last long. Just not a fan of all that… processed stuff. I prefer to eat real food, you know? And the walking… I tried, but my knees started bothering me. It’s difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, diet changes haven't been sustainable, and exercise is limited by knee pain. I see. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… the doctor always told me my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a small pill for it, years ago. Still take that, yes. And… oh! I had a bit of trouble with my cholesterol a long time ago, but it seems to be okay now. They check it every year when I get my physical. Aside from that, not much. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: And what medication are you taking for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… Here it is. Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. My regular doctor, Dr. Nakamura, he prescribed it. A good man, Dr. Nakamura.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 10mg daily. Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife used to worry about that, always asking if I was allergic to something new when we went to restaurants. But I always just told her, “I eat anything, dear.”
DOCTOR: And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife didn’t like them. And I might have a small glass of wine with dinner… once in a while. Maybe on a special occasion. But that's it. Definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested in any of that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had diabetes. And my father, he had heart trouble, passed away when he was fairly young. My wife’s side of the family… mostly healthy, I think. No major illnesses that I can recall. They were a sturdy bunch, my wife’s people.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Osumi, that gives me a good starting point. Given your history, your current medication, and your lifestyle, simply prescribing a medication isn't the most prudent course of action at this time. Your knees are already bothering you, and we need to rule out other possible causes for your weight gain before attributing it solely to diet and exercise.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I appreciate you taking the time to look at everything. What do you suggest then? What’s the next step?
DOCTOR: I’d like to order some blood work to check your blood sugar, cholesterol levels, and thyroid function. And I also recommend a consultation with a physical therapist to address your knee pain. They can develop a tailored exercise program that won't aggravate your condition. We'll also want to talk about diet, but a sustainable plan is important, and a registered dietician might be helpful there. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Blood work, physical therapy… and maybe someone to help with the eating. I can do that. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. So, how do we go about getting these things arranged?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work. You can get that done at the lab down the street—I’ll give you a slip. As for the physical therapy, I’ll make a referral for you. The office will contact you to schedule an appointment. As for the dietician, I can provide you with a list of recommended professionals in the area. It will be a process, Mr. Osumi, but we’ll get you moving in the right direction. Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. A list of dieticians… that’s good. I appreciate it. Thank you for not just… handing me a pill. It’s nice to feel like you’re actually listening.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Osumi. That’s my job. I’ll have the receptionist give you all the necessary paperwork and the referral information. Please follow up with me after you’ve had the blood work done and seen the physical therapist, and we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. Here's the requisition. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And thank you again for your time and patience. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Mr. Osumi. Take care.
