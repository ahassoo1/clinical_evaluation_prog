DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… alright. Honestly, it’s this bruising. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, the one the other doctor prescribed after… well, never mind. But I bump into things normally, like everyone does, and now I look like I've been in a boxing match. It’s embarrassing, frankly. And worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bruising easily is definitely concerning, especially when you're on a blood thinner. Let’s get to the bottom of this. You mentioned a blood thinner prescribed by another doctor… can you remind me what the name of that medication is?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t remember the name. It was… a while ago, after my wife passed. A lot of things got… blurry then. It’s a little white pill, I think. Or maybe a pale yellow? They all look the same after a while, you know? I just fill the prescription every month, and the pharmacy takes care of it. I don’t bother trying to keep track of everything. It's not like I prescribe it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand – it’s perfectly normal to not remember medication names, especially during a difficult time. We can certainly look it up in our system, or I can check your pharmacy records. That’s the easiest way to be sure. Do you recall which pharmacy you typically use?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's… Walgreens. The one on Elm Street. Near the bakery. Though I sometimes go to the other one, the one by the grocery store, if I’m already there. Honestly, they both deliver, so it doesn’t really matter, does it? They just… show up with the pills. Are you sure you need the exact location? It feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have the primary location, just to ensure we pull the correct record. There can be slight variations in prescriptions between locations, and we want to be as accurate as possible. Okay, here we are… it says you’re currently on Warfarin, 5mg daily. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Warfarin… yes, that sounds right. War-fa-rin. That’s it. See? I knew it was something complicated I couldn’t remember. Five milligrams… yes, that sounds about right too. Honestly, I just swallow the pill. I don’t pay attention to the numbers. You doctors are the ones who need to keep track of all this. Is that a lot? Is five milligrams a lot of Warfarin? Should I be worried about that?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright that you don’t keep track of the dosage – that’s what I'm here for. Five milligrams is a standard dose of Warfarin, but whether it’s the right dose for you is what we need to determine. Warfarin requires regular monitoring with blood tests to ensure it’s within the therapeutic range – meaning it’s effectively preventing clots without causing excessive bleeding. Have you had those blood tests done regularly?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, I think so. They call me, sometimes. Tell me to come in. Or sometimes they just… adjust the dose. I don’t really remember the specifics. It’s a whole process, isn’t it? I go to the lab, they poke me, and then I go home. They call with the results. It feels like a lot of bother, honestly. Is it really necessary to do them so often? I mean, if the pills are supposed to be helping, shouldn’t I just… keep taking them? Perhaps I'm just being sensitive. It’s just… a needle, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. It is a process, and it can be bothersome to have regular blood tests. However, with Warfarin, it’s absolutely crucial. Warfarin’s effect on your blood can vary depending on many factors – your diet, other medications you’re taking, even how you’re feeling that day. That’s why we need to monitor your INR – that’s the blood test that measures how quickly your blood clots. Do you know the last time your INR was checked, and if so, what the result was?
PATIENT: INR… no, I have absolutely no idea. They just tell me if I need to adjust the dose. Or don’t. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. All these numbers and tests… It’s just… a lot. I came in because I’m bruising, and now you’re asking me about numbers I don’t even know. Can we just… look at the bruising? Maybe it's nothing? Perhaps I just need to be more careful.
DOCTOR: You’re right to say that. I apologize for throwing so many numbers at you. It’s easy for me to get into the details, and I forget that it can be overwhelming. We absolutely can focus on the bruising. Let's take a look. Could you please roll up your sleeves and pants legs a bit so I can get a good look?
PATIENT: Fine. There. Happy now? It’s awful, isn't it? I keep hitting my shins on furniture, even when I’m trying to be careful. And these ones on my arms… I don’t even remember how I got these. It’s just… appearing, like some sort of rash, only purple and painful. It's making me anxious, honestly. I don't want to end up with a body covered in bruises.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There are definitely several bruises here, in various stages of healing. The different colors indicate different ages of the bruises – the newer ones are more purple and tender, while the older ones are fading to yellow. It’s concerning to have this many, especially without a clear explanation. I'm not seeing any signs of a more serious underlying issue just by looking, but to be thorough, I'd like to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… get it over with, please. I have other things I need to be doing. This whole thing is taking up my entire morning. I just want to know if I'm going to be alright, and if these bruises are something to worry about. Is it my blood thinner, or is it something else? It’s just… a lot of uncertainty, you know? I don't handle uncertainty well.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson, and I'll do my best to get you some answers as quickly as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Your heart and lungs sound normal. That rules out some of the more serious possibilities. Given your history of taking Warfarin, the bruising is likely related to the medication. However, it's still important to investigate further. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel to assess your blood cells and how well your blood is clotting. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A complete… what now? Look, Doctor, I already told you, I don’t understand all these numbers and tests. Just tell me, is it dangerous? Am I going to die from bruising? I just want a straight answer. You’re making this much more complicated than it needs to be. I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not confuse them with a bunch of medical jargon. Frankly, I’m starting to regret coming in at all. Perhaps I should just deal with the bruises myself.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be frustrated, Mr. Farson. I apologize for using medical jargon and making you feel more confused and anxious. I will absolutely stop doing that. To answer your question directly: No, you are not going to die from bruising. However, excessive bruising can be a sign of a more serious problem, and we need to rule those out. A complete blood count is a simple blood test that checks the number of different types of cells in your blood. It can help us identify if you have any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the bruising. The coagulation panel is another blood test that checks how well your blood is clotting. It's not about making things more complicated; it's about being thorough and making sure we're not missing anything. Would you be willing to let me order these tests, so we can get some answers and put your mind at ease?
PATIENT: Fine. Do the tests. Whatever. Just… get it over with. And please, no more numbers. Just tell me if it's bad or not. I have a lunch appointment, you know. This is taking up my entire day. Honestly, I used to have a good doctor… she didn’t bother me with all this nonsense. Just told me what was wrong and gave me a pill. This is… exhausting. And frankly, condescending. Are you implying I’m stupid? Because I don’t understand all your fancy medical terms?
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, you are absolutely right to be frustrated, and I sincerely apologize if I’ve made you feel stupid or condescended to. That was not my intention at all. I am truly sorry. I understand you miss your previous doctor and her straightforward approach, and I’ll do my best to be more clear and concise. I just want to ensure we’re covering all bases to provide you with the best possible care. I'm ordering the CBC and coagulation panel now. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take long. Once the results are back, we can discuss them together, and I’ll explain them in plain language. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could cause further injury. And if you notice any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe pain, swelling, or bleeding, please contact me immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. I’m going to the lab. And then I'm going to lunch. And frankly, I’m not in a very good mood anymore. Just… leave me alone. .
