DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. Well, I got a note from... someone. Said I should come get a card. A “get well” card, they said. From a doctor. Seemed silly, but… here I am. Don’t feel sick, you understand. Just… doing what they tell me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a bit unusual to be referred for a “get well” card. Let’s try to figure out what prompted this visit, then. Sometimes these things are a follow-up from an emergency room visit or a recent hospitalization. Do you recall being to the hospital or seeing another doctor recently?
PATIENT: Hospital? No. Not recently. Not for anything serious. I had my knee looked at, a long time ago. But that wasn’t the hospital. A… a specialist. A bone doctor. That was years, maybe five years, ago. And I definitely didn’t get no card then. This is all very… strange. Who even sends a card for feeling fine? It's a waste of good paper.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kammer. Let me see if I can find anything in your chart that might explain this. Just give me a moment… Ah, here we are. It looks like you did have a visit with an orthopedic specialist five years ago, as you mentioned, for knee pain. And… it appears you were seen in the emergency room about six months ago for shortness of breath. Do you remember that visit?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath…? Hmm. Now that you mention it… I did have a little trouble breathing one night. But I figured it was the heat. It gets awful hot in my building. Didn’t go to no hospital. Maybe I… maybe my daughter took me? She worries too much. Honestly, I don't remember much about it. Just felt a little winded. Why would that need a card? Are you sure you got the right person?
DOCTOR: The records indicate you were evaluated for possible pneumonia and discharged with a prescription for an antibiotic. It also mentions a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician was recommended. It seems someone – likely your daughter – scheduled this visit for you to ensure everything is resolving properly. That’s a good thing, Mr. Kammer. It’s always best to be thorough. To be sure, let's just do a quick check of your lungs and take your oxygen level. It’ll only take a minute or two. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Pneumonia…? I never had pneumonia! I told you, it was the heat. And now you want to poke and prod at me? Honestly. I don’t like doctors poking and prodding. And I feel perfectly fine. But… alright. If it gets you to stop asking questions… go ahead. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. Just hurry up, please. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kammer. I'll be as quick as possible. I understand your frustration. This is just a routine check to make sure everything is clear. Just breathe normally, as deeply as you can. Okay. And again… Good. Now, I’m going to listen to your front, if you don’t mind. Hmm. I do hear some mild wheezing in your lower lungs. It's subtle, but it's there. And your oxygen saturation is a little lower than I'd like, at 92%. It’s not an emergency, but it does warrant a bit more investigation. Could you tell me if you've had any cough, fever, or chills recently?
PATIENT: Wheezing…? Never heard of it. And 92… what does that mean? Numbers. Always with the numbers. I told you I feel fine. A little tired, maybe. It’s August, it’s hot. And yes, I coughed a little last week, a tickle in my throat. But that’s it! Old age, probably. And no fever. I don't get fevers. My daughter always makes a fuss over nothing. This is ridiculous. Are you going to give me a card now? Or are you going to keep poking and prodding and throwing numbers at me?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kammer. You’re right, numbers can be confusing. 92% oxygen saturation is a little low, and the mild wheezing suggests there might be some inflammation in your lungs. It’s not alarming, but it's enough to want to figure out what’s going on. Since you mentioned a cough, and the wheezing I’m hearing, it’s possible you had a mild case of bronchitis or a lingering effect from a previous respiratory infection. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. It’s a quick, painless procedure, and it will help us rule out anything more serious. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray…? You want to take a picture of my lungs? What for? I'm telling you, it's nothing! Just a little cough, a little tired… It’s the heat! And now you want to shine lights at my insides? Honestly, you doctors… always with the fancy machines. I don’t like it. No. No X-ray. I’ll just… I’ll just go home and drink some tea. That’s what my mother always did. This is a waste of my time. And a waste of good paper, sending me here for nothing. I’m not getting an X-ray. .
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Kammer. I respect your decision. However, given the mild wheezing and slightly low oxygen level, it’s difficult to rule out potential issues without further investigation. Since you are declining the X-ray, I strongly recommend a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician. They can monitor your symptoms and determine the best course of action. I'm going to write a note to them detailing my findings and your concerns. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or high fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Here's a referral note to take with you. Would you like me to help you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician before you leave?
