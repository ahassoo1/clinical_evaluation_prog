DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Stilaire. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’ve been coughing up… blood. Not a lot, but enough to worry me. It happened a few times this week. It’s… frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Weichers. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is concerning and it’s good you came in to get it checked. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it’s… bright red. Not dark. And it’s… mixed with my spit, I guess. Not just… pure blood. And it doesn’t always happen when I cough, just sometimes. Sometimes it's just a little bit, other times… a bit more. I hope that makes sense. It’s hard to talk about.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Weichers, and you are doing very well explaining it. Bright red blood suggests it’s coming from fairly close to your airway. Now, can you tell me about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… about three days ago, I believe. August 1st. I remember because my grandson, Leo, was visiting and I was trying not to worry him. He’s six. I coughed a little then, but didn't see anything. Then yesterday, it was… more noticeable. And this morning again. I haven’t had a fever, or chills, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the coughing?
PATIENT: Um… well, I have been a little tired. But I am always a little tired. I don't know if that's… related. And… my chest feels a little tight sometimes, but I have asthma. So it could be that. It's… hard to tell what is new and what is just my asthma. I've been using my inhaler more, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. The increased inhaler use is a good piece of information. Now, Ms. Weichers, regarding your asthma—how well-controlled has it been generally, would you say?
PATIENT: It's… okay. Most of the time, it's fine. I don't have attacks very often. But sometimes, with the weather changing or if I get a cold, it gets a little worse. I usually can manage it with my inhaler and sometimes a short course of steroids, if it’s really bad. The last time I needed steroids was… maybe six months ago? I don't remember exactly. It hasn't been bothering me more than usual, until this blood, of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, Ms. Weichers, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, and then I’ll perform a brief physical exam. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a little sniffle maybe two weeks ago, but it didn't last long. Just a very mild cold. I didn’t even take anything for it. Nothing like the flu, definitely. And I haven't been around anyone who is sick, as far as I know. I try to be careful, especially since… since my husband passed away, I am extra cautious.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Weichers. And, if you don’t mind me asking, do you have any significant past medical history, aside from the asthma?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. And… I had a broken wrist when I was younger, but that’s healed completely. Other than that… not much, I don't think. I try to stay healthy. And… I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Just a small glass of wine occasionally with dinner. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful information, Ms. Weichers, thank you. Yes, it is important. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Yes, just my asthma inhalers. I have a blue one, which is for when I feel an attack coming on, and a brown one that I use every day to prevent attacks. I also take a vitamin D supplement, but that's it. Nothing else. Do you need to know the names of the inhalers? I have them in my purse. I can get them for you.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, if you wouldn’t mind. Knowing the specific names will be very helpful. While you're getting those, could you also tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Here. This blue one is Ventolin, and the brown one is Symbicort. And… allergies? Um… I am allergic to cats. I get a little itchy if I pet one. And… I think I’m a little allergic to pollen, in the springtime. It makes me sneeze, but not too badly. Nothing serious, really. I haven’t been around cats or much pollen lately.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Weichers. This is very thorough. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be causing this, I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, and I’ll also take a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead. It’s a little scary, but I want to know what is happening. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'm going to ask you to take a few deep breaths. First, I’ll listen to your heart. Please relax your shoulders… Your heart sounds regular. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs, front and back. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… and again… I hear some mild wheezing, which could be related to your asthma. Now, could you open your mouth wide and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Ah… Is something wrong? My throat feels fine, I don't think I have a sore throat. I don’t feel like I'm coming down with a cold or anything like that. I just… worry. It’s hard not to, with this blood. It really frightened me. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Your throat looks clear, Ms. Weichers, no significant inflammation. The wheezing I'm hearing does suggest your asthma may be contributing, however, given the presence of blood, we need to investigate further to rule out other possibilities. I would like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count to get a clearer picture of what's going on. The X-ray will help us see if there's any sign of infection or other lung issues, and the CBC will check for any abnormalities in your blood cells. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. An X-ray and blood tests… alright. I trust you. I just want to know what is happening and get this sorted out. Is the X-ray… painful? And how long will the blood tests take? I have a dinner appointment with my grandson later this week, I hope I can still make it. He is learning to play checkers.
DOCTOR: The X-ray is not painful at all, Ms. Weichers. You'll simply stand or sit in front of a machine, and it will take a picture of your chest. It’s very quick and non-invasive. As for the blood tests, they usually take about ten minutes to draw the sample, and the results typically come back within a day or two. I will let the lab know it is urgent, given your symptoms. We will certainly do our best to get you an answer as quickly as possible so you can enjoy your checkers game with Leo. In the meantime, if you experience any increase in bleeding, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anyone I can contact should I need further information?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. Leo is very excited about teaching me checkers. He's a very good teacher, very patient. No, I don’t have anyone local I could… contact. Everyone else lives in Japan. I’m quite on my own here, really. But I’m alright. I’m… used to it. Just a little worried. Should I continue using my inhalers as normal? Do you have a preferred pharmacy nearby? I have insurance, private insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Weichers. You’re very resilient. Yes, please continue using your inhalers as you normally would. Do not stop or change your dosage without consulting me first. And, yes, I do have a preferred pharmacy very close to the clinic—Miller's Pharmacy. They are very reliable and will bill your insurance directly. Would you like me to send the prescriptions there electronically?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Miller’s Pharmacy sounds fine. That would be very convenient. Thank you for… everything, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and reassuring. I feel… a little less scared now. Still worried, but… less scared. What should I expect after the X-ray and blood tests? Will you call me with the results? How long does it usually take to get a phone call? I don’t have a mobile phone.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. That’s my job. Once the results are available, my nurse, Sarah, will contact you by telephone with the findings. Since you don’t have a mobile phone, we will use the number we have on file. Typically, we receive results within 24-48 hours. Sarah will explain the results to you and if any further action is required. If you haven’t heard anything within 48 hours, please do not hesitate to call the clinic directly and ask for an update. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve answered everything, really. Thank you again, Doctor Stilaire. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate your kindness. I suppose… I'll just go and have the X-ray done. It was… nice meeting you. Hopefully, the results will be alright.
DOCTOR: It was lovely meeting you too, Ms. Weichers. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns whatsoever. The X-ray technician will be expecting you. Take care, and I hope you enjoy your checkers game with Leo.
