DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Fourney, it’s about my sight, naturally. It's…diminishing. It's not a sudden thing, mind you. More of a gradual…fading. It's quite inconvenient, really. A man needs to see things, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes, I suppose it is. “Diminishing,” you say. How long has this been going on, and can you describe it a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s been…months, certainly. Perhaps six, maybe eight? It's hard to pinpoint. It’s not as though I spend my days cataloging the passage of time, Doctor. As for describing it…everything seems a bit…gray. Not completely gone, you understand. Just…washed out. Like looking through a dirty window, perhaps. And it's worse at night, naturally. Everything blends together. Makes driving…problematic. Though I assure you, I'm a very careful driver.
DOCTOR: "Gray," "washed out," worse at night…and affecting driving. Alright. Have you noticed any other changes with your vision?
PATIENT: Other changes? Goodness, Doctor, what kind of question is that? I suppose…things seem a little blurry around the edges. Not consistently, mind you. Just when I'm tired, perhaps. Or when I haven't had enough coffee. It’s likely just age, honestly. My father's sight went the same way. Though he wasn’t as…particular about his health as I am. Mostly just sat around, you know. Not a productive man. Did you go to a good school, Doctor? This is a rather nice office, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: Blurry around the edges, worse with fatigue. And a family history of similar vision changes. That's good information. Now, let's try to focus on your specific situation, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any floaters, flashes of light, or any double vision?
PATIENT: Floaters? Flashes? Doctor, are you attempting to confuse me? I'm a businessman, not a…a stargazer. I see things. Or, I used to see things clearly. Now everything is…dim. No, I haven't noticed any “floaters” or “flashes.” Honestly, I don't know what you expect me to notice. I’m here because my vision is deteriorating, not because I’ve suddenly developed an interest in…optometry. Are you sure you went to medical school? This feels like a rather elementary line of questioning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Let's move on to a quick exam, then. It will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. I'm going to check your visual acuity, peripheral vision, and examine the back of your eye with an ophthalmoscope. Please just follow my instructions.
PATIENT: An exam, is it? Very well. Though I must say, I find this rather…unnecessary. I’m perfectly capable of assessing my own state of affairs, thank you very much. But proceed, if you must. Though do be gentle. I have a very important meeting this afternoon. And please, refrain from using any…technical jargon. I prefer plain English.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I’ll do my best to be as efficient and clear as possible. Now, if you would just look straight ahead at the chart on the wall, and tell me what letters you see, starting with the top row.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is hardly a scientific endeavor. The lighting in here is atrocious. And these letters…they’re dreadfully small. Hmm…let me see. The top row…it appears to be…E, C…perhaps a P? It's all rather blurry, you know. Is this the best you have? I've seen clearer charts at the DMV.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s try this one. Just read the letters as clearly as you can, from left to right. Don’t strain your eyes. Okay. Your visual acuity is approximately 20/70 in both eyes. That means you can see at 70 feet what someone with normal vision can see at 20 feet. Now, I’m going to check your peripheral vision. I need you to look straight ahead at this point, and tell me when you see a light in your side vision.
PATIENT: 20/70, you say? Dreadful. Simply dreadful. I knew something was amiss. My golf game has been suffering, you know. Couldn't see the ball properly. Peripheral vision now? More lights? Doctor, this is turning into a rather elaborate torture session. I’m looking straight ahead, as you requested. Now, where is this light supposed to appear? Honestly, it’s difficult to concentrate with all this…fuss. It's probably just the overhead lights reflecting off the window. Is it lunchtime yet?
DOCTOR: Your peripheral vision is markedly reduced in both eyes, Mr. Alcorta. Now, I'm going to use an ophthalmoscope to examine the back of your eyes. It won’t hurt, but I need you to look straight ahead and remain still. I see some areas of pallor in both optic discs, and some mild drusen. These findings, combined with your reduced visual acuity and peripheral vision, are suggestive of age-related macular degeneration, though further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
PATIENT: Macular…degeneration? Is that…serious? Doctor, you’re using all these complicated terms again. Pallor? Drusen? Honestly, I feel as though I’m attending a medical convention. Is this going to affect my driving? And my golf game, naturally. Further testing, you say? More lights? Honestly, this is becoming quite tiresome. Will this require…surgery? I have a very important business deal pending, you know. Can't be having any downtime. And will my insurance cover this? Oh, wait… nevermind. This is just…splendid. Utterly splendid.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, age-related macular degeneration is a common condition that affects central vision. It can cause blurry or distorted vision, and, if left untreated, can lead to significant vision loss. While there is no cure, there are treatments available that can slow the progression of the disease. To get a better understanding of the severity of your condition, I recommend a fluorescein angiography and an optical coherence tomography scan. These tests will provide detailed images of your retina and help me determine the best course of treatment. As for your questions, these tests do require an injection, but it's generally well-tolerated. Regarding your driving and golf game, the extent to which your vision will be affected depends on the severity of your condition. We need the results of the tests to determine that. Given you are uninsured, I will refer you to a specialist who participates in a financial assistance program. They may be able to provide the tests and treatment at a reduced cost. I will also provide you with a list of resources for low-cost vision care. It's important to address this now, Mr. Alcorta, to preserve as much of your vision as possible. I understand your concerns about your business deal and golf game, but your vision is paramount.
PATIENT: Injection, you say? Financial assistance programs? Doctor, this is all rather…unsettling. I've always taken pride in my independence. I don’t care for the idea of needing charity, frankly. And I still haven't heard whether this will affect my driving! My golf handicap is rather important, you know. Is there absolutely no other way? Perhaps some…eye exercises? Or a different pair of glasses? I have a rather expensive optician. Is he not good enough? And what about this specialist? Is he…competent? I don't wish to be experimented on. This is all very inconvenient. Utterly inconvenient. .
