DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um... well, I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me a lot. It was… in my spit. Not a lot, but enough to worry me. It happened a few times now, over the last week.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood, you say. Hemoptysis, to be precise. And this has occurred over the past week?
PATIENT: “Hemop… what-sis?” Sorry, Doctor. That is a big word. Just… coughing up blood. Yes, for about one week now. It’s not every cough, just sometimes. It makes me nervous. Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: Hemoptysis simply means coughing up blood, Ms. Weichers. I apologize for the medical terminology. It can be concerning, yes. We need to determine the source. Now, tell me, can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay, hemop-tee-sis is coughing up blood. That makes sense. It's… bright red. Not dark. And… not a huge amount, like a tablespoon maybe, each time? It's mixed with the… normal spit, I guess. It doesn’t hurt to cough it up, really. Just… surprising. And a little frightening.
DOCTOR: Bright red, mixed with sputum, approximately one tablespoon each episode… and no associated pain. Good. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I have been a little tired lately, but I thought that was just… being older. And maybe a little short of breath when I walk up the stairs, but I live on the second floor, so that's not unusual. No fever, no chills, no chest pain. I… I don’t think so. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “A little tired” and “a little short of breath” are details, Ms. Weichers. Everything is helpful. We need to be thorough. Now, do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. My husband… he used to, but he passed away three years ago. He quit many years before he got sick, though. Is it something bad, Doctor? You seem… concerned.
DOCTOR: It’s concerning enough to investigate, Ms. Weichers. Hemoptysis can have several causes, ranging from relatively benign to more serious. We need to rule out the more concerning possibilities. Now, have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Just a little cold a couple of months ago, but nothing major. No fever, no bad aches, just a sniffle for a few days. I took some over-the-counter medicine and it went away. I don't remember being sick before that for… a long time. Do you think it could be from that old cold? Even though it was a while ago?
DOCTOR: It's possible a lingering irritation from a previous cold could be a factor, Ms. Weichers, but we can’t assume that. Given your age and the presence of hemoptysis, we need to do some further investigation to be certain. I'm going to perform a physical exam, and then I'd like to order a chest X-ray. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A chest X-ray, yes. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's wrong. A physical exam is fine too. Will it… hurt?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Weichers, it will not hurt. I will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and palpate your lymph nodes. Standard procedure. Please have a seat on the examination table and I'll begin.
PATIENT: Okay. I am a little cold. Is it alright if I keep my sweater on?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Weichers. Keeping your sweater on is perfectly acceptable. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Another one. Good. I'm hearing some slight… diminished breath sounds on the lower left lobe. It’s subtle, but noted. Lymph nodes feel… normal. No swelling, no tenderness. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, open your mouth and say "Ah." Throat appears clear. No visible lesions.
PATIENT: "Ahhh." Is that… bad, Doctor? The breath sounds being… quiet? I am starting to worry a little.
DOCTOR: "Diminished breath sounds" simply means they are quieter than expected, Ms. Weichers. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it warrants further investigation. This, combined with the hemoptysis, is why I’m ordering the chest X-ray. I'm writing the order for the X-ray now. The radiology department is down the hall. They’ll call you when they're ready. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? I… I don't think so? I've never had an X-ray before, so I don't know what that is. I am not allergic to anything, as far as I know. Just… pollen sometimes, but I just sneeze. That's all. Do they use dye for every X-ray?
DOCTOR: Most standard chest X-rays do not require contrast dye, Ms. Weichers. My apologies for not clarifying. I was being preemptive. However, depending on the results of the initial X-ray, we may need to consider a CT scan, which sometimes utilizes contrast. For now, just go down to radiology and tell them Dr. Duplichan ordered a chest X-ray. They will explain the procedure. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay, good. No dye right now, that is… reassuring. No, I don't think so. Just… go to radiology and tell them your name and that you need an X-ray. Will they tell me the results right away, or will I have to come back? And… is it okay if I walk there myself? It’s not far, is it?
DOCTOR: Typically, the results will not be available immediately, Ms. Weichers. The radiologist needs to interpret the images. They will send the report to my office, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. As for walking there, yes, that is perfectly acceptable. It is just down the hall. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Please let my staff know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms while waiting for the results.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I will. I… I will let your staff know. Thank you. .
