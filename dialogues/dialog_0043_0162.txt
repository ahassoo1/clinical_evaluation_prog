DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, no offense, but I don’t really have time for small talk. I just… my stomach's been puffed up, alright? Been happening for a bit now. Honestly, it’s annoying. Can we just figure out what’s wrong and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I apologize if my greeting seemed excessive; I simply aim to create a comfortable environment for our patients. We will absolutely get straight to the point and address your concerns. So, you’re experiencing abdominal distension – a feeling of puffiness in your stomach. You mentioned it’s been happening for “a bit now.” Could you tell me approximately how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, “approximately”? Look, I don’t keep calendars for my bloating, okay? A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. Sometimes I wake up fine, sometimes I look like I swallowed a beach ball. It’s just… uncomfortable. I eat, I work, it happens. Doesn’t really matter what I do, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. It's frustrating when symptoms are unpredictable and don't seem to be linked to anything specific. “A few weeks” is helpful, thank you. You say it doesn’t seem to matter what you do. To clarify, does this happen regardless of what you eat, or when you eat, or is it entirely random?
PATIENT: Random, mostly. I mean, I eat normal stuff. Burgers, rice, chicken… I'm a pile driver operator, I need the fuel. It’s not like I’m living on salads, but I also don’t go crazy with junk food. It just… happens. Sometimes after a big meal, sometimes not. Honestly, I stopped trying to figure it out. It’s a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a fairly standard diet and no consistent relationship with meal timing or quantity. That’s good information. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this distension?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I dunno. I just feel… bloated. Maybe a little gassy sometimes. Look, doc, I’m not here to list every little thing. It’s my stomach, it puffs up, and it’s annoying. Is that enough, or do you need a detailed timeline of every burp?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kristofik, that’s quite alright. You’re not expected to provide a detailed timeline of every burp. I simply ask to rule out any potential underlying issues. You mentioned gas – is this accompanied by any abdominal pain, cramping, or changes in your bowel habits – either constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. Like… a dull ache, nothin' serious. Comes and goes with the puffiness, I guess. Bowel habits are… normal. I go when I gotta go. Look, I work a physical job, alright? I don’t spend my days analyzing my… output. It's all pretty standard. I'm tellin' ya, it's just bloating.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Thank you for clarifying. So, intermittent, mild abdominal discomfort that coincides with the distension, and generally normal bowel habits. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Seriously? Look, I’ve been a pile driver operator for twenty years. Broken a few ribs, busted my knuckles a few times, the usual. Had the flu a couple times. Other than that… nothin'. I'm a pretty healthy guy, despite this stomach thing. My wife… she handled all the doctor stuff when she was alive. I don't really remember much of it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. It sounds like you’ve led a physically demanding life, and it’s understandable that you haven't had much need for medical attention. And I'm very sorry for your loss; it’s perfectly normal to have difficulty recalling details after such a significant event. Just to be thorough, do you happen to know if you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I just take a multivitamin sometimes. And ibuprofen when my back acts up from work. That's about it. Look, doc, I'm tellin' ya, this isn’t a complicated case. It's just a puffy stomach. Can we just get something for it?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Kristofik. You are right, it may not be complicated. However, it’s my responsibility to ensure we’ve considered all possibilities. Just a few more questions, and then we can move towards a plan. Now, have you had any recent changes in your weight – either weight gain or weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight? Uh… not really. Maybe a few pounds here or there, but that’s just work. When I'm pushin’ steel all day, my weight fluctuates. I don't keep a chart, doc. I'm a pile driver operator, not a fitness model. Look, can we just skip the questions and get to the part where you tell me what's wrong and how to fix it? I got a job to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize for the extensive questioning. I assure you, I’m working as efficiently as possible. Just one final question regarding your history, and then we'll move on to a physical examination. Have you ever had any abdominal surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Serious illnesses? Nope. Broken a few bones, but never anything…internal. Look, I’m a pretty simple guy. I eat, I work, I sleep. Sometimes my stomach puffs up. That’s my medical history. Can we please just get this over with? I'm losing daylight.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I understand. Given your history – or lack thereof – and your description of the symptoms, I think it’s reasonable to proceed with a physical examination. It will help me to further assess your condition. If you don't mind, could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently palpate it – that means I’ll feel your abdomen – to check for any tenderness or masses. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm listening for bowel sounds. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, which is normal. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Just feels like… my stomach. It's always a little firm when I've been working hard. A little uncomfortable, but nothin' serious. Like you said, just feels normal. Get it done with.
DOCTOR: Okay, and how about here?
PATIENT: Still nothin’ major. A little pressure, yeah, but I've been liftin' steel all day. Look, doc, this isn't rocket science. It’s a puffy stomach. I swear, if you tell me I need to change my diet or start doing yoga, I'm walkin' out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I've completed the examination. There’s no significant tenderness or any palpable masses. Your abdomen is slightly firm, as you mentioned, which is consistent with your physically demanding occupation. Based on your history and the physical exam, it's likely that your symptoms are related to trapped gas and normal bowel function, possibly exacerbated by your work activities. This is a fairly common issue. However, to rule out any underlying causes, I would like to order a few simple blood tests. They'll check for inflammation and basic organ function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ugh. Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. The sooner I can get back to work, the better. Is that gonna take long? I got a deadline to meet. And don’t tell me I need to change my diet. Seriously.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Kristofik, I will not suggest any drastic changes to your diet. The blood tests are relatively quick, and we can get the results back within a few days. The phlebotomist will draw a small sample from your arm. While we wait for the results, I recommend over-the-counter simethicone – that's the main ingredient in Gas-X – which can help relieve trapped gas and bloating. It's generally very effective. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Simethicone, huh? Fine. I'll try it. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my work. Look, I really don't have time for this. No, I don't have any questions. Just tell me when I can get the blood tests done, and I'll get out of your hair.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. The phlebotomist is available immediately. She’s in the room next door. After the blood tests, I'll have the results sent to me, and I’ll contact you as soon as they’re available. Here's a written summary of our consultation, including the recommendations for simethicone. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Kristofik. I hope you feel better soon. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Nah, that's it. Just get me outta here. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kristofik. Thank you for coming in, and have a good day. .
