DOCTOR: Alright, Miss Kobler, so tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Burlingham, is it? It’s… difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling… short of breath, lately. Not a sudden thing, more… gradual. And my mouth feels terribly dry, and my eyes too. Like the desert, almost. I apologize if that sounds… dramatic. It simply is quite dry.
DOCTOR: Gradual, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… hard to pinpoint when it began, exactly. Perhaps… several months ago? It wasn’t severe at first, just… noticeable. I’d find myself taking a slightly deeper breath than usual. Now… well, now it’s tiring to walk even short distances. I do apologize for my vagueness. My memory… isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Several months. And this dryness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, I believe. Though it’s worse in the evenings. And when I wake up. It’s a… pervasive dryness, if that makes sense. Not just a quick thirst. It’s… uncomfortable. And my eyes feel gritty. Like sand. I try to use eye drops, but they don’t help much. I don't recall a specific event that caused this, if that is useful information.
DOCTOR: Right. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I have been… rather tired, lately. More tired than usual, I mean. And… sometimes my heart feels like it’s… fluttering. Not painful, just… noticeable. And… occasionally, I feel a little lightheaded when I stand up too quickly. But those could simply be from… being tired, perhaps? I am trying to recall anything else, but it's difficult. I've been writing a lot, so perhaps I've simply been overdoing it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any past medical problems?
PATIENT: Past medical problems… That is… a difficult question. I was divorced some years ago, and… things were rather stressful then. I believe I saw a doctor about… anxiety, at that time. But nothing… serious. As for illnesses… I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Measles, mumps… I’m afraid my memory is truly poor when it comes to details. I don’t recall ever being hospitalized for anything. Or having any… chronic conditions. I do have private insurance, if that is relevant.
DOCTOR: Anxiety… and nothing else significant. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. I’ve always been… rather healthy, I thought. Until recently, of course. I apologize for not being more forthcoming with details, Doctor. It’s simply… frustrating. I wish I could remember more clearly. I feel as though I'm failing to provide useful information. Is this… unhelpful? I can try to… think harder, though I’m not certain it will yield results.
DOCTOR: We'll get there. Now, family history. Are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: No… my parents are both… gone, now. Passed away some years ago. I had a younger brother, but we lost touch after… after the divorce. I haven’t spoken to him in many years. I… don’t know anything about his health, I’m afraid. I recall my mother had… some heart trouble, towards the end. But that was a long time ago. And I don’t recall any other significant illnesses in the family. It’s… a rather isolated family history, truthfully. I apologize for the lack of detail.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? Well, I am a writer, as you know. I spend a great deal of time indoors, at my desk. I don't have many hobbies, truthfully. I enjoy reading, naturally. And walking… or, I used to enjoy walking. Before this… breathlessness. I don't smoke. I rarely drink alcohol. I try to eat a healthy diet, though sometimes I find myself… forgetting to eat altogether when I am absorbed in my work. It's rather solitary, I suppose. Not much excitement. I've been divorced for quite some time, as I mentioned. No children. Is that the sort of information you require, Doctor?
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… That is a good question. I… don't believe so. I haven't taken many medications in my life, truthfully. Just… occasional pain relievers for headaches. And, perhaps, some antibiotics for… a cold, now and then. I don't recall ever having an allergic reaction to anything. But my memory… is unreliable. It's possible I’ve simply forgotten. I do apologize for my vagueness. Would it be helpful if I contacted my previous doctor to see if they have any records? I don't recall their name at the moment, but I may be able to… find it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though I must warn you, I may be a little unsteady. This… breathlessness makes me feel rather weak. Please, do let me know if you notice anything concerning. I apologize for any inconvenience. I’ll try my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 110/70, pulse is 88 and regular. A little fast, but not alarming. I'm going to listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in... and out... again... and out... Your breathing sounds a little… diminished. And I’m going to check your throat… Say “ah”… Throat looks normal. Any swelling?
PATIENT: No swelling, to my knowledge. Though my mouth feels rather dry, as I mentioned. It feels… constricted, almost. And… I do feel a little lightheaded now. Perhaps it’s the standing. Or… the examination. It's difficult to say. Everything feels… a little fuzzy. But I am cooperating as best I can, Doctor. Do let me know if you discover anything concerning. I appreciate your diligence.
DOCTOR: No swelling in your thyroid. Now, let’s check your oxygen saturation. Hmm. 92%. That's a little low. Alright. And lastly, I'm going to check your extremities for any swelling. No edema. Everything seems normal there.
PATIENT: 92%... is that… concerning, Doctor? I apologize for my ignorance, but I don’t understand what that number signifies. And I appreciate you explaining everything, even if I struggle to comprehend it. I… do feel rather weak now. Perhaps I should sit down? I'm starting to feel a little anxious. This examination is… unsettling, truthfully. I just want to understand what is happening, and what can be done to alleviate these symptoms.
DOCTOR: 92% is a little low. Normal is usually between 95 and 100%. It suggests your blood isn't carrying enough oxygen. We need to investigate further. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. The blood work will check your thyroid function, kidney function, and look for any signs of infection. It's likely… nothing serious. But we need to rule things out.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray and blood work… I understand. Though I must admit, I feel rather… overwhelmed. I apologize for my lack of composure, Doctor. It's simply… unsettling to hear that something isn’t quite right. I will cooperate fully with whatever tests you deem necessary. When will I be able to schedule these tests? And… how long will it take to receive the results? I hope it’s nothing too serious, as you say. I appreciate your thoroughness. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Perhaps… rest?
DOCTOR: Rest is good. And avoid any strenuous activity. I'll have the lab draw the blood now, and the radiology department will schedule the X-ray. It shouldn't take more than a few days to get the results. We’ll call you with the findings. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated. And… if your symptoms worsen – if you experience severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or feel like you’re going to faint – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Rest, avoid strenuous activity, stay hydrated… and go to the emergency room if my symptoms worsen. I understand. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, despite my… anxiety. And thank you for scheduling the tests so promptly. I will… try to remain calm. And I will… call if anything changes. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Perhaps… something I should avoid eating or drinking? Or… any medications I should discontinue? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: No, no need to change anything with your diet or medications. Just… try not to worry. It's likely something minor. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll take care of you. Here’s the requisition form. And the radiology department will call you to schedule the X-ray. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate your patience with my… vagueness and anxiety. I will proceed to the lab now, and await the radiology department’s call. Thank you again for your assistance. I… hope to receive good news. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day.
