DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovec. Or… is it Brodie?
PATIENT: Yes, Brodie is fine. Good morning to you too, Doctor… Osterholm, right? It's… hard to keep track of names these days. But yes, Brodie is good. I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Osterholm. It’s alright, happens to the best of us. Now, Brodie, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, this cough. It’s been… a long time. Just a dry cough, really. Doesn’t bring anything up, you know? Just… tickles and then… hack. It’s mostly worse at night, I think. Or maybe during the day? Honestly, it all feels the same after a while. My wife… she used to make me tea for it. But… well. It's been a while since she could do that.
DOCTOR: A dry cough, worse at night… or during the day. Right. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a hard one. A long time. Maybe… six months? A year? It’s… it started around the colder weather, I think. Last fall. Or the fall before? See, I used to remember these things. I worked with cars for… well, a long time. Always kept track of dates then, for repairs and such. But now… it all blurs together. It just feels old, you know?
DOCTOR: Six months to a year… alright. And is it affecting anything else?
PATIENT: Well… sleep, a little. I wake myself up sometimes. And… I get tired easier, I suppose. It's hard to tell what's the cough and what's… just being old. I don’t do much anymore, you see. Used to be, I could work on a car all day and not feel a thing. Now I… sit mostly. Watch TV. It's not the same, but… what else am I gonna do?
DOCTOR: Right. And are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Other than being tired and coughing? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little… short of breath sometimes? When I walk up the steps to the porch, perhaps. But… I’ve always been a little winded. It's a small porch. I don't know. It's hard to say what's new and what's just… me. I don't get fevers, if that’s what you’re asking. And no… nothing coming up when I cough, like I said. Just dry. Very dry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? I… don't think so. Never really paid much attention to that sort of thing. Grew up in the mountains, you see. Fresh air, mostly. Didn’t have much time for sniffles and sneezes when you were trying to get rice planted. My wife… she was the one who worried about those things. If I ate something funny, she’d know right away. But me? I just… ate. Never had a bad reaction, as far as I remember. I liked spicy food, though. Maybe that bothered things sometimes? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. No, not really. Not regularly, anyway. The doctor… a different doctor, a long time ago… gave me something for my blood pressure, I think? But I stopped taking it. Felt a little… funny. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it really flares up. Just over-the-counter stuff, you know? Ibuprofen, maybe? I can’t quite recall the name. It doesn’t really help much, to be honest. Mostly, I just try to move slowly. And… nothing else. I really don’t like taking pills.
DOCTOR: And do you have a history of any major illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a question. Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a boy, falling out of a tree. And I had… appendicitis, when I was young. That was a bad one. And… I had a surgery, years ago, for a hernia. That was… somewhere around when my wife and I bought the house. A long time ago. Other than that… I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. A few colds, a few aches and pains, but nothing serious. I’ve always been a strong man, you see. Until… recently. It’s just getting old, I suppose. It takes its toll. Everything just… hurts more. And I forget things. Like what year I had that surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My wife’s mother… she had trouble breathing when she got old. Some kind of… lung thing, I think. She had to use a machine to help her. But my side… my parents… they both lived to be very old. Strong people. Worked hard all their lives. My father farmed, and my mother… she was a weaver. They didn’t get sick much, as far as I can remember. We didn't see doctors much, back then. Just… tough people, mostly. Didn’t complain much. Now… everything’s different. Everyone goes to the doctor for everything. It feels… strange. But I suppose it's good. To be careful. Even if I can't remember what I'm being careful about.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Pavlovec, let’s have a listen to your lungs. Could you sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Sit up straight… I can do that. Though it creaks a little these days. My back… it’s not what it used to be. Just a bit… stiff. But I'll try. Go ahead, Doctor. Listen away. I hope it's not too bad. It just feels… tired. Like everything else.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished, Mr. Pavlovec. And I hear some… wheezing. It's not terribly concerning at this moment, but it's something we need to investigate further. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. My wife… she wouldn't allow it. Said it was bad for your lungs, and for everyone around you. And she was right, I suppose. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I try to stay away from places where people do smoke. Makes it hard to breathe, even just being near it. Always have. Strong smell. No, never smoked. Not even as a boy. My father, he used to chew tobacco, but that was about it. Never saw the appeal. Just makes you stink.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and I'd like to get a blood test to check your oxygen levels and rule out any infection. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh dear. I don't think so. Never had anything like that before, as far as I remember. My wife… she had a few tests done, but I never paid much attention to what they used. I just drove her, and waited. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, really. But I suppose it's possible. I just… don’t know. Is it something I should be worried about? My skin gets a little itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just from the heat. I don't have any rashes or anything. Just… old skin, mostly. It’s gotten very thin. I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to anything, but I can’t be sure. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will proceed cautiously. The lab will be aware. I’m also going to listen to your heart. Please lie back for me.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Lie back… that's not so bad. Though it feels strange, lying flat. Like my breath gets… shorter. I used to be able to sleep flat, but now I need a couple of pillows. Old age, I suppose. Just gets harder to breathe. Go ahead, Doctor. Listen away. I hope everything’s alright. My heart… it’s been beating for a long time, you know? It's a good strong heart, I think. But it’s getting tired, too. Everything's just getting tired.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… regular, but a little… faint. We'll get the results back from the blood test and X-ray, and then we can figure out the next step. I’m going to order an EKG as well, just to get a more detailed reading of your heart rhythm. Do you have any family history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems… hmm. Now that you mention it… my mother’s brother… he had trouble with his chest. Something with his heartbeat, I think. It was a long time ago, when I was a boy. He was always very quiet, and he didn’t talk about it much. He used to get… breathless, sometimes. And he had to take medicine. But other than that… not really. My father… he lived to be very old, and he was always very strong. He worked hard all his life, and he never complained. And my wife… she didn’t have any heart problems, as far as I know. She was always very healthy. Just… a little nervous. But her nerves didn’t affect her heart, I don’t think. It's hard to remember, you know? It was a long time ago. Everything just… blurs together after a while. But yes, my mother's brother had trouble with his chest. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like we have a fair bit to investigate. I will write you a referral to a cardiologist for a more in-depth evaluation. It’s important to rule out any underlying heart condition, given your family history and the faintness of your heartbeat. I understand it's a lot to take in, but we need to be thorough. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… that sounds… serious. Is it something bad? My heart… it’s been beating for a long time. I just want to breathe easy again. And… not forget things so much. Is it something I should be worried about? I don’t want to be a bother. I just… want to know what’s going on. And maybe… maybe get some sleep. Is it something I have to do? The tests, and the… cardiologist? I just… I don’t like going to doctors. It reminds me of… of my wife. She always worried so much. And now… it's just me. Is it something bad, Doctor? I just want to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pavlovec, it's not necessarily something bad. It's simply a precaution. We're checking to make sure everything is functioning as it should. Your symptoms—the cough, the shortness of breath, the fatigue—warrant further investigation. Given your age and family history, seeing a cardiologist is the responsible course of action. It doesn’t mean you have a serious problem, but we need to rule one out. The tests will give us a clearer picture of your heart health. I understand you're worried, but delaying a proper diagnosis won't help. And yes, I strongly recommend you follow through with the referral. It’s for your own well-being. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I understand. Tests… cardiologist… it’s just… a lot. And it reminds me of… everything. But… you're right. I shouldn’t delay. I want to breathe easy again. And… maybe remember things a little better. So… yes. I’ll do the tests. And I’ll see the cardiologist. Just… please be quick about it. I don’t want to be a bother. And… tell me if it’s something bad, okay? I just want to know. Is there anything else I need to do? Anything I should be worried about before the tests?
DOCTOR: Alright. I will arrange for the chest X-ray and blood test to be done as soon as possible. The lab will call you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also have my nurse give you a referral form for the cardiologist. As for before the tests… just try to stay hydrated. Nothing strenuous. And try not to worry too much. I understand it's easier said than done. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Emergency room… yes, okay. Chest pain… shortness of breath… I understand. Nothing strenuous… stay hydrated… that’s good advice. My wife always told me to drink plenty of water. Is there anything else? Should I… stop taking my arthritis medicine? Or… is it okay to keep taking it? I just don’t want to do anything wrong. And… thank you, Doctor. For… everything. It's just… a lot to take in. But… thank you. I’ll try to remember everything you said. Chest pain… emergency room… stay hydrated… and… thank you. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Pavlovec. It is alright to continue taking your arthritis medication as you normally do unless you experience any adverse reactions. As for everything else, I believe that covers it for now. My nurse will come in shortly to give you the referral form and answer any further questions you may have. Try to rest, and please don't hesitate to call us if you have any concerns. We’re here to help. Do you have any transportation arranged to get to these appointments?
PATIENT: Transportation… hmm. That’s a good question. I usually take the bus, but… I’m not sure if I can manage it with all these tests. It’s a bit of a walk to the bus stop, and… I get tired easily, you know? I have a neighbor, Mrs. Henderson… she’s very kind. Maybe she can help. I’ll have to ask her. But… thank you, Doctor, for reminding me. I didn't even think about that. Transportation… I’ll ask Mrs. Henderson. And thank you again. For everything. I think… that’s all for now. I just… want to go home and rest. I hope… everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Pavlovec. I will have the nurse check on you shortly. Let her know if you need assistance. Get some rest, and please take care of yourself. And remember, if you experience any chest pain or difficulty breathing, don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And… thank you again. I… I appreciate everything. You’ve been very kind. .
