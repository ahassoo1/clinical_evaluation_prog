DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. My name is Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my back, mostly. It’s been pretty painful lately. It’s just… achy, you know? And sometimes sharp.
DOCTOR: Alright, back pain. And you say it's been painful lately… can you be a bit more specific about how long "lately" is?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe about three weeks ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little stiff after gardening. But it’s gotten worse each week. Now it's pretty constant.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, progressively worsening. And you mentioned gardening – is that the primary activity that seems to aggravate it, or are there other things that make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, gardening definitely makes it worse. Bending over, you know? But even just sitting for too long now… or trying to lift things. It’s getting so I’m afraid to do much of anything. It shoots pain down my leg sometimes too, not always, but when it does, oof. That’s really bad.
DOCTOR: Shooting pain down the leg... That's important information. Can you describe where exactly in your leg you feel the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to say exactly. It starts in my lower back, then goes down my buttock and then down the back of my thigh. Sometimes it goes all the way to my calf, but not always. It's not in my shin, if that makes sense. More on the outside of my leg, towards the back. Like… where the hamstring is, maybe? I don't know all the names for things.
DOCTOR: Alright, so radiating pain down the posterior aspect of your leg, stopping short of the shin. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. It’s not always there, but it’s pretty much always somewhere. Like, even when it’s not sharp, it’s just a dull ache. But then I'll move wrong, or try to lift something, and bam, it’s really painful for a little while. Then it fades back down to the ache. It’s just… annoying. And getting worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. Annoying and worsening are certainly concerning. Now, have you experienced any numbness or weakness in either of your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, yeah, a little. My left foot feels kinda… tingly sometimes. Not all the time, and not completely numb, just… like pins and needles, you know? And it feels a little weak when I try to lift it, but I figured that was just because of the pain. It's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Tingling in the left foot and some perceived weakness. Okay. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever had back problems before—any injuries, surgeries, or other treatments for back pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I pulled a muscle once, a long time ago, when I was younger, lifting boxes, but that was it. Just a little sore for a few days. Nothing like this. I’ve never had any surgery on my back, or anything. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Mostly just normal aches and pains as you get older.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior significant back issues. And how about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had arthritis in her knees, really bad towards the end of her life. And my uncle, on my wife’s side, he had something with his spine, I think. He had surgery on it, years ago. But other than that, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Arthritis in your mother and a spinal surgery in your wife’s uncle. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Not much, thankfully. I take a little something for my blood pressure, lisinopril, I think it's called. And that's about it. No allergies that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, lisinopril for blood pressure, no known allergies. Now, Mr. Way, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie down on the table, face up. I’ll start with some range of motion tests. Now, can you point your toes and flex your feet for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is that okay? It hurts a little when I bend my foot up, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. And you're right, I see some discomfort with dorsiflexion – bending your foot upwards. Now, I’m going to lift your leg up, keeping it straight. Let me know if you feel any pain radiating down your leg. How about now?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that one. That one makes it shoot down my leg. Not as bad as when I bend my foot, but definitely. Right around my buttock and down the back of my thigh. Stop when you get to about… there.
DOCTOR: Alright, pain reproduced with straight leg raise, around mid-thigh. Now, let’s try the other leg. Any pain with this one?
PATIENT: Not as much. It's a little uncomfortable, but not like the other leg. Just a dull ache, not that shooting pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so less pain with the left leg. And now, I'm just going to feel along your spine... Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yeah, right there… That's pretty tender. And a little bit to the left too, but not as much. It feels kind of… tight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the physical exam findings—the pain with dorsiflexion, the reproduced pain with the straight leg raise on the right side, and the tenderness along your lumbar spine—it appears you're experiencing likely lumbar radiculopathy, potentially due to a compression of a nerve root in your lower back. This is commonly caused by a herniated disc or spinal stenosis, though we’d need imaging to confirm that. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Lumbar… what now? Radiculo… Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. So, something's pinched in my back? Is that what you're saying? And that's what's causing the pain down my leg? I'm not a doctor, you know. Could you explain it a little simpler?
DOCTOR: Of course. Let me put it this way: You have nerves that run from your spine down your legs. These nerves send signals to your legs, allowing you to move and feel. In your case, something – most likely a disc that’s slipped out of place, or a narrowing of the space where the nerves travel - is irritating or compressing one of those nerves in your lower back. This compression causes the pain you feel in your back, buttock, and down your leg—that shooting pain is the nerve sending a signal that something isn’t right. Is that clearer?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes a little more sense. So, a pinched nerve. That’s what’s causing all this trouble. And you said you need pictures to see exactly what’s pinching it? What kind of pictures? Are we talking… X-rays? Or something else? And is this something serious?
DOCTOR: Yes, a pinched nerve is a good way to think about it. And you're right, we'd need imaging to confirm the cause. X-rays can show the structure of your spine, but they don't show the nerves or the discs very well. The best imaging for this is an MRI – Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It gives us a very detailed picture of your spine, the discs, and the nerves. As for whether it’s serious... Most cases of lumbar radiculopathy aren't emergencies, but it’s important to diagnose it properly to determine the best course of treatment and prevent any long-term complications. There is a small risk of permanent nerve damage if left untreated. We need to get the MRI to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Permanent nerve damage… that doesn’t sound good at all. An MRI… is that safe? I’ve heard things about those machines. And how long does it take to get one? I’m not a fan of hospitals, you know. I hope it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. MRIs are very safe, actually. They use strong magnets and radio waves, but there's no radiation involved. There are some precautions – you can’t have any metal objects on you, like jewelry or pacemakers, and people with certain implants might not be able to have one, but we'll screen you carefully for that. As for timing… We can schedule it at the hospital radiology department. Usually, it takes about 30-45 minutes to complete the scan itself, and then the radiologist will need a day or two to interpret the results. In the meantime, while we’re waiting for the MRI, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of muscle relaxants and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to help manage the pain and inflammation. I also recommend you avoid any heavy lifting, bending, or twisting movements. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… better. No metal, I can do that. And I’ll definitely stay away from lifting anything. Muscle relaxants… will those make me sleepy? I have a lot of gardening to do, when I can, you know. And I don't want to be out of it. But, yes, let’s get the MRI done. And then we'll see what the pictures say. What happens if it is a slipped disc? Do they have to operate? I really don’t want surgery.
DOCTOR: It’s good to be proactive and ask questions. Many people experience some drowsiness with muscle relaxants, but it varies from person to person. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it causes too much sleepiness, we can adjust the dose or switch to a different medication. Now, regarding a slipped disc... Most slipped discs don't require surgery. Many people improve with conservative treatment—medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Physical therapy can help strengthen your back muscles, improve your posture, and teach you proper lifting techniques. Surgery is generally reserved for cases where conservative treatment fails, or if you have significant nerve compression causing weakness or loss of bowel or bladder control. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Let’s focus on getting the MRI and seeing what the radiologist says. I’ll also give you a referral to a physical therapist, so you can start some gentle exercises while we’re waiting for the results. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A plan is good. Gentle exercises… I can do that. And I'll try to be careful with the muscle relaxants. I don’t want to be falling asleep in the garden! Okay. So, the MRI and the physical therapist. And the medicine. I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse print out the MRI order, the physical therapy referral, and the medication prescriptions for you. Please call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your MRI appointment. We'll get you scheduled as soon as possible. I’ll see you back here once the results are in, and we can discuss the next steps. Have a good day, and please take care of your back. .
