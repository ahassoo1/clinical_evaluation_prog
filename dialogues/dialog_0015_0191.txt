DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I decided it was time… time to get checked for HIV. I just wanted to know my status, really. It’s something I’ve been putting off, but… better late than never, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. A sensible decision. And thank you for coming in. It is always better to know. Now, to be thorough, I’ll need to ask you a few questions. This is confidential, of course. Have you ever had any reason to believe you might have been exposed to HIV?
PATIENT: Exposed…? Hmm. That’s a difficult question. Not that I know of, no. My husband and I… we’ve been married for a very long time. And we haven’t… well, we haven’t been with anyone else. But you hear things, don’t you? Stories. And things happen. I suppose I just want to be sure. I haven’t really done anything risky, if that makes sense. But I'd like to be tested anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's prudent to be cautious. “Risky” can mean different things to different people, and testing is always a good idea if you have any concern at all. Let's go through some specifics. Have you ever shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. I’ve never… I’ve never taken anything like that. Needles are… frightening things. I’ve always stayed far away from them. Is that what you’re asking? About… drugs? Because no, absolutely not. I’m a churchgoing woman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I was asking. Just covering all bases. Have you ever received a blood transfusion or had any medical procedures where blood products were used?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. Years ago, when I was much younger, I did have a surgery. A fibroid, it was. Must have been… oh, goodness, nearly thirty years ago now. And I definitely received a blood transfusion then. It was a large one. Everything was done at the hospital, of course. A proper hospital, not some… back-alley place. I remember being very, very weak afterwards. Is that… is that something I should be worried about? Back then, they didn’t test for everything like they do now, did they?
DOCTOR: That is something we need to consider. Blood transfusions before widespread screening did carry a risk. And yes, testing protocols have improved significantly. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or been tested for them?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a bit of a personal question, isn’t it? My husband and I… we didn’t really discuss these things much when we were younger. It wasn’t the sort of thing you talked about openly, you see. We were raised differently. But I don’t think I’ve ever had anything. I mean, I’ve never had any symptoms, anything noticeable. We weren’t… promiscuous, if that’s what you’re asking. Just each other, mostly. We did see the doctor regularly for check-ups, but I don’t recall ever being specifically tested for those things. Does that make sense? I’m sorry if I’m not being very clear. This is all a little… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It's alright. These questions are sensitive. And I appreciate your honesty. Given the transfusion history and the lack of prior STI testing, we should proceed with a comprehensive HIV test. We'll also run some tests for other sexually transmitted infections as a precaution. I’d also like to get a full medical history, if you don’t mind. Any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds sensible. A thorough test is… reassuring, I suppose. As for illnesses… well, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take medication for it, a small pill every morning. And my knees… they give me trouble sometimes. Arthritis, they say. It’s the age, I expect. Other than that… I’m generally quite healthy for my age, I think. I walk every day, you see. And I try to eat a good diet, though it’s hard sometimes. My husband loves fried plantains… But yes, just the blood pressure and the arthritis, really. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries besides the fibroid removal?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, I don’t believe so. The fibroid was the only one. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was so long ago, it hardly counts, does it? And I’ve had vaccinations, of course. Tetanus, flu shots… the usual things. But no other surgeries. My husband always said I was too much of a coward to go under the knife again! He passed away two years ago, you know. It’s… it’s still difficult sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m sorry for your loss. Now, regarding medications, you mentioned a pill for your blood pressure. Do you know the name of it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It’s… let me think… it’s a small white pill. Lisinopril, that’s it! Lisinopril. The doctor prescribed it years ago, and I’ve been taking it ever since. It keeps my blood pressure under control, thankfully. I try to remember to take it every morning with my breakfast. Sometimes I forget, but mostly I’m quite good about it. And that’s all the medication I take, really. Just the Lisinopril. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your overall health. It’s standard procedure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’m used to doctors examining me, you see. It’s just… all these questions… it makes me think about things. About my husband, and… well, life. But yes, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Please roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I hope it’s not too high. I was a little nervous coming here, you see. All this talk… it gets one’s blood racing. But I’m trying to be calm. I’m trying.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Not alarming, but something to monitor. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Throat is clear. No obvious abnormalities detected. Alright. Now, I'll need to draw some blood for the HIV test and other screening panels. Do you have any allergies to latex or any difficulties with blood draws?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies to latex. And thankfully, I'm usually quite good with blood draws. My husband always teased me about it. Said I didn’t even flinch! Though I suppose everyone is a little nervous, aren’t they? Just… please be gentle, Doctor. That’s all I ask. And… thank you. For being so thorough.
DOCTOR: I will be. Please relax your arm. This may sting for a moment. We’ll send these off to the lab immediately. Results typically take 3-5 business days. I will have my assistant contact you as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Not right now. Just… what if it’s positive? What happens then? I mean… what do I do? It’s just… a lot to take in, isn't it? I haven’t thought this through very well. I just wanted to know. Now… I’m scared.
DOCTOR: If the results are positive, we will discuss treatment options immediately. HIV is a manageable condition with medication. It does not necessarily mean a compromised quality of life. We would also need to conduct further testing to determine the viral load and CD4 count. We would discuss partner notification and safer sex practices. I will refer you to an HIV specialist for ongoing care. It's important not to jump to conclusions. Many factors can influence test results. I understand your anxiety, but panicking will not help. We will address this together, one step at a time. Do you have anyone you can lean on for support during this waiting period?
PATIENT: No… not really. My husband… he passed away, you see. And I don’t have any close family. Just… some distant cousins I haven’t spoken to in years. I’ve always been a… private person. Kept things to myself. I suppose I’ll have to manage on my own. Like I always do. But… thank you, Doctor. For explaining things. It’s… a little easier to breathe now. A little. I just… I hope it’s negative. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve given my assistant your contact information. She will call you with the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, fatigue, or unusual symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you for your time… and your patience. I appreciate it. I’ll… I’ll wait for the phone call. God bless you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Shaub. .
