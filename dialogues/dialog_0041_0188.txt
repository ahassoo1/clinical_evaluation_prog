DOCTOR: Hi Criston, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um, it's my… my pee. It’s orange. I noticed it yesterday, and it’s still orange today. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. Very orange. Not a little bit, like… a lot. I drink water, you know? I try to. But it's still orange. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Not a little bit, a lot. And you are drinking water regularly… that's good. It can be a sign of a few different things, but it’s often nothing serious. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More how? Like… what kind of orange? It’s like… the color of… carrots, maybe? Not like a pale orange, but a strong orange. And… is there anything in it? I don’t think so. It looks clear, just… orange. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yeah, that makes sense. Carrot-colored is helpful. No visible particles or anything in it, just the color itself. Alright. Now, have you noticed any other changes, like pain when you pee, or needing to go more often?
PATIENT: No pain. And… no, I go about the same amount. Maybe a little less, now that I think about it. I’m trying to drink more water, so maybe that’s why. But it’s not… hurting when I pee, or anything like that. Just orange. It’s just… it’s a weird color, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, no pain or frequency changes, and maybe slightly less volume since you're focusing on drinking more water. Okay. Let's see… have you started taking any new vitamins or medications recently?
PATIENT: No vitamins. No new… medicine. Same as always. I take something for my… my blood pressure, but I’ve had that for a long time now. Nothing different. I promise. My wife would tell me if I started something new, she keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know your wife keeps track of things! And you've been on the same blood pressure medication for a while. Let’s do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, that's… fine. What will you do? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles today, I promise. I just want to listen to your belly and check your reflexes, just a basic check-up. Then I'll quickly test your urine – that’s where we'll get some answers. Could you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. A urine test, yes? That's… alright. I can do that. Do I need to… do anything special? Like, how much pee do you need?
DOCTOR: Just a regular sample will do, Criston. We have those little cups in the bathroom. Don’t worry about filling it all the way, a couple ounces is perfect. I'll leave you to it, and I'll be right here when you’re finished. Take your time.
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. Couple ounces. I think I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I will be right back.
DOCTOR: Alright, Criston, thanks. Let's take a look at this. It will just take a few moments.
PATIENT: Okay. Just a few moments. I’m a little nervous, I don’t like being sick. Is it something serious, do you think? My wife is worried, she said orange pee is never good.
DOCTOR: It’s good your wife is looking out for you. She's right to be cautious. Orange urine can be caused by several things, and it’s good to check it out. It could be something simple like dehydration, or it could indicate a problem with the liver or bile ducts. But we won't know until we see the results. Okay, here we go… hmm. The results show elevated levels of bilirubin in your urine. That’s the substance produced by the liver. Also, your urine is a little concentrated.
PATIENT: Bilirubin? Is that… bad? Concentrated? I don't understand. My wife knows about my liver, I had a test a few years ago. Is this about that? Am I… sick?
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath, Criston. Elevated bilirubin can be a sign of liver issues, yes. That’s why it’s good we checked it. It means your liver isn't processing things as efficiently as it should. Remembering your liver test a few years ago is helpful. Okay, it looks like you had a slightly elevated liver enzyme level back in 2022, but it resolved on its own. This bilirubin level is higher than that, but still not dramatically so. We need to investigate further. The concentrated urine suggests you may be a bit dehydrated, which can also contribute to the orange color and elevated bilirubin. I’m not saying you’re seriously ill right now, but we need to rule out any potential liver problems. I'm going to order some more comprehensive blood work to get a clearer picture of your liver function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's… good. More blood work. Yes, alright. My wife will be happy. She always says to check everything. Dehydrated, you say? I'll drink more water. But the liver… is it… serious if it’s the liver?
DOCTOR: It can be serious, Criston, but it's important not to jump to conclusions. There are many reasons for elevated bilirubin, and not all of them are serious. It could be something as simple as a temporary blockage, or a mild infection. It could indicate something more significant, which is why we're running these tests. We need to find out why your bilirubin is elevated before we can determine the best course of action. I'm going to order a full liver panel, a complete blood count, and a bilirubin fractionation test. These will give us a much better understanding of what’s going on. We'll also repeat a urine analysis just to be sure. Do you have any allergies to medication that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None. I take my blood pressure medicine, but that’s it. And… how long will these tests take? Will I need another appointment? And… will my wife need to come with me? She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, good, no allergies. The blood work should be ready in about 24-48 hours. I'll call you with the results as soon as I have them. Yes, you will need to come back for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the next steps. I’m happy to have your wife join you for the follow-up appointment if she'd feel more comfortable. It’s often helpful to have another person there to listen and ask questions. The appointment will be about 30 minutes, and we can go over everything in detail. And, Criston, while we're waiting for the results, please focus on staying well-hydrated. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that's… alright. Just drink water. And bring my wife. Yes. Thank you, Doctor Polczynski. You’ve been very… kind. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Criston. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I'll have the nurse schedule that follow-up appointment for you and your wife before you leave. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
