DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 64 years of age. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's right. Sixty-four. Look, Doctor, I ain’t got all day. Just need a… a paper. A permission slip, you could say. For somethin’… cosmetic. My nephew said I needed to get cleared by a doctor first. He handles all the details, see? I don't rightly recall what it's for, but it involves… lookin’ better. Is that alright? Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: A “permission slip,” you say?
PATIENT: That’s what he called it. Young folks and their… words. It's a procedure. To… improve my appearance. He said somethin’ about… risks. And you gotta have a doctor say it's okay. I trust my nephew, but… rules are rules, I suppose. Honestly, I don't have the patience for a long explanation. Is this somethin’ you can do, or do I need to find another doctor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, while I appreciate your… directness, a responsible medical evaluation requires more than simply fulfilling a request for a “permission slip.” It’s my professional obligation to understand what procedure you're seeking, why you want it, and to assess whether it’s appropriate for your overall health. Now, can you at least tell me what kind of procedure it is?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, with all due respect… I told you, I don't know. My nephew scheduled the whole thing. He said it’s… somethin’ with my face. Some kinda… lift, I think? Or somethin' to tighten things up. He showed me pictures of other folks who got it done, and they looked… younger. That's all I know! I just want to look a little less… worn out, alright? I ain’t askin’ for miracles, just a little help. Is this so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, a facial “lift” is a surgical procedure with potential complications. It’s not something to be undertaken lightly, especially without a clear understanding of the risks and benefits. Given your lack of information and, frankly, your seeming disinterest in your own medical care, I’m hesitant to simply sign off on this request. Now, let’s start with the basics. Do you have any current medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Look, I'm a pretty healthy man for my age. A little achin’ here and there, but who isn’t? No… no fancy diseases. Doctor said I was fine at my last check-up… years ago. Honestly, I don’t go to the doctor much. Waste of time and money, if you ask me. I eat alright, sleep alright… I’m just… gettin’ old, that’s all. Is that good enough? Can we please just get this over with? My nephew's waitin’ on me.
DOCTOR: “Years ago” is not a medical history, Mr. Honcoop. And saying you “eat alright” doesn’t tell me anything. Do you take any medications at all – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I take somethin’ for my… joints. They get stiff in the mornin’. Little white pill. Can’t recall the name… somethin’ with an 'A', I think? And sometimes I take somethin’ for… heartburn. When I eat spicy food. That’s about it. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to these things. My daughter usually handles my pills. She's got a good memory, that one. Can we just ask her? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, it is my responsibility to understand your medical history, not your daughter’s. It's concerning that you are unaware of the medications you are taking. Now, I'm going to need to perform a basic physical exam, at the very least, before I can even consider signing off on this procedure. And I need you to be honest with me about any other health issues you might be experiencing, even if you think they’re minor. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness gracious. I… I don’t think so. Maybe a little sniffle when the pollen’s bad in the spring, but that’s all. And I think I got a rash once, years ago, from poison ivy. But that wasn’t a serious allergy, just itchy. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you doin’ your job, but this is gettin’ out of hand. I just want to look a little better, not… undergo a full investigation. Can’t you just… ask my nephew? He'll know everything you need. This is a waste of both our time. Frankly, I'm startin' to regret comin’ here. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I cannot base a medical decision on information provided by your nephew without a proper evaluation. Given your lack of knowledge regarding your medical history and your apparent unwillingness to provide a complete account of your health, I am unable to approve this procedure. I strongly advise you to consult with another physician who can conduct a thorough assessment and determine if this is a safe and appropriate course of action for you. I understand this is not what you wanted to hear, but my priority is your well-being. I will document my findings and recommendations in your chart. I wish you the best of luck.
