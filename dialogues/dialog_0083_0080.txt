DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Dr. Alanes. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, I don’t really need anything, not exactly. Just need to get some forms filled out for Medicare, you know? They sent me a bunch and said I had to get a doctor to sign off on them.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s a Medicare form completion visit. Absolutely, I can assist you with that. To ensure I complete the forms accurately, I’ll need to gather some information from you. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Ask away. I'll do my best to answer everything. Sometimes my memory isn’t what it used to be, but I’ll try!
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Ms. Fabing. We can take our time. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, or anything else – in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned something about it a few years back, but I don’t really remember being put on any medicine for it. And my knees aren't what they used to be, so I guess you could say I have a bit of arthritis. Nothing too serious, just aches and pains, especially when the weather changes. Other than that… I think I'm pretty healthy, for my age. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. So, a possible history of hypertension and some knee pain consistent with arthritis. We'll need to clarify the blood pressure history. Do you recall when the doctor mentioned the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… probably around 2018 or 2019, I think? I had a check-up with Dr. Reynolds back in Shelby. He said my numbers were a little high, but I don’t recall any follow-up appointments specifically for that. I mostly just saw him for my yearly physicals. I moved away not long after that, so I never really got it checked again.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially elevated blood pressure around 2018-2019 with Dr. Reynolds, but no specific follow-up or treatment. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that was a long time ago. And… oh! When my son was born, I had a C-section. That was back in 2008. Other than those two things, I haven’t been in the hospital or had any surgeries. Not that I can remember, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy in childhood and a C-section in 2008. Thank you. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, sometimes. It’s an over-the-counter pain reliever, ibuprofen. I don’t take it every day, just when they really bother me. And I take a multivitamin, but that’s about it. Nothing else regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven't had any trouble with any medicines. My mom always said I had a strong stomach!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Fabing. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandpa on my dad’s side had heart problems, I think. He passed away when I was pretty young, but I remember everyone saying it was his heart. And my aunt on my mom’s side had diabetes, but she wasn’t very healthy overall, if you know what I mean. She didn’t take very good care of herself. Other than that, I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. We didn’t really talk about it much.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Fabing. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing about your grandpa’s heart problems and your aunt’s diabetes is helpful. Finally, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I’m retired now, so I don’t have a job to worry about. I mostly spend my time with my grandkids, and I like to do beadwork. It keeps my hands busy. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but I have a sweet tooth, so I indulge a little. And I don’t get a lot of exercise, to be honest. I should probably work on that.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a lovely lifestyle, Ms. Fabing. It’s good to hear you’re active with your grandkids and enjoy beadwork. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. I'll also feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. It shouldn't take too long. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear. Nose and throat appear normal. No signs of infection. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Alright, Ms. Fabing. Everything sounds and looks within normal limits, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure reading.
PATIENT: Okay, good. I figured I was probably alright. That blood pressure… is that something I should worry about? I haven’t really paid much attention to it before.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re asking about it. A blood pressure of 142/88 is considered Stage 1 hypertension. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need to be overly concerned right now, but it does warrant some attention. Since this is the first time we’re checking it, I’d like to repeat the measurement a couple of times today to confirm the reading. And I recommend we monitor it at home as well. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I’ve never needed one before. My husband, Earl, he has one, but he keeps it in the garage with his tools. It's probably dusty. Would it be alright if I borrowed it and checked it myself? Or would it be better to get a new one? I don’t want to mess up the reading with a dirty cuff or something.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good point about the dust! It's best to have an accurate reading, so a new cuff would be ideal. They're relatively inexpensive and easy to use. In the meantime, since you don't have a cuff immediately available, I can take a couple more readings here in the office to see if the first one was just a bit high due to some temporary stress or anxiety. Then we can discuss options for monitoring at home and potentially managing your blood pressure if it remains elevated. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Taking a couple more readings here would be great. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I get a little nervous at the doctor’s office sometimes, so maybe that’s why it was high.
DOCTOR: That's very common, Ms. Fabing. It's called "white coat hypertension," and it happens to many people. Let's see what the readings are now. Okay, that's 145/90. Still elevated. And one more… 140/85. Consistently elevated. Okay, Ms. Fabing, all three readings are consistently above the normal range. Since your blood pressure is elevated, I recommend we start with some lifestyle modifications and repeat the monitoring. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, that makes sense. Lifestyle changes… what does that even mean? Do I have to start running marathons or something?
DOCTOR: Definitely no marathons required! Lifestyle changes can be as simple as making small adjustments to your diet and increasing your physical activity. Things like reducing your sodium intake, eating more fruits and vegetables, and aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. We can discuss these in more detail and create a plan that works for you. It’s also important to manage stress, as that can raise your blood pressure. I'd also like to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying causes for your elevated blood pressure. This will include a complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel. Do you have any questions about the blood work or the lifestyle changes?
PATIENT: Okay, that doesn’t sound too bad. I can try to eat better, and I guess I could walk a little more. My grandkids like to go to the park, so maybe I can join them. Blood work… do I have to get my arm poked? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, unfortunately, blood work does require a small needle stick. But it’s very quick, and the lab technicians are very skilled. Most people don't even feel it. We only need a small sample of blood. If you’re very anxious about it, we can discuss some strategies to help you relax during the procedure. We can also let the lab technician know you’re nervous, and they can take extra care to make you comfortable. It’s a small inconvenience for important information. I’ll give you a lab order, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to discuss the results and see how you’re doing with the lifestyle changes. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, I guess so. A month sounds alright. I can try to get it done. And I’ll try to walk more with the grandkids. Oh! And I need you to sign off on those Medicare forms, that’s why I came in today! I almost forgot!
DOCTOR: You are right! My apologies, I completely forgot about the forms amidst everything else. Let me pull them up now. Okay, here we are. I just need to confirm some of the information we've discussed today – your medical history, medications, and current symptoms – and then I'll sign them. It shouldn't take too long. Alright, everything looks good. Here you go, Ms. Fabing. These should be all set. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help, Dr. Alanes. You explained everything so clearly, and I feel a lot better now. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fabing. I'm glad I could help. Remember to schedule your follow-up appointment, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your time with your grandkids!
