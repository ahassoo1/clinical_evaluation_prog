DOCTOR: Good morning, Chelise. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is high. Hyper… something. I don’t really understand all the medical words, but it sounded like I should come talk to someone. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Hyperlipidemia – that's the high cholesterol. It is good you came in to discuss it. It’s very common, and we can definitely figure out what’s going on and how to manage it. To start, can you tell me a little more about how you found out about this letter?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I had my yearly check-up with Dr. Van Derlyn, you know, my regular doctor? And she said everything seemed okay, but then a week or so later this letter arrived in the mail. It had all these numbers… and a big red circle around one of them! She just wanted me to get it checked out with a specialist, she said. That's you, I guess?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s me. Dr. Van Derlyn is a good doctor – it sounds like she’s being very thorough. And yes, getting those results flagged is why she sent you my way. It’s good to be proactive. Do you happen to remember what those numbers were, or do you have the letter with you now?
PATIENT: I actually do have it! I always bring paperwork, you never know. Let’s see… Okay, here it is. Total cholesterol is 245… HDL is 40… LDL is 160… and triglycerides are 150. Does that mean anything to you? I’m terrible with numbers.
DOCTOR: Yes, those numbers definitely give us a starting point. Okay, so total cholesterol at 245 is a little high, ideally we want that under 200. HDL, which is the “good” cholesterol, is a little low – we like to see that above 60 if possible. LDL, the “bad” cholesterol, is a bit elevated at 160 – we generally aim for under 100, or even lower depending on other risk factors. And your triglycerides are borderline high at 150 – ideally under 150. Now, these numbers don't tell the whole story. We need to look at your overall health picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. My blood pressure is usually pretty good, I check it at home sometimes. And no diabetes either. My mother had it, but I haven't. I try to eat healthy, mostly… I do like my cheese, though! And I walk the dog every day, a big Old English Sheepdog named Winston. He keeps me healthy, if nothing else. He needs a good long walk!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the walking – regular exercise is excellent. And Winston sounds like a wonderful motivator! Okay, so no personal history of high blood pressure or diabetes, and your mother had diabetes. Any other significant medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. My father had heart problems, I think. He had a bypass surgery when he was in his sixties. And his brother… he had a stroke. That was quite a shock. They both smoked, if that makes a difference. I never picked up the habit, thankfully. It smelled awful.
DOCTOR: That does make a difference. A family history of heart disease and stroke is important information. And good for you for never smoking – that's a huge protective factor. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle a little more. Besides walking Winston, do you do any other exercise?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Just the walking. I used to swim, years ago, but I haven’t been in a pool in… oh, goodness, must be twenty years! I mostly just enjoy reading and… well, relaxing. I’m retired now, thankfully. Used to be an aerospace engineer, very stressful job! Now I just take things easy.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. A stressful job can certainly take a toll. It's good you've transitioned to a more relaxed lifestyle. And now that we’ve talked about your history and lifestyle, let’s go over any medications you’re taking, and any allergies you might have. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a multivitamin, just a basic one. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they bother me. Otherwise, no. No allergies either, thankfully. I can eat anything, which is nice. I love food!
DOCTOR: Good. That simplifies things. Alright, Chelise, we’ve covered a lot of ground. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold! I always get chilly.
DOCTOR: I will definitely keep that in mind. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. 138/82. That's a little elevated, but not overly concerning. It can fluctuate depending on stress and activity. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Finally, let's take a look at your knees. There’s some mild tenderness on the inner aspect of both knees, but no significant swelling or redness. Range of motion is slightly limited, likely due to some mild arthritis. Everything seems generally good, but those knees could benefit from some strengthening exercises. Does that hurt when I do that?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, that’s a little tender. Not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. I’ve had trouble with them for years, ever since I was younger. I used to be a very active swimmer, like I said, and I think I just wore them out. Strengthening exercises sound good, in theory. Maybe Winston can help motivate me there too!
DOCTOR: It sounds like you likely have some osteoarthritis in your knees, which is very common with age and previous activity. Winston is an excellent motivator! We can discuss some gentle exercises you can do at home, or I can refer you to a physical therapist for a more structured program. Now, based on everything we’ve discussed – your family history, lifestyle, and physical exam – I think the next step is to repeat a lipid panel to confirm those numbers and potentially order some additional blood tests to rule out any underlying causes of high cholesterol. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Additional tests… the more information, the better, I suppose. I don’t mind a bit of blood work. Just… please tell the person drawing it to be gentle! I’m not a huge fan of needles.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll make a note on the requisition form to request a gentle phlebotomist. We’ll also order a comprehensive metabolic panel to get a better overview of your overall health. I’ll give you the requisition forms, and you can go to the lab downstairs at your convenience. They don’t require an appointment. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s a relief to have a plan. I appreciate you being so thorough. And thank you for remembering about the gentle needle! Hopefully, Winston will be proud of me for being so proactive.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chelise. It's my pleasure. And Winston will be proud – he sounds like a very supportive companion! Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get these results back to you as quickly as possible. Here are the forms. And again, thank you for coming in today. Have a good afternoon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Tosca. You too. I will! And I'm sure Winston says hello too.
