DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s these little spells, I suppose. Confusing spells. My wife, she’s the one who really insisted I come. Says I ask the same questions twice, forget where I put things… things a man should remember. It’s bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, “confusing spells”... and your wife is concerned about some memory issues, repeating questions, misplacing things. That’s very good of her to bring it to our attention. It is best to get these things checked out. Just to clarify, Mr. Lason, when did you first start noticing these… spells?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not like a sudden thing, Doctor. It’s been… creeping up, I guess. Maybe six months now? Hard to say exactly. I’m a busy man, always working. Tile work, you know. Details are important. But lately… the details seem to slip away easier. It’s not like I’m forgetting everything, just… little things. Irritating little things. Like where I left my glasses, even though they're usually on my head. My wife points it out constantly.
DOCTOR: Six months… gradual onset. And mostly affecting small details, not a complete loss of memory. That’s helpful to know. Do you find these… slips are happening more frequently recently, or have they been pretty consistent over the last six months?
PATIENT: Recently, yes. Definitely recently. Seems like just last week I asked my wife three times where we were going for dinner. Three times! She was… not pleased. And I left the truck keys in the refrigerator. The refrigerator, Doctor! A perfectly good set of keys, chilling with the vegetables. It’s… embarrassing. And frankly, a little unsettling. I’ve always had a good head on my shoulders.
DOCTOR: Okay. Repeating questions and misplacing things, worsening recently. It is good you're noticing these changes, and that your wife is supporting you. We’ll try to figure out what’s going on. Now, besides the memory issues, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm. Let me think. My appetite… hasn’t been the best, I suppose. Not that I'm not eating, just… not as much as usual. And I get tired easier. Always tired after a long day on the job, of course, but lately it seems to linger. Like a weight on me, even after a full night’s sleep. My wife says I’ve been more… irritable. Which is probably just her exaggerating. She always says I’m irritable.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite, increased fatigue, and your wife notes some irritability… We're building a picture here, Mr. Lason. Do you have any trouble with your sleep – falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested when you wake up?
PATIENT: Well, falling asleep isn't a problem, Doctor. I'm usually out as soon as my head hits the pillow. It’s staying asleep that’s the issue. I wake up… several times a night. Usually just for a few minutes, but enough to disrupt things. And then I lie there, staring at the ceiling. Thinking about tile, mostly. Or things I need to get done. Not a restful sleep, that’s for sure. My wife says I toss and turn a lot. She’s a light sleeper, my wife. Very light.
DOCTOR: Okay. Difficulty staying asleep, with some tossing and turning. And you mentioned your wife has noticed this. Have you had any changes in your mood, besides the irritability your wife mentioned?
PATIENT: Changes in my mood... That's a difficult question. I wouldn't say I'm sad, exactly. More... frustrated, I suppose. Frustrated with myself, mostly. Forgetting things, losing focus... It's not the man I am, Doctor. I’ve always been sharp, reliable. Now I feel… slow. And that irritates me, naturally. I don’t cry or anything, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… grumpy. A lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you've been experiencing some concerning changes over the past six months – memory problems, fatigue, decreased appetite, difficulty staying asleep, and some mood changes. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Let me see. Years ago, I had a bad back. From all the tile work, you understand. Got physical therapy, that helped. And I had my prostate checked a few times, as all men do at my age. Nothing serious there, just… routine. Otherwise, no. I’ve always been a healthy man. Never smoked, barely drink. Good Khmer food, that’s my secret. Strong spices, keeps you going. I've had the usual flu shots, that sort of thing. Nothing major, Doctor. Really. I’ve been lucky.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of back pain, resolved with physical therapy, and routine prostate checks. No other significant medical conditions. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Just the tonsils, when I was a boy. A long time ago. A very long time ago. And… oh, a small thing on my knee, years back. A sports injury, when I was younger. Not a major surgery, just a quick procedure to fix a torn cartilage. Nothing since then. No, no major surgeries. I avoid hospitals if I can, Doctor. Bad luck always seems to find you in those places.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a minor knee surgery. No other surgeries. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… my father, he had a weak heart. Passed away when he was in his seventies. My mother, she had diabetes. She wasn’t careful with sweets, always sneaking little treats. And my older brother, he had some trouble with his memory towards the end. Not sure what it was, just… forgetful. He passed away a few years ago, now. That’s about it, Doctor. Nothing too serious. Mostly just the usual old age things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weak heart in your father, diabetes in your mother, and some memory issues in your brother. That's helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a small thing, Doctor. I take a vitamin D supplement. My wife insists on it. Says I don’t get enough sun working indoors all the time. And sometimes, if my back is bothering me, I take ibuprofen. But that's it. Nothing else. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Too many side effects, always. I prefer a good Khmer massage for my aches and pains. Much better than anything they can give you in a bottle.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D supplement and ibuprofen as needed for back pain. And now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None at all. I can eat anything, take anything. I’ve always had a strong stomach. I eat street food in Cambodia all the time, you know. Very spicy, very flavorful. Never had a problem. No allergies. My wife is the one with the allergies. Pollen, dust… always sneezing. But me? I'm fine. Strong Khmer blood, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for all of that information. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment. Just… try to be quick, if you can. I have a job to get back to, you know. Tile doesn't lay itself. But do whatever you need to do. I want to figure out what’s going on with my head. It’s… unsettling, this forgetfulness.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, I’m going to do a brief cognitive assessment, just a few simple questions to check your memory and thinking. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, alright. Questions… go ahead. I’ll do my best. Just… don't make them too difficult, please. I’m a tile setter, not a scholar. But I'll try. I want to get to the bottom of this. This forgetfulness... it's starting to worry me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly. These will be simple. I’m going to say three words, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me. Then, I’ll ask you to recall them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, ready. Go ahead. Just tell me the words. I’ll try to remember them. This is… a bit silly, isn’t it? But if it helps, I’m willing to do whatever you need. Tile work is all about attention to detail, you know. So I should be good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: table, penny, orange. Please repeat those back to me.
PATIENT: Table… penny… orange. There. I said them. Now, what happens next? I hope I’m doing this right. My mind feels… a little foggy, if I’m honest. But I’m sure I can remember those words. Table, penny, orange. Easy. Should be easy.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Mr. Lason. Now, let's move on to another part of the assessment. I’m going to ask you a few questions about your current date and location. Do you know what today’s date is?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Let me think… It’s… August. Definitely August. And… the 2nd, I think. August 2nd. Yes, that’s right. August 2nd, 2025. Is that correct? I try to keep track, you know. My wife likes me to remember things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. And do you know where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where we are…? Hmm. This is… a doctor’s office, of course. A nice, clean doctor’s office. Suburban, I think my wife said. Dr. Bombara’s office. Somewhere outside the city. That’s about all I know. Is that good enough? I’m better with tile, if you want to know the truth. Knowing where you are isn’t exactly essential when you’re laying a floor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Mr. Lason. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards. Take your time.
PATIENT: … D-L-R-O-W. Is that right? D-L-R-O-W? It feels… strange to spell something backwards. My brain isn’t used to doing that. I usually spell things forwards. It’s much easier that way. Is that correct? I hope I got it right. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier. Do you remember them?
PATIENT: … Three words… Let me see… There was… a table. Yes, a table. And… something shiny. A penny, I think. And… a fruit. Orange, yes. A table, a penny, and an orange. Did I get them all? I think I got them all. But my mind feels… a little fuzzy, Doctor. A little foggy. It’s like trying to grasp smoke. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lason. That was very helpful. Based on this brief assessment, and your history, I suspect we may be dealing with mild cognitive impairment. However, it’s too early to say for sure. We need to rule out other potential causes first. I'd like to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other conditions that can affect memory. And I'd also recommend a brain scan—an MRI—to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… a brain scan…? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it something bad? Is my brain… broken? I don’t like the sound of that at all. I just want to know why I’m forgetting things. Why I’m asking the same questions twice. Is it something I can fix? I don’t want to end up… you know… not myself. I just want to get back to laying tile. That’s all. But if you think it’s necessary… I suppose I can do it. Just… tell me what it means. Don’t sugarcoat it, Doctor. I want to know the truth.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. It’s natural to be worried. A brain scan doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. It’s simply a way for us to get a more detailed look at your brain and rule out any structural problems. The blood work will help us identify any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory issues. There are many treatable causes of cognitive impairment, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. If the tests reveal something more concerning, we’ll discuss all of your options and develop a plan to manage your condition. There are medications and therapies that can help improve memory and cognitive function. We’ll take things one step at a time, Mr. Lason. I’m here to support you every step of the way. And, to be clear, this does not automatically mean you’ll be unable to continue laying tile. Let’s get these tests done first, and then we’ll have a better understanding of what we’re dealing with. Would you like me to explain the process of the blood work and brain scan in more detail?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Alright. Do what you need to do. Blood work… brain scan… explain it to me. I want to know what I’m getting myself into. Tell me everything. What will it involve? Will it hurt? How long will it take? And… what if it is something bad? What if I can’t… you know… think anymore? Just… be honest with me, Doctor. I need to know. I’m a practical man. I like to be prepared. Don’t sugarcoat anything. Just tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. Let’s start with the blood work. It’s a relatively simple procedure. We’ll just need to draw a small sample of blood from your arm. A phlebotomist will clean the area, then insert a needle into a vein. You might feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. The whole process usually takes about 10-15 minutes. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be available in a few days. Now, the MRI is a bit more involved. It involves lying inside a large, tube-shaped machine that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. You’ll need to lie very still during the scan, which usually takes about 30-60 minutes. It can be a bit claustrophobic, but we can provide you with headphones and a comfortable blanket to help you relax. Regarding your concerns about the potential findings, it’s important to remember that we don’t know anything for certain yet. The MRI can help us identify any structural problems, such as tumors or strokes. It can also help us assess the size of your brain and identify any areas of atrophy, which can be a sign of cognitive decline. If we do find something concerning, we’ll discuss all of your options and develop a plan to manage your condition. There are medications and therapies that can help improve memory and cognitive function. We can also provide you with support and resources to help you cope with any challenges you may face. It’s important to remember that even if we do find something concerning, it doesn’t mean that your life is over. Many people live full and productive lives with cognitive impairment. We’ll work together to develop a plan that’s right for you. Do you have any questions about the blood work or the MRI?
PATIENT: …Claustrophobic, you say? I don't like small spaces. Never have. And a magnetic field… that sounds… unsettling. Will it affect my pacemaker? I had one put in a few years ago. And what about the metal in my hips? I had replacements done on both sides. Will that be a problem? I don't want to be… you know… pulled into the machine. And what if it is something bad? What if it's Alzheimer's? My mother… she forgot everything. It was awful. I don't want to end up like her. Just… be honest with me, Doctor. What are the chances? What am I looking at here? Tell me the truth. Even if it's not what I want to hear.
DOCTOR: Those are very important questions, Mr. Lason, and I’m glad you’re asking them. Let’s address them one by one. First, regarding the claustrophobia, we can take steps to make you more comfortable. We can offer you a mild sedative to help you relax during the scan. We can also keep the machine open as much as possible, and you can talk to the technician throughout the procedure. If you start to feel panicked, you can stop the scan at any time. Regarding your pacemaker and hip replacements, it’s crucial that we gather detailed information about the specific models. We'll need to review your medical records and contact the manufacturers to ensure they are MRI-compatible. In most cases, modern pacemakers and hip replacements are safe for MRI scans, but it’s essential to verify. We would not proceed with the scan if there was any risk. Regarding your concerns about Alzheimer’s disease, it’s important to remember that memory loss can have many causes. While Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia, it’s not the only possibility. Other causes include vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. It’s too early to say whether you have Alzheimer’s disease. We need to rule out other possibilities first. The MRI can help us assess your brain for signs of atrophy or other abnormalities. The blood work can help us identify any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory loss. The chances of having Alzheimer’s disease depend on many factors, including your age, family history, and overall health. Approximately 1 in 9 people age 65 and older have Alzheimer’s disease. However, many people live full and productive lives with memory loss, even if they do have a diagnosis of dementia. I understand that this is a lot to process, Mr. Lason. We’ll take things one step at a time. We’ll start with the blood work, and then we’ll schedule the MRI if it’s safe and you’re comfortable proceeding. We’ll discuss the results with you in detail, and we’ll develop a plan that’s right for you. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: …It’s just… a lot. Too much information. Too many tests. Too many possibilities. I just want to know why I’m forgetting things. Why I’m asking the same questions twice. Why my wife is constantly correcting me. Alright. Do the blood work. Get it over with. And schedule the MRI… if it’s safe. But if it’s going to be… uncomfortable… I don’t know. I don’t like small spaces. I don’t like being confined. And what about my tile work? Can I still lay tile? That’s all I know. That’s all I’ve ever done. If I can’t lay tile… I don’t know what I’ll do. Is it going to affect my hands? My eyes? My coordination? Just… be honest with me, Doctor. What am I looking at here? Tell me the truth. Even if it’s not what I want to hear. I need to know. I need to prepare. I need to… know what’s going to happen.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It is a lot to process, and it's completely natural to feel overwhelmed and anxious. And you're right to want to know what to expect. Let's address your concerns about your tile work. In most cases, cognitive impairment doesn't immediately affect your ability to perform tasks like laying tile. The effects can vary depending on the cause and severity of the impairment. If you do have mild cognitive impairment, it's possible that you might experience some difficulty with tasks that require complex planning or problem-solving. You might also have some trouble with remembering details or staying focused. However, with appropriate support and strategies, many people are able to continue working and pursuing their hobbies. Regarding your hands, eyes, and coordination, these are not typically affected by cognitive impairment. However, if you have a condition that's causing cognitive impairment, it's possible that it could also affect your physical abilities. For example, if you have a stroke, it could cause weakness or paralysis on one side of your body. I want to assure you that we're going to do everything we can to determine the cause of your memory loss and develop a plan that's right for you. We'll work together to explore all of your options and help you maintain your independence and quality of life. Before we proceed with the tests, I want to provide you with some resources that can help you learn more about cognitive impairment and find support. I have some pamphlets here about memory loss and dementia, and I can also provide you with a list of local support groups and organizations. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: …Support groups. I don’t want to join a support group. I just want to know what’s going on with my head. I don't want to talk to other people about it. I just want to get back to laying tile. Alright. Do the blood work. Schedule the MRI… if it’s safe. But if I start to feel… confined… I want to be able to stop. Right away. No questions asked. And tell me… honestly… what am I looking at here? What’s the worst-case scenario? What if it is Alzheimer’s? What happens then? Just… tell me the truth. Even if it’s not what I want to hear. I need to know. I need to prepare. I need to… know what’s going to happen. I don’t want any surprises. Just… be honest with me, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to avoid support groups, Mr. Lason. That's completely your decision, and I respect that. And I promise to honor your request to stop the MRI immediately if you start to feel confined. We will prioritize your comfort and well-being above all else. Let's address your concerns about the worst-case scenario. If it is Alzheimer’s disease, the progression can vary depending on the individual. In the early stages, you might experience mild memory loss and difficulty with tasks that require complex planning or problem-solving. As the disease progresses, the symptoms can become more severe, and you might experience difficulty with communication, reasoning, and self-care. However, it's important to remember that there are treatments and therapies that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. We can also provide you with support and resources to help you cope with the challenges of living with Alzheimer’s disease. It’s also important to remember that not everyone with Alzheimer’s disease experiences the same symptoms or progresses at the same rate. Some people live for many years with relatively mild symptoms, while others experience a more rapid decline. We will work closely with you and your family to develop a plan that's right for you. We can also connect you with resources that can provide you with emotional support, practical assistance, and financial guidance. Before we proceed with the tests, I want to assure you that we will be here to support you every step of the way. We will answer your questions, address your concerns, and provide you with the best possible care. We will also respect your wishes and honor your decisions. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: …I don't want to end up like my mother. She didn't even know who I was anymore. She… she just stared at me with blank eyes. It was… awful. Alright. Do the blood work. Schedule the MRI… if it’s safe. But if I start to feel… confined… I want to be able to stop. Right away. No questions asked. And… and please… don’t tell me any more. I don’t want to know what might happen. I just want to get this over with. Just… do the tests. And tell me what they say. That’s all. Please. Just… do the tests. I need to get back to laying tile. That’s all that matters. I need to get back to my life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I understand. We will do the blood work and schedule the MRI, with the understanding that you can stop the MRI at any time, no questions asked. And I will refrain from discussing the potential outcomes or prognosis any further, unless you specifically ask me to. I will prioritize your comfort and well-being above all else, and I will respect your wishes every step of the way. I will also ensure that you receive the results of the tests as soon as they are available. Now, let's get started with the blood work. I will have a nurse come in shortly to draw a sample. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, thank you. Just… just get it over with. I need to get back to my life. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I will let the nurse know you're ready. Please take a deep breath, and remember that we are here to support you every step of the way. .
