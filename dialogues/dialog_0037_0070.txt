DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. AX, you say? Hmm. Yes. New here. Just… a check-up, I think. The lady on the phone, she say I need to come. Something about… being new to the area? Old doctor, he… gone. I don't remember much. It's all a blur, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you recently moved to the area and we sent out a welcome letter. That's perfectly alright – it's common to forget details. A general check-up is a great idea, especially with a change in doctors. To get started, could you tell me a little bit about any health concerns you do remember having?
PATIENT: Concerns? Oh. Well… my back. It… aches sometimes. Old back. Always aches. And… I get tired. Very tired. Not like… sick tired, just… old man tired. Been that way a long time. Don’t think it’s anything serious. Is that what you want to know? I used to work with… faces. Lots of standing. Maybe that.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain and fatigue. That’s good information to start with. You mentioned you used to work with faces – what kind of work was that, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Faces, yes. Makeup. For the… the stage. The theater. I made people look pretty. Or scary. Or… old. Lots of different faces. It was… a long time ago. Before all this. Before… well. A lot of standing, like I say. And holding my hands just so. Very precise work. My fingers… they get stiff sometimes now.
DOCTOR: Makeup artist for the theater – that sounds fascinating! And a lot of physical work, especially with the hands. The stiffness you're feeling in your fingers is something we should definitely take a look at. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe the back pain a little more?
PATIENT: More… hmm. It's not a sharp pain, you understand? It’s a… dull ache. Mostly in the lower part. After I stand for a long time. Or… if I bend over. It's not so bad if I’m sitting. Like an old… heavy weight. That’s how it feels. Has been that way for years. I just… live with it. It's just an old back, you know? Nothing to worry about. Really.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache in the lower back, worse with standing and bending, and present for a long time. We'll certainly want to examine your back to get a better sense of things. Before we do that, let's quickly go over your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. Never had any problems with… pills. I take a little something for my… waterworks, if you understand. Old man problems. But no allergies, no. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Unless… maybe some kind of cream, long ago? But I don't remember what. It was a long time ago. A very long time. It didn't make me sick, just… itchy, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, so medication for urinary issues, and a possible mild skin reaction to a cream in the past. We can try to get more details on that later if needed. Now, could you tell me what medications you are currently taking, including the dosage if you know it?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Just the one. For the… you know. Water. Little blue pill. I take one every… night. That’s what the doctor told me. One little blue pill. I don't know the number. It's… small. And blue. That’s all I remember. Old doctor, he always just gave me the pills. I didn’t ask questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, one blue pill nightly for urinary issues. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospital? Oh. Once. A long time ago. When I was… younger. Fell off a ladder. Painting. Broke my… arm, I think. It was a bad break. They had to… fix it. Stayed in the hospital for a week. Maybe more. It's all a blur, you know? Long time ago. Everything was… different then. I don't remember much about it. Doctors, nurses… it all just blends together.
DOCTOR: Okay, hospitalization for a broken arm after a fall from a ladder. That's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. Yes. My… appendix. A long, long time ago. When I was very young. It burst, they said. It was… an emergency. They took it out. That's all I remember. It hurt for a while, but I got better. It was a long time ago. They did something, and it was over. I don't remember details. I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in the past. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Parents? Oh, no. No, they are… gone. A long time ago. My mother… she died when I was young. Very young. From… sickness, I think. My father… he worked in a factory. He… well, he didn't live a long life. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember much about them, to be honest. It’s… all a bit blurry. I had a sister, though. She lived in… somewhere. I don't remember where. We don't speak anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, both parents deceased, sister who you no longer have contact with. Now, regarding your social history, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoked. Tried it once, long ago, but didn’t like it. Made me cough. Alcohol? A little. Sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner. Not much. Just… to relax. And… no. No drugs. Never. I'm a respectable man. Always have been. Just a little wine now and then. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, a glass of wine occasionally is not a problem at all. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh. We did that one already, didn't we? I said no. No allergies. Unless… that cream. Long ago. But I don’t remember what it was for. It just… itched. A long time ago. It wasn't serious. Really. I don’t think it’s important. Are we finished now?
DOCTOR: Yes, we've covered a lot of ground. Thank you for being so patient and answering all my questions. Now, I would like to do a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of your back pain and overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. And no poking and prodding. I don't like being poked and prodded. Just… be gentle, alright? I'm an old man. Everything hurts already. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and finally we'll take a look at your back. If you could please sit on the table, we can get started. Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are normal. No murmurs or irregularities detected. Your lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, if you wouldn't mind, could you please lie down on your stomach for me so I can examine your back?
PATIENT: Careful… careful now. Old bones, you know. This is uncomfortable. And cold! This table is cold. Just… get it over with quickly, alright? I don’t like lying here. It makes my back hurt even more.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Szmyd, I'm just going to gently feel your back. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. There is some tenderness to the left of your spine, at the L4-L5 level. And your range of motion is slightly limited, particularly with bending forward. I'm also checking your reflexes and sensation. Your reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. There's no sign of any nerve compression. Alright, Mr. Szmyd, you can sit back up now. Based on my examination, it appears you have some muscle strain and inflammation in your lower back. The limited range of motion suggests some stiffness, which is likely contributing to your pain. The good news is, there are no signs of any serious nerve problems.
PATIENT: Muscle strain… That’s what old age does to you, you know. Everything aches and strains. So, what does that mean? Do I need… pills? Or something? I don’t want to be stuck lying in bed all day. Is it serious? Will I be able to… walk normally again? I need to walk! I don’t want any trouble.
DOCTOR: No, it's not serious, Mr. Szmyd. It's a common condition, especially with your history of physical work. You won't need to be stuck in bed all day. I recommend a few things. First, we can start with some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help reduce the inflammation and pain. Second, gentle stretching and low-impact exercise, like walking, can help improve your flexibility and strengthen your back muscles. Third, I would like to recommend physical therapy to help you learn proper stretching and strengthening exercises. I’m also going to order some X-rays of your lower back, just to rule out any underlying bone problems. Would you be interested in a referral to a physical therapist?
PATIENT: Pills… stretching… physical therapy… It sounds like a lot of trouble. I just want it to stop hurting, you know? Is it expensive? This physical therapy… I’m on a fixed income. And I don’t like going to new places. More doctors, more poking and prodding… X-rays… That means more waiting, doesn’t it? I don’t know… Maybe just the pills? Can I just get the pills and see if that helps? Is that possible? I really don’t want to deal with all this other stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. It can be overwhelming to think about all these different treatments. Yes, it is certainly possible to start with just the over-the-counter pain relievers. We can try that for a week or two and see if it provides some relief. However, I do strongly recommend the physical therapy, as it can help address the underlying muscle weakness and stiffness that are contributing to your pain. The X-rays will help rule out any structural issues, and it’s a good precaution to take. They are relatively quick and painless. I’ll write you a prescription for ibuprofen. Let's start with that, and if you're not seeing improvement after a week or two, we can revisit the physical therapy and X-ray options. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Pills… that’s good. That’s manageable. A week or two… I can do a week or two. No poking and prodding… no new places… that’s what I like. Yes, that sounds good. Very good. Just the pills for now. Is that all? Can I go now? My back is still aching.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now. Here is your prescription for ibuprofen. Take it as directed on the label. If your pain doesn’t improve after a week or two, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can discuss other options. You can go now. And remember, gentle stretching and walking can also help. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as numbness, weakness, or bowel or bladder problems, please seek medical attention immediately. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Szmyd. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. Pills… that’s good. Gentle walking… I can do that. Bye bye to you too, doctor.
