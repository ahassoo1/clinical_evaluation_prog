DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Pleasure is mine. I am here because... my ear. It is leaking something. A little bit of fluid, you understand? It started maybe three days ago. Not much pain, just… wet.
DOCTOR: I understand. Leaking fluid from the ear for three days. And you haven’t experienced any significant pain with it, is that correct?
PATIENT: Correct, Doctor. Not much pain. Maybe a little… uncomfortable if I press on it. But not like a bad ache, you know? More… a feeling. And sometimes, I hear a little… ringing. Very quiet ringing. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for clarifying. A little discomfort with pressure and intermittent ringing in the ear… that's helpful information. Has this happened before, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never before. This is new. I have never had this… leaking. Or the ringing. I am usually very good with remembering things, and I would remember this if it happened before. I am certain.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, and I appreciate your detailed recollection. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you describe the fluid?
PATIENT: The fluid… let me see. It is… clear. Not thick. Like water, almost. And it does not smell. I checked, you understand? I did not want to… ignore something. A little bit yellow, maybe, but mostly clear. Very small amount, though. I use a tissue to wipe it, and that is all.
DOCTOR: Clear, slightly yellowish fluid, without odor, and only a small amount… Thank you. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, Doctor. No headache. My hearing… it feels normal. I can hear you perfectly, you understand? And no dizziness. I did feel a little… tired yesterday, but I work very hard. Maybe just from that. I do not think it is related.
DOCTOR: No fever, headache, or dizziness. Hearing seems unaffected, and the fatigue you experienced might be unrelated. Now, Mr. Radillo, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, or any ear infections in the past, even as a child?
PATIENT: No colds or the flu recently, Doctor. I try to stay very healthy. And… no ear infections, not ever. When I was a small boy, we did not have good doctors. But I never had trouble with my ears. I played outside a lot, sometimes in the water, but never any infections. I remember very clearly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who has been ill?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not traveled. I stay here, mostly. And no, I have not been around anyone who is sick. I work at the school, you understand? With the children. But no one has been very ill. Just the usual little coughs and sneezes. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Now, let's take a look at your ears. Would you mind sitting up and facing me?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Not a problem. I am ready when you are. Please, be gentle. My ears are… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Radillo. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m just going to take a look inside your ears with this instrument. It won't hurt, but please let me know if you feel any discomfort. Alright… I see some slight redness in the ear canal on both sides. Your ear drums appear intact, but there is a small amount of fluid present behind the right ear drum. No signs of a foreign object. It looks like there is a small amount of inflammation.
PATIENT: Inflammation? Is that bad, Doctor? What does that mean? And the fluid… is it an infection? I am worried, you understand. I need to be healthy for the children.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Radillo, and it's good that you're thinking about the children. Inflammation simply means there's some irritation or swelling. It doesn’t necessarily mean a severe infection, but it could be an early sign of one. The fluid behind the ear drum is also concerning, and we need to investigate further. Given your symptoms and the findings of the exam, it’s likely this is either an early middle ear infection – also known as otitis media – or an issue with the Eustachian tube, which can cause fluid buildup. To be certain, I would like to check your hearing with a quick audiological test. It’s a non-invasive procedure, and it will give us a better idea of what’s going on. Would you be willing to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. If it helps to know what is happening, I am willing. I trust your judgment. Eustachian tube… is that something serious? I do not understand these medical words, you understand. Just tell me if it is something I need to worry about.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that, Mr. Radillo. The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of your throat and helps to equalize pressure. Sometimes, it can become blocked, which can lead to fluid buildup and discomfort. It’s usually not serious, but it can sometimes lead to an infection. The audiological test will help us rule out any hearing loss and determine the best course of action. It’s a quick and painless procedure. If you're comfortable, we can proceed with the test now. It will take about 10-15 minutes. I’ll explain everything as we go along.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I am ready. Ten to fifteen minutes is no problem. Please, explain everything clearly. I do not want to be confused.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I’m going to put these headphones on for you. You’ll hear a series of tones and beeps in each ear. Whenever you hear a tone, please press the button on this handle. It doesn’t matter how soft or loud the tone is, just press the button. We’ll test each ear individually. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Hear a tone, press the button. Simple. I am ready when you are. Please, tell me if I am doing it wrong. I do not want to mess up the test.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s begin. I’m going to start with your right ear. Just relax and listen carefully. If you hear anything at all, even a faint sound, press the button. Don’t worry if you don’t hear anything, that’s perfectly normal. …Okay, that’s the last tone. Thank you, Mr. Radillo. You did a wonderful job. The test results show mild hearing loss in your right ear, particularly at lower frequencies. This correlates with the fluid buildup we observed behind the ear drum. There is no significant hearing loss in your left ear.
PATIENT: Mild hearing loss? Oh… that is not good, is it? Will it get worse? And the fluid… what do we do about the fluid? Will I need… medicine? I worry about being able to hear the children, you understand? They are very quiet sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Mr. Radillo. Mild hearing loss is often temporary, especially when it’s related to fluid buildup. It doesn’t necessarily mean it will get worse. And we have several options to address the fluid. Based on your symptoms and the test results, I suspect you have a middle ear infection, likely caused by a viral upper respiratory infection. However, to be absolutely certain, and rule out any other potential causes, I’d like to order a tympanometry test. It's a quick and painless procedure that measures the movement of your eardrum, and it will give us a clearer picture of what's happening in your middle ear. In the meantime, I recommend a course of observation, coupled with symptomatic treatment. I’ll prescribe a decongestant to help open up your Eustachian tube and drain the fluid. I also recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to manage any discomfort. And, of course, plenty of rest and fluids. If your symptoms don’t improve within 72 hours, or if they worsen, we’ll revisit the possibility of antibiotics. We want to avoid unnecessary antibiotics if possible, but we need to ensure you receive the appropriate treatment if necessary. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: 72 hours… Observation, decongestant, pain relievers. Yes, that sounds… okay. Reasonable. But what about the tympanometry test? Will that tell us more? And will it be uncomfortable? I do not like things being put in my ear, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, the tympanometry test will provide us with more detailed information about the function of your middle ear. It’s a very quick and painless procedure. A small probe is gently inserted into your ear canal – it doesn't go very far, and it doesn't touch the ear drum. It measures how well your ear drum moves in response to changes in air pressure. It's similar to the examination I just performed, but more precise. It takes only a few seconds per ear. It will help us confirm the presence of fluid and assess the severity of the inflammation. Based on the results, we can determine the most appropriate course of action. I can perform the test here today if you’re comfortable. If not, we can schedule it for another day. Either way, we’ll proceed with the observation and symptomatic treatment in the meantime. Would you like me to perform the test now, or would you prefer to schedule it for another appointment?
PATIENT: Hmm… A few seconds. Does not touch the ear drum. Perhaps… perhaps I can try it. Just a few seconds. But if it is uncomfortable, you must stop immediately, you understand? I do not want to risk making things worse. Alright. Let's try it. But be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Radillo. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go along, and I will stop immediately if you experience any discomfort. Alright, I’m just going to gently insert this small probe into your ear. You might feel a slight pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax and try to stay still. Okay, that’s the last ear. Thank you. The results confirm the presence of fluid behind both ear drums, and they indicate some inflammation in the middle ear. It’s consistent with the diagnosis of acute otitis media. Given your mild hearing loss and the persistence of symptoms, I recommend starting a course of antibiotics. I’ll prescribe Amoxicillin for 10 days. It’s a commonly used antibiotic and it’s generally well-tolerated. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Amoxicillin… Ten days. Yes, if that is what you recommend, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. I want to get better, you understand? I need to be healthy for the children. Will there be any side effects? And… is it okay to drive while taking it? I need to be able to get to work.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Amoxicillin is a very effective antibiotic, and it should help clear up the infection. Common side effects are generally mild and may include nausea, diarrhea, or stomach upset. If you experience any severe side effects, such as a rash, difficulty breathing, or swelling, stop taking the medication immediately and contact me or seek medical attention. Regarding driving, yes, it is generally safe to drive while taking Amoxicillin. It doesn’t typically cause drowsiness or impair your ability to drive. However, if you do experience any side effects that make you feel unwell or dizzy, I recommend avoiding driving until you feel better. I'll also provide you with a written prescription and instructions for taking the medication. It’s important to complete the full 10-day course, even if you start feeling better before then. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. Thank you for your patience. You have explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your help. I will follow your instructions carefully. I hope to feel better soon.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. We're here to support you. I’ll have the nurse provide you with the prescription and a follow-up appointment card. I’d like to see you back in one week to check your progress. Get well soon, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Goodbye.
