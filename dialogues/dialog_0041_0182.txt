DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Orwin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I haven't got all day. It's about this…procedure. My daughter insisted I get a check-up first. Says the surgeon wants it. Just want to get it over with, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. No rush. A procedure, right. And your daughter suggested a check-up beforehand... That’s very thoughtful of her. Could you tell me a little more about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: It's…well, it’s cosmetic. I’m getting a bit of a…sag. Under my chin, you see? It's not becoming. And frankly, I don’t need to explain everything to you. It’s just a little tightening. A nip and tuck, as they say. Though I find the term rather vulgar.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. A cosmetic procedure to address some…laxity under the chin. Not a problem at all, you don't need to go into detail if you're not comfortable. Just to be thorough, and since you're coming to me for a check-up before proceeding, I'd like to get a general sense of your overall health. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well? At my age? What does that even mean? I ache a bit in the mornings, naturally. And I get tired easier than I used to. But that's just…old age creeping in. I haven't been sick sick, if that's what you're asking. No coughs, no fevers, nothing like that. Just…old.
DOCTOR: That's fair enough. “Old” is perfectly valid. No recent coughs or fevers, that's good. And the aches and fatigue… those are common as we get older, definitely. Just trying to rule out anything that might make the procedure a bit riskier. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, the doctor mentioned something years ago, but I don't take anything for it. He said to watch my salt intake. Which I mostly do. Salt is important, you know. And…no, nothing else. I used to have a bit of trouble with my knees, but that was years back. Mostly gone now. Just a bit creaky in cold weather. Honestly, I'm a pretty healthy man for my age. Don’t go looking for problems where there aren't any.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, watching salt intake. And some knee trouble that's improved. Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hm. Let me think… Yes. Appendectomy when I was a boy. And…a hernia operation. Years ago. Must be… forty years ago, at least. Nothing since. Minor things, really. Both went fine. No complications. I heal quickly, generally. Though, like I said, getting a bit slower these days. But still. No problems.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Appendectomy and hernia repair, both without complications. And you said you heal well generally, even now. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family with any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: My mother, God rest her soul, she had…arthritis. Badly. Couldn't walk in her later years. And my father… he died of a heart attack. Sudden, you know? Perfectly healthy one day, gone the next. That's why I watch my salt. Though, like I said, I'm a healthy man. Don't dwell on the past, I always say. Just bad luck, most likely.
DOCTOR: I understand. Arthritis in your mother, and your father had a heart attack. Okay. Just a couple more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. The doctor gave me some pills for my knees once, years back, but I can't recall the name. Didn’t seem to do much, to be honest. No reactions, though. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’m a sturdy Norwegian, you know. We’re built tough. Though, like I said, getting a little creaky these days. Can we hurry this along? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No known allergies, that’s good. Alright, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and have a look at your throat. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, yes, get it over with. Just…don't poke around too much. And be gentle, alright? I bruise easily, you know. Getting old has its disadvantages. Though, like I said…
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Gentle is the name of the game. Alright, if you could just sit back and relax. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Sounds a little… diminished, but not alarming for your age. Now, just a quick listen to your lungs… Everything sounds clear there. Blood pressure next… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, if you could open your mouth for me, I’m just going to take a quick look at your throat… Everything looks clear back there. No redness or swelling. Alright, everything sounds good so far. I'm documenting all of this as we go.
PATIENT: Finally. Good. So, can I go now? Is that it? No need for any… further poking and prodding, I hope? I'm a busy man, you know. And frankly, I’m starting to feel a bit lightheaded. This waiting around is worse than the procedure itself, honestly. Can we just…get this over with? Is the surgeon going to call, or…?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, you seem generally healthy for your age. However, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and your mother's history of arthritis and your father’s heart attack are worth noting. The dizziness you're feeling could be related to the slightly elevated blood pressure, or just being a little dehydrated from the waiting. I would recommend a more comprehensive blood workup to get a better baseline of your overall health, just to be on the safe side before proceeding with the cosmetic procedure. Also, I'd like to discuss some lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise – that can help manage your blood pressure. I will contact the surgeon's office and let them know I’ve completed the check-up, and I’ll advise them of my recommendations. They will likely want to review my notes. Do you have any questions for me before I go over the lab order and some potential lifestyle changes?
PATIENT: Lab order? Lifestyle changes? Honestly! This is ridiculous. I came here for a simple clearance, not a complete overhaul of my life. I’ve lived this long doing things my way. I eat what I want, I don’t need to go running around like a fool, and frankly, I’m perfectly happy as I am. Just tell the surgeon I’m in good enough health. He’s a professional, he can make the decision. I don’t need another doctor telling me what to do. And don’t bother with the lab order. I’m not paying for any unnecessary tests. Is that clear? Can I finally go now? I have a lunch appointment, you know. And I’m starting to get very annoyed. Stop wasting my time!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand your frustration. While I respect your wishes, I have a professional obligation to ensure your safety. Performing a procedure without a basic understanding of your underlying health is, in my opinion, irresponsible. I will document your refusal of the blood workup and your desire to proceed with the surgery without it. However, I strongly advise against it. The surgeon will ultimately make the final decision, but they will be aware of my concerns. I'm going to give you a written summary of our conversation, outlining the potential risks, and your decision to proceed without further testing. Here you go. And yes, you are now free to go. I wish you all the best with your procedure, Mr. Orwin. .
