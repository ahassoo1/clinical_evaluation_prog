DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, right? That's a pretty name. Um… what brings me in? Let me think… It’s my joints, mostly. They get…stiff. Especially in the mornings. It’s just… hard to get moving, you know? Not a sharp pain, just… not wanting to bend. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started. A while now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in the joints, especially in the mornings. And you said it’s been going on for a while. Do you remember anything that might have triggered it, or did it just gradually start?
PATIENT: Triggered…? Hmm. That’s a good question. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t recall. Things… aren’t so clear these days, you know? I used to be very active, I think. Lots of gardening, walking… but that was a long time ago. Maybe after… after my husband passed? Everything sort of blurred together then. It just… started being harder to get up and about, I guess. No big fall or anything. Just… slow.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's completely normal for things to feel a bit hazy when you've been through a difficult time. We’ll take our time. So, this stiffness… where exactly are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just one place, you know? Mostly in my hands, I think. Makes it hard to… button things, or open jars. And my knees… they feel a bit creaky when I climb the stairs. And sometimes my hips… just a general ache. It’s not a bad pain, never really sharp. Just… uncomfortable. I try not to complain too much, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so hands, knees, and hips. More of a general ache and stiffness, not sharp pain. And it’s affecting things like buttoning clothes and climbing stairs. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in any of those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… redness…? Let me see… I haven't really looked closely, to be honest. I just feel the… the stiffness. Maybe a little puffy sometimes, in my hands? But I always thought that was just… my weight, you know? I don’t think I’ve seen any red. No, not that I remember. It doesn’t look angry, if that makes sense. Just…old. Is that a thing? Joints looking old?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, and it is a thing – joints can certainly show their age. Okay, no redness or noticeable swelling. Have you tried anything to help with the ache and stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I take a little ibuprofen sometimes, if it’s really bothering me. But it doesn’t always help, you know? And I try to keep moving, even if it hurts a little. I do a little walking, but not as much as I used to. My daughter, bless her heart, she got me one of those… those heating pads. That feels nice for a bit, but it doesn't last. I mostly just try to… push through. It’s just what you do, right?
DOCTOR: I see. Ibuprofen occasionally, walking, and a heating pad. And you're trying to stay active, which is good. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the joint pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get a little tired, maybe more tired than I used to. But I’m… well, I'm not getting any younger, right? And sometimes my hands feel… numb, a little tingly. Not always, just… sometimes. Is that connected, do you think? I’m just… always something, it feels like these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some tingling in your hands. It's good you're mentioning everything. Now, just to get a better picture, can you tell me about any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now you’re asking something! Let me think. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… I think I had high blood pressure, at one point? The doctor put me on a little pill, but I don’t really remember much about it. It’s all a bit… fuzzy. My husband always handled the doctor things, you see. After he passed… I just haven't kept up with it all, I guess. I don't think anything major, though. No… no broken bones or anything like that. Mostly just… aches and pains, as you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a history of high blood pressure. And your husband handled most of the medical details previously. Have you ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries… let me think very carefully. Oh! I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That was a long, long time ago. And… I think I had a small mole removed from my back, maybe ten years ago? But that was just a tiny thing, the doctor just snipped it off. I don’t think anything else. Not that I remember, anyway. Things get… lost, you know? It’s like a sieve.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils removed as a child and a mole removed from your back. Now, can you tell me about any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family… That's a tough one. My mother, bless her soul, she had… arthritis, I think? In her hands. Badly. She used to complain about it all the time. And my father… he had heart trouble, I think. He passed away when I was young. My brother… he's still alive, thank goodness, but he’s got… diabetes, I believe. But honestly, I don’t really know much about it. We weren't a very close family, you see. Mostly just…distant. So, I’m not very good with remembering all the medical details. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly okay. It's very common not to have all the details. So, arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and diabetes in your brother. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. I don't think so. I don't recall ever having a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. Maybe a little sensitive to shellfish, sometimes? But it's not a serious allergy, just a little… tummy trouble. Nothing major. I’ve never had to go to the hospital for allergies, or anything like that. Just… a little tummy ache now and then. Is that enough information? I’m sorry I’m not very helpful with all of this. It's just… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Lilliana. It's completely alright. So, a possible mild sensitivity to shellfish. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Well, just the ibuprofen, when my joints get bad. And… I take a little vitamin D, sometimes. My daughter told me to. She says I need it for my bones. But I don't take it every day, just when I remember. And… oh, I take a little something for my… sleep. It’s not a prescription, just something I buy at the store. Helps me get a few hours of rest. That’s all, I think. Really, that’s it. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, you know? I always worry about side effects.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed, vitamin D occasionally, and an over-the-counter sleep aid. Thank you, Lilliana. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your joints and overall health. It will involve me looking at and feeling your joints, and listening to your heart and lungs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, please? My joints are a little… sensitive, you know? And… I get a little nervous around doctors, to be honest. It reminds me of… well, never mind. Just… gentle, please. And tell me if you find anything wrong, okay? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything as I go. And I promise to let you know what I find, good or bad, and we'll discuss it together. First, let's take a look at your hands. Can you open and close your fists for me, and then spread your fingers wide?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. There. Is that alright? It’s a little… creaky, you know? And a little hard to bend all the way. I don’t think they bend like they used to. Old hands, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just feeling around now. There is some mild stiffness, as you mentioned, and a slight decrease in range of motion. I don't see any significant redness or swelling. There's a little tenderness when I press here , and here . But overall, it doesn’t seem particularly inflamed. Now, let’s check your wrists. Any pain or discomfort when I move them like this?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little… ache, when you bend them. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like they’re getting old. And… a little grating, you know? Like sandpaper. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. And… they feel a little weak, maybe? I don't think I have the strength I used to. It’s probably just age, though, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting the decreased range of motion and the crepitus you described, which is consistent with some wear and tear in the joint. There is no significant swelling or redness. Now, let’s check your elbows. Can you bend and straighten them for me?
PATIENT: Okay. There. It feels a little… tight, you know? And… a little achy on the outside of this one . Not bad, just… noticeable. I don't think I can bend them as far as I used to, either. Is that normal? It’s probably just age, right? I keep saying that… I’m sorry. I’m just… worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting some slight tenderness on the outside of your right elbow, which could be a sign of some mild arthritis or tendonitis. There doesn't appear to be any significant swelling or redness. Now, let's move on to your knees. Can you bend them for me as much as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My knees… There. It’s… hard, you know? And… creaky. Really creaky. And… it feels a little tight on the inside. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And I can’t bend them as far as I used to, not by a long shot. It’s probably just age, you know? And… I’m a little overweight, so that doesn’t help, either. I’m sorry. I'm just… not very flexible these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting some crepitus and decreased range of motion in both knees, as you mentioned. There’s no significant swelling or warmth, but there is some mild tenderness along the joint line. Now, can you stand up for me, if you’re able?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I can stand up. There. It’s a little… shaky, you know? And my knees… they feel a little weak. I don't think they can support me as well as they used to. I used to be able to walk for miles, but now… not so much. Is it bad? Is it something serious? I'm just… worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting a slightly unsteady gait and some mild crepitus in your hips as well. There doesn't appear to be any significant tenderness. Overall, your exam findings are consistent with osteoarthritis, which is a common condition that affects joints as we age. It's causing some wear and tear in your hands, wrists, elbows, knees, and hips, resulting in stiffness, pain, and decreased range of motion. It's important to remember that osteoarthritis is a progressive condition, but there are many things we can do to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Would you be open to discussing some treatment options?
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis. That sounds… serious. So, it’s not just… old age? Treatment options… yes, yes, that sounds good. Anything to help… anything to make it easier. I don’t want to be… useless, you know? I like being able to do things. What kind of things can we do? Pills? Exercises? I don’t know… I just… want to feel better. And… is it going to get worse? I’m sorry, I’m just… asking a lot of questions. I get anxious, you know? My daughter says I worry too much. But… it's scary.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Lilliana. That's what I'm here for, and it's completely understandable to feel anxious. Osteoarthritis isn't necessarily serious in the sense that it's life-threatening, but it can certainly impact your quality of life if left unmanaged. There are several things we can do. The goal of treatment is to reduce pain, improve function, and slow down the progression of the disease. First, we can explore some lifestyle modifications, like weight management, which can significantly reduce the stress on your joints. Regular exercise, specifically low-impact activities like walking, swimming, or cycling, can also help strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion. Physical therapy can be very beneficial in learning specific exercises and techniques to manage your symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help reduce pain and inflammation. We can also discuss prescription medications if over-the-counter options aren't providing enough relief. In some cases, we might consider injections, like corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid, to provide temporary pain relief. As for whether it will get worse, osteoarthritis is a progressive condition, meaning it can worsen over time. However, with appropriate management, we can slow down the progression and minimize your symptoms. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a lot of information. Weight management… I know I need to lose weight, but it’s so hard. Exercise… I used to walk a lot, but my knees… it’s just painful. And pills… I don’t like taking a lot of pills, you know? So… what do you recommend? What do you think would be the best place to start? I don’t want to do anything too drastic, you know? Just… something to help. Something to make it easier. And… is physical therapy expensive? I don’t have a lot of money, you know. I’m a widow, and… things are tight. And I don't have insurance, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed, and it's important to start slowly and gradually. We don't need to do everything at once. Given your concerns about weight, exercise, and medication, and your financial situation, I would recommend starting with lifestyle modifications and physical therapy. Regarding weight management, even losing a small amount of weight can significantly reduce the stress on your joints. We can discuss some simple dietary changes that you can make. I can also provide you with some resources for healthy eating on a budget. Regarding exercise, we can start with low-impact activities like walking for short periods of time, gradually increasing the duration as your pain allows. We can also explore other options like swimming or water aerobics, which are gentle on your joints. Regarding physical therapy, I understand your concerns about the cost. Unfortunately, physical therapy can be expensive, but there are some options available. Some clinics offer sliding scale fees based on income, and there are also some community programs that offer free or low-cost physical therapy services. I can help you research some options in your area. Before we proceed, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any other underlying conditions that might be contributing to your joint pain. I would also like to take some X-rays of your knees and hips to assess the extent of the damage. These tests will help me develop a more tailored treatment plan for you. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Blood tests and X-rays… Oh dear. More tests. I hate tests. But… I suppose it’s better to know, right? Okay. Blood tests and X-rays. And then… the lifestyle changes and physical therapy. And you’ll help me find some affordable options? That would be wonderful. I appreciate that. How long will it take to get the results of the tests? And… will it hurt to get the X-rays? I get nervous, you know. My husband always said I was a worrywart. But… I just don’t like being poked and prodded. And… what if the tests show something bad? Will you tell me? I want to know, even if it’s not good news. I just… want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel nervous, and I understand your concerns. The blood tests are relatively quick and painless – we’ll just need to draw a small sample of blood from your arm. The X-rays are also painless – you’ll simply need to stand or lie still for a few moments while the machine takes pictures of your knees and hips. The entire process should only take a few minutes. The results of the blood tests typically take a few days to come back. The X-rays will be reviewed by a radiologist, and I’ll discuss the results with you as soon as I have them. Regardless of the results, I will be honest and upfront with you. If the tests show something concerning, we will discuss your options and develop a plan to address it. And if the tests are normal, we will focus on managing your symptoms and improving your quality of life. Before we proceed with the tests, do you have any allergies or medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… no allergies, I don’t think. And… like I said, I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, and high blood pressure at one point, but I don’t take anything for it anymore. And I think that’s it. I’m just… old. But… what if I can’t afford the tests? Will you still see me? I don't want to be a burden, you know. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. My daughter said I should come to the doctor, and I’m glad I did. You’re very kind. And… can we schedule the tests for next week? I have a hair appointment on Friday, and I don’t want to miss that. It’s just… important to me.
DOCTOR: You're not a burden at all, Lilliana. And we will absolutely figure something out regarding the cost of the tests. Many labs offer financial assistance programs, and I can also help you explore some options for low-cost or free testing in the area. We won’t move forward with anything until we’ve addressed that concern. And yes, we can definitely schedule the tests for next week. Let me take a look at my schedule… How does Tuesday morning sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday morning… yes, that would be fine. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my hair appointment. I need to look presentable, you know? My daughter is taking me out to lunch afterwards. So… Tuesday morning. What time? And… do I need to do anything to prepare for the tests? Should I take my usual medications? And… will it be crowded? I don't like being around a lot of people, you know. And… thank you again. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better just talking to you.
DOCTOR: Tuesday morning at 9:00 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: 9:00 AM… yes, that’s perfect. That gives me plenty of time to get ready, and it won’t interfere with my hair appointment. And… no special preparation needed for the tests. You can take your usual medications as scheduled. And as for being crowded… I’ll do my best to minimize your exposure to other patients. We can schedule your tests during a less busy time, and I’ll make sure you have a private area to wait in. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
DOCTOR: Excellent. So, Tuesday at 9:00 AM it is. My nurse will call you tomorrow to confirm the appointment and provide any additional instructions. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I'm glad I could help, Lilliana. I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday. And please remember, you're not alone in this. We'll work together to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Have a good rest of your day, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient. Yes, Tuesday at 9:00 AM. I won’t forget. And… thank you again. You’ve given me a little hope. Have a good day, Doctor. And… goodbye.
