DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, I've noticed a lump… a mass, I suppose, in my lower abdomen. It's been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A mass, you say. And how long is “a little while,” precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Probably... around six weeks, maybe? It started quite small, I didn’t really pay it much attention at first, to be honest. It’s grown a bit since then, though, and it’s just… concerning.
DOCTOR: Concerning. A vague descriptor, but noted. And has this “growth,” as you call it, been constant, or has it been fluctuating?
PATIENT: That's a good question. It hasn't felt constant. There have been times when I didn’t notice it as much, and other times… well, like after I’ve been doing a lot of lifting with choreography, it feels more prominent, if that makes sense? It’s hard to say for sure, really.
DOCTOR: Choreography?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I'm a choreographer. I work with a few dance companies around the city. It involves a lot of physical work, as you can imagine. Sometimes I'm demonstrating moves, sometimes lifting partners… It’s quite demanding, actually. Perhaps that's relevant?
DOCTOR: “Perhaps.” A rather unhelpful assessment, don’t you think?
PATIENT: Apologies, Doctor. I just mean… I wasn’t sure if the physical strain could be contributing to whatever this is. I don’t have a medical background, so I'm just trying to think of anything that might be related. I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: We’ll determine what is related, Mr. Raghunathan. Now, let’s move beyond speculation. Do you experience any pain associated with this mass?
PATIENT: No, not really pain, Doctor. It's not painful to the touch, and I don’t get any discomfort unless I’m… exerting myself. Then it feels a little… heavy, I suppose. Not a sharp pain, just a sort of ache, and more of an awareness of it being there.
DOCTOR: “Awareness.” Very precise. And has this “awareness” been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not that I've noticed. No fever, no changes in my… bowel habits, no weight loss. Just the lump, and that occasional feeling of heaviness when I'm being active. Honestly, that’s why I waited so long to come in. It wasn't causing any real problems, just… a worry.
DOCTOR: Very well. I suppose we’ll need to conduct a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with palpation of the abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. Just let me know if there’s anything I should do or be aware of during the examination.
DOCTOR: Simply lie flat and remain still. I will be examining your abdomen. Try to relax, though I understand that may be difficult.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’ll do my best to relax.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is a definite mass present in the left lower quadrant. It appears to be approximately… three centimeters in diameter. Non-tender to palpation, somewhat firm, and slightly mobile. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, though slightly hypoactive. The mass does not appear to be significantly impacting bowel function, at least based on this preliminary examination.
PATIENT: That sounds… concerning, Doctor. What could it be? Is it something serious? I’m not sure I understand what "hypoactive" means, either.
DOCTOR: "Hypoactive" means your bowel sounds are a little quieter than usual. It's not a cause for immediate alarm, but it's something to note. As for what it could be… it’s impossible to say definitively without further investigation. It could be a number of things. A lipoma, a hernia, perhaps even… something more concerning. We need to rule out the more serious possibilities. I will order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal ultrasound.
PATIENT: That… that sounds like a lot. An ultrasound… will that show us what it is? And how long will it take to get the results? I have rehearsals next week, and… I'm worried about being able to continue dancing if it's something serious.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound should provide a clearer picture of the mass and its characteristics. As for the results… typically within 48 to 72 hours, depending on the lab. Whether you can continue dancing is entirely dependent on the findings. I would advise against strenuous activity until we have a diagnosis. I’ll send the orders to the lab now. You’ll receive a call to schedule the ultrasound. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Okay. So, no dancing until I know more… I understand. Thank you for explaining everything, even if it's… a little frightening.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll also order a referral to a general surgeon, just to be cautious. Should the ultrasound reveal anything concerning, you'll need their expertise. I will also need a complete list of your medications, if any, and your past medical history. Do you have that information readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I don't take any regular medications, thankfully. And I… I had a bout of pneumonia when I was a child, but otherwise, I've been relatively healthy. Here’s my insurance card, and a list of previous doctors I've seen. It's not very extensive, though. I’m married, if that's relevant, and my Medicare number is on the card.
DOCTOR: Married. Noted. And pneumonia… a childhood illness is unlikely to be relevant, but we document everything. Very well. I have all the necessary information. I’ll have the lab results sent to my office, and you will receive a call to schedule the ultrasound within 24 hours. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all for now. Thank you again for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll wait for the call about the ultrasound.
DOCTOR: Very well. You are dismissed. Please refrain from strenuous activity until we have a definitive diagnosis. .
