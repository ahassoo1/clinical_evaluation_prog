DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been… experiencing a bit of unsteadiness, I suppose. It's hard to explain exactly. I feel… off balance sometimes. It's been happening for a little while now, but it seems to be getting… more noticeable recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, "unsteadiness" – I understand. And you said it’s been happening for a little while, and recently more noticeable. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Honestly… it’s difficult to pinpoint when it started exactly. My memory isn't what it used to be. I believe it was… after a particularly long shift at the rig, but I couldn’t say for certain. It’s just… little things. Bumping into furniture, feeling like I might fall when I stand up quickly… things like that. It doesn’t happen every time, which is what makes it so… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started potentially after a long shift at the rig, and it's intermittent – not happening every time you stand or move. That's helpful information. You mentioned bumping into furniture and feeling off balance when standing. Can you describe how you feel when you're off balance?
PATIENT: It’s… not dizziness, exactly. More like… the room isn't quite steady. Like it's gently swaying, even when I know it isn’t. And it’s not a spinning sensation, if that makes sense. It’s… subtle. Hard to describe. It’s like my feet aren’t quite… connected to the floor, perhaps? And sometimes I just feel… weak in the legs. I hope that isn't too confusing.
DOCTOR: No, that's a very helpful description, Lilyanna. Not spinning, more of a swaying sensation and feeling disconnected, with some leg weakness. That helps me narrow things down. Just to be thorough, do you notice anything that makes it worse – certain movements, positions, times of day, anything like that?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I believe it’s worse when I’m tired, definitely. Long shifts at the rig, like you said before, leave me feeling completely drained, and that's when it’s most noticeable. And… sometimes after I’ve been standing for a very long time. I do a lot of walking at work, you see. But I… I can't think of anything else specific. It doesn't seem to be affected by what I eat, or the time of day, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse with fatigue and prolonged standing. That's good to know. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the unsteadiness – things like headaches, blurry vision, ringing in your ears, nausea, or any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No headaches, no blurry vision, and certainly no ringing in the ears. Nausea… occasionally, but I think that's more related to the work itself, if I’m being honest. The fumes and the motion… sometimes it gets to me. As for my hearing… no, I don’t think so. It’s… it's been a while since I’ve really paid attention, if that makes sense. I suppose I should probably get that checked as well, but it hasn’t been a priority, to be frank.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We can address that later if needed. No headaches, blurry vision, ringing in the ears, or nausea directly linked to the unsteadiness. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My husband… he handled all of the medical things. It’s been two years since he passed, and honestly, I haven’t kept up with it as well as I should. I believe I have slightly high blood pressure, but I’ve been taking medication for it, so it’s usually under control. And… I had a surgery on my knee a long time ago, when I was younger. A sports injury, I think. But that doesn't seem to be related to this current issue. Other than that… I’m not certain. I apologize for not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Lilyanna. It’s understandable that things might be difficult to recall after a loss. High blood pressure managed with medication and a past knee surgery – that’s good to know. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Oh dear… It’s… a white pill, I believe. A small, white pill. I apologize, Doctor. I truly wish I could be more precise. My husband always refilled it, and I just… took it as prescribed. I don't recall the name at all. I know it’s a very important question, and I feel terrible for not knowing. Perhaps my pharmacy could provide you with a list? Would that be helpful?
DOCTOR: That would be very helpful, Lilyanna. We can certainly obtain a list of your medications from your pharmacy. I understand it’s difficult to remember these details, especially after a loss. Don't worry about it. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: My mother… she had diabetes, yes. She was diagnosed quite late in life, I believe. And… my grandfather, on my father’s side, had some sort of heart condition. He passed away when I was very young, so I don’t remember much about it. As far as I know, there weren’t any neurological disorders in the family. But, to be honest, we didn't talk about medical history very much. It wasn't considered important, perhaps? I apologize for not being able to provide you with more information.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lilyanna. Knowing about your mother's diabetes and grandfather's heart condition is helpful. We can always investigate further if needed. Finally, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions, but that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I work very hard, and I need to stay alert and focused. Those things would interfere with that. I pride myself on being responsible, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Lilyanna. Thank you for being so open with me. Okay, so to summarize: you’re experiencing intermittent unsteadiness, worse with fatigue and prolonged standing, not associated with dizziness, headaches, or blurry vision. You manage high blood pressure with medication , have a past knee surgery, a family history of diabetes and heart disease, and don’t smoke, drink excessively, or use recreational drugs. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I want to get to the bottom of this, so please, do whatever you need to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Okay, good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. Next, I'll check your ears, eyes, and neurological function. Let's start with your ears… Ears appear normal, no signs of infection or fluid. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Reflexes are intact. Now, I’m going to assess your balance. Can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can, Doctor. It's… difficult. I don't feel very stable. I think I need to hold onto something…
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that. You do have some difficulty maintaining your balance with your eyes closed. Okay, walk for me, please, a few steps forward. Your gait appears steady, but there’s a slight hesitation with each step. No noticeable limping or dragging. Finally, I’m going to check your strength in your legs. Can you squeeze my hand as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that enough? I don’t want to hurt you. I try to be strong, but my hands aren’t what they used to be. All the work… it takes a toll, you know?
DOCTOR: That was good, Lilyanna. Your grip strength is within normal limits. Okay, based on the examination, you have some difficulty with balance, especially with your eyes closed. Your gait is relatively steady, and your strength is normal. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Given your history and the examination findings, several possibilities could be contributing to your symptoms. It could be related to medication side effects, a mild inner ear issue, or potentially a neurological condition. It is also possible this is related to fatigue and overall physical strain from work. To help narrow down the possibilities, I recommend a few tests. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for any underlying medical conditions, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes, and a Vitamin D level. I also think an audiogram to evaluate your hearing would be helpful, given your report of potential difficulty hearing, and possibly an MRI of the brain to rule out any neurological issues. Would you be comfortable proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: That… that sounds like a lot of tests, Doctor. But… if it will help me understand what's going on, then yes, I suppose so. I just… I don’t like the idea of more tests, to be honest. But you’re the doctor. If you think it’s necessary, then I trust your judgment. Please, just… explain everything to me clearly, okay? And tell me what each test is for. I’m not very good with medical things, as you’ve probably noticed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilyanna. I understand your apprehension, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. The complete blood count, or CBC, is a simple blood test that checks for things like anemia, infection, and other blood disorders. It can help rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. The basic metabolic panel, or BMP, is another blood test that checks your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. It can help assess your overall health and identify any imbalances that might be causing your unsteadiness. The Vitamin D level test checks if you have enough Vitamin D in your body. Vitamin D deficiency can cause muscle weakness and balance problems. The audiogram is a hearing test that measures your ability to hear different sounds. It can help identify any hearing loss that might be contributing to your symptoms. Finally, the MRI of the brain is a scan that uses magnetic waves to create detailed images of your brain. It can help rule out any neurological issues, such as multiple sclerosis or stroke. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on and help us determine the best course of treatment. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… a bit scary, to be honest. Is it painful? And… will it take a long time? And what if it finds something… bad? I don’t want to know if there’s something seriously wrong with my brain. Perhaps… perhaps we could just try some physical therapy first? Before doing all these… invasive tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilyanna. An MRI can sound intimidating, but it is a very safe procedure. It’s not painful at all. You’ll lie inside a large tube, and it uses magnetic waves, not radiation, to create the images. It can be a bit noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes, but that’s it. As for finding something “bad,” that’s a valid concern. However, it’s better to know what’s going on so we can address it appropriately. Sometimes, the MRI will show nothing at all, and that’s good news too. Physical therapy is a reasonable suggestion, and it could be helpful in improving your balance and strength. However, it won’t tell us why you’re experiencing these symptoms. It’s like treating the symptom without knowing the cause. I think it’s best to proceed with the tests first, so we have a clear diagnosis before starting any treatment. We can discuss the results together, and you can decide what you’re comfortable with. I won't push you into anything you don’t want to do. Would you like me to order the tests for you now?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, Doctor. You’re right. It’s better to know, I suppose. Even if it’s… scary. Please, go ahead and order the tests. But… could you explain the process to me again? What will happen when I go to get them done? And… will they contact me to schedule an appointment? I just… I like to be prepared. And I get anxious easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilyanna. I completely understand. Let’s go through it step-by-step. First, I’ll send the orders to the lab and imaging center. They’ll contact you directly to schedule appointments. You’ll likely have the blood work done first, as it’s quicker. They’ll just need a small sample of your blood. For the audiogram, you'll go to the audiology department. They’ll have you wear headphones and listen to different sounds at varying volumes. It’s a painless test, and it takes about 30-60 minutes. The MRI is the most involved. You’ll need to remove any metal objects—jewelry, hairpins, even some types of makeup—as metal can interfere with the scan. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large tube. It’s important to lie very still during the scan, and it can be a bit noisy. You’ll be given earplugs to help with the noise. A technician will be monitoring you throughout the scan, and you’ll be able to communicate with them if you need to. The whole process will likely take a few days to a week, depending on appointment availability. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I’ll also give you a written summary of the tests and what to expect. And if you have any questions or concerns along the way, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. Does that sound a bit clearer?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that does sound a bit clearer. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. I’m still anxious, of course, but I feel… a little bit better knowing what to expect. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any precautions I should take? Just… to make sure I don't fall or… make things worse?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I'm glad I could help. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, and we’ll take things one step at a time. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help minimize your risk of falling. Avoid walking in dimly lit areas or on uneven surfaces. Use a cane or walker if you feel unsteady. Wear comfortable shoes with good support. And most importantly, listen to your body. If you feel tired or dizzy, sit down immediately. Also, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until we know what’s causing your symptoms. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Finally, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as severe dizziness, headache, vision changes, or weakness—please call the clinic immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. I’ll also write all of this down for you in your discharge instructions. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. Thank you again for everything. I’ll… I’ll schedule the tests as soon as I can. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Take care, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
