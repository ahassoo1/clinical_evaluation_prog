DOCTOR: Hi Derick, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… swelling, really. Face and legs, like you said. It’s been… a bit of a bother. Not sure why it's happening, mind you. Seems to come and go. Don't recall anything specific that sets it off.
DOCTOR: Right, swelling in your face and legs. And it comes and goes without anything obvious causing it, you said?
PATIENT: That’s right. Comes and goes. Honestly, probably been happening for… well, a while now. Not something I usually bother a doctor about, if I'm being frank. Just figured it was… old age, I suppose. Or maybe the weather. It has been humid.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're getting it checked out now though, even if it’s been going on for a bit. "Old age" and weather can sometimes be factors, but it's best to rule out anything else. Just to get a clearer picture, can you describe the swelling a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm. Describe it… well, it's puffy, isn't it? Like… if you leave dough out too long. Mostly around my ankles and feet, and then sometimes my cheeks get a little… rounder. Not painful, usually. Just… noticeable. Especially in the evenings. It's not like it's sudden, you understand. It builds up.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy, building up gradually, mostly ankles, feet, and sometimes cheeks, more noticeable in the evenings, and not painful. That's helpful. Now, has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed? Not really. Lost my wife, bless her heart, a few years back now. That was a big change, I suppose. But that wasn’t recent. Aside from that… I eat pretty much the same stuff. Same routine. Maybe I haven't been getting out as much… but honestly, I never was one for a lot of activity. Oh! The pharmacy switched my blood pressure pills, maybe six months ago? Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, losing your wife is a huge change, and I’m sorry for your loss. And yes, the change in blood pressure medication is important. Do you remember the name of the old one, or the new one?
PATIENT: Ugh, names… always a struggle. No, not a clue, Doctor. They just handed me a different box. Said it was the same thing, just… cheaper, I think? Something about the insurance. Or maybe it was more expensive. Honestly, they mumbled something about costs and I just nodded. I don't pay much attention to those things. My daughter usually handles all that now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can look that up in the system. Let’s see… Ah, yes. It looks like you were switched from Lisinopril to Valsartan about six months ago. Now, besides the medication change, any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Valsartan… sounds familiar, I guess. Symptoms… Let me think. I get a bit tired, I suppose. But who doesn't, at my age? Nothing major. Sometimes my ankles feel a little… achy, but I figured that was just from sitting too long. And… I’ve been a bit more thirsty lately. Oh, and I think I have to go to the bathroom more often, too. At night, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, achy ankles, increased thirst, and more frequent urination, especially at night. That’s good information. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you know of, like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Kidney issues… no, not that I know of. Doctor always said my heart was a bit… enlarged, maybe? Years ago. But that was a long time ago. Never needed any special treatment or anything. And no, no diabetes. My wife, bless her heart, she had a touch of that, but not me. Mostly just getting old, I suspect. That's what it feels like, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, enlarged heart in the past, but no specific treatment. No diabetes. Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Had my appendix out when I was a boy, that much I remember. And… oh, a hernia repair, years ago. Maybe twenty, thirty years ago? Something like that. Nothing recent. Small thing, really. Can't recall the exact date, though. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't paying much attention to the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a hernia repair in the past. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the Valsartan?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is getting complicated. Let me see... I take something for my knees, a little white pill. And… oh, a baby aspirin, every day, Doctor told me to years ago. For my heart, I think. That's it, I'm pretty sure. My daughter keeps a list, she's much better at remembering these things. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so Valsartan, a medication for your knees, and a daily baby aspirin. And you have no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with any pills. Lucky, I suppose. Though, I don't take a lot of them, to be fair. Just trying to keep things simple, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your ankles, and take your blood pressure. It'll help me get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Sounds… alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a bit of a schedule, you see. Not a busy one, but… still. Go ahead, Doctor. Just try to be gentle, alright? My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible. Blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated. Let's listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your ankles… I notice some significant swelling, pitting edema, especially on both sides. And your skin feels a little cool to the touch. One last thing, let me check your weight... 58 kilograms. That’s a bit on the lower side.
PATIENT: Ugh, my ankles do feel puffy. Never much liked looking at them, to be honest. Low weight… well, my wife always said I needed to eat more. But I never had much of an appetite. Murmur… is that bad, Doctor? Sounds serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, the murmur isn't necessarily bad immediately, but it's something we need to investigate further. It could be related to your enlarged heart from years ago, or something else entirely. It’s why I want to run some tests. Based on what you've told me and the exam, the swelling, increased urination, thirst, and the murmur, along with the slightly low weight... I'm concerned about the possibility of heart failure or kidney problems. It's important to figure out which one it is, or if it's a combination of both. I’d like to order a blood test to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. And an EKG to look at your heart’s electrical activity. Also, a urine test to look for protein. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Tests… more complications. Heart failure… kidneys… sounds… serious. My wife always said I shouldn't worry so much. Alright, Doctor, if you think it's necessary. Do what you need to do. Just… try to keep it quick, alright? And explain everything clearly. I don't understand much of this medical talk. Protein in my… what was it? Pee? Just… get it over with, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We’ll take it one step at a time. The urine test is just a simple sample of your pee, yes. It helps us see how well your kidneys are working. I'll write up the orders for the blood tests, EKG, and urine test now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and explain the EKG process. It's a quick, painless test where we put some stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s activity. While we wait for the results, I'd like to start you on a low-sodium diet. That will help reduce the swelling and put less stress on your kidneys and heart. Do you think you can manage that?
PATIENT: Low… sodium? What’s that? Is that something I need to buy at the store? I don’t do much cooking, my daughter usually handles that. She brings over meals a couple times a week. I suppose I could ask her… but I don’t want to bother her. She’s got a busy life. Salt… I always put a little salt on my food. Is that bad? This is getting complicated, Doctor. Very complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, it is a little complicated, but we’ll take it slow. Sodium is a type of salt that’s in a lot of processed foods. Cutting back on sodium means avoiding things like canned soups, processed meats, and fast food. And yes, it’s best to use less salt when cooking. Don’t worry about bothering your daughter. You can just mention to her that the doctor recommended a low-sodium diet. She’ll know what to do. If not, the nurse can provide you with a list of low-sodium foods. For now, let’s just focus on getting the tests done. The results will help us figure out the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… tests… low sodium… daughter… Yes, alright. Tests. Just… get it over with. I'm just tired, Doctor. Tired of everything. When will the nurse be here? I just want to sit down.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re tired, and it’s a lot to take in. The nurse should be here within the next few minutes. I’ll just step out for a moment and give her a heads-up. In the meantime, try to relax. I’ll be right back with the nurse. Let me know if you need anything. And remember, we’re here to help. We’ll figure this out together.
