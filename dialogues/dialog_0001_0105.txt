DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Well, it’s… about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? I think my wife set this up. It’s… bariatric surgery, she called it. I don’t really remember all the details, honestly. She said I needed an evaluation.
DOCTOR: Bariatric surgery… right. Your wife brought you in. Look, I'm Dr. Pehrson. Seventeen years doing this, and frankly, a lot of people think they need this surgery when they don’t. Let’s just get through this. So, you’re… concerned about your weight. How long have you been, shall we say, concerned?
PATIENT: Um… a long time, I guess. Honestly, it feels like… always? I mean, I’ve been bigger most of my life. It’s hard to say when it started being a concern… maybe the last few years? My wife keeps saying I need to be healthier, and… I guess she’s right. It’s just… everything feels a little fuzzy, you know? I don’t really keep track of dates or anything.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy. Right. Okay. Well, let’s try to get some specifics. Are you having any problems related to your weight right now?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. I get… really tired, just walking around. And my knees… they hurt a lot, especially at the end of the day. It makes it hard to… well, do anything, really. Just getting up from a chair sometimes is tough. And… I get out of breath pretty easily, even doing simple things. It’s embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, knee pain, shortness of breath. All… predictable. Have you tried anything to address this before surgery became a thought?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, a little. My wife tried to get me to go for walks with her, but… I didn’t really stick with it. And she’s always trying to get me to eat healthier, but… I like my food, you know? I’ve tried a few diets, I guess… like, cutting out carbs or something. But I always end up going back to what I normally eat. It’s hard. It just… feels like nothing really works for long.
DOCTOR: Right. So, minimal effort. Look, Mr. Kochubey, this surgery isn’t a magic fix. It requires a lifestyle change. Are you aware of the risks involved?
PATIENT: Risks? Uh… she mentioned something about it. Something about… complications? I don’t really remember the details. I just know she said it could help me lose weight and be healthier. I guess I wasn’t really listening to the scary parts, if there were any. Is it… dangerous? I mean, I trust my wife, but… it’s still surgery, right?
DOCTOR: "Dangerous" is a strong word. It's invasive. There's a risk of infection, blood clots, nutritional deficiencies... the list goes on. We'd need to run some tests, obviously. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I haven’t really had any bad reactions to anything. Maybe… a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes when there’s a lot of pollen? But I don’t take any medicine for it. And… I think I was a little itchy after eating shellfish once, a long time ago. But it wasn’t anything serious, I just didn’t eat it again. Is that an allergy? I’m not really sure. My wife usually handles all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, potential mild seasonal allergies, possible shellfish sensitivity. We'll note that. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Never have, really. Just… whatever over-the-counter stuff for a headache now and then. But I try to just rest when I have a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just standard stuff. Height, weight, listen to your heart and lungs… I'm going to need you to step on the scale. Don't worry, I've seen it all.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I haven't weighed myself in… a long time, actually. Don't judge, Doc.
DOCTOR: 139 pounds. And your height is… 155 centimeters. Alright. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not critical. Heart sounds… normal. Lungs… slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally, could be related to your weight. Knees… some crepitus and tenderness to palpation, consistent with osteoarthritis. Alright. I’m going to order some basic bloodwork – a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a CBC. We'll also need an EKG just to be safe. We need to rule out any underlying conditions before we even consider surgery. It's standard protocol.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. When will I… get the results? And… what happens next? I’m kind of lost here, to be honest.
DOCTOR: The lab results will take a few days, maybe three to five business days. The nurse will call you with the results and schedule a follow-up appointment. Until then, continue with your current lifestyle. Honestly, it's unlikely you're a good candidate for surgery at this weight, but we need to be thorough. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doc. For explaining everything. I guess I’ll just… wait for the nurse to call? I’m not sure what else to do. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Mr. Kochubey. The nurse will be in touch. .
