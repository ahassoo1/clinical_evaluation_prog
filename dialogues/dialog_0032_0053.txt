DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my waterworks, really. I’m having trouble going to the bathroom. It’s not… easy, you know? It takes a long time, and sometimes it doesn’t even want to go.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty with urination. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe three months ago? At first it wasn’t so bad, just a little slow. But it’s gotten worse steadily since then. I remember it being around the time we had that big heatwave in May, actually. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It could matter. Sometimes dehydration can certainly contribute to urinary issues. But let’s focus on the specifics. When you do manage to urinate, Ms. Yadao, is it a complete emptying, or do you feel like you still have to go back shortly after?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. No, it doesn’t feel like it’s completely empty. I usually have to go again within an hour or two, sometimes even sooner. And it’s… straining, you know? I have to push a bit to get it going. It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I see. Incomplete emptying and straining. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Like the color? No, not really. It looks… normal, I suppose. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink a lot of tea, so that could be it. I haven't seen any blood, or anything like that. And the smell is… well, it smells like urine! I haven’t noticed anything different there either. Honestly, I’m just glad it's still coming out, you know? It’s just a struggle to get it going.
DOCTOR: Right. No blood, no change in odor, just difficulty and incomplete emptying. And you mentioned drinking a lot of tea… what kind of tea, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Oh, all sorts! Mostly black tea, with a little bit of herbal tea in the evenings – chamomile, sometimes peppermint. I like a strong brew. I have a few cups throughout the day, maybe four or five. I used to drink more coffee, but I switched to tea a few years ago. My sister said it was better for my… well, everything! Though I suppose too much tea could be a problem, couldn't it?
DOCTOR: It can be. Certain teas have diuretic properties, meaning they can increase urine production. Others contain compounds that may irritate the bladder. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been controlled with medication for years now. And my hips… they’re a bit creaky, you know? Arthritis, the doctor said. Nothing major, just the usual aches and pains of getting older. I had a gallbladder removed years ago, too, but that was ages ago. And… I think that’s it. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I don’t really like going to the doctor, so I try to avoid it when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Controlled hypertension, arthritis, and a cholecystectomy. And you're currently taking medication for your blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. One tablet every morning. I’ve been taking it for… oh, goodness, maybe ten years now? It seems to be doing its job, the doctor says my numbers are good. I always make sure to refill it on time, I wouldn’t want to risk that! Is that… is that important to this, Doctor? The medication?
DOCTOR: It can be. Some medications have side effects that affect urinary function. Now, before we proceed further, Ms. Yadao, have you ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… No, I don’t think so. Just the gallbladder. And… well, I had a hysterectomy when I was quite young, maybe in my twenties. It was a long time ago, before I moved here, actually. I don’t remember all the details, it was… unpleasant, you know? But it was many, many years ago. It never seemed to bother me afterwards, though. At least, not until now, maybe? Could that be… related?
DOCTOR: A hysterectomy… yes, that could be relevant. Sometimes, post-surgical changes can cause urinary issues. Now, Ms. Yadao, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. I'll need to check your abdomen, and I'd also like to perform a pelvic exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. A pelvic exam? Well… I haven’t had one of those in… decades, I suppose. It’s been a very long time. I… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. But… will it be uncomfortable? And how long will it take? I’m not very good with… poking and prodding, you know. Just let me know if it's going to be… intrusive.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Yadao. It will involve an internal examination, and I will explain everything as I go and proceed as gently as possible. It should take approximately ten to fifteen minutes. We'll start with the abdominal exam, and then if you’re comfortable, we’ll move to the pelvic exam. We can absolutely stop at any point if you feel uncomfortable. I want to assure you this is to help determine the cause of your urinary difficulties. Would you like a moment to prepare?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A moment would be lovely. I… I need to just… gather my thoughts. And maybe adjust things a bit. It’s just… a lot to take in. Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. Take all the time you need. I'll be just outside when you're ready. And please, don’t hesitate to ask any questions you may have. I'll leave you to change. .
