DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes. Right. Well, it’s for… a check-up, I believe? Something about needing to be cleared for… acting? Or a performance, maybe? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. They sent me, you see. The theatre folks. I don’t really keep track of these things anymore. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: A check-up for a performance, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Though, truthfully, I don't recall which performance. I’ve… done a few, over the years. Mostly ushering, and taking tickets… sometimes a little bit on stage, here and there. Old age, you know. Things just… blur.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, regardless of which performance, it's good you're getting checked out. It's always best to be thorough. Let’s start with a general history. Have you been feeling unwell recently?
PATIENT: Unwell…? Hmm. Not particularly, no. A little tired, maybe? But that's just getting old, I suspect. I sleep alright, I think. Not much aches or pains, either. Honestly, I don’t really notice much these days. It's hard to tell what’s normal and what isn’t, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant aches, pains, or fatigue… just a general sense of being… older. And you said you sleep alright?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. I go to bed… when I’m tired. And wake up… when I’m not. Simple as that. It’s not a great sleep, mind you, but it’s… sufficient. I wouldn't say I’m restless or anything. Not that I remember, anyway.
DOCTOR: You mentioned sleeping "sufficiently". Do you ever experience any shortness of breath when lying down, or wake up feeling like you're gasping for air?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. That’s… a good question. I don't think so. Sometimes I cough a little at night, but that's probably just dust. I live near the old theatre, you see. Lots of… old things floating around. No, I don’t think I’ve been gasping for air. Not recently, at least.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… changes? Oh dear. I eat when I’m hungry, I suppose. And… not much when I’m not. I don't really weigh myself, you see. Never have. Too busy with… things. I’m probably thinner than I used to be, but that’s just age, isn’t it? I haven't noticed a big change, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or lung disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… That’s a difficult one. I saw a doctor years ago, when I was… younger, I suppose. For a cough, maybe? Or a cold? He gave me some… pills. Nothing serious, I don’t think. I don’t remember any big diagnoses, like… heart problems or diabetes. I've always been fairly… robust, if you know what I mean. But… honestly, it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A very long time ago. And… maybe a tonsillectomy? It's all a bit hazy. Hospitalized… possibly for the appendix? But nothing major, I assure you. Nothing recently, certainly. I try to stay out of hospitals, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? Oh, dear. My… my parents are both gone now. A long time ago. I had a brother, I think. But we didn't see each other much. I don’t really know anything about their health, if that's what you mean. They… they just got old, I suppose. Like everyone else. I wasn't really the one to ask about these things, you see. I was always busy with… work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to get a complete picture, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no. Absolutely not. I never smoked a day in my life. Too expensive, you see. And alcohol… a little wine with dinner, maybe, occasionally. But nothing serious. And recreational drugs… heavens, no! A respectable man doesn't do those things. I've always been a very… temperate person.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications…? Hmm. Let me see… I used to take something for my… indigestion, I think. Years ago. But I stopped taking it. It didn't seem to do much good, and I didn't want to fill my body with pills. No, I'm not taking anything currently. Just a little tea, sometimes. For my nerves.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and just have a quick look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go right ahead. Though, don’t expect much. Everything’s a bit… worn out, you know? Just be gentle. And try not to take too long, if you wouldn’t mind. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Krahn… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are… somewhat distant. A bit of a murmur, but not particularly concerning at this point. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, take a few deep breaths through your mouth. Lungs are clear, but there’s some diminished breath sounds at the bases… consistent with age. Ears are clear, some wax buildup… Throat looks a little dry, but no acute inflammation. Alright, Mr. Krahn. Everything seems… reasonably normal, given your age and history. But I would like to order a few basic blood tests just to get a better picture of your overall health. Specifically, a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… oh, dear. Are they… necessary? I’m not a fan of needles, you see. And I don’t really like being poked and prodded. But… if you insist. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just… try to be quick, alright? And don't tell me too much about the results, if you can help it. I don’t want to worry myself unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. I understand your concerns. We'll keep it as quick and painless as possible. And I’ll only share the essential information with you – no unnecessary details. We’ll just need a small sample of blood. The lab is just down the hall. I'll write you a requisition form, and the nurse will be able to assist you. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d also recommend you try to stay hydrated and maintain a reasonably healthy diet. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please let me know immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmm. No, I don't think so. Not at the moment. Just… tell me how long these tests will take? I have… commitments, you see. And can I… can I still usher?
DOCTOR: The tests should take about an hour or so, Mr. Krahn. And… yes, you should be able to continue ushering. But if you experience any fatigue or shortness of breath, you may need to take it easy. Honestly, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be able to continue your activities, as long as you're sensible. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. And Mr. Krahn… try not to overexert yourself. It's important to listen to your body.
PATIENT: .
