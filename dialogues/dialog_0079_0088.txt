DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… this ringing in my ears. It’s been happening for a while now, and it’s starting to bug me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. Ringing in the ears… or tinnitus, as we call it. And when you say 'a while', could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe three, four months now? It comes and goes, but it’s definitely been more frequent lately. It’s like a high-pitched whine, sometimes. Other times it’s more of a buzzing. It’s hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Three to four months, fluctuating in intensity. High-pitched whine and buzzing… understandable. Is it constant when it is present, or does it come and go in bursts even during those periods?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, even when it’s… well, there. Like, it won't be solid ringing the whole time. It’ll be quiet for a bit, then louder, then quiet again. It’s really annoying when I’m trying to sleep, though. That’s the worst part.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Honestly? Not really that I’ve noticed. I work as a waiter, so it’s pretty noisy at work sometimes, but it started before I even got this job. I used to listen to music pretty loud with headphones, but I stopped doing that a while ago now. I don’t know… maybe stress? I got divorced a couple of years back, so things have been a bit hectic.
DOCTOR: Alright. Previous loud headphone use, recent divorce causing stress... and it seems unrelated to your current work environment. Have you noticed any hearing loss, or muffled hearing, along with the ringing?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. Everything sounds normal, as far as I can tell. I might not be the best at noticing small changes though, to be honest. I haven’t really paid that much attention.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s move on to some more general questions. Do you experience any dizziness or vertigo alongside the ringing?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No, not really. Maybe a little off-balance sometimes, but I put that down to being tired from work. It’s definitely not spinning or anything like that. Just… a bit unsteady, occasionally.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any pain, pressure, or discomfort in your ears?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the ringing. It's just… frustrating, you know? It makes it hard to concentrate. Sometimes it's so loud it's hard to hear people talking.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, I'd like to do a brief ear examination, if that's alright. It will involve looking inside your ears with an otoscope. Do you have any allergies to any medications or latex?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. That's good. Yeah, go ahead with the examination. I just want to get this sorted, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please sit here and lean forward slightly. I will need to look in both ears. Alright, Mr. Dhanoa. The ear canals appear clear bilaterally. The tympanic membranes are intact, and I don’t see any signs of infection or fluid. There's a very small amount of cerumen in both ears, but it doesn’t appear to be obstructing the canal. I'll document that.
PATIENT: Okay, good. So, what does that mean? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Based on the examination, there are no obvious physical causes for your tinnitus. No infection, no blockage… The small amount of cerumen is unlikely to be the cause. Given your history of previous loud noise exposure and recent stress, it's most likely sensorineural tinnitus – meaning it originates in the inner ear or auditory nerve. It’s very common, and often associated with noise damage or stress. It's rarely indicative of a serious underlying condition, but it can be persistent.
PATIENT: Okay… persistent? So it’s not going to just… go away on its own? What can I do about it? I'm trying to get back on my feet after the divorce and this is just… another thing.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, there's no definitive cure for tinnitus. However, there are several strategies to manage it. We can try some things to reduce your perception of the sound. First, I recommend minimizing exposure to loud noises whenever possible. Even if it doesn't seem loud, prolonged exposure can exacerbate the issue. Second, stress management techniques like mindfulness or relaxation exercises can be beneficial. Third, we can consider a course of cognitive behavioral therapy—CBT—which can help you reframe your thoughts and reactions to the tinnitus. Finally, and this is something I would typically refer you to an audiologist for, a hearing test to establish a baseline and potentially explore masking devices. Would you be open to a referral to an audiologist for further evaluation and management?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. A referral to an audiologist sounds… sensible. I mean, if there's anything that can help, I’m willing to try it. Minimizing noise and stress… I can definitely try that too. It's just... hard sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. I will prepare a referral for you to Dr. Emily Carter, an excellent audiologist with a good reputation in the area. She’ll conduct a thorough hearing assessment and discuss potential treatment options with you. I’ll also print out some information on tinnitus and stress management techniques for you to take home. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden hearing loss, dizziness, or pain in your ears, please contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Dhanoa. I hope you find some relief with the audiologist. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
