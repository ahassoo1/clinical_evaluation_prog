DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Quicksey. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. To be perfectly honest… it’s a little difficult to explain. I understand it has something to do with… plans for the future, should something… unforeseen happen? I was advised to inquire about a form, an “Advance Directive” or perhaps a “POLST” form, I believe. My ex-husband mentioned it, but… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re interested in discussing advance care planning – making sure your wishes are known regarding your medical care should you be unable to speak for yourself. Both Advance Directives and POLST forms are excellent tools for that, and it’s very proactive of you to think about this now. To clarify, when you say “unforeseen happen,” are you experiencing any specific health concerns that prompted this thought, or is this more of a general consideration for the future?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing specific. It’s not… a sudden impulse. It’s just… things have a way of changing, don't they? And I don’t want to be a burden, or have decisions made for me that aren't… aligned with what I would want. I suppose it’s more of a general… preparation. I apologize if that sounds vague. It's difficult to articulate. I… I don’t really recall what spurred the initial conversation with my ex-husband, only that he felt it was important.
DOCTOR: Not at all. That’s perfectly understandable, and it’s quite common for people to feel that way. It's very responsible of you to consider this even without a specific health event prompting it. So, let’s explore this a bit further. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. I believe… generally speaking, I am quite well. I maintain a… rather active lifestyle, though I confess I've been spending more time in my studio lately. I'm an etcher and engraver, you see, and it requires… focus. I don’t recall having any major illnesses or surgeries. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I have private insurance, should that be relevant. I… I do take a daily vitamin, if that’s helpful. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in… well, I can’t quite recall how long. It’s been some time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. An active lifestyle and maintaining a studio practice is wonderful. And it's helpful to know you have private insurance. Since it’s been some time since your last check-up, let’s quickly review some of your medical history, just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. To my knowledge, no. I don’t believe so. I’ve never experienced any… adverse reactions to anything. I occasionally have a slight sensitivity to certain metals used in my work – nickel, primarily – but it’s just a skin irritation, nothing serious. I don't take any regular medications, aside from the daily vitamin, as I mentioned. I… I am quite certain I haven't had any serious allergic reactions in my life. Though, again, my memory… is a little unreliable. Perhaps it’s best to err on the side of caution?
DOCTOR: That's a very good point, and caution is always wise. We can certainly document the potential nickel sensitivity. It’s good you've had no known major allergies. Now, let’s talk a bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Family history… that's… a difficult question, Doctor. My parents… passed away some time ago, and I wasn't particularly close to my extended family. I know my mother suffered from… high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some sort of heart condition, though I don’t recall the specifics. It was a long time ago. There wasn't much discussion of medical matters, truthfully. I… I don’t believe there was any history of Alzheimer's or cancer, to my knowledge. But I truly couldn’t say with any certainty. It’s… frustrating how little I remember.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s common for families not to discuss those details, and it's understandable that details may be fuzzy. We’ll document what you recall, and that’s a good starting point. Finally, before we move on to discussing the Advance Directive and POLST forms themselves, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… I… I am divorced. It was some time ago. I live alone. My work occupies most of my time. I don’t have a large circle of friends, truthfully. I occasionally attend art exhibitions, but… I primarily keep to myself. I don't drink or smoke. I don't have any pets. I… I suppose that’s the relevant information. It’s not a very… exciting social life.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you lead a focused life, which is perfectly valid. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's focus on what brought you in today - your interest in advance care planning. Do you have any specific wishes regarding your medical care that you’ve already thought about?
PATIENT: Specific wishes… I have considered, in a general sense, that I would prefer not to be kept alive artificially if there were no reasonable hope of recovery. I… I don't want to be a burden. And I would prefer to have my ex-husband involved in any decision-making process, should I be unable to participate. He understands me… better than most. Beyond that… I haven't given it a great deal of thought, truthfully. I suppose I was hoping you could guide me through the process. I understand these forms involve… outlining specific treatments and interventions, and I'm not entirely sure what my preferences would be in various scenarios.
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent starting point. It's very common to feel unsure about specific treatments. That's exactly what these forms are designed for - to help you articulate your wishes, and to guide your loved ones and medical team in making decisions aligned with your values. There are two main forms we can discuss: the Advance Directive, which is a broader document outlining your overall wishes for medical care, and the POLST form, which is more specific and focuses on current medical orders. Given your preference for not being kept alive artificially without hope of recovery, and your desire for your ex-husband to be involved in decision-making, we can certainly work on both. Before we delve into the specifics, do you have any questions about either form?
PATIENT: Not at this moment, Doctor. Although… could you perhaps explain the difference between the two forms in a little more detail? I understand one is broader, and one is more specific, but… what does that mean in practical terms? And… if I complete both, would they… overlap? I apologize if these are rather basic questions.
DOCTOR: Not at all, these are excellent questions. It's important to understand the difference. Think of the Advance Directive as your overall healthcare philosophy – what’s important to you in general. It outlines your values, what kind of care you’d want in various situations, and who you’d want making decisions for you. It’s a more general statement of intent. The POLST form, on the other hand, is a medical order. It’s a specific set of instructions for your current medical condition. It says things like “Do Not Resuscitate,” “Do Not Intubate,” or “Comfort Measures Only.” It's only relevant if you are seriously ill and unable to communicate your wishes. They can overlap. Your Advance Directive can guide the creation of your POLST form. For example, if your Advance Directive states you don't want aggressive life-sustaining treatment, that would likely be reflected in a “Do Not Resuscitate” order on your POLST form. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… I believe so. The Advance Directive is the overarching… philosophy, and the POLST form is the practical application of that philosophy in a specific situation. It’s like… the theory and the practice, perhaps? Your explanation is very helpful, Doctor. It’s… much clearer now. I think I would like to begin with the Advance Directive, if that’s acceptable. Perhaps we can work on the POLST form later, once my overall wishes are more clearly defined.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Absolutely. Let's begin with the Advance Directive. It's a fairly comprehensive document, but we can take it one section at a time. It's important to remember there's no rush. We want to make sure your wishes are accurately reflected. First, the form asks you to name a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions for you if you're unable to do so yourself. You mentioned your ex-husband. Is he the person you'd like to name as your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. He is. I trust him implicitly. He… he understands my values and preferences better than anyone else. He would be able to advocate for me, even if it’s difficult. He's… surprisingly good at navigating bureaucracy, as well. Which I appreciate, given my… organizational challenges.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And does he have a current address and phone number for us?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe so. His address is 14 Willow Creek Lane, Oakhaven, and his phone number is… 555-123-4567. Yes, that’s correct. I… I keep meaning to update my address book. It's a rather chaotic system, as you might imagine.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Now, the next section asks about your wishes regarding specific medical treatments. It covers things like resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition and hydration, and dialysis. Do you have any specific preferences regarding these treatments?
PATIENT: I… as I mentioned earlier, I would not want to be kept alive artificially if there were no reasonable hope of recovery. So, regarding resuscitation… I would not want CPR if my heart were to stop and there was no prospect of regaining consciousness. And I… I would not want to be placed on a ventilator if my lungs were to fail and there was no reasonable chance of recovery. Artificial nutrition and hydration… I suppose that depends on the circumstances. If I were permanently unconscious, I would not want to be fed artificially. But if there was a possibility of recovery, I would want to be kept comfortable and nourished for as long as possible. Dialysis… I don’t believe I have any specific preferences regarding that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very clear. You do not want CPR or mechanical ventilation if there’s no reasonable hope of recovery. You do not want artificial nutrition if permanently unconscious. And you have no specific preference regarding dialysis. That is very helpful. The next section asks about pain management. Do you have any specific wishes regarding pain control?
PATIENT: I… want to be comfortable, Doctor. That is my greatest wish. I do not want to suffer needlessly. I want to be kept as comfortable as possible, even if that means… accepting some level of drowsiness or other side effects. I trust you and the medical team to manage my pain appropriately, even if it means prioritizing comfort over complete alertness. I… I have witnessed enough suffering in my life. I simply want to be peaceful.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable and important wish. We absolutely prioritize comfort and will ensure your pain is managed effectively, even if it means accepting some side effects to achieve that goal. That will be clearly documented in your chart. Now, the final section is a space for you to add any other specific wishes or concerns. Is there anything else you’d like to add before we finalize the Advance Directive?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. I… I am grateful for your patience and guidance. It's… surprisingly reassuring to have these things documented. It takes a weight off my shoulders, knowing that my wishes will be respected. Perhaps… just one small request. Could you ensure that a copy of this form is given to my ex-husband? He… he is the one who initiated this process, and he deserves to know that it’s been completed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A copy will be given to him directly. And we'll keep a copy in your chart, readily accessible to the medical team. So, to recap, we have completed your Advance Directive, outlining your wishes regarding healthcare proxy, resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition, pain management, and overall comfort. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. You have been incredibly thorough, and I feel much more at ease now. Thank you. Perhaps… we can discuss the POLST form at a later date? When I've had more time to consider my wishes in specific scenarios. But for now… this is enough. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. That sounds like a perfectly reasonable plan. We can absolutely revisit the POLST form at your convenience. It’s important to take your time and feel comfortable with your decisions. Here are some informational brochures on Advance Directives and POLST forms that you might find helpful. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns at any time, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. It was a pleasure meeting you today.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor Quicksey. Thank you for your kindness and patience. I appreciate your guidance. I believe that will be all for today. Have a good day.
