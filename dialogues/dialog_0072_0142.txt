DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I am Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Right, well… it's my head, mostly. I keep getting these… bad headaches. And I get really sweaty when they happen, and my heart kinda… races. It's been going on for a while now, I think. Honestly, it's a bit fuzzy on the details.
DOCTOR: "A bit fuzzy," you say. Alright. Let’s try to clarify. When you say “a while,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… Geez, that’s a tough one. Probably… a few months, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. They don't happen every day, thankfully. More like… a couple times a week, sometimes less. It's just… when they do happen, they're pretty rough. I don't really keep track, I guess.
DOCTOR: A few months, intermittent. And you mentioned sweating and a racing heart with the headaches. Can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Right. The headache… it’s like, a really bad pressure, all over my head, kinda. Not just one spot. And it feels… throbbing, I guess? It makes it hard to think, and bright lights are awful when it’s happening. It usually starts in the morning, but not always. Sometimes it’ll come on in the afternoon. I… honestly, it all kinda blends together after a while. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate, Mr. Lawther. But we need more precision. You describe it as “pressure” and “throbbing.” On a scale of one to ten, with one being barely noticeable and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you assign to these headaches at their peak?
PATIENT: Oh. Right, a scale. Okay… hmm. I’d say… maybe an eight? Yeah, definitely an eight. Sometimes even a nine, if I'm being honest. It's really bad. Makes it hard to do anything. I usually just have to lie down in a dark room.
DOCTOR: An eight to nine… And you say bright lights exacerbate the pain. Have you noticed any other triggers?
PATIENT: Triggers… Not really, no. I mean, I drink coffee sometimes, but I've tried cutting back and it didn't seem to make a difference. I work in a factory, so it's kinda noisy and busy all day. I guess stress could be a factor, but… it's just work, you know? I don’t know if that’s enough to cause something like this. I really can’t think of anything specific that always sets it off.
DOCTOR: "Just work," you say. Mr. Lawther, dismissing potential stressors is not helpful. Now, let's move on. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: Oh. Right, sorry. I didn’t mean to… dismiss it. It’s just… it's a tough job, you know? And I try not to think about it too much. Nausea… sometimes. Not always, but yeah, I’ve felt sick to my stomach a few times when I have a really bad one. I haven't actually thrown up, though. Just… really queasy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Queasy. Very well. Have you noticed any visual disturbances preceding or during these headaches?
PATIENT: Visual… disturbances? Hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes, right before it starts, I get… like, little sparkly bits in my vision. Not all the time, but a few times. It’s kinda hard to explain. Like… seeing stars, almost, even with my eyes closed. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. But yeah, I guess that’s a disturbance.
DOCTOR: Sparkly bits… auras, perhaps. Now, let’s review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… Not that I know of. I mean, I haven't been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. No high blood pressure, no diabetes… I had the flu a couple of years ago, but that's about it. My family… my dad had a bad back, but that’s not really… chronic, is it? I don't really remember any serious illnesses. I've always been pretty healthy, I think. Mostly.
DOCTOR: No significant medical history reported. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Uh, no. No surgeries. Not a one. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but they just put it in a cast. Nothing… surgical. I don't like hospitals, so I avoid them when I can.
DOCTOR: No surgical history. Now, Mr. Lawther, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t really take pills, unless I have a really bad cold, and then just whatever you get at the pharmacy, you know? Like… Dayquil, or something. But that’s it. No prescriptions, no vitamins, nothing regular. I try to stay away from that stuff if I can.
DOCTOR: No current medications reported. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… Not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I'm not allergic to penicillin or anything like that. Sometimes I get a bit itchy when I'm around cats, but that's just a mild allergy, not like… life-threatening or anything. I think I’m pretty allergy-free, honestly. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Lawther, I'm going to perform a brief neurological examination. This will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It's a standard procedure, and it will help me assess the nature of your headaches. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… alright. Sure, yeah. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. And yeah, I'll tell you if anything hurts.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please sit on the examination table and keep your arms relaxed. I will start with your reflexes. Now, just let your leg fall loose. Don't tense up. Good. Now the other leg. Both reflexes are present and equal. Now, I will check your strength. Please squeeze my hands as hard as you can when I ask you to. Squeeze… harder. Good. Now, I’d like you to resist as I try to push your arm down. Again… with the other arm. Finally, I’ll need you to touch your finger to your nose, then to my finger, then repeat.
PATIENT: Okay, here we go. Ow, that's a bit… sensitive. I'm trying, Doctor. I'm not very strong. I’m doing my best… it's kinda hard. There. Is that okay? It feels a bit… clumsy.
DOCTOR: Alright. The reflexes are present bilaterally, though somewhat diminished. Grip strength is weaker than expected for your age and stature, and there is mild incoordination with finger-to-nose testing. Based on your history and this brief examination, I suspect you may be experiencing migraine headaches. However, the diminished reflexes and weakness warrant further investigation to rule out other potential causes. I am going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a CT scan of the head. This will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I will also recommend a neurology consult. A specialist will be able to provide a more thorough evaluation and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
PATIENT: A CT scan…? And a specialist…? Is… is it something serious, Doctor? The migraines… are they really bad? I just thought it was… stress, you know? A specialist sounds… scary. And I don’t have insurance… Will that be expensive?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, it is far too early to definitively diagnose anything. The tests are simply to rule out more serious underlying causes for your symptoms. The CT scan will allow us to visualize your brain and identify any abnormalities. The neurology consult will provide a more specialized assessment. I understand your concerns about the cost. Unfortunately, without insurance, the cost of these tests and the consult will be significant. I will have the billing department contact you to discuss payment options and potential financial assistance programs. The hospital does offer some assistance to those without coverage, but it’s not a guarantee. Ignoring these symptoms is not an option. We need to determine the cause of your headaches and ensure you receive appropriate treatment. The longer we wait, the more potential complications could arise. I will write you a referral to Neurology and the orders for the bloodwork and CT scan. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Financial assistance… okay. That’s… something, I guess. Neurology… Will they… do more tests? Like, even more than this? And what if… what if it is something serious? And… can I still work? If I have all these appointments… I need to keep my job… It’s just… everything is so confusing right now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, I understand you are anxious, but dwelling on hypotheticals is unhelpful. It is possible the neurologist will order additional tests to further refine the diagnosis. This is standard procedure. The specific tests will depend on their assessment of your condition. Regarding your ability to work, that is something you will need to discuss with your employer. I can provide a note outlining your medical appointments and restrictions, if any, after the neurology consult. However, I cannot guarantee your employer will accommodate your needs. I have provided you with the referral and orders for the necessary tests. It is your responsibility to schedule these appointments and follow through with the recommended care. Continuing to work while experiencing debilitating headaches is not advisable, but that is a decision you must make in consultation with your employer. Do you have any specific questions about the tests themselves, or the referral process?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… when can I get the paperwork? And… how long will it take to get the appointments? I just want this to be over… I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Here is your referral to Neurology and the orders for the bloodwork and CT scan. The neurology office is located at . You can reach them at . I recommend calling them immediately to schedule an appointment. The CT scan can be scheduled through the radiology department at . The bloodwork can be done at any Quest Diagnostics lab. As for timing, that will depend on appointment availability. However, I suggest emphasizing the urgency of your situation when you call. I have provided you with all the necessary information. I will follow up with you after you have seen the neurologist to discuss the results. I wish you the best of luck, Mr. Lawther. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any urgent concerns.
