DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Thanks for havin' me. Uh, well, to be honest, I just... wanted to check things out. Never really been to a doctor 'fore, just curious, I guess. Seein' how things work and all. I'm feelin' alright, nothin' hurtin' or nothin'.
DOCTOR: I understand. A check-up is always a good idea, even if you're feeling well. It's good to establish a baseline. Hmm… you said you’ve never been to a doctor before?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Mostly just stayed on the boat, ya know? We had a medic, but it was mostly for accidents. Cuts and scrapes. Never a real check-up like this. It’s… fancy in here.
DOCTOR: Well, this is a bit different than a boat, I imagine. Alright. Just to get a little more information, and don’t worry if you don’t remember everything perfectly, just tell me what you do recall. Have you been feeling any specific symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Like I said, feelin' okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but workin' on a boat does that to ya. Long days. I don't get sick much, if that helps. Mostly just… normal stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. “Normal stuff” is helpful. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. And haven't been really sick. Had the flu once, I think, a long time ago. When I was a kid. But nothin' serious. Mostly just tough it out, ya know? Workin' folk don't have time to be laid up.
DOCTOR: I understand. Toughing it out is common. Alright. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Uh… divorced, like it says on the paper. Mom's still around, but we don't talk much. She's… okay, I guess. Doesn't really do doctors either. Not much family history to talk about, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly fine. We can skip that then. Now, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Nope. Don’t take nothin’. Never needed to. Just water, mostly. And coffee to stay awake on the night shift. That doesn't count as medicine, right?
DOCTOR: Coffee definitely doesn’t count as medicine, though I understand the need for it! Okay. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle... do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been one for any of that. Smokin' makes me cough just thinkin' about it. And alcohol… nah. Makes me feel sick. Never really saw the point, to be honest. Clean livin', I guess. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a general overview of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's kinda why I came, right? To get checked out. Whatever ya need, Doc. Just let me know. I ain't nervous or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. listens with stethoscope Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from talking, or simply your build. Lungs sound clear. Now, let me check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80. A little on the higher side, but we can monitor that. Now, I'll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears look normal. Throat is clear as well. Alright, everything looks alright so far. I'm going to have your weight and height checked, if you don't mind.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Little tight, but I can handle it. Never been weighed before, actually. Always just felt… big enough. I work hard, ya know? Builds ya up.
DOCTOR: Alright, 183 centimeters, 91 kilograms… that puts your BMI at 29.1. That's considered overweight, but not significantly. We can discuss ways to manage that if you're interested. Now, just a few more quick things... I'll check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And lastly, I’ll just take a look at your skin. Skin looks good. No rashes or anything concerning. Okay, everything appears normal. Given your history and the exam, I think a basic blood test would be a good idea just to get a baseline. We can check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. What do you think?
PATIENT: Yeah, a blood test sounds… sensible. If that's what ya recommend, Doc, I trust ya. Never had blood taken before either, but… I can handle it. Just let me know if it's gonna hurt. Is it gonna be a lot?
DOCTOR: It's just a small vial, Demondre, nothing major. There will be a slight pinch, but it’s very quick. The phlebotomist is very skilled. It's more uncomfortable than painful, really. We'll send it off to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend trying to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet, and perhaps getting some regular exercise if your work schedule allows. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the blood test?
PATIENT: Nah, I think ya covered everything. Fruits and veggies… I can try. Work's kinda rough, long hours, but I can sneak 'em in, I guess. So… where do we go for the blood test? And how long does it take? Is it… scary? I’m not good with needles.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 203. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. And I understand your concern about needles. It's perfectly normal to be apprehensive. The phlebotomist is very good at making people comfortable. They can explain the process to you, and they'll be gentle. If you're really worried, you can look away while they do it. They also have techniques to distract you. Would you like me to accompany you to the lab if that would make you feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: Yeah… actually, that would be good. If ya don't mind, Doc. Just… havin' someone there would be a lot better. Thanks. I appreciate that. I guess… let's go then. Room 203, right? Hopefully, it ain’t too bad.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Demondre. Let's go. It will be alright. Room 203 it is. I'll be right there with you. walks with Demondre down the hall towards room 203
