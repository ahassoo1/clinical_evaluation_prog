DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven't been myself lately. It’s… difficult to explain. I just feel… low. Very low. And I understand you’re the person to speak to about things like this. I hope this won't take too long, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: “Low,” alright. We can certainly explore that. It's good you came in. It can take some time to figure these things out, but we'll get there. To start, can you tell me more about what you mean by “not yourself”?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I used to be very active, you see. Ski patrol in the winter, lifeguarding in the summer, even now I try to keep busy. But… the joy isn’t there anymore. Everything feels like… effort. I don’t look forward to things like I used to. I just… exist, mostly. And I sleep a lot more than I should. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. A loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed and increased fatigue… those are important details. And how long has this been going on, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. It wasn't sudden, you see. It sort of… crept up on me. Perhaps… six months, maybe longer? It’s hard to pinpoint, honestly. After the divorce, things weren’t the same, but I thought I was handling it. Now… I’m not so sure.
DOCTOR: Six months or longer… and following a significant life event. Alright. Has this “low” feeling been constant over that time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. There are days… fewer and fewer now, mind you… where I feel almost normal. But then it just… descends again. Like a heavy blanket. It’s worse in the mornings, usually. And… I find myself crying more easily. Small things will set me off. It’s rather embarrassing, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: A fluctuating pattern, worse in the mornings, with increased tearfulness… Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this low mood?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t crave much of anything. And… my concentration isn’t good. I forget things easily. Not… terribly important things, thankfully, but… names, appointments, little details. I used to have a very sharp mind. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite and difficulty with concentration and memory… Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I’ve lost some weight. Not intentionally, of course. My clothes are a bit looser than they used to be. I haven’t weighed myself recently, but I’d say… maybe ten or fifteen pounds. It’s not a dramatic amount, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any physical symptoms – things like headaches, digestive issues, or changes in your sleep pattern besides just sleeping more?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My stomach… it’s been unsettled. Not constant pain, but… queasy, often. And I wake up in the middle of the night, even after a full night’s sleep. I don’t feel rested, even when I’ve been in bed for eight hours. It’s… quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, so we have unsettled stomach and disrupted sleep despite increased sleep duration. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I’ve had regular check-ups with my family doctor over the years, and he always said I was in good condition. I have private insurance, so I’ve always been able to see a doctor when needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Never had a surgery. A broken arm as a child, but it healed on its own. No hospital stays. I always took care of myself, you see. Very active, good diet. I can't imagine needing surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there any history of mental illness – depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder – in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a difficult question. My mother… she was a very quiet woman. She kept to herself a lot. I wouldn’t say she was unhappy, exactly, but she wasn't exactly joyful either. My father was stoic, a very reserved man. I don’t recall them ever discussing… feelings. I don't know if that counts as anything. My sister is doing quite well, as far as I know. She lives in Lagos and rarely speaks of anything personal.
DOCTOR: Alright, so limited information regarding family history of mental illness. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Are you currently married, divorced, widowed?
PATIENT: Divorced, Doctor. It was… amicable, as divorces go. We simply grew apart. It was several years ago now. I haven’t remarried, and I don’t have any children. I live alone, mostly. I have a few friends, but we don’t see each other as often as we used to. Everyone is busy with their own lives, you see.
DOCTOR: Divorced, living alone, limited social contact. Do you use alcohol, tobacco, or any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never. I’ve never had an interest in any of those things. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps, but nothing more. I always believed in taking care of my body, keeping it healthy. Those things would only hinder that, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no substance use. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, thankfully. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’ve always been very fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Derasmo, thank you for providing me with all of that information. It gives me a much clearer picture of what’s been going on. Based on what you've told me – the loss of interest in activities, increased fatigue, changes in appetite and sleep, difficulty concentrating, weight loss, and a sense of general “low” mood – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of major depressive disorder. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes before we arrive at a definitive diagnosis. I'd like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and a complete blood count. We also need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate you being thorough. Blood work is fine. Anything that will help figure this out, I’m agreeable to. I just want to feel like myself again. Do you have the form here? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a small ski patrol meeting next week, I wouldn’t want to miss it if I was feeling better by then.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here's the lab requisition form. It just needs your signature and the date. The lab is just across the parking lot, and they're expecting you. It usually takes about three to five business days to get the results back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. As for your ski patrol meeting, let’s not get ahead of ourselves, but hopefully, we’ll have a better understanding of what’s going on by then. It’s difficult to say if you’ll be feeling better by then, but we’ll do our best. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, or if you have any thoughts of harming yourself, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately, or call 911. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Emergency room or 911 if things worsen. I appreciate you making that clear. Here you are. Three to five business days... I shall try to be patient. Thank you for your time and attention, Doctor Deschane. I do hope this blood work will give us some answers.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Derasmo. Patience is key. I’ll have my nurse schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. .
