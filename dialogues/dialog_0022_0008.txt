DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, yes. Right. It's... my ears. They feel blocked, like something's stuffed in there. Not painful, just… full. I don’t really know why, to be honest. It’s been a bit annoying, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Blocked ears, feeling of fullness, and no pain. That’s good to know. And how long have you been experiencing this feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a good question. A while, I think? Maybe a week or so? It comes and goes, honestly. Sometimes it’s worse than others. I really don't keep track of these things. My wife… she always did that. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It's very common not to keep exact track. A week or so gives us a good starting point. Does anything seem to make it worse – like changes in altitude, chewing, or being around loud noises?
PATIENT: Chewing… no, I don’t think so. Altitude… maybe a little? I haven't been on a plane recently, though. Just… when I’m up high, like walking up a hill. And loud noises… well, it's always a bit worse when things are noisy, isn't it? But nothing specific that I've noticed. Honestly, it just… is.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it seems to be somewhat influenced by altitude, and generally aggravated by louder environments. Have you noticed any hearing loss, ringing in your ears, or dizziness along with the fullness?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… no, not that I’ve noticed. Though… my wife used to say I never listened properly anyway. Ringing… sometimes, maybe? A very faint ringing, but I put that down to getting older. And dizziness… no, not really. Just… a bit off balance sometimes, but that’s just my knees, I think. They've never been great.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No significant hearing loss or dizziness. Just occasional faint ringing and some balance issues you attribute to your knees. Now, have you had any recent colds, sinus infections, or allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… not really. A bit sniffly sometimes in the spring, but nothing major. A cold… hmm. I think I had a bit of a sniffle a couple of weeks ago, but it didn’t last long. Just a normal little cold. Nothing like the flu, thankfully. I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Medications. Let me think. Just a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor prescribed it a few years back. Can't remember the name, sorry. And no, no allergies that I know of. My wife always kept track of all that, but… well.
DOCTOR: Okay, so medication for blood pressure, and no known drug allergies. I understand it can be difficult to remember these things. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever had any ear infections, ear surgery, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ear infections… as a child, maybe? A long time ago. Nothing since, I don’t think. No surgery, definitely not on my ears. And… significant medical conditions… just the blood pressure, really. And my knees, of course. They’ve always been troublesome. Honestly, I've been pretty lucky, health-wise. Relatively.
DOCTOR: Alright, so childhood ear infections, blood pressure, and troublesome knees. And are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother had… something with her heart, I think? A long time ago. And my father… he had diabetes, I believe. But that was a long time ago too. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to family medical history. It’s all a bit… blurry. My wife was the one who knew all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. So, potential heart issues in your mother, and diabetes in your father. Now, just a couple more questions, and then I’d like to take a quick look in your ears. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Tried it once as a young man, didn’t like it. Alcohol… a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that’s all. And recreational drugs? Good heavens, no. Never been interested. I lead a quiet life, Doctor. A very quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Non-smoker, occasional wine, and no drug use. Thank you for being so open. Now, if you don’t mind, I'd like to take a quick look in your ears with an otoscope. It won’t be uncomfortable, just let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Right, yes. Fine. Go ahead. Don’t think it will bother me. Just… try to be quick, if you wouldn't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m looking at the eardrum now… Hmm. It appears slightly dull and there's a bit of cerumen – earwax – present. Similar findings on this side – dull eardrum, some cerumen buildup. No signs of acute infection, but the wax is obscuring my view a bit. It looks like you have some earwax buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to the feeling of fullness. The eardrums themselves don’t appear to be inflamed, which is good. It’s likely that removing the wax will improve your symptoms. Would you be comfortable with me attempting to remove the wax?
PATIENT: Wax, you say? Well, that makes sense, I suppose. I haven’t really thought about it. Yes, go ahead and remove it, if you think that’s best. The sooner the better, really. This fullness is rather annoying. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will be as gentle as possible. We’ll use a gentle irrigation technique to remove the wax. I’ll warm up the water first to make it more comfortable. I’m going to use a bulb syringe with warm water to gently flush out the wax. It may feel a little strange, a bit of a bubbling sensation, but it shouldn’t be painful. Let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort. We’ll start with your right ear. I’m going to gently pull your ear up and back to straighten the ear canal. Here we go… Hmm… some wax is coming out. I’ll repeat this a few times. Okay, that seems to have loosened a good amount of wax. Now let’s switch to the left ear. Alright. That looks much better. The eardrums are now much clearer, and the ear canals are significantly less obstructed. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It feels… lighter, definitely. Less blocked. Like there’s less pressure. It’s not completely gone, but it’s much, much better. Thank you, Doctor. I can actually hear you more clearly now, I think. It was rather muffled before. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… will it stay like this?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear! It sounds like removing the wax has significantly improved your symptoms. It's common to experience some slight residual fullness after wax removal, but that should resolve on its own within the next few days. To prevent wax buildup in the future, I recommend avoiding using cotton swabs in your ears, as they can actually push the wax further in. You can use over-the-counter earwax softening drops once or twice a month if you feel like wax is accumulating again. I’ll give you a written summary of our visit with these instructions. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No cotton swabs, right. Good to know. I think my wife told me that once, but… well. Yes, a written summary would be very helpful. I tend to forget these things. No, I don’t think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for your help. You’ve been very patient with me. I think that will be all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I'm glad I could help. And don’t worry about forgetting – that's perfectly normal. I’ll have the nurse print out that summary for you now. Here’s a work note excusing you from strenuous activity for the rest of the day, just in case you feel a little off balance. And feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Guerrerolopez.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
