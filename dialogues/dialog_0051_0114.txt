DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Glazewski. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because...well, it’s my breathing. It gets difficult when I try to lie flat. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked. I don’t like to bother people, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's always best to get these things checked out, and you’re not bothering anyone at all. So, the difficulty breathing specifically when you lie flat...can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a terrible struggle, Doctor. It just...feels like something is pressing on my chest. Makes it harder to get a good breath. It doesn’t happen every time I lie down, but more often than not, it does. It's worse at night, I believe. I usually end up propping myself up with pillows to make it easier. And it’s been getting…gradually worse, maybe over the last three months or so. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Vanderwiele. So, it’s a feeling of pressure in your chest, worse when lying down, especially at night, and progressively worsening over the last three months. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I have been a bit more tired lately, but I attribute that to my age, you understand. And…well, my ankles do swell up some at the end of the day. Not terribly, but noticeable. I hadn't connected it to the breathing, though. Would that be…related, do you think?
DOCTOR: It could be related, Ms. Vanderwiele. Fatigue and ankle swelling can sometimes occur with heart and lung issues. To get a better understanding, let me ask a few more questions. Have you experienced any coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath when you are upright?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. When I’m sitting or standing, I don’t have any trouble. I might get a little winded walking up a hill, but that’s to be expected. It’s truly when I’m lying down that it bothers me. No coughing or wheezing at all. And no chest pain, thankfully. Just the…pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No chest pain, no coughing or wheezing, just pressure when lying flat. Now, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I had high blood pressure for a time, many years ago. But it was controlled with medication, and the doctor took me off it about ten years back. Said it had come down on its own. Other than that…no, nothing serious. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you understand. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, but that wasn't related to this, surely.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that resolved, and gallbladder removal. And you haven't been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That's all I can recall. I used to see Dr. Abernathy, but he retired several years ago. I haven’t had much need for doctors since then, thankfully. I try to stay active, you see. Mostly gardening and a bit of walking. Is there anything else you need to know? I would like to finish up, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Vanderwiele. Just a few more questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Has anyone in your family had problems with their heart or lungs?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother…she had some breathing trouble towards the end of her life, but I don't recall exactly what it was. Something to do with her lungs, I think. She was a smoker, you see, for many years. And my father…he had a weak heart, I believe. He passed away quite suddenly when I was young. But beyond that…not that I am aware of. My brother is still living, but we don't speak much these days. I wouldn't know his medical history if you paid me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mother with lung issues and a father with heart problems. And you don’t know about your brother’s health. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single one. I prefer to avoid them if I can, you see. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if possible. I might take an aspirin now and again for a headache, but that's it. And nothing regularly. Truly nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele. No medications at all. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Let’s get it done. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. It will be easiest if you breathe normally, and try to relax. I’m hearing some mild crackles in your lower lungs, and your heart sounds a bit…distant. Not alarming, but worth noting. I'd also like to check your legs for swelling, if that's alright.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Check away, Doctor. I don't mind at all. I did mention the swelling, didn’t I? It’s not terrible, but it’s there at the end of the day. Anything else you need to poke and prod at, just let me know. I just want to get this sorted out so I can get back to my garden.
DOCTOR: You did mention the swelling, yes. Alright, I'm feeling some mild swelling in both of your ankles, as you mentioned. Given your symptoms – the difficulty breathing when lying flat, the fatigue, the swelling, and what I'm hearing in your lungs – it sounds like you may be experiencing some fluid retention, which could be related to heart failure. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further. I'd like to order a few tests: a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, an electrocardiogram to check your heart rhythm, and some blood work, including a BNP level, which can help us assess whether your heart is stressed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Heart failure? That sounds…serious, Doctor. I thought it was just getting old! Tests…well, I suppose if you think they’re necessary. But I don't like the sound of it at all. What exactly will these tests involve? And how long will I have to wait for the results? I have a garden to tend, you know!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Vanderwiele. It is concerning to hear that possibility, and it's completely natural to feel anxious. But please don’t jump to conclusions. "Heart failure" simply means that your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should, and it can be caused by many things, some of which are very treatable. The tests will help us determine the cause and the best course of action. The chest X-ray is a quick, painless procedure – you'll just stand or sit in front of a machine, and it takes a few seconds. The EKG involves placing some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart's electrical activity – it’s also painless, and takes about five minutes. And the blood work will involve a simple blood draw. As for the results, we should have them back within a few days, usually 2-3 business days. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your salt intake and avoiding strenuous activity. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Limiting salt…well, I can try. I do like a good salted tomato, but I suppose I can forgo that for a bit. And no strenuous activity…that’s not a problem, thankfully. I mostly potter around in the garden. Two to three days…that seems like an eternity! But alright, I suppose I have no choice. Will someone call me to schedule the tests, or should I call the office? And do I need to prepare in any way for them? I don’t want to be a bother, you see.
DOCTOR: You won’t be a bother at all, Ms. Vanderwiele. Our scheduling department will call you within the next 24 hours to set up the appointments. You shouldn’t need to do any special preparation for the chest X-ray or EKG. For the blood work, it’s best to be in a fasting state – meaning you shouldn’t eat or drink anything for 8-12 hours beforehand. I’ll also have the nurse give you a written summary of these instructions before you leave today. And if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Now, before you go, are you experiencing any chest pain right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No chest pain at all. Just the…unease, you understand. I suppose I'm just worried about what the tests might reveal. I think that’s all my questions, for now. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And thank you for writing down the instructions - my memory isn’t what it used to be! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I'll go home and try to relax.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Vanderwiele. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I want to assure you, we will get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns before your appointments. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I shall try to remain calm. Good day.
