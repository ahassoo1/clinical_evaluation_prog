DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, it’s a little… complicated. I'm here for clearance before a surgery, a cosmetic one. Though, truthfully, I don’t recall all the details about why I decided to have it done. It was… a while ago, I believe.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. Sometimes these things get planned quite a ways in advance. And it’s not uncommon to feel a little unsure about the specifics of the initial decision-making process. So, to clarify, you're seeking medical clearance for an elective cosmetic surgery. Do you recall what type of surgery it is?
PATIENT: I truly wish I did. It feels… like it involved my face, perhaps? Or maybe my neck? It’s so frustrating. My husband… he handled most of the arrangements, and… well, he’s passed away now. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It's like trying to remember a dream.
DOCTOR: Please don't apologize at all, Mackenzi. You’ve experienced a significant loss, and it's perfectly understandable that details might be difficult to recall right now. We can certainly work through this. To help me understand your overall health and ensure you're a suitable candidate for surgery – whatever it may be – let’s start with a general medical history. Perhaps as we talk, something will jog your memory. First, can you tell me about any significant past medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions… hmm. I… I believe I had some trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago? It wasn’t terribly serious, I don't think. Just… a little high sometimes. It was managed with medication for a while, then… I think my husband said it went down on its own. And… I've always been prone to allergies. Mostly seasonal, pollen and things. But nothing life-threatening. Is that helpful, Doctor? It feels like grasping at straws.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mackenzi. High blood pressure, even if it seems to have resolved, is important information, and seasonal allergies are good to know as well. Do you currently take any medication for your blood pressure, or for your allergies?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, I don’t think so. I haven’t been taking anything regularly. Not recently, anyway. I may have used allergy pills during the spring, but… honestly, I can’t be certain. My husband usually handled all of that. He kept everything so organized. It’s a blur now. I apologize again for being so…unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You aren’t being unhelpful at all, Mackenzi. It's very common for patients to have difficulty recalling medication lists, especially after a loss. We’ll do our best to piece everything together. Now, let’s talk about allergies specifically. Besides pollen, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I've always been quite lucky in that regard, thankfully. No known drug allergies, no food sensitivities that I’m aware of… I used to enjoy quite spicy food, actually, and never had a reaction. I… I really can’t think of anything. Is that… good? Is that helpful, at least?
DOCTOR: That is good, Mackenzi. Knowing you don’t have any known allergies is definitely helpful. Now, can you tell me about any past surgical procedures you’ve had?
PATIENT: Past surgeries… Hmm. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, of course. That’s… fairly standard, I suppose. And… I broke my arm when I was a child, and had a cast. But… beyond that? No, I don’t believe so. Nothing major. Nothing that required a long recovery. I'm… fairly certain. It's hard to be sure. I really wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: You're doing wonderfully, Mackenzi. It's perfectly alright that you don’t remember every detail. Wisdom teeth removal and a childhood arm fracture are good to know. Now, I’d like to ask about your family medical history. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any other chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. My mother passed away when I was quite young. And I wasn’t very close to my father. He… I believe he had some problems with his heart later in life. High blood pressure, maybe? But I wasn’t involved in his care, so I don’t have many details. My grandmother on my mother’s side… she lived a long life, thankfully. I don't recall any specific illnesses, but she was… quite frail towards the end. I wish I could offer more information, Doctor. It feels like… fragments of memories.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mackenzi. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete, especially given the circumstances you’ve described. Knowing about your father’s heart problems and high blood pressure is helpful. Now, just a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve always been quite careful about my health. My husband… he didn’t smoke either. We both preferred a quiet life, fresh air… things like that. No, I’ve never smoked a day in my life.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. Very rarely. Just… a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Nothing excessive. I wouldn’t say I drink regularly, not at all. More of a… social thing, when we’d go out with friends. It's been a while since I've had a drink, honestly. Since… everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Regular? Not anymore, Doctor. I used to enjoy gardening with my husband, that was quite active, I suppose. But… since he’s passed, I haven’t really had the motivation. I do a bit of walking, short strolls around the neighborhood, but that's about it. It's… difficult to find the energy, truthfully. I’m afraid I’m not very athletic these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so honest, Mackenzi. It’s important for me to have a complete picture of your health. Alright, we've covered a lot of ground. To help me clarify the situation regarding your upcoming surgery, and to make sure you're a good candidate, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it will help. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best. I just want to make sure everything is… as safe as possible. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit on the examination table, we’ll start with your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, temperature and respiration rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, take a look at your throat, and briefly examine your abdomen. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but within an acceptable range. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat appears clear, no signs of infection. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure warrants further investigation. We should repeat this check on a different day to see if it remains consistently high. Would you be able to come back next week for a follow-up?
PATIENT: Next week… yes, that should be alright. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. The blood pressure… I suppose it doesn’t surprise me. I haven’t been very good about taking care of myself lately. But… what does it mean for the surgery? Is it… a problem? Will it prevent me from having it done?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily a problem, Mackenzi, but it does require us to be cautious. Elevated blood pressure can increase the risks associated with any surgery, so we need to ensure it’s well-controlled before proceeding. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some routine blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel – to check your overall health and kidney function. We will also get an EKG to ensure there are no heart abnormalities. We also need to find out what surgery you’re scheduled for, if you remember. If you have any paperwork or notes from the surgeon, that would be incredibly helpful. Knowing the specifics of the procedure will allow me to assess the potential risks more accurately and collaborate with your surgeon to develop a safe plan. Do you have any questions about the blood work or the EKG?
PATIENT: Blood work… an EKG… Yes, that sounds… thorough. I'm afraid I don’t have any paperwork, Doctor. As I mentioned, my husband handled all of that. I… I’ve looked everywhere for something, anything, but I haven’t found a single document. It’s incredibly frustrating. Will that… Will that be a problem? Not knowing what surgery it is? Is there anything else I can do?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mackenzi. We can work through this even without the paperwork. It’s not uncommon for patients to have gaps in their medical history. We will simply proceed with extra caution. In this case, perhaps a consultation with a surgeon might be helpful. They could review your medical records and provide more details about the planned procedure. If you can recall the surgeon’s name or the hospital where the surgery is scheduled, that would be a great starting point. I'm also going to order a stress test to rule out any underlying cardiac issues, given the slight elevation in your blood pressure. Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No chest pain, no shortness of breath… and no palpitations. I… I haven't experienced anything like that. The surgeon… I vaguely remember a name, Dr. Alvarez, maybe? But I’m not certain. And the hospital… it was a larger one, closer to the city, but I couldn't tell you the exact name. Everything is such a blur. I feel terribly helpless. I just want to get this done… to move on with my life. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's not too much to ask at all, Mackenzi. And you aren’t helpless. You're doing a wonderful job providing the information you can recall. We will do everything we can to ensure your safety and help you achieve your goals. I will contact Dr. Alvarez’s office and request your medical records. In the meantime, let’s schedule the blood work and EKG. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. I will also send a referral for a cardiology consultation, just to be thorough. Do you have any immediate concerns or questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think you've covered everything. I appreciate your patience and kindness. It’s a relief to finally be taking some steps forward, even if it’s a bit overwhelming. I suppose I should schedule those tests then? Whatever you think is best. Thank you again, Doctor Reisig. I truly do appreciate your help. I’m ready to do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: Excellent. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to schedule the blood work and EKG. She’ll also provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for each test. In the meantime, if you experience any changes in your health – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or severe headaches – please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. I will be in touch once I receive the results from Dr. Alvarez’s office. Remember, Mackenzi, we’re in this together. We'll navigate this process step-by-step, ensuring your safety and well-being are our top priorities. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that's everything. Thank you again for everything. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll see you soon, then. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll be in touch soon. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again.
