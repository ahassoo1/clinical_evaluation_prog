DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. My name is Dr. Hembrey. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Can you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Uh... good morning. Yes, consultation. I need... to go somewhere. Far away. My wife... she wanted to go. Now I go for her. It's... important. I think I need... shots? For travel? I don’t really remember what the lady on the phone said. Too much talking, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re seeking travel vaccinations. And you’re traveling on behalf of your wife?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. For her. She... She planned it all. Beautiful place. I just... need to make sure I don’t get sick. She wouldn’t want that. What place… I forget the name. Somewhere warm. Lots of… trees? It was a long flight. Definitely a long flight. Was it Africa? Maybe Africa.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, "somewhere warm with lots of trees" doesn’t narrow it down significantly, unfortunately. Africa is a large continent, and vaccination requirements vary greatly depending on the specific country. Do you have any documentation regarding your travel plans?
PATIENT: Documentation? Like… a paper? She had all the papers. Bookings, everything. I... I think they are at home. With... her things. I didn't really look at them. She did all the planning. I just… pack. Maybe the travel place has it? The one that sold the tickets? I don't know. I just need to be safe, you know? Not get sick.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re relying on your wife’s arrangements. It’s…suboptimal to proceed without knowing where you’re traveling. Without that information, I cannot responsibly advise you on necessary vaccinations. Do you recall the airline you used?
PATIENT: Airline...? Hmm... Big plane. Blue... maybe? Or was it red? It had…windows. Lots of them. Everyone was very nice. It's all a blur, really. I don’t pay attention to details. She always booked everything. I just… showed up. Is it important? Can’t you just give me… everything? All the shots? Just to be safe?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, with all due respect, “everything” is not a safe or responsible approach to vaccinations. Each vaccine carries potential side effects, and administering unnecessary ones is not in your best interest. More importantly, some destinations require specific vaccines, and without knowing your destination, I cannot ensure you are adequately protected. Do you have any idea when this trip is scheduled for?
PATIENT: Well! I just want to be careful! I'm trying to do what my wife would have wanted. You're making me feel like I’m stupid because I don't remember details! She always took care of everything... When...? Soon. Very soon. Next week, maybe? Or the week after? I took time off work. The boss... he was understanding. It's all very confusing. I just want to go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I am not attempting to make you feel unintelligent. I am a physician, and my priority is to ensure you receive appropriate medical care. Proceeding without knowing your destination and timeframe is simply not safe, and frankly, quite frustrating. Do you have a contact number for the travel agency that booked your tickets?
PATIENT: Travel agency… hmm. I think… maybe a small shop? Downtown. Near the market? I don’t remember the name. Everything looks the same downtown. Old man… maybe? He had a beard. I don't have a number. My wife always called them. Can’t you just… check? Surely there's a computer somewhere? You're a doctor, you have computers! Find out where I'm going, and then give me the shots. Please?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your anxiety, but I cannot simply “find out where you’re going” without any identifying information. That would be a breach of privacy, and frankly, an impossible task. I can attempt to locate the travel agency, but without a name or address, it will be extremely difficult and time-consuming. Before I proceed further, I need to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you experienced any recent illnesses, fever, or unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: Fine. Ask your questions. I don't get sick much. I work. I sleep. Maybe a little cough last month? Nothing serious. Just dust from the factory. A little tired sometimes. Everyone is tired. Nothing else. I feel…okay. Mostly. I miss my wife. Does that count as a symptom?
DOCTOR: While grief is certainly taxing on the body, I'm referring to physical symptoms. A cough, even if mild, warrants further inquiry. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies...? Hmm. No. Not that I know of. She always gave me the medicine. I never asked. I just... took it. Never had any problems. Never had to. Unless... one time, a rash? But that was years ago. Maybe from the laundry soap? I don't remember. It didn't last long. Just a little itchy. Not important.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Tayar. Even a mild reaction is relevant. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medicine…? No. No medicine. Just… vitamins. She gave them to me every morning. Said they were good for… energy. Small, yellow pills. I think. Maybe orange? I don't know what they were. I just took them with my breakfast. She bought them at the… market. Near the travel agency. Everything is near the travel agency. Is this important too?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, everything you tell me is potentially important. However, it's difficult to ascertain what vitamins you were taking without knowing the specific product or ingredients. Before I can advise you on travel vaccinations, I strongly recommend you contact the travel agency and obtain documentation regarding your travel itinerary. If that proves impossible, I suggest you postpone your trip until you can obtain this information. Traveling without knowing your destination and potential health risks is simply not advisable. We can discuss a referral to a travel medicine specialist if you're able to locate the necessary information.
PATIENT: Postpone...? She would be so disappointed... I just wanted to honor her memory. Now I can't even do that right. I’ll… I’ll try to find the travel agency. But I don't know where to start. Thank you, Doctor. For trying. I think I should go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your distress. It’s admirable that you wish to honor your wife's memory. However, your health and safety are paramount. I will provide you with a list of travel agencies in the area, as well as resources for obtaining travel health information. Please, do not hesitate to contact my office if you require further assistance. Take care. And please, prioritize your well-being. .
