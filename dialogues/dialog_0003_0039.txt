DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bohnett. I am Dr. Yackey. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s try to be concise, shall we?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. That’s a fine name, Yackey. Sounds… sturdy. Yes, concise is good. My memory's usually pretty sharp, but sometimes things… slip. Though, I remember exactly when I met my wife, Edith – August 12th, 1957. Beautiful day it was. But, uh, what exactly are we talking about today? Something about cholesterol, you said?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bohnett, your primary care physician flagged an elevated cholesterol level on your recent bloodwork. We're here to discuss that, and determine if any intervention is necessary. Now, to be clear, when did you last have bloodwork done?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Edith always handled these things. She was very organized. It was… hmm… I believe it was just last month, maybe the middle of July. Dr. Olson, down at the community clinic, did it. Yes, that’s right, Dr. Olson. A very nice young woman. She said something about a check-up. Is “elevated cholesterol” bad? I don’t really understand all these medical words.
DOCTOR: July. Alright. Elevated cholesterol can be problematic, Mr. Bohnett. Essentially, it builds up in your arteries, making it harder for blood to flow. We need to ascertain the specifics of those levels before we jump to any conclusions. Do you happen to recall any specific numbers she mentioned?
PATIENT: Numbers? Oh, dear. No, I don’t think so. She just said it was a little high. She mentioned something about good and bad cholesterol, but the numbers… they all blurred together. I was more worried about my arthritis acting up that day, to be honest. My knees were killing me. She did say it wasn’t terribly high, though. Not an emergency, she made that clear. Do you have a way of showing me these numbers? Maybe a chart or something? It’s easier for me to see things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I have access to Dr. Olson’s notes here. Let's see… Ah, yes. Your total cholesterol is 245, your LDL—that's the "bad" cholesterol—is 160, your HDL—the "good" cholesterol—is 45, and your triglycerides are 180. Now, these are somewhat elevated, particularly the LDL. Do you have any family history of heart disease, Mr. Bohnett?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, all those numbers again! My head's spinning a little. Heart disease… Edith’s father, he had a touch of it. He smoked like a chimney, though. And her grandmother, on her mother’s side, she had chest pains a lot. But mostly it was just old age, I think. They both lived to be quite old, actually. Eighty-something, both of them. I’ve always been pretty active, myself. Used to work on a farm, you see. Lots of lifting and walking. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Activity is beneficial, yes. However, genetics also play a role. An LDL of 160 is above the recommended level for someone of your age, and with a family history, we need to be proactive. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… Just something for my arthritis. A little pill, blue one. Naproxen, I think it’s called. And sometimes, when my knees are really bad, the doctor gives me a stronger one, but just for a short while. That’s all. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. They never seem to do much good anyway, and Edith always said they upset your stomach. Besides the arthritis medicine, I don't take anything regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other medications. Now, Mr. Bohnett, given your cholesterol levels and your arthritis, I recommend we start with lifestyle modifications. Primarily, dietary changes. Reduced saturated fats, more fiber… standard recommendations. We can discuss that in more detail. I also suggest a walking regimen, if your knees permit. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to recheck your levels. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… Yes, I suppose that makes sense. Edith was always a good cook, but she did like butter. And bacon. I can cut back on the bacon, I suppose. Walking… if my knees cooperate. It’s been a bit rough lately. Three months… yes, that sounds alright. But could we maybe talk a little more about what I should be eating? I’m not very good at remembering all those fancy food names. And what does “saturated fats” even mean? I just want to make sure I’m doing it right. I don’t want to bother you again soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. "Saturated fats" are found in things like red meat, full-fat dairy, butter, and fried foods. We want to limit those. Focus on lean proteins like fish and chicken, plenty of fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. Think oatmeal, brown rice, whole-wheat bread. Avoid processed foods as much as possible. I have a pamphlet here with a sample diet plan. It’s rather basic, but it should give you a starting point. Do you have any questions specifically about these dietary recommendations at this moment?
PATIENT: Oh, that's kind of you to give me a pamphlet. Oatmeal… that I can handle. Edith always made a good oatmeal. Brown rice… I think I’ve had that before. Fish… I used to enjoy salmon. But what about eggs? I like a fried egg for breakfast sometimes. Are eggs bad? And what do you mean by “processed foods”? Everything seems processed these days. Is canned soup processed? This is all a bit overwhelming, honestly. My head’s spinning again.
DOCTOR: Eggs are acceptable in moderation, Mr. Bohnett. Perhaps two to three times a week. "Processed foods" refers to items with a long list of ingredients, often containing high amounts of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. Yes, canned soup generally falls into that category. We won't get bogged down in the minutiae of every food item. Focus on fresh, whole foods as much as possible. I’m afraid my time is limited. Do you have any urgent questions, or shall we schedule that follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, no, I suppose not. It just seems like… a lot to remember. And I don’t want to do anything wrong. Three months, then? Yes. That sounds… alright. I suppose I can manage for three months. Just… try to eat less bacon and more oatmeal. And avoid the canned soup. Is that right? .
DOCTOR: Precisely. That’s a reasonable starting point. I've scheduled a follow-up appointment for November 2nd. The nurse will remind you. Thank you for your time, Mr. Bohnett. .
