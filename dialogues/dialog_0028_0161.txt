DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Trefren, so you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but a friend suggested I come in. She said I should look into something to… help prevent things, you know? With, um, HIV. I don’t even really know where to start, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Preventative measures… right. And this is due to a specific concern, or just general… awareness?
PATIENT: No, no specific… incident. It’s just… things are different now than when I was younger. I’ve been… dating a little. And my friend, Layla, she just really stressed that it's good to be careful. She said there’s a pill you can take before anything happens. Is that what I’m talking about? It all feels a bit… new to me.
DOCTOR: So, Layla suggested PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is a good option to discuss, certainly. Before we go further, Ms. Trefren, let's get a clearer picture of your overall health. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… a while. Probably about five years ago? Maybe a little longer. It was with Dr. El-Amin, back in… oh, what was the town? Nevermind. It doesn’t matter. It was a while ago. I haven't really needed to go since then, thankfully. Everything’s usually been alright. Is that a problem? I mean, for this pill… do I need to be all checked up first?
DOCTOR: Five years is… less than ideal, yes. We'll need some updated blood work, and I'd like to do a basic physical. It’s standard procedure. It's not about assuming anything is wrong, it's about establishing a baseline and ensuring you're a good candidate for PrEP. It’s important to rule out any existing infections before starting. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me see. I used to be allergic to penicillin, but that was when I was a kid. I haven't had a reaction to anything in… decades, I think. Honestly, I can't even remember the last time I took anything stronger than ibuprofen. Does that count? And, um… I get a little itchy with wool sometimes, but I don't think that's what you mean. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. And no current medications, aside from occasional ibuprofen. Alright. We'll proceed with the blood work and physical exam. Just to clarify, Ms. Trefren, has there been any recent change in your sexual activity that prompted this concern, or is this purely a preventative measure based on Layla's advice?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like it’s new new. I’ve always… dated. But, yeah, I’ve been seeing someone a bit more regularly lately. Maybe the last couple of months? It’s… casual. And I guess I’m just being more careful now that I’m… older. It's probably Layla and that. She’s a very sensible woman. I just… don’t want to take any chances. It’s a little scary, you know? Everything changing.
DOCTOR: Recent change in sexual activity, casual dating. Understandable. Alright, Ms. Trefren. Let's get started with the physical exam. Please step onto the scale for me.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Don't mind the clothes, I suppose. I’m not exactly dressed for a doctor’s appointment. Though, what difference does it make? It’s just a number, right?
DOCTOR: 214 pounds. And your height is recorded as 192 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Tall, I know. Runs in the family. My mother was practically a giant. It's hard finding clothes, honestly. But... what does that number mean? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's… above the average range, Ms. Trefren. It’s not necessarily bad, but it does contribute to overall health risk. We’ll discuss it further after the exam and blood work. Now, please have a seat on the exam table. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. Is there anything I should be doing? Like… breathing a certain way? I never really do this… unless something's wrong, and then I'm usually panicking too much to remember instructions.
DOCTOR: Just breathe normally, Ms. Trefren. Deep, regular breaths are fine. Lungs sound clear. Heart rate is… elevated, but not significantly. Any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Sometimes a little… bloating, maybe, after I eat. But nothing serious. I think it's just… getting older, you know? Everything slows down. Are you finding anything… wrong? You're making me nervous now.
DOCTOR: Abdomen soft, no tenderness. Bloating noted. Ms. Trefren, I’m not finding anything acutely concerning at this stage, but it's crucial to have a complete picture. We’ll need to run some blood tests to assess your overall health, including screening for any sexually transmitted infections and a general metabolic panel. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… the pill. Is it… safe? Are there a lot of side effects? That's what I'm mostly worried about. I've heard things… things about medicines. And… will this be expensive? I’m on Medicare, but I don't know what it covers. .
DOCTOR: PrEP is generally very safe, Ms. Trefren, when taken as prescribed and monitored by a physician. The most common side effects are mild – nausea, headache, fatigue. We’ll discuss managing those if they occur. As for cost… with Medicare, coverage should be available, but there may be co-pays or deductibles. We’ll have the billing department look into your specific plan once we determine PrEP is appropriate for you. Now, let's get those blood tests ordered. I'll have my nurse draw them now.
