DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It's lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some…pressure in my bladder, and it’s been concerning me. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. Bladder pressure can be quite bothersome, certainly. “A little while” is rather vague, I’m afraid. Could you perhaps give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Of course. Let me think… it started, I believe, in late June. So, about five or six weeks now. It's not constant, but it happens several times a day, and it’s… noticeable. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… a feeling of fullness, even after I’ve just gone to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Alright, five or six weeks, starting in late June. And it's a feeling of fullness even after voiding. Is it associated with any urgency – a sudden, strong need to go?
PATIENT: Yes, actually, that's a good way to put it. Sometimes there is a sudden need to go, even if I don’t feel like I need to, if that makes sense. It’s… unsettling. And sometimes, when I try to go, it takes a moment for anything to come out. It isn't a forceful stream, either. It’s more… hesitant.
DOCTOR: Hesitant… I see. And is this happening with every void, or just some?
PATIENT: It’s not every time, Doctor. I would say maybe… three out of five times? The other times it feels perfectly normal. And it doesn’t seem to be related to how much water I drink, or what I’m eating. It’s just… random, really. I haven’t noticed a pattern.
DOCTOR: Random, you say. Alright. And are you experiencing any pain or burning sensation while you urinate, or afterwards?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, there's no pain or burning. That's one thing I'm relieved about. It's purely this pressure and the occasional hesitancy. Sometimes, just a little discomfort, like a slight ache low in my abdomen, but it goes away quickly. It’s not severe, and it doesn’t happen with every episode of pressure.
DOCTOR: No pain or burning, just pressure and occasional hesitancy, with minor, transient abdominal discomfort. Do you have any fever, chills, or nausea accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. No fever, no chills, and definitely no nausea. I feel perfectly well otherwise. It's really just this bladder issue that’s bothering me. I’ve been a little tired lately, but I attribute that to work. I’m a graphic designer, and we’ve had a particularly busy month.
DOCTOR: Busy month… I understand. Alright. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, let me ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about seven years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I also had a bout of pneumonia when I was in my early twenties, but I recovered fully. Otherwise, I've been generally healthy. I do take a daily multivitamin, and I try to eat a balanced diet. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, well-controlled – good. Pneumonia in your twenties, that’s helpful to know. And a daily multivitamin. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication and the multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's it. Just the medication for my blood pressure, which is Lisinopril, and the multivitamin. I don’t take anything over-the-counter regularly, unless I have a headache, and then I'll take ibuprofen. But that’s very infrequent. I should also mention, I had a Cesarean section when I gave birth to my son fifteen years ago. I don’t have any issues related to that now, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Cesarean section fifteen years ago, good to note. And no allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, and I haven't had any adverse reactions to medications in the past. My husband always double-checks when I take something new, just to be safe, but I’ve never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, I want to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me think… On my mother’s side, my grandmother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my uncle, her son, also developed it later in life. My father’s side… he had heart disease, but he smoked for many years, so that’s probably a contributing factor. No history of bladder or kidney problems that I’m aware of, on either side of the family. Is there anything specific you're looking for in relation to my symptoms?
DOCTOR: Diabetes, heart disease… good to know. No bladder or kidney problems. Alright. Now, may I ask about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am married, as you know, and we’ve been together for seventeen years. I work full-time, as I mentioned, as a graphic designer. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I used to exercise more regularly, but work has been demanding, and it’s been difficult to find the time lately. I do try to eat a healthy diet, but I confess it’s not always easy with a busy schedule.
DOCTOR: That's helpful. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a quick neurological assessment. After that, I'd like to perform a urine test to rule out any infection. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I understand. I'm happy to proceed with the examination and the urine test. Please, let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Just relax, and I’ll explain everything as I go. Let's begin by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Now, I'm listening for any unusual sounds… Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I will just gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing particularly tender. It feels… normal, I suppose. A little pressure when you press, but not pain. I occasionally feel a slight ache in the lower abdomen, but it’s not present right now. Everything feels as it should, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now I will just quickly assess your reflexes in your lower extremities. Everything seems normal there as well. Now, would you please excuse me for a moment while I prepare a sample cup for your urine test?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, take your time. I’ll just sit here quietly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marialena. When you’re ready, I'll step outside to give you some privacy for the urine sample. Just collect a mid-stream sample, if you could, and I’ll be right back. Just leave the cup on the counter when you're done.
PATIENT: Okay, I’ve collected a mid-stream sample. I'm ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marialena. I’ll just send this sample to the lab for analysis. It should be back within a few hours. While we wait, I’d like to discuss potential causes for your symptoms. Given your age and medical history, and the absence of fever or burning sensation, a urinary tract infection is less likely. However, we can’t rule it out entirely until we have the lab results. Other possibilities include an overactive bladder, bladder stones, or even interstitial cystitis. It's also possible it could be related to your Cesarean section, though it's been fifteen years. Do any of those possibilities sound more likely to you, based on your experience?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot to take in, Doctor. Based on what you’ve said, an overactive bladder sounds… plausible, I suppose. The hesitancy, and the sudden urges… that fits. I haven’t noticed any pain, thankfully, so bladder stones seem less likely. And I hadn’t considered my Cesarean section – it’s been so long, I didn't think it could be related. But if there’s any internal pressure, that’s conceivable, I suppose. I really don’t know. It’s all very confusing. I’m just relieved we’re trying to figure it out.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, and it’s good you are relieved we are investigating. Until we have the lab results, it’s difficult to say for certain. I would like to order a complete blood count to assess your overall health, and a urinalysis to confirm or rule out an infection. We should also order a bladder scan to evaluate the amount of urine remaining in your bladder after voiding, and to help determine if there are any structural abnormalities. I will also give you a frequency diary to track your urination patterns for the next few days. This will help us identify any triggers or patterns. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds very thorough, and perfectly acceptable. A frequency diary seems like a good idea, and I'm happy to track my urination patterns. And the other tests sound sensible as well. I trust your judgment. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, should I limit my fluid intake, or avoid caffeine? Or is there anything else I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: Good question. For now, I wouldn’t restrict your fluid intake drastically, as we don’t want to become dehydrated. However, it's best to avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate the bladder. Try to avoid drinking large amounts of fluids right before bedtime. Other than that, just continue with your normal routine and focus on keeping the frequency diary as accurately as possible. We’ll review the results together in a few days and discuss the next steps. Here is the diary. I would like to see you back here in five days to discuss the results. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's very clear. No, I don't think I have any further questions at the moment. Thank you so much for your time and patience. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kind manner.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. I’m glad I could help, and I’m here if any questions arise before our next appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and I'll see you in five days. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
