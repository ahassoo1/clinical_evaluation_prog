DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, okay? Just… tired. Really tired. And I… I eat dirt now. Not like, a lot a lot, but… yeah. Dirt. Don't look at me like that. It started a few weeks ago, maybe? I don’t keep track of dates.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. Thank you for being honest with me. It sounds like you’re experiencing significant fatigue, and… a craving for dirt, which we call geophagy. It's good you’re telling me about all of this. When you say “tired,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… being tired! Like, I could sleep for a week and still feel like I ran a marathon. Everything feels heavy. Just… ugh. I can’t even focus at work anymore. I used to be good with the… the machines, you know? Making them do things. Now I just stare at the screen. It's frustrating! Honestly, it's probably just old age, okay? Don't make a big deal out of it.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound like “just old age,” Hedy. Significant fatigue that interferes with your work and daily life is something we need to investigate. And the craving for dirt… that’s unusual, and could be a clue. When did you first notice this fatigue starting?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, this is what I mean. Investigate. Look, I told you, a few weeks ago. Maybe after… after my husband… passed. It's all a blur. Everything just kinda… blended together. I don’t know exactly when. It wasn't like one day I woke up feeling fine, and the next I was… like this. It just… happened. Do I have to remember the date? It's not important.
DOCTOR: No, you don’t have to remember the exact date, Hedy. I understand this is difficult. It’s perfectly normal to have a fuzzy recollection after a loss. Just “a few weeks ago” is helpful. You mentioned this started after your husband passed. I am very sorry for your loss. Grief can manifest in many ways, and fatigue is certainly one of them. Aside from the fatigue and the dirt craving, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I… I don't know. I get headaches, sometimes. But I always get headaches. And… I think I’m a little more… short-tempered than usual. My neighbor keeps trying to get me to join her gardening club. Honestly, the woman is relentless. Is that a change? I just want her to leave me alone. And…oh! My stomach feels weird. Like, not sick, exactly, just…off. Mostly after I… you know. The dirt. But I don’t think that’s related. It’s probably just indigestion.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, increased irritability, and some stomach upset, particularly after consuming dirt. That's helpful information, Hedy. And it could be related. The dirt craving is definitely something we need to explore further. When you say "stomach upset," can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s just… uncomfortable. Like, a dull ache. And sometimes, my stomach feels… bloated. It’s not like I’m throwing up or anything, okay? I just… don't feel right. And I have… trouble, you know… going to the bathroom. It’s not something I want to talk about! Honestly, this whole conversation is ridiculous. I came here because I was tired, not to discuss my…digestive issues!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy. We're just trying to get a complete picture of what’s going on to figure out the best way to help you. Constipation is a good thing to know. It can be related to several things, including some potential reasons for the dirt craving. Now, about the dirt… Can you tell me a little more about why you are craving it?
PATIENT: Why? What do you mean, why? I… I don’t know! It just… tastes good. And it feels… soothing. Like, a little bit of comfort. Don’t look at me like that! It’s not like I’m enjoying a five-course meal of soil, okay? It’s just a little bit. From the yard. It’s probably full of minerals. Honestly, I read somewhere it’s good for you. Maybe I’m deficient in something? I don't know! Look, I just… I want to feel better. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: No, Hedy, that’s not too much to ask at all. We will try to figure out what’s going on and help you feel better. It's interesting that you mention it tastes good and feels soothing. While it’s true that some mineral deficiencies can cause unusual cravings—a condition called pica—it’s important to investigate this thoroughly. It also raises some concerns about potential exposure to toxins or parasites. First, I’d like to do a physical exam, just to get a general sense of your health. Then, I’m going to order some blood tests to check for anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and any underlying nutritional deficiencies. Would that be alright with you?
