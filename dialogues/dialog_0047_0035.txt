DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sucich. I’m Dr. Press. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor Press. It’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, a good few days now. Quite bothersome, they are! Not dangerous, I don’t think, but tiring, really.
DOCTOR: A few days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about four days now, I reckon. Started right after I had a lovely bit of fish – walu, it was. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don't usually have hiccups, ever, really. It's just… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Walu, alright. And you haven’t experienced anything else alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No heartburn, no trouble breathing, no pain anywhere. Just… hic… these hiccups! They come and go, mostly after I eat or drink something, but even when I’m just sitting here, quiet as a mouse. It’s just… annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking anything for them at the moment?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I haven’t bothered with anything, to be honest. I thought they’d just go away on their own, like everything usually does. My daughter, Leilani, she suggested holding my breath, but that just makes me feel dizzy. Not very helpful, that! I don’t like taking pills unless I really have to, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, let’s just go through a bit of your medical history, just to be thorough. Do you have any ongoing health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years now? And my knees aren’t what they used to be, a bit creaky, you know, getting old! But nothing serious, Doctor. I'm generally quite healthy, for my age. I used to work as a psychiatric aide, so I’m used to keeping myself together. It’s more about keeping others together, most of the time!
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a bit of ibuprofen now and then for the knees, when they really bother me. Nothing regular, mind you. Maybe a couple of times a month, if that. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor suggested it last winter, something about the sunshine. But that’s it, really. I try to stay away from too many pills, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Mrs. Sucich?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat all sorts of things, I love my food! Shellfish, peanuts, everything! My husband used to tease me about my cast iron stomach, bless his soul. He’s gone now, of course, but I still enjoy a good meal. No allergies, no. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… Well, my mother lived to be a good age, eighty-nine, I think. She had a bit of trouble with her heart towards the end, but nothing major while she was younger. My father, he passed away younger, maybe in his sixties, something with his lungs. And I have two sisters, both still alive, thankfully. They’re both healthy as can be, I think, though we don’t see each other often. Nothing really… remarkable, I suppose. No history of hiccups, if that's what you’re wondering!
DOCTOR: Right. And just to clarify, Mrs. Sucich, you mentioned you had walu a few days before these hiccups started?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Lovely piece of fish it was, too. From the market down by the harbor. I ate it on Tuesday, I believe. And the hiccups started… Wednesday morning, maybe? It's hard to say exactly, these old memories aren't what they used to be, but definitely after the fish. It's just a thought, of course. Perhaps it was just a coincidence?
DOCTOR: It’s possible. Now, I’m going to have a quick listen to your chest, just to rule anything out. Could you please sit back and take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Deep breaths, you say? Like this? I used to do a lot of singing in my younger days, so I’m quite good at breathing, I think. Though not as good as I used to be, of course. Go ahead, Doctor. Take your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything sounds clear, no wheezing or crackles. Heart rate is regular. Blood pressure is… 130 over 80. Not bad for your age. Now, considering the recent fish consumption and the lack of other symptoms, it's possible this is a case of temporary phrenic nerve irritation. It’s not usually serious, but it can be quite bothersome. We can try a few things. Have you tried drinking a glass of water quickly?
PATIENT: Oh, phrenic nerve… sounds complicated! No, I haven’t tried drinking water quickly, no. I usually sip it slowly, to enjoy it. Is that what they recommend? Drinking it quickly? It sounds a bit… undignified, to be honest. But if it helps, I’m willing to try. Is there anything else? Something I can eat? Or avoid? I do love my food, you see, and I wouldn't want to give up my walu entirely!
DOCTOR: Drinking quickly can sometimes interrupt the hiccup reflex. As for food, there's no particular dietary restriction needed. It’s unlikely to be related to anything you’re eating. For now, I suggest trying the water trick. If that doesn’t work within a day or two, we can consider a medication to help calm the nerve. It’s a simple antispasmodic, nothing to worry about. But let’s start with the water, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, water it is. I can certainly manage that! A glass of water quickly… I'll give it a try. And if that doesn't work, then… the little pill, you say? Not too worried about it, if it has to be. Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease. I was starting to think I was going to be hiccuping forever! Is there anything else I should be doing? Or avoiding? Like strenuous exercise, or anything?
DOCTOR: No, no need for any special restrictions. Just try to relax, and drink your water quickly. If the hiccups persist for more than a week, or if they worsen, do come back and see me. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Water quickly, and come back if they don't stop. Thank you again. You're a very kind doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old woman’s hiccups! I think I’ll go home and try that water now. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sucich. Get home and take care. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
