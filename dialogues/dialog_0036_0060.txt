DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. It’s… well, it’s my family, mostly. A lot of heart trouble on both sides, you know? My grandfather, my uncle… it’s just always something. I want to make sure I don't end up the same way. I guess I just want to be told everything’s okay, or what I can do to keep it okay. I'm not thrilled about the idea of waiting for something to happen before dealing with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Blain. It’s very proactive of you to think about this now, especially with the family history you've described. Knowing your family's medical background is a really important first step. To get a better picture of your current health, and to figure out the best way to monitor things, I’m going to ask you a few questions. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Questions are… okay. Just, don’t make me sit here all day. I have things to do, you know? Not that… well, never mind. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with a little about your current health. Are you experiencing any symptoms at all – anything that feels off, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. That’s the whole point, isn’t it? I feel fine. I wouldn’t be here if I was complaining about aches and pains. Honestly, I exercise regularly – I run about five kilometers three times a week – and I eat… reasonably well. It’s mostly preventative, you see? I'm trying to avoid problems, not treat them.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Blain. Staying active and mindful of your diet is a huge part of preventative care. It sounds like you're already taking good care of yourself. To get a more complete picture, let's go through a quick review of your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – even something you might have thought was minor at the time?
PATIENT: No. Nothing diagnosed. I had… chickenpox as a kid, obviously. And I broke my arm once, when I was maybe ten. But nothing… serious. Nothing that would matter now. I'm a healthy person, Dr. Bacy. I'm just… cautious. I’d rather be safe than sorry, alright? Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going through the motions?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Blain. And you're right to be proactive. It's good to establish a baseline, even when things are going well. Alright, so no significant medical history. What about surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any. I don’t… do hospitals. Or… anything invasive. I'm not a fan, obviously. So, no surgeries. None. Are we done with the history yet? Because, honestly, this is a bit tedious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. We're almost through the history portion. Now, just to be thorough, I like to ask about family history beyond what you already mentioned regarding heart trouble. Can you tell me about your parents’ and siblings’ health?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. Managed it with pills for years. She's… she passed away a couple of years ago, actually. Not heart-related, thankfully. Cancer. My father’s still alive, thankfully. He's… okay, for his age. A little arthritis, some memory problems, but nothing major. And I have one sister. She’s… fine too, as far as I know. Healthy, works in an office, the usual. Honestly, I’m the healthiest one in the family, probably. Is that enough detail? I can’t remember everything off the top of my head.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Blain, and I'm sorry to hear about your mother. It sounds like you have a good understanding of your family's health, and that's excellent. Knowing about your mother's history is important. Just a few more quick questions before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. I can eat anything, take any medicine… as long as I have to, of course. I'm not a fan of taking pills unnecessarily, as you know. Seriously, I don’t have any allergies. I’m pretty robust, actually. I don’t understand why I even have to answer these questions. It’s all pretty obvious, isn’t it? Healthy person, no history, no allergies… what else do you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Blain. I assure you, I'm asking these questions to get a complete picture and ensure we make the best decisions for your health. It’s important to rule out everything, even if it seems unlikely. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don't take anything. I get my vitamins from my food, thank you very much. No pills, no powders, no potions. I’m a firm believer in natural health. Just… exercise and a good diet. That's it. Honestly, Dr. Bacy, are we done with the questions yet? I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Alright, Blain, we are officially done with the questions. Thank you for your patience. It sounds like you're in very good health, and you're taking excellent care of yourself. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline reading. We'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and do a basic examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. I have… things to do. But, yes. Do whatever you need to do. Just… be quick about it, alright? And please, don't tell me everything's fine until you've actually looked. I don’t want empty reassurance. I want facts.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Facts are exactly what we’ll focus on. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat here on the exam table. I’m going to wrap this cuff around your arm. It will inflate briefly and feel a little tight. Just relax your arm and breathe normally. Blood pressure is 120 over 80, and your heart rate is 68, which is excellent. I’m going to listen to your lungs now. Please take a deep breath in and out. Lung sounds are clear. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, and I don't detect any murmurs. Everything sounds good. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses detected. Extremities are normal, reflexes are intact. Alright, Blain, the physical exam was normal. Everything sounds and feels good. However, given your family history of heart trouble, I would like to order some blood work just to get a baseline cholesterol level, blood sugar, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… fine. If you insist. It’s just… another inconvenience, but I suppose it’s better to be thorough. But don't just give me numbers, alright? I want you to explain everything to me. What does it mean if my cholesterol is high? What does a complete blood count even tell me? I don’t want to be left in the dark. And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks. Just… explain it all to me, in plain English, alright? No medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Blain. I completely understand your concerns, and I assure you I will explain everything in plain English. No medical jargon, I promise. The blood work will give us a more detailed look at your overall health. The cholesterol test will tell us your levels of different types of cholesterol – HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol. HDL is the "good" cholesterol, which helps remove bad cholesterol from your arteries. LDL is the "bad" cholesterol, which can build up and cause blockages. We want to see a high HDL and a low LDL. A complete blood count tells us about the different types of cells in your blood – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help us identify any signs of infection, anemia, or other blood disorders. The results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail. I'll explain everything to you in plain English, and we can discuss any necessary steps to maintain your health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. 3-5 days… acceptable. As long as I don’t have to wait weeks. And you promise no jargon. I’ve had bad experiences with doctors in the past who just spout off terms I don't understand. So… where do I go for the blood work? And do I need to fast beforehand? I don’t want to mess up the results because I had breakfast. Just tell me everything I need to know, step by step. I’m not a medical professional, you know. I just want to make sure I don’t end up like my grandfather.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Blain. I understand your concerns, and I’ll make sure you have all the information you need. You’ll need to go to the lab at Suburban General Hospital, located at 123 Main Street. Here’s a requisition form. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll draw your blood. And yes, you do need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks – except water – for 12 hours before your appointment. Fasting is important for accurate cholesterol results. The lab is open from 7 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday. You can walk in anytime during those hours, or you can schedule an appointment online or by phone. The phone number is 555-1234. Once you’ve had the blood work done, the results will be sent directly to me. I’ll contact you as soon as they’re available to schedule another appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that covers it. 12 hours fasting, Suburban General, 555-1234… I’ve written it down. Just… don’t call me with vague results. I want a clear explanation, alright? No “maybe” or “possibly” or “it could be.” I want facts. And I expect you to remember my family history. I don’t want to have to explain it all over again. Alright. I suppose I’ll go get this blood work done. Thank you, Dr. Bacy. Hopefully, this will put my mind at ease. Although, honestly, I’m not holding my breath. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Blain. I understand your concerns, and I promise to provide you with a clear and thorough explanation of your results. I've made detailed notes on your family history, and I’ll review them before our next appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
