DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. I get very red, you see. Mostly in my face, but sometimes my neck too. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: “Flushing,” you say. And how long has this been occurring, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, hmm… maybe six months ago? It’s not every day, but maybe three or four times a week, I guess. Sometimes more if I get… excited. Not in a happy way, just… worked up.
DOCTOR: “Worked up.” Could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Well, like if someone is… being unfair. Or if I’m thinking about things too much. Old business, you know? Things that happened a long time ago. It just… warms me up, inside. And then my face gets red. It's very embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the flushing seems to be correlated with emotional distress, specifically when you’re dwelling on past issues or feeling frustrated. And it’s been occurring for approximately six months, several times a week. Do you notice anything else happening with the flushing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my heart beats a little fast. Not racing, just… noticeable. And… my hands get a little shaky. Not always, but sometimes when I'm really flushed, my hands… tremble a bit. And I feel… warm, all over. Not a fever, just… too warm.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do these episodes happen at a particular time of day, or after certain activities or foods?
PATIENT: No, no pattern really. It could be morning, afternoon, evening… doesn’t matter. I haven’t noticed anything with food. I eat… simple things. Rice, dal, sometimes chicken. I don’t drink… much alcohol. Maybe one small glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But it doesn't seem to be that. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s move on to some other questions, Mr. Withycombe. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, or any heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… no, I don’t think so. The doctor always said my pressure was good. My father… he had some problems with his heart when he was older. He had a… a bad turn, I think. But not when he was young. He lived to be eighty-two, so it wasn’t too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Never had to take anything regularly. And no allergies that I know of. I've taken… pain relievers for headaches sometimes, but nothing serious. No reactions, never. I try to avoid pills if I can, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, Mr. Withycombe, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just to rule out any obvious underlying causes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll get started. First, I’ll take your blood pressure… and then listen to your heart and lungs. Please try to relax. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142/88 mmHg. Heart sounds are regular, though a bit rapid as you described. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I also note some mild redness to your facial skin, consistent with your report. No significant findings otherwise.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that… bad? The blood pressure, I mean. I don’t understand all the numbers.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal, Mr. Withycombe. It’s a little higher than we’d like to see. It could be due to anxiety, as we are talking about potentially stressful topics, or it could indicate a developing issue. Given your symptoms of flushing, rapid heartbeat, and occasional tremors, and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I’m considering a few possibilities. It could be a benign condition like rosacea exacerbated by stress, however, we need to rule out other, more serious causes. We’ll need to run some blood tests to assess your thyroid function, cortisol levels, and catecholamine levels. This will help us determine if there’s an underlying hormonal imbalance or issue with your nervous system.
PATIENT: Blood tests… oh dear. What kind of issues? Is it… something serious? I don’t like tests. They always make me nervous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Withycombe, it's important to gather information before jumping to conclusions. The blood tests will help us rule things out. It could be something simple, or it could indicate a need for further investigation. Potential possibilities, though not necessarily likely, include pheochromocytoma – a rare tumor of the adrenal gland – or hyperthyroidism. However, these are less common, and we’re not suggesting you have either at this point. We need a baseline, so we know what’s going on. I’ll order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a 24-hour urine test to check catecholamine levels. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Twenty-four-hour urine test…? Oh, that sounds… complicated. And a bit unpleasant. I don't know… Are there other ways to figure out what's wrong? I’m not a fan of tests, Doctor. It makes me very anxious. Could it just be… stress? I've had a lot on my mind lately.
DOCTOR: Mr. Withycombe, while stress can certainly contribute to these symptoms, it's my professional responsibility to thoroughly investigate potential underlying medical causes. It’s not simply about dismissing your concerns as stress-related. The 24-hour urine test is, admittedly, a bit inconvenient, but it provides valuable information that blood tests alone cannot. It’s crucial for ruling out rare but serious conditions. I understand your anxiety, but refusing testing could delay a proper diagnosis and potentially lead to more serious complications down the line. I’ll provide you with detailed instructions for the urine collection, and the lab will assist you. We can also discuss a referral to a psychiatrist if your anxiety is significantly impacting your quality of life. But the tests are the first step. Do you agree to proceed with the blood work and urine collection?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's necessary. But please… explain everything very carefully. I get confused easily. And if it's going to be very… uncomfortable, just tell me beforehand. I trust you, Doctor, but I'm still very nervous about all this. Yes, I’ll do the tests. But slowly, please.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the lab draw blood for the complete blood count and thyroid panel right away. I’ll write the order for the 24-hour urine collection. The lab technician will provide you with detailed instructions, and I’ll also have my nurse review them with you before you leave. It involves collecting all your urine for 24 hours in a special container. It is important to follow the instructions precisely. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the results. In the meantime, I recommend practicing some relaxation techniques to manage your anxiety. I can provide you with a list of resources. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Relaxation techniques… hmm. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t had the energy lately. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… please make sure the nurse explains the urine test very clearly. And thank you… for taking the time. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse come in to review the instructions with you now. Please don’t hesitate to ask any questions, no matter how minor they may seem. It’s important that you understand the process. I’ll see you next week, Mr. Withycombe. Nurse, could you please come in and discuss the 24-hour urine collection with Mr. Withycombe?
