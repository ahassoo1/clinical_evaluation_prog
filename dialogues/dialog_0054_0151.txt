DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this tingling, you see. In my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I don’t even know how long now. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. It’s not painful, just… annoying. Like pins and needles, you know? I just want to get it sorted, if that makes sense. I have things to do!
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Tingling in the hands and feet can definitely be disruptive. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks, I think. It’s hard to say exactly, honestly. Time just… slips away these days. It’s not constant, like I said. Some days I barely notice it, and other days it's… more prominent. Especially when I'm walking my route for work, I think. Does that matter? I carry a lot of mail, you know.
DOCTOR: It does matter, yes. Walking and carrying mail could certainly be a factor. To get a better understanding, could you describe exactly where the tingling is located in your hands and feet?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... In my hands, it’s mostly in my fingers, all of them, really. And it goes up my wrist a little bit. Not the palm of my hand, though. And in my feet… it’s like, the bottom of my feet, and my toes. Not really the top, more the soles. It’s hard to explain… all over, but not everywhere, you know? It's not like a burning, just... a prickly feeling. Is that making any sense at all? I’m not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright; you're describing it just fine. So, primarily in the fingers and soles of your feet, more of a prickly tingling sensation. Does it feel the same in both hands and both feet, or is it worse on one side?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty much the same, I think. Maybe a little worse in my left hand, now that you mention it. I do all my sorting with my left hand, so I guess it gets more use. And maybe my left foot too, but it’s hard to tell. Honestly, they both bother me enough. It’s just… uncomfortable. I try not to think about it too much, but it's hard when you're walking for eight hours a day!
DOCTOR: I understand. Walking eight hours a day with that discomfort would be challenging. Let’s talk a little bit more about your overall health. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… well, I’ve been a little more tired lately, but I just figured that was the heat. It's been awfully warm, you know? And my back aches a bit, but that’s nothing new. I'm an old woman, Doctor! Things ache. I don't know… nothing major. No weakness, no numbness, no trouble with my balance. Just the tingling and the tiredness. Oh, and sometimes my feet feel a little cold, even when it’s warm out. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts. Tiredness, back pain, and cold feet – all helpful information. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history... Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, and I broke my wrist once when I was a little girl, but that healed fine. Nothing else really. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I haven’t been to the doctor in… goodness, I don't even remember. Maybe five years? Ten? I mostly just try to keep busy and not bother anyone. I don’t have insurance, you see, so I try to avoid it if I can. Is that okay? I feel bad making a fuss.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We'll do our best to figure things out. No insurance is understandable, and you're not making a fuss at all. Just trying to stay healthy is a good thing. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any medications. Never have, really. I’m not a fan of pills, if I'm honest. And no allergies, as far as I know. I've never had a reaction to anything. Just… plain old aches and pains, that’s all. I always thought they just came with getting older. I don't want anything fancy, Doctor. Just something to make the tingling stop, if possible. I really need to get back to my route, you know? People are counting on me.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. No medications and no known allergies. I understand you'd like to get back to your route as soon as possible. To help me understand what might be causing the tingling, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try not to keep me too long, please? I really don't want to fall behind. My supervisor gets very upset if I do. And honestly, I just want to get home and put my feet up.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as quick as possible. First, let's check your reflexes. Could you please sit comfortably on the examination table and let your arms relax by your sides?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Arms relaxed… like this? Do you need me to do anything else? I always feel a bit silly doing this.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfect. Just relax. Okay… and the other leg. Alright, those seem… a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, let’s check your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different parts of your feet and hands with this cotton swab, and I’d like you to tell me when you feel it. Can you close your eyes for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright, I can close my eyes. Diminished… is that bad? Oh dear. Just tell me when you touch me, right? I hope I don't mess this up. I’m not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: Not at all! You’re doing great. Okay, can you tell me when you feel this on the tip of your thumb?
PATIENT: Yes… yes! I feel it now. There! Did I do it right? It was… a little faint, though. It didn't feel very strong. Is that okay? I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly fine. It was a little faint, as you said, but you’re doing great. Alright, and now your left foot… can you tell me when you feel this touch?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I feel it. It's... harder to feel on this foot, I think. A little numb, maybe? Not completely, but not as strong as the other one. Does that make sense? It's difficult to explain… it’s just… less noticeable.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Less noticeable sensation on the left foot. Okay, last thing for now. I'm going to check the pulses in your feet. Your pulses are a little weak, but present. Alright, Ms. Uzarski, based on the examination, your reflexes are slightly diminished, your sensation is reduced in your left foot, and your pulses are a little weak. These findings, combined with your tingling and tiredness, could suggest a few possibilities, like peripheral neuropathy – which is nerve damage – or possibly some early signs of peripheral artery disease, which affects blood flow. It’s also possible it's related to your work and repetitive use.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Nerve damage and… artery disease? That sounds… serious. Is it… bad? Will I have to stop working? I really can't afford to stop working, Doctor. What does this mean? And what can we do about it?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ms. Uzarski. Let's not jump to conclusions just yet. "Suggest" is the key word here. We need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture. The good news is, many of these conditions are manageable, especially if we catch them early. To rule things out and get a definitive diagnosis, I'd like to order a couple of tests. First, a nerve conduction study, which measures the electrical activity in your nerves, and a vascular study to check the blood flow in your legs and feet. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend avoiding prolonged standing or repetitive movements as much as possible – I know that’s difficult with your job, but try to take frequent breaks and elevate your feet when you can. I also want to discuss medication options if the tests confirm a diagnosis. However, without knowing the exact cause, it’s too early to prescribe anything. Would you be comfortable with me ordering these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, alright, I suppose so. If it will help figure out what’s wrong. Frequent breaks… I’ll try, but it’s not always easy. My supervisor isn't very understanding. And medication… I really don’t like the idea of pills, but if it’s the only way… How much will these tests cost? I don't have insurance, you see. And how long will it take to get the results? I really need to get back to work… I’m just… worried about everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. The cost of the tests is a valid worry, and I'll do my best to help you navigate that. Let me check with the lab and see if they offer any financial assistance programs or discounted rates for patients without insurance. I can also see if we can prioritize the most essential test first to minimize costs. Typically, the nerve conduction study and vascular study can cost between $300 and $600 each, but I will confirm with the lab and get you exact pricing. As for the results, it usually takes about a week to ten days to get them back. I will have my staff contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – such as increased pain, numbness, or weakness – please don't hesitate to call the office. To make things a little easier, I will write you a note for your supervisor explaining that you are undergoing some medical tests and may need to take occasional breaks. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A note for my supervisor… that would be wonderful, thank you. And checking for financial assistance… that would be a great help. I really appreciate you doing that. A week to ten days… I can manage that, I think. As long as it doesn't get worse. I'll keep an eye on it, and I’ll call if anything changes. So, what do I need to do now? Do I need to schedule an appointment with the lab? And is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to schedule an appointment with the lab for both tests. My staff will give you the lab’s contact information and assist you with scheduling. They’ll also provide you with any specific instructions you need to follow before the tests, such as fasting or avoiding certain medications. In the meantime, I recommend the following: Elevate your feet whenever possible: This helps reduce swelling and improve blood flow. Wear comfortable, supportive shoes: Avoid shoes that are too tight or constricting. Avoid prolonged standing or sitting: Take frequent breaks to move around. Monitor your symptoms: Pay attention to any changes in pain, numbness, or weakness. Manage any underlying health conditions: If you have diabetes or any other health conditions, make sure they are well-controlled. I’ll also have my staff give you a handout with more information about peripheral neuropathy and peripheral artery disease. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I guess… I’ll just wait for the staff to contact me about scheduling the tests. And I’ll try to follow your advice. Thank you again. I hope we can figure out what’s wrong… and get me back to my route.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. I’m glad I could help. We’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on and get you back to your routine. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. My staff will be in touch shortly to schedule those tests. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
