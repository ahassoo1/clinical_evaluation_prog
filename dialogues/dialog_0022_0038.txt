DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, it’s… rather difficult to explain precisely. I believe I was advised to inquire about some forms… regarding future medical decisions? I don’t… quite recall the specifics. Something about ensuring my wishes are known, should I… become unable to communicate them myself. I was told an Advance Directive or POLST form might be what I need. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds right. You’re thinking about advance care planning – making sure your healthcare wishes are known if you can’t speak for yourself. An Advance Directive and a POLST form are both tools to help with that, and it’s very responsible of you to look into this now. Before we get into the forms themselves, could you tell me a bit more about why you’re thinking about this now?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. It’s not a recent development, exactly. I’ve simply… been feeling a certain… fragility, I suppose. It’s not physical, not precisely. More… a sense of things shifting. And… a friend suggested it. She felt it would be prudent. My memory isn't what it once was, and she worried about… complications. I apologize, it’s difficult to articulate. I don't recall what complications, specifically. Perhaps she had a particular incident in mind?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you've been doing some thoughtful consideration, and it's common to feel that way. A sense of things shifting, a concern about memory… those are valid reasons to consider advance care planning. It's good you have a friend looking out for you. You mentioned a concern about memory. Has this been a gradual change, or more sudden?
PATIENT: Gradual, I believe. It’s… subtle. Misplacing items, forgetting names… small things. Nothing catastrophic, certainly. But… frequent enough to be concerning. And occasionally… a larger gap, where I struggle to recall events from not so long ago. It’s… unsettling. I wouldn’t want decisions made for me that aren’t truly… mine. Even if I can’t readily articulate what those decisions should be. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. And it's very wise to be proactive about this. We’ll definitely explore your wishes as thoroughly as possible. To help me get a better understanding, let’s do a brief review of your medical history, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be… sensible. Though, I must confess, my recollection of details is rather poor. I hope I can be of some assistance. Please, do proceed. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant. And… I was previously married, but am now divorced, should that also be… noted?
DOCTOR: Thank you. Both are helpful to know. Let me see... I have some basic information here. It looks like you’ve had a few routine check-ups in the past, but not much else documented. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. I believe I was told, some years ago, that my blood pressure was slightly elevated, but I was advised to simply… monitor it. I don’t recall any other… diagnoses. I haven't been to a doctor regularly in some time, truthfully. Mostly just… annual check-ups, as you said. I do lead a fairly… sedentary life, given my occupation. Etching requires a great deal of stillness. I… apologize again for my lack of clarity. This is rather frustrating.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize at all. It’s perfectly alright. Many people don’t have a detailed medical history, and we’re just trying to get a baseline. "Sedentary life" is good information, though, and we can discuss that later. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I believe I had my tonsils removed as a child. A rather standard procedure, I was told. And… I was briefly hospitalized many years ago, when I was quite young, with a rather severe bout of pneumonia. I believe I was quite ill, but… the details are… fuzzy. I recall a great deal of coughing, and… a lingering weakness afterwards. But the specifics… escape me. I’m afraid I’m not a very helpful source of information.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful. Tonsillectomy as a child and pneumonia previously – that’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or dementia?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family is… rather scattered. I haven’t been in close contact with many of them for a considerable time. My mother… passed away several years ago. I believe she had some sort of… heart ailment, but again, the specifics elude me. My father… I haven’t seen him since I was a child. And I… don’t recall any other significant illnesses among my… relatives. I’m truly sorry. I wish I could provide more… concrete information. It’s… disconcerting to feel so disconnected from my own… history.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. It’s very common for people to have limited knowledge of their family medical history. Don’t feel bad about that at all. We can work with what we have. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I have never smoked, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine on a… special occasion, but that is exceedingly rare. And I… certainly do not use any recreational drugs. My work requires a steady hand and a clear mind, and those substances would… impede that. I maintain a rather… disciplined lifestyle, despite its sedentary nature. I prioritize my health, to the best of my ability, given my… circumstances. I apologize if I sound… defensive. It’s simply… a rather personal question.
DOCTOR: Not at all. I apologize if it felt too personal; it’s standard practice to ask about these things. And I appreciate your honesty. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I haven’t required any… regular medication for some time. Occasionally, I take an over-the-counter pain reliever for a… minor headache, but that is exceedingly infrequent. And I… do not take any supplements. I believe in a… simple approach to health. Proper rest, a balanced diet… those are my priorities. I confess, I’m rather… meticulous about my routines.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. It sounds like you take good care of yourself. Now, before we move on to discussing Advance Directives, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be… sensible. Though, I must warn you, I’m rather… sensitive to discomfort. And I haven’t had a physical exam in quite some time, so… please be gentle. And I… apologize in advance if I… react unexpectedly. It's simply… a long-standing aversion.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll take things slowly and gently. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. First, I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, normal rate. Lungs are clear… no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’ll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. We'll keep an eye on that. Finally, I'll just quickly look in your ears and throat. Ears are clear, throat looks normal. No signs of infection. Overall, everything seems within normal limits, but we will need to monitor your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure… I suspected as much. My mother… had similar issues. Thank you for confirming that. It’s… reassuring to know everything else appears… normal. Though, I confess, I am rather… anxious about needing to manage it. I’ve always prided myself on my health, and… this feels… disconcerting. Now, regarding these Advance Directives… perhaps you could explain them in… simpler terms? I apologize for my continued… lack of understanding. It's simply… a great deal of information to process.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, and you're not alone in that. Think of Advance Directives as a way to make your wishes known about your healthcare if you become unable to speak for yourself. There are a few different types. A Living Will outlines the types of medical treatment you would or wouldn't want in specific situations - things like life support, feeding tubes, or resuscitation. A Healthcare Proxy, or Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, allows you to name someone you trust to make healthcare decisions on your behalf if you can't. A POLST form, which stands for Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, is a more specific form that outlines your current wishes regarding things like CPR, intubation, and artificial nutrition. It's often used by people with serious illnesses. Does that make a bit more sense?
PATIENT: Living Will… Healthcare Proxy… POLST… It’s… a great deal to absorb. So, the Living Will is… more general, outlining preferences for various scenarios? And the Healthcare Proxy… designates a specific person to advocate for me? And the POLST… is the most definitive, outlining current orders? It sounds… rather complex. And… somewhat daunting. I confess, the thought of making such… definitive statements about my future… fills me with a certain… unease. What if my wishes change? What if… unforeseen circumstances arise? Perhaps… I should simply avoid it altogether?
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns. It is a complex topic, and it's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed or hesitant. And you absolutely don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with. You're right, it’s also important to remember that you can change your mind at any time. These documents aren't set in stone. You can update them as your wishes evolve or if your circumstances change. Many people find it helpful to discuss these decisions with their loved ones and their healthcare providers. Perhaps we can start with a simple conversation about your values and beliefs regarding healthcare. What's most important to you?
PATIENT: That… is a sensible approach. Starting with a conversation… rather than immediately completing forms. What’s most important to me… I suppose… dignity, above all else. And… avoiding unnecessary suffering. I’ve always valued… independence. The ability to make my own decisions, to control my own fate. The thought of being… helpless, dependent on others… is deeply unsettling. I believe in… quality of life. And… I would prefer… a peaceful end, should it come to that. I realize that sounds… rather morbid. I apologize. It’s simply… my honest feelings.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Those are very thoughtful and important values. Dignity, avoiding suffering, independence, quality of life… and a peaceful end. Those are excellent things to focus on. It sounds like you’ve already given this a great deal of thought, even if you haven’t formalized it in writing. Given your values, we could explore a Healthcare Proxy first. This would allow you to name someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf, ensuring your wishes are respected if you’re unable to communicate them yourself. Would you be comfortable discussing that option?
PATIENT: A Healthcare Proxy… naming someone I trust… yes, I believe that would be… prudent. I have a… friend, Anya Volkov. She is… exceptionally reliable and… understands my values. She has always been… a strong advocate for me. Though, I confess, I’m… hesitant to burden her with such a responsibility. She is… quite busy with her own affairs. But… I trust her implicitly. Perhaps… we could discuss the process? What would be involved in… formally designating her as my proxy?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good first step. Anya Volkov sounds like a wonderful choice. It's important to choose someone you trust completely and who understands your wishes. The process is relatively straightforward. We have a form that outlines the responsibilities and limitations of a Healthcare Proxy. You’ll need to complete it and sign it in the presence of a witness. It’s also important to have a conversation with Anya about your wishes, so she understands what you would want in various situations. I can provide you with some resources and conversation starters to help with that. I can print out the form for you now. We can go over it together, and you can take your time to fill it out. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be… most appreciated. A form to review… and conversation starters… that would be… exceedingly helpful. I confess, I’m… not particularly adept at articulating my thoughts, especially when it comes to… difficult subjects. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… alleviated a great deal of my anxiety. Perhaps… this isn’t as daunting as I initially feared.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. That's exactly what I'm here for. This packet includes the Healthcare Proxy form, a section for you to document your values and wishes, and some conversation starters. Please take your time to read through everything and fill it out at your own pace. I also included a list of local resources, including a social worker who can help you with advance care planning if you’d like. No need to rush. When you're ready, we can go over the form together and discuss any questions you may have. We can schedule a follow-up appointment if you prefer. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: That is… exceptionally thoughtful, Doctor. The additional resources… and the offer of a follow-up appointment… I truly appreciate your… patience and kindness. No, I believe that is all for today. I will… review these materials at my leisure and… schedule a follow-up appointment as needed. Thank you again… for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I look forward to hearing from you. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
