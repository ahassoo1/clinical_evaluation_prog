DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, my back. It’s been really, really bad lately. Worse than usual. It hurts to… well, to do just about everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Back pain, worsening.” And when did you first notice this pain becoming particularly troublesome, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe two weeks ago? No, maybe three. It’s hard to say exactly. It was just a little ache at first, you know? But now… now it’s like someone is stabbing me. Especially when I try to stand up straight. Or bend over. Everything is hard.
DOCTOR: So, it began gradually over the past two to three weeks, progressing from a mild ache to a sharper, more intense pain that interferes with your daily activities, specifically standing and bending. Can you pinpoint exactly where on your back the pain is located?
PATIENT: Right in my lower back. Not up high, down here. And it… it feels like it goes around to my side sometimes. Not all the time, but it does. It’s… hard to explain. Like a really bad muscle pull, but it doesn't go away. Even when I rest.
DOCTOR: Lower back pain radiating around to your side. And you describe it as feeling similar to a muscle pull, but persistent, not improving with rest. Is it constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant. But it gets worse with moving. Like, when I walk, or try to lift anything, even something light. Sitting for too long is bad too. Then it really hurts. But even when I'm just laying down, there's still something there. A dull ache, you know? It doesn't go completely away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Constant dull ache with exacerbations with activity – walking, lifting, prolonged sitting. Now, Ms. Meigs, have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No numbness or tingling. And my legs… they feel okay. Strong enough. I can walk, like I said, but it hurts. It’s not that they feel weak, it just… hurts to use them, because of my back. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So no neurological symptoms – no numbness, tingling, or weakness in your lower extremities, only pain exacerbated by movement. Have you tried anything to alleviate the pain yourself?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. I tried some… those heating pads? And I took some of those over-the-counter pain pills. You know, the ones for aches and pains. But they don't really do much anymore. They used to help a little, but now… not so much. My daughter, she gave me some cream, for muscles, but that didn't help either. It just smells nice.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you’ve tried heat, over-the-counter analgesics, and a topical muscle cream, with limited relief. Now, Ms. Meigs, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – anything you’ve been diagnosed with, such as arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Um… well, I have cancer. Doctor, you can see it on my chart, right? They found it… oh, a couple years ago now. It’s in my… well, I don't really understand all the details, but it’s in my bones. That’s what the other doctors told me. And I… I get treatments. Chemotherapy, sometimes. And pills. Lots of pills. Does that matter? Is my back pain because of that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Meigs, that absolutely matters. Thank you for telling me. Given your history of bone cancer and ongoing treatment, the back pain is certainly a concern that needs to be investigated thoroughly. We will need to consider all possibilities. Do you recall when the back pain started in relation to your cancer diagnosis and treatment?
PATIENT: Hmm… It started… not right away after I found out about the cancer. It was maybe… six months later? But I didn't think much of it at first. Just old age, I thought. But it's been getting worse, like I said. Especially lately. And it’s different now. It's not just an ache. It feels… deeper, somehow. Does that make sense? It feels like it's coming from inside the bone, not just the muscles.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Meigs, that is a very important distinction. Pain emanating from within the bone itself. And you’ve noticed a worsening trend, particularly recently. Before we proceed, have you experienced any other symptoms – such as fever, unexplained weight loss, night sweats, or bowel or bladder changes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. I haven’t lost weight, I think. Maybe a little, but I haven't been eating much lately, because… well, because of everything. And no night sweats. My… bathroom habits are okay. Everything is… normal there. Except for the back pain, everything is pretty much the same. It’s just… I’m scared, Doctor. Is it getting worse? Is the cancer… spreading?
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, I understand your concerns, and it’s perfectly natural to be worried. Given your medical history, it’s important to investigate this pain thoroughly to determine the underlying cause. We need to rule out several possibilities. I would like to perform a physical examination now, focusing on your back and lower extremities. This will involve assessing your range of motion, checking your reflexes, and palpating your spine to identify any areas of tenderness. After the examination, we will likely need to order some imaging tests – an X-ray, and possibly an MRI or CT scan – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s happening. I want to know if it’s… bad. The exam and the tests… that’s fine. Just… please tell me what you find. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening. It helps, just to talk about it.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Meigs. And I assure you, I will explain everything to you as clearly as possible. First, let’s begin with the examination. Please lie down on your stomach on the examination table, if you're able. I'll start by palpating your spine to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities.
PATIENT: Okay. There. Is that alright? It hurts a little to lay on my stomach, but… I can manage. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs, I’m going to gently press on different areas of your lower back. Please let me know if you feel any pain, and tell me where exactly it is located. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right there. It’s… sharp. Not a constant pain, but when you press on it, it really hurts. It feels like… a bruise, almost. But deep inside.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. And what about here, on the sides of your spine?
PATIENT: Yes, it hurts there too. But it’s a different kind of pain. More of an ache, like a really tight muscle. But it still makes my back hurt all over when you touch it. It feels… swollen, maybe? Does that make sense? Like there's pressure there, even when you're not touching it.
DOCTOR: Alright. There is some tenderness and increased tone in the paraspinal muscles bilaterally, with focal tenderness over the spinous processes. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. Can you try to bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh. I can’t… I can’t go all the way. It hurts too much. Just this far… My back is just… locked up. It feels like something is blocking me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. You have a significantly limited range of motion with forward flexion. Now, let's check your reflexes in your lower extremities. Please relax your legs. I’m going to gently tap on your knees and ankles with this small hammer. This is a normal part of the examination.
PATIENT: Okay. That little hammer… it doesn’t hurt, does it? I’m a little scared, Doctor. I don't like being poked and prodded. But I'll try to relax. Just… be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. This won't hurt. And now the Achilles tendon. Okay, your reflexes are… present and equal bilaterally, but slightly diminished. That’s something we’ll need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to quickly assess your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I lightly touch your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It tickles a little. It feels… normal. Both legs feel the same. No numbness, no tingling, just… normal. But everything hurts, Doctor. It's hard to tell what's normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sensation is intact bilaterally, no reports of numbness or tingling. To summarize, Ms. Meigs: you have tenderness and increased tone in the paraspinal muscles, focal tenderness over the spinous processes, limited range of motion, and slightly diminished reflexes. Given your history of bone cancer, these findings are concerning, and we need to determine the underlying cause. I’m going to order an X-ray of your lumbar spine to start, and based on those results, we may need to consider an MRI or CT scan for a more detailed assessment. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: X-ray… and maybe a scan… Is that… bad, Doctor? Does that mean you think it is the cancer? I’m really scared. And… will the tests hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what's happening… and what I can do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, it’s understandable that you’re scared, and you have every right to be. Ordering the X-ray and potentially a scan isn’t necessarily a confirmation that the cancer has spread. It’s a necessary step to rule out other potential causes for your pain and to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The X-ray itself is painless – it simply involves a brief exposure to radiation. The MRI or CT scan, if needed, is also painless, but you will need to lie very still inside the machine. It can be a bit claustrophobic for some people, but we can discuss options to manage that if it’s a concern. As for the results, it typically takes 24 to 48 hours to get the X-ray results back. If we need to order further imaging, it could take a few days longer. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a stronger pain medication to help manage your discomfort. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Muscle relaxant and pain medication… Okay. That sounds… okay. Anything to help with the pain. And… 24 to 48 hours… I can wait. I guess. As long as you’re doing everything you can to find out what’s happening. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for… not just brushing me off. What do I need to do next?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Meigs. And I assure you, we are doing everything we can. First, my nurse will schedule you for an X-ray. She'll also give you the prescriptions for the muscle relaxant and pain medication. Please take the medications as directed, and if the pain is not adequately controlled, please contact my office immediately. I'd like to see you back in 7 days to review the X-ray results and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, weakness in your legs, or bowel or bladder changes – please contact my office right away. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Seven days… I can remember that. I’ll… I’ll see you then. And thank you again. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Meigs. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. My nurse will escort you to the scheduling desk. Goodbye.
