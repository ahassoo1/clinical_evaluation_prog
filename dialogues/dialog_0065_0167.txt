DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my foot. It’s… hurting. A long time hurting. And there’s a sore. Not good sore, you know? Been trying to take care of it myself, but not getting better.
DOCTOR: A long time hurting, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Maybe… six months now? More, maybe. Hard to remember exactly. It started small, like a little cut. I thought nothing of it, just a scrape from walking barefoot. But it didn't heal. Then it got… deeper. Now it’s painful to walk.
DOCTOR: Six months, alright. And it’s progressively worsened, causing you pain with ambulation. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, mostly. When I walk too much, it really hurts. Even standing for long… not good. When I sit down and rest, it’s better. Not gone, but… quieter. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Intermittent pain, exacerbated by weight-bearing activity and relieved with rest. Have you noticed any redness, swelling, or drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Redness… yes, sometimes. It gets red around it. And… a little puffy, maybe. Not much. And… sometimes a little wet. Not a lot, but… something comes out. It's not… bright red, if that makes sense. More… cloudy.
DOCTOR: Redness, mild swelling, and cloudy drainage. Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or fatigue associated with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I know of. I feel… tired sometimes, but I’m an old man! That’s just getting old, I think. No chills. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: I see. And what have you been doing to treat this sore yourself?
PATIENT: I wash it with soap and water. Every day. And I put… a bandage on it. Sometimes, I put some… cream on it. The cream… the kind you buy at the store. For cuts and scrapes. Is that good enough? I’m not sure. I asked my neighbor, but she’s not a doctor, you know?
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter wound care. Have you had any similar sores in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. This is the first time. I’ve had… bumps and bruises, of course, but never a sore like this that wouldn’t heal. I’ve always been careful walking, try to avoid stepping on anything sharp.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m going to need to take a look at this foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. It’s a little… smelly, I’m afraid. Old man feet, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright. Let's have a look. Hmm. There is a clearly defined ulceration on the dorsal aspect of your foot. The surrounding skin is erythematous and there appears to be some purulent drainage. The area is warm to the touch. I’m also noting some loss of sensation in the surrounding tissue. Do you have diabetes, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Diabetes? The doctor… a long time ago, he said my sugar was… high. He gave me pills. I take them every day. Is… is that diabetes? I don’t really… remember everything he said.
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds like diabetes. And it’s important that we address this, as diabetes can significantly impair wound healing and increase the risk of infection. Do you check your blood sugar levels at home?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t. He never told me to. Just take the pills. I have a hard time with… machines, you know? And… needles. I just take the pills like he said.
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, with uncontrolled diabetes and a non-healing wound, we need to be very cautious. I'm concerned about a possible infection. I’m going to order some blood work to check your blood sugar levels and assess for infection. I also want to get a culture of the wound to identify any bacteria present. I will also need to obtain an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. Do you understand?
PATIENT: X-ray… blood work… That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it… bad? I just want my foot to get better. I like to walk. I understand… I think. You want to check my blood and… look inside my foot? That sounds scary.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Stoegbauer. We're simply gathering information to determine the best course of treatment. We need to rule out any serious complications. The X-ray will show us if there’s any infection in the bone. The blood work will tell us how well your diabetes is controlled and if there’s an active infection. It's important to be thorough. I'm also going to refer you to a podiatrist for specialized wound care. They are experts in foot problems and can provide the best possible treatment for this ulceration. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Podiatrist… another doctor? That’s a lot of doctors, Doctor. Is this wound… very bad? And what about the… the needle for the blood? I don't like needles. Will it hurt a lot? I just want this to be over.
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, it’s not ideal, I agree. However, given your history and the appearance of the wound, it’s essential we take all necessary precautions. The wound is concerning, yes, and requires specialized care. As for the blood draw, it’s a quick pinch – a brief discomfort. We will be as gentle as possible. The podiatrist will be able to provide ongoing wound care, debridement if necessary, and assess for any further complications. I’m writing the orders for the blood work and X-ray now. The lab technician will explain the procedure to you. I’ll also have my nurse schedule an appointment with a podiatrist for you. In the meantime, keep the wound clean and dry, and please, avoid walking on it as much as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Clean and dry… no walking. More doctors… I will try. But it’s hard, you know? I like to walk. And I don’t like needles. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be in shortly to explain the next steps and draw your blood. I expect to have the results of the blood work and X-ray back within 24-48 hours, and we will discuss them at that time. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any fever, increased pain, redness, or swelling.
