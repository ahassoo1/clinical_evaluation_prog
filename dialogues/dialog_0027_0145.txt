DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here today… ah, let me see… Yes, it is for the home health, and also the hospice… the certification, you understand? My… ex-wife arranged it. She thinks it is best, for my recovery.
DOCTOR: Okay, home health and hospice certification… I see. And is this related to a recent illness or injury, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. It is… was… a fall. About three weeks ago, I believe. Broke the hip, you understand? They operated, of course. It is… healing, but slowly. It is not as easy as it used to be, to recover. And my ex-wife… she worries.
DOCTOR: Three weeks ago, a hip fracture requiring surgery. And now you’re looking at home health and hospice certification to help with recovery. Is the pain still significant, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: Yes, the pain… it is there. Not constant, you understand? But when I try to… to move, or to stand… it is quite sharp. The nurses… they give me something for it. But it does not always… suffice, you could say. It is better when I am resting, of course. Much better.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pain with movement, especially standing, that's relieved somewhat with rest and medication, but not completely controlled. Can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. It is… a deep ache, you understand? Like a… a weight pressing down. And when I do move… it is a sharp, stabbing pain. It comes quickly, and then fades. But it prevents me from… from doing many things. Even walking is difficult. It is… frustrating. I was always very active, you see. A gardener, mostly. And now… now I cannot even tend to my roses.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds very frustrating to have your activity limited like that. Let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… I have… ah, high blood pressure, I believe. The doctor put me on medication for that some years ago. And… I had a touch of diabetes, but it is… controlled with diet, mostly. And a bit of arthritis in the hands, but that is… old age, you understand? Nothing serious, really. Just a little stiffness. I do take a daily vitamin, as well. A multi-vitamin.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and diabetes managed with medication and diet, arthritis, and a multi-vitamin. Do you know what medications you're currently taking for your blood pressure and diabetes?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think… for the blood pressure, it is… ah, Lisinopril, I believe. A small white pill. And for the diabetes… Metformin, yes. That is the one. A larger, yellow pill. I take both every morning, with breakfast. I have been taking them for… oh, several years now. The doctor checks regularly, you understand? Blood tests and such.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's very helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ah, allergies… let me see. No, I do not believe so. Not to medications, no. Perhaps a little… irritation from certain flowers, but nothing serious. A runny nose, perhaps. And I avoid shellfish, you understand? Not an allergy, exactly, but… it does not agree with me. Gives me… indigestion. But truly, no serious allergies to report.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant allergies. Good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your recovery. You mentioned the pain is hindering your ability to walk. Are you currently using any assistive devices, such as a walker or cane?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. The pain… it is a problem. And yes, I am using a walker, you understand? They gave me one at the hospital. It helps, of course, but… it is not the same. I was always very steady on my feet. And now… I feel very… unstable, sometimes. It is quite frustrating, truly. Even with the walker, I am very careful.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s natural to feel that way after a hip fracture. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind, just to check your range of motion and stability. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I understand you need to check. Please, proceed. I will do my best to cooperate. Just… be gentle, if you would. It still feels… tender, you understand? Even with the pain medication.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's just have you stand up slowly, if you're able. And tell me if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. There… it is… a little tender, you understand? But manageable. The right leg… it is the one that was… broken. It feels… weak, still. I am trying to put weight on it, but it is not easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There is some tenderness when I press here on your right hip, and a slight decrease in range of motion compared to your left. Can you lift your right leg up like this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. It is… difficult, you understand? It does not go very high. And it… aches a little when I do that. It is not… fluid, like it used to be. Perhaps it is just… stiff. From being in bed for so long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Your pulses are good, which is reassuring. And I'm not noticing any significant swelling. It sounds like you're still experiencing some weakness and stiffness, which is common after a hip fracture. Why don't you sit back down for a moment. We can discuss a plan to help with your recovery.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That is… much better. A plan… yes, that would be good. I want to be able to… to walk again, you understand? To tend to my garden. That is… important to me. I am willing to do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: I understand. And we will work towards that goal. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it appears your recovery is progressing, but a bit slower than we'd like. I think a more structured physical therapy program would be beneficial. We can also consider a referral to an orthopedic specialist for a second opinion, if you’d like. And we need to ensure your pain is well-controlled so you can participate in therapy effectively. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable, Doctor. Physical therapy… yes, I have heard good things. And… a second opinion, perhaps. If you think it is necessary. I trust your judgment, of course. But… it cannot hurt. And… pain control, yes. That is very important. I want to be able to do the therapy, you understand? Not just… sit and suffer. So, yes. Physical therapy, second opinion if you think it is wise, and better pain control. That is… a good plan. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I agree. I’m going to write referrals for both physical therapy and an orthopedic specialist. The physical therapist will assess your current abilities and develop a personalized program. The specialist can evaluate the hip and ensure there are no underlying issues delaying your recovery. As for the pain, I’m going to adjust your medication slightly and see if that provides better relief. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes, one question, Doctor. About the hospice referral… my ex-wife explained it as… to make things “easier.” Is that… is that because I am… unwell? I do not feel… unwell. Just… slow to recover. I want to be clear about that. I want to get better. Is the hospice… only for people who are… very sick?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Bahta, and it’s perfectly understandable to be concerned about that. Sometimes, hospice referrals are made for individuals who need extra support with chronic conditions or after a significant illness like a hip fracture, even if they aren't necessarily at the end of life. It can provide services like pain management, physical therapy, and emotional support. It sounds like your ex-wife may have thought it would be helpful with your recovery. However, if you're not comfortable with hospice at this time, we absolutely do not need to proceed with it. We can explore other options for support. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: That… that is reassuring, Doctor. I did not want to be… mistaken. I want to recover. Not… to prepare for the end. If it is just for support… for the pain and the physical therapy… then perhaps. But not if it is… something more. I need to be clear about that. If it is just assistance… then yes. Perhaps we can try it, and see. But I want to be able to stop, if it is not… right. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That is completely possible, Mr. Bahta. Hospice is a service you can opt into and out of at any time. It’s entirely your decision. We can arrange for a hospice nurse to come and assess your needs and discuss the services they offer. If you find it’s not a good fit, you can discontinue it at any point without any repercussions. We’ll focus on getting you the support you need to recover and get back to gardening. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very acceptable. To try it, and see. If it helps… good. If not… I can stop. I appreciate your honesty, and your understanding. I feel… much better now. Thank you. I believe that is all my questions for today.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I'm glad I could clarify things. I'll get the referrals and medication adjustments sent to your pharmacy, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your progress. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. It was a pleasure meeting you.
