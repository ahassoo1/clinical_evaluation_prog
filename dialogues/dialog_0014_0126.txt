DOCTOR: Alright, Christen, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, Doctor Osterholm, it’s… it’s been a bit bothersome, to be frank. I’ve just been incredibly thirsty, no matter how much I drink. And hungry, constantly hungry. It’s quite disruptive, really. I'd like to get it sorted if possible, as I have things to be getting on with.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Thirsty and hungry, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It’s not… a normal level, if you understand. I feel like I’m constantly reaching for water or a snack. It's been going on for… oh, I suppose a couple of weeks now, maybe a bit longer. Hard to say precisely, to be honest. It’s just… irritating.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks. And has anything changed in those couple of weeks?
PATIENT: Changed? Not that I can readily think of… No, no major changes to my diet, no. Work’s been the same, stressful as always with shipping delays and all that. Sleep’s been… adequate, I suppose. I wouldn’t say good, but adequate. No new medications, nothing like that. Why do you ask? Is something specific you’re looking for? I just want to get this… addressed, quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Well, sometimes these things are related to something simple. A change in diet, a new medication... but you said no. Alright. And any changes in how often you’re urinating?
PATIENT: Urinating… Hmm. Now that you mention it… yes, I suppose I have been going to the bathroom a bit more frequently. Not drastically, but… noticeable. I hadn't really connected the two, to be honest. Just put it down to the amount I’m drinking, I suppose. Is that… normal with this thirst? I really don’t know much about these things.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And before we get too far, have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Diagnosed…? Let me think. No, not as such. I had a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but that’s hardly a diagnosis, is it? Nothing chronic, nothing serious. A few sprained ankles playing football when I was younger, but that was all treated at the time and… well, that was a long time ago. Why do you ask, Doctor? Is it something concerning? I appreciate you asking these questions, of course, but I have a lot to get done today.
DOCTOR: Just routine, Christen. We need to get a full picture. Alright, and family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a bit… complicated, to be honest. My mother… well, she had some issues with her stomach, years ago. Nothing specific diagnosed, just… unwell. My father was generally healthy, I think. He worked in the shipyard, very physical job. My grandparents… I didn’t know them well enough to say. They passed when I was young. Is this important, Doctor? I’m afraid I’m not very good with remembering medical details, to be frank.
DOCTOR: It’s always important. Alright. Let's move on. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Waste of money, and terrible for your health. No, Doctor, definitely not a smoker. I drink… occasionally. A pint or two at the pub with the lads on a Friday. Nothing excessive, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. The quicker we get through this, the better. Lead the way, Doctor. I do have a meeting later this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just hop up on the table for me, please. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take your blood pressure. And I'll just quickly feel your abdomen. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 140/90. Now, abdomen… slightly tender to palpation in the upper quadrants, but nothing alarming. Alright. I'm going to order a blood glucose test and a complete metabolic panel. That will give us a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Right. Blood tests, yes? Is that… routine? 140/90… is that high? My father always had good blood pressure, so I assumed I would too. What exactly are you looking for with these tests, Doctor? And how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know if this will interfere with my schedule.
DOCTOR: 140/90 is a bit elevated, yes. We want to see it closer to 120/80. And the blood tests will help us rule out several things. Primarily, we’re looking for signs of diabetes. Your symptoms – excessive thirst, frequent urination, constant hunger – are all consistent with that. The metabolic panel will give us a broader picture of your kidney and liver function. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. We’ll call you if anything is concerning. But frankly, given your symptoms, I’d advise you to cut back on sugary drinks and refined carbohydrates in the meantime. It won't hurt to start there. I'm putting in the order for the tests now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any allergies to latex or anything like that?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Good heavens. That’s… concerning. My diet isn’t that bad, Doctor. I have a biscuit with my tea, and perhaps a bit of chocolate after dinner. I do enjoy a full Scottish breakfast on a Saturday, of course. But I wouldn’t say it's excessive. No, no allergies to latex or anything. I'm quite healthy, generally. I just want to get to the bottom of this thirst. 24-48 hours… Right. Very well. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Anything I should be doing in the meantime besides… avoiding biscuits? I really do appreciate your time, Doctor, but I do have a rather full day ahead of me.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not saying you have diabetes, alright?
PATIENT: I didn’t say you did, Doctor. I merely stated I enjoy a biscuit with my tea. And a full Scottish breakfast on a Saturday. It’s a perfectly reasonable diet! I just don't understand why this thirst has suddenly appeared, and I'd appreciate it if we could focus on finding the cause, rather than… implying I have a serious illness. I work very hard, Doctor, and I don’t have time for unnecessary worry. Is there anything further you need to ask before I can leave?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No, that’s all for now. Just… try to drink water instead of sugary drinks, and we'll see what the blood tests show. The nurse will be in shortly. .
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. .
