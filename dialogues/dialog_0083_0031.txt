DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you too. Well, my left leg has gotten quite swollen, and I’ve been told I have a funny heartbeat... something called atrial… fib… fill-a-ration? I think that’s what they said. It's been bothering me a bit.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, yes. That is something we should definitely look into. And the swelling in your leg is also important. Let’s start with the leg swelling. When did you first notice it, and has it been getting worse?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe a week ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little puffiness, really. But these past couple of days it’s gotten… more noticeable. Definitely bigger now. It doesn’t hurt too much, just feels… heavy, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, “heavy” is a good way to describe it. And is it just your left leg that's swollen, or is it affecting both legs?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. The right leg is perfectly fine. I’ve been trying to put it up when I can, but it doesn’t seem to help a great deal, to be honest. I also noticed it gets a bit worse at the end of the day, after I've been on my feet teaching.
DOCTOR: Teaching?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m a computer science teacher, Doctor. At the postsecondary level. It's quite a bit of standing, and walking around the room helping the students. Though, mostly it’s sitting and explaining things, to be fair. But still… a lot of being on my feet. It's a good job, but… tiring sometimes.
DOCTOR: That is a demanding job. Being on your feet for extended periods can certainly contribute to swelling. Now, let’s go back to the heart issue. Who told you about the irregular heartbeat, and do you know what tests, if any, were done?
PATIENT: It was the doctor at the health clinic, about a month ago now. He… he used a little device, pressed it to my chest. Said it was atrial fill-a-ration, like I said. He didn’t do much else, just said to keep an eye on it and make an appointment if I felt unwell. He didn’t explain it very well, to be honest. I don't really understand what it is, just that it’s something to do with my heart beating strangely.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon to feel confused after a brief consultation. Atrial fibrillation, or AFib, as it’s often called, is an irregular and often rapid heart rate. It can sometimes cause symptoms like palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue. But it can also be asymptomatic, meaning you don't feel any symptoms at all. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please do. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I haven’t been feeling terribly unwell, just a bit more tired than usual, maybe. But it's better to be safe, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat on the table, and I’ll begin with the heart and lung sounds. Please try to relax and breathe normally. Okay. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, consistent with what you were told. I’m also noting some mild swelling in your left ankle. I'm going to check your pulses in both legs, and then we'll do a quick neurological exam just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. I’ll try my best to relax. It’s a bit strange having someone listen to my chest, to be honest, but I trust your judgement, Doctor. Do I need to do anything special? Just lie still?
DOCTOR: Just lie still and breathe normally, yes. No need to worry about anything else. Okay, pulses are a bit weaker in your left leg compared to your right, but still present. Reflexes are normal in both feet, and sensation is intact. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to get a more detailed look at your heart rhythm, and a D-dimer blood test to check for blood clots in your leg. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. An EKG and a blood test… perfectly acceptable. Will the blood test be a lot? I don’t mind a little prick, but I’m not a fan of having too much taken, if you understand. And how long will I have to wait for the results?
DOCTOR: Just a standard blood draw, nothing extensive. A couple of vials, that’s all. And you’re right, it’s not the most comfortable thing in the world, but it’s quick. The EKG results should be available almost immediately, while the D-dimer results usually take a couple of hours. We can review them together once they're back. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to elevate your leg when possible, and avoiding prolonged standing if you can. Also, please stay well-hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Elevate my leg, stay hydrated… I can manage that. Thank you for explaining things so clearly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit. Is there anything you need from me? Any forms I need to fill out? Perhaps a list of medications I’m currently taking? Though, I don’t take any regularly, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No, no regular medications is helpful to know. We'll just need a basic allergy and social history form filled out. It just asks about any allergies you have, and some lifestyle questions. The nurse will be in shortly to get that started, and to draw the blood for the D-dimer test. Once the results are back, we’ll discuss them, and decide on the best course of action. It’s possible we’ll need to consult with a cardiologist, but let’s see what the tests show first. Do you have any limitations I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No limitations, Doctor. I’m perfectly able-bodied, aside from this leg swelling, of course. No allergies either. I suppose I lead a fairly ordinary life. I do enjoy a good walk in the hills when the weather allows, but I haven’t been doing much of that lately. I try to eat healthily, though I do have a sweet tooth, I must admit. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: A sweet tooth is perfectly relevant! It’s good to have a complete picture. And enjoying walks is wonderful, though it’s good you’ve been taking it easy with the swelling. Okay, let’s get those forms completed and get the blood draw done. The nurse, Sarah, will be with you shortly. She’ll explain everything thoroughly. In the meantime, is there anyone you'd like us to contact with the results, or is there anyone who drives you to appointments?
PATIENT: No, I don’t need anyone contacted. I drove myself here, and I’m perfectly capable of getting back. I live alone, so there's no one to contact, really. I prefer to handle these things myself, if you don’t mind. I appreciate you asking, though. You’ve been very considerate, Doctor. It’s a relief to find a doctor who takes the time to listen.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand completely. We're here to support you in any way we can. I want you to feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. Alright, then. Sarah should be in any minute. Just let her know if you have any questions or concerns. In the meantime, try to relax. I’ll see you shortly after the results are available. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. I’ll wait here and try to relax. .
