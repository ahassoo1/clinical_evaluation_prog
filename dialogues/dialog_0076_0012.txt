DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Squiers, good to see you… or, well, to meet you. Let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Ruocco. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because I am planning a cruise – a rather lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires a bit of medical information before I depart. I thought it best to get that sorted with a proper check-up, just to be on the safe side, you understand.
DOCTOR: A cruise, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It leaves on the 15th of September. A bit of a last-minute decision, really. My husband… well, he always wanted to go, and I thought… it seemed a nice thing to do. Though, all this paperwork! They want to know about… everything, practically. Do you usually have to fill out such extensive forms for something like this?
DOCTOR: Forms are… always extensive. It's the lawyers, really. Alright, so a September cruise. Let's get this done. First things first – any major medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Major problems… not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I had a touch of the flu last winter, a rather nasty one, but I recovered fully. And, well, my knees aren't what they used to be, if you don't mind my saying so. A bit of stiffness, you know, getting older. Nothing that stops me from doing things, mind you, just a bit uncomfortable sometimes. I haven’t been to see a doctor regularly in… oh, quite a while, actually. My husband always handled those things.
DOCTOR: Flu last winter, knees a bit stiff… right. And what about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Yes, actually. A tonsillectomy when I was a girl, quite a long time ago now – I believe I was seven or eight. And… hmm. Oh, yes! A minor operation on my hand, about twenty years ago, when I was still working in the shop. Just to remove a cyst, nothing serious. It healed up perfectly, no bother at all. I always was lucky with healing.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, cyst removal… Okay. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never really taken much in the way of medicine, if I can help it. A bit of paracetamol for headaches, perhaps, but nothing regular. I don’t recall ever having a reaction to anything. My husband always remembered these things, but… well. Perhaps it’s best to be cautious, though. Is there a particular medication I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: No, no. Just checking. Now, family history. Anything significant?
PATIENT: Significant… Hmm. My mother, bless her, she had high blood pressure in her later years. And my father, he always had a weak heart, though he lived to a good age, all things considered. My brother is… perfectly healthy, as far as I know. He lives in Canada, you see, and we don’t see each other often. I suppose that’s all, really. Nothing terribly worrying, I wouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in mother, weak heart in father. Alright. And do you smoke?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband tried it once, years ago, and I put a swift end to that. Dreadful habit, really. And I don’t drink much either, just a glass of sherry with dinner on special occasions. I’ve always believed in moderation, you see. It's a much healthier way to live.
DOCTOR: Right. And how about any current medications you're taking?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s an easy one, Doctor. None at all. As I said, I don’t take much in the way of medicine. Just the occasional paracetamol, if I have a headache. And sometimes a little cream for my hands, they get rather dry in the winter. But that’s it, really. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. Just the basics, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's have a quick listen to your heart and lungs, just to be on the safe side. Do you mind?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please, go right ahead. I do hope everything is alright. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, you see. My husband always said so. But I’m sure it’s nothing. Just being cautious is always best, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Heart rate is… adequate. Lungs are clear, but a bit of diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. Probably just age, but we’ll note it. Blood pressure is 130/80. That’s… acceptable. Now, let me have a look at your throat. Say “ahhh.”
PATIENT: Alright. Ahhh. Is that alright, Doctor? I hope I'm not making a fuss. It feels a little dry, perhaps. The weather's been rather warm, you see, and I haven't been drinking enough water, I suppose. Just a bit parched, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Nothing remarkable. A little dryness, as you say. Alright. Last thing for now. I'm just going to check your reflexes. Left leg... good. Right leg... also good. Seems… adequate. So, all in all, you’re in… reasonably good shape for your age. But I would recommend drinking more water. It’s important.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. And you are quite right about the water, I really should make more of an effort. My husband always told me the same thing, you see. So, do you think that's everything I need for the cruise line forms? I'm just anxious to get it all sorted, if possible. I'm not terribly good with paperwork, you see, and I'd hate to hold anything up.
DOCTOR: I’ll just print a quick summary for you. Just routine stuff. No major concerns. But… I would recommend, just as a precaution, getting a flu shot before you travel. And perhaps a pneumococcal vaccine, given your age. It's always best to be safe. I’ll write a note saying you’re fit to travel, but with those recommendations. Here you go. And try to drink more water. Honestly. Next!
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. A flu shot… and the other one… I'll certainly consider it. Thank you for the recommendations. And thank you for the note saying I'm fit to travel. That’s a great weight off my mind. I won’t take up any more of your time. You must have many patients waiting. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: Right. Have a good cruise. And drink more water.
