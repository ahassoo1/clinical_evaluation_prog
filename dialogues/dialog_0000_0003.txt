DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Pinky Batara, Doctor. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I haven't got all day, so let’s just get this over with. It's this…shaking. In my hands. Been happening for a while now, I guess. Honestly, can't recall exactly when it started. It's just…annoying.
DOCTOR: Right. “Shaking.” And it’s in your hands, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. Sometimes feels like it’s…all over, but it's worse in my hands. Makes it hard to, you know, hold a glass or something. I used to have a very steady hand. Directed a lot of pictures, you know. Very precise work. Doesn’t matter now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: So it interferes with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Interferes? Well, yeah, of course it does. Try eating soup with a shaky hand! It's a mess. And I can't write properly anymore. Used to keep a journal, you know. All my thoughts...gone now. It's just…declining, everything. Don’t need a doctor to tell me that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And this shaking… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Hard to say when. I think it’s worse when I'm…stressed. Or tired. Though, what isn’t worse when I'm tired? I'm eighty years old, Doctor, what do you expect? It's not like you can fix it, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed anything else associated with the shaking?
PATIENT: Associated with it? Like what? Look, I just know my hands shake. That's it. No bells and whistles. No flashing lights. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t got time for a riddle. Just tell me if it’s serious or not. And if there’s anything, anything at all, you can do about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s try this. Any stiffness in your joints?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Sometimes, maybe. My whole body feels a bit creaky, frankly. Eighty years, Doctor! Everything aches. Is this going somewhere? I got a luncheon to get to, you know.
DOCTOR: Are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… Oh! The little blue pill for my…pressure. High blood pressure. And something for my arthritis, but I can't recall the name. Honestly, the pharmacist handles all that. Just takes them out of a bottle, that's all. Don’t bother writing it down, I doubt it matters.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had any problems. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that's just the heat, probably. It's been a warm summer. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? This shaking isn’t life-threatening, is it? Because that’s really all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Let's just do a quick physical exam, just to rule a few things out. It'll only take a few moments. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. But don’t expect miracles, Doctor. I’m an old man. Everything’s falling apart. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide. Could you please extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Hurry it up, will ya? My luncheon…
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes are a little slower than expected, and I'm noticing some tremor in your hands when writing. Now, could you please touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: See? Shaky! What did you expect? This is pointless. You're not going to discover anything I don't already know. Is that enough? Can we be done now?
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what's causing the shaking. However, given your age and symptoms, the most likely possibility is essential tremor. This is a common neurological condition that causes shaking, typically in the hands. It’s not life-threatening, but it can be bothersome. It could also be a side effect of a medication, or, less likely, a sign of something more serious. To be certain, I recommend further evaluation with a neurologist.
PATIENT: A neurologist? What for? To tell me I’m old? I already know that! Look, I don't want to go running around to specialists. I just wanted to know if I was dropping dead or something. Essential…what-was-it? As long as it’s not killing me, I suppose. Is there anything you can prescribe to calm the shaking? Something, anything at all? A pill? A cream? I don’t care, just something!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. There are medications that can help manage the symptoms of essential tremor. Beta-blockers, like propranolol, and anti-seizure medications, like primidone, can sometimes reduce the shaking. However, they have potential side effects, and we would need to monitor you carefully. I can prescribe propranolol to start, 20mg twice a day. We’ll see how you tolerate it. I also recommend avoiding caffeine and stress as much as possible, as these can worsen the shaking. Here’s the prescription. If the shaking doesn't improve, or if you experience any side effects, like dizziness or fatigue, please call the office immediately. And I still strongly recommend a consultation with a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. Do you have any questions for me?
