DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, doc, it’s… unpleasant. Been throwing up blood. Not a ton, but enough to worry a fella. Started a couple days ago, just thought it was somethin’ I ate, but it ain’t gettin’ better. And honestly, it's kinda freakin' me out.
DOCTOR: Throwing up blood, you say. Very well. And how much blood would you estimate, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Look, I ain't exactly measurin' cups in the bathroom, alright? It's not like a fountain, but it's more than just a streak. Maybe… a shot glass full each time? Give or take. And it’s… bright red. Not… chunky or anything, thankfully. Just… blood. Makes a man feel weak, ya know? I haven’t been able to keep much down either, even water.
DOCTOR: Bright red blood, you say. And unable to keep water down. Hmm. Have you noticed any abdominal pain, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Pain? Yeah, some. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Right in the middle, kinda under my ribs. Comes and goes, but it's definitely there. Feels worse after… well, after tryin' to eat, even if I can't keep it down. And I’ve been feelin’ tired, just… drained. Like an old battery. Is this somethin' serious, doc? Be straight with me, I don’t need sugar-coating.
DOCTOR: "Straight with you," you say. Very well. Fatigue and abdominal pain with hematemesis – vomiting blood – warrants a thorough investigation. Do you have any history of ulcers, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Nah, not that I know of. Never been told I had ‘em. My wife… bless her soul… she handled all the doctor stuff. I just showed up when she told me to. She passed a couple years back, cancer. I haven’t really been to a doctor since. This… this is new territory for me, doc. I’m a simple man, I don't bother with the medical mumbo jumbo if I can help it. Is this somethin' I got from bad food, or somethin' worse?
DOCTOR: I see. Loss of a spouse is… unfortunate. However, your medical history – or lack thereof – is not ideal. Bright red hematemesis can be caused by a variety of factors, ranging from minor esophageal irritation to more serious conditions. We need to rule out the latter. Have you been taking any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? Just… antacids, sometimes. Tums, mostly. When the heartburn gets bad. And… that’s it. I don’t take nothin’ regularly. Never really needed to, until lately. Look, doc, I work with… well, I work with the dead. Crematory operator. It's not a glamorous job, and it can be… hard on a man. I just figured maybe somethin’ I ate. Stress, maybe? But this ain’t goin' away, and it's startin' to scare me. Are you thinkin' somethin' serious? Don't beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: A crematory operator, you say. An… unusual profession. While stress can certainly exacerbate gastrointestinal issues, hematemesis requires a more definitive assessment. I'm going to need to perform a physical examination, Mr. Gentz. Please lie down on the examination table. I will need to listen to your abdomen, and check your vital signs. Afterwards, we will likely need to order some blood work and potentially an endoscopy.
PATIENT: Endoscopy? What's that? Sounds… unpleasant. Is it gonna involve stickin' a camera down my throat? Because frankly, doc, that doesn’t sound like a good time. Look, I’m a practical man. If it’s somethin’ simple, can’t we just… try somethin’ for the heartburn first? Maybe a stronger antacid? I really don't want any cameras or… procedures if we don’t have to. And I ain't exactly made of money, seein' as I ain't insured. This whole thing is just… stressful.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining. It is the most reliable method for determining the cause of your hematemesis. I understand your concerns regarding cost and discomfort, Mr. Gentz, but we must rule out potentially life-threatening conditions like bleeding ulcers, esophageal varices, or even malignancy. I will order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a coagulation panel immediately. However, without visualization, a definitive diagnosis is impossible. Regarding your financial situation, we can discuss options for assistance at the billing office. Now, please lie down so I can auscultate your abdomen. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Fine. But I'm tellin' ya, doc, I don't like the sound of any of this. And I still think it's just heartburn. Just get it over with. And try not to poke around too much. It's a sensitive area, ya know? A man's pride… is a fragile thing.
DOCTOR: I am listening for bowel sounds, Mr. Gentz. Please remain still. Your bowel sounds are… hypoactive. Diminished. Tenderness in the epigastric region. Mild. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 88. Temperature is normal. As I suspected. Now, I will order the blood work. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw samples. Do you have any allergies to latex or other medical materials?
PATIENT: Latex? Nah, never had a problem with that stuff. Just… don't like needles, if that counts. And I really don't like bein' poked and prodded, but I guess it’s gotta be done. How long ‘til we get the results? And what exactly are you lookin’ for in these blood tests? Just tell me in plain English, doc. No fancy mumbo jumbo, alright? A man deserves to know what’s goin’ on with his own body. Is this gonna be somethin' serious, or can I just go home and take some antacids? That's all I want to know.
DOCTOR: The blood work will take approximately one to two hours for initial results. We are looking for signs of anemia, which would indicate blood loss. We will also assess your liver and kidney function, and check for any signs of infection. The coagulation panel will determine if your blood is clotting properly. Mr. Gentz, I understand your desire for a quick resolution. However, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without the results of these tests. While antacids may temporarily alleviate your symptoms, they will not address the underlying cause of your hematemesis. And frankly, given your history and current presentation, dismissing this as "just heartburn" would be… irresponsible. Please remain here. The technician will be with you shortly. I will review the results as soon as they are available.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. And hurry it up, will ya? A man’s got things to do. .
