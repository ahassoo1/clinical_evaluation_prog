DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good morning to you too. It's… well, it's my leg. It’s been swelling up. It’s after… after the cancer stuff, you know? I had treatment, and now it’s puffy. It’s a bit annoying, really.
DOCTOR: I see. So the swelling is in your leg, and you’re concerned it might be related to your previous cancer treatment. That’s understandable. To help me get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, maybe… a couple of weeks ago? It wasn’t much at first, just a little bigger than usual. But it’s gotten worse each day, I think. It’s mostly in my right leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it began about two weeks ago, gradually worsening, and is primarily located in your right leg. Is the swelling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty much always there now. At first, it went down when I put my leg up, but not anymore. It feels… heavy, all the time. And sometimes it’s a little bit painful, like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Alright, constant swelling now, doesn't improve with elevation, and you're experiencing a dull ache. Has anything specific made it worse – like standing for long periods, or any particular activity?
PATIENT: Oh, standing, yes! Definitely standing. And… walking a lot. If I try to do too much, it gets really bad. I try not to, but… you know. I still have things to do. Sitting helps a little, but it never goes away completely.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, standing and walking aggravate the swelling, while sitting offers some, but not complete, relief. Have you noticed any changes in the skin of your right leg – any redness, warmth, or any sores or breaks in the skin?
PATIENT: No, not really. The skin feels… normal, I think. Maybe a little bit tighter, because of the swelling. But no redness or anything like that. No cuts or anything. It just… looks puffy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No redness, warmth, or breaks in the skin – just the puffiness. Now, thinking about your cancer treatment, do you recall what type of treatment you received?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a bit of a blur, to be honest. I had… chemotherapy, I think. And… radiation? Yes, definitely radiation. It was a long time ago, and there were so many appointments. I can't remember the specifics, I'm afraid. It was at the hospital, you know, the big one downtown.
DOCTOR: I understand; it’s perfectly normal to not remember all the details after a course of treatment like that. Chemotherapy and radiation… okay. And do you happen to recall if you had any surgery as part of your cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… I think so. A small surgery on my… lymph nodes, maybe? In my groin. It was a long time ago, and they put me to sleep, so I don’t remember much. It was right after the chemotherapy, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially a surgery involving your lymph nodes in the groin following the chemotherapy. That’s helpful to know. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the swelling, such as pain in your chest, shortness of breath, or any fever or chills?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the leg. No chest pain, I can breathe alright, and no fever or anything. It's just… annoying, and I worry about it, you know? Is it the cancer coming back?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It’s completely natural to worry. We'll do our best to figure out what's going on. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Aside from the cancer treatment, do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. I used to have high blood pressure, but the doctor gave me pills for it, and it's been alright for years. I don’t think I have anything else… nothing major, anyway. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't?
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that is currently managed with medication, and generally feeling well otherwise. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the pills for the blood pressure. And… a vitamin, sometimes. Just a general one. Nothing special. I don't like taking too many pills, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, just the blood pressure medication and occasional vitamins. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat everything, and I haven’t changed anything in my diet recently.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, one last few questions regarding your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh no, never smoked. My mother smoked, and it made her so sick, so I always stayed away from it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking. Excellent. And how about alcohol consumption – do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Just a little bit, sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing heavy. It helps me relax, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, light alcohol consumption – a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. That's helpful to know. Now, Ms. Queener, I'd like to examine your leg to get a better understanding of the swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Please do. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It’s been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to gently feel your leg now. I notice some mild tenderness to the touch in the lower part of your right calf. Your pulses feel normal. The swelling appears to be primarily in your lower leg and foot. Skin temperature is normal, as you mentioned, no redness. I'm also going to measure the circumference of both your legs to see if there's a significant difference in size. There is a difference of approximately 2 centimeters in circumference between your right and left legs. This, along with the tenderness, suggests some fluid buildup. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing, but this could be related to lymphedema, which is a common side effect after lymph node removal or radiation. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as a blood clot. I want to order a Doppler ultrasound of your right leg to assess blood flow. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Lymp-e-what? Is that serious? And a blood clot? That sounds… scary. But yes, Doctor, if you think it’s necessary, please do the test. I just want to know what’s going on and make it stop, you know? The swelling, and the worry.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. Lymphedema is swelling caused by a buildup of fluid in the tissues when the lymphatic system is damaged or blocked. It’s not always serious, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can lead to other complications. We want to catch it early and manage it properly. And yes, a blood clot is something we need to rule out to ensure your safety. It’s always best to be thorough. So, I’m ordering a Doppler ultrasound of your right leg. The technician will use a handheld device to create images of the blood vessels and check for any clots. I'll also order a basic blood panel to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying causes. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the blood before you leave. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained it all very well, Doctor. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will it hurt? The tests, I mean.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. The Doppler ultrasound should only take about 30-45 minutes, and the blood panel will be relatively quick as well. The lab will let you know when the results are available, usually within 24-48 hours. They’ll likely call you directly. As for pain, the Doppler ultrasound is non-invasive; it doesn't involve any needles or incisions. You might feel a little pressure from the device, but it shouldn’t be painful. The blood draw will be a quick pinch, as usual. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend elevating your right leg whenever possible – especially when you're sitting or lying down. You can also try wearing compression stockings, which can help reduce swelling. Do you have any compression stockings already?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any compression stockings. I don’t even know where to get them. And… elevate it? I try to, but it’s hard, you know? I still have to do things.
DOCTOR: I understand; it can be difficult to manage with a busy schedule. Compression stockings are available at most pharmacies and medical supply stores. They come in different levels of compression, and the pharmacist can help you choose the right one. As for elevating your leg, even short periods of elevation throughout the day can make a difference. When you're sitting, try propping your leg up on a pillow or ottoman. In the meantime, if you notice any sudden worsening of the swelling, redness, warmth, or pain, or if you develop any chest pain or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Once we have the results of the ultrasound and blood panel, we can discuss the best course of treatment. This might include continued compression therapy, physical therapy, or other interventions. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. You’ve explained everything so clearly, Doctor. Thank you. I’m just… relieved to be getting it checked out. I’ll try to elevate my leg, and I’ll go to the pharmacy for those stockings. And I’ll watch for those things you mentioned. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Queener. I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. It's always best to be proactive about your health. The lab technician is ready for you whenever you are. They’ll get you all set up. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. Here’s a written summary of everything we discussed today, including the test orders and recommendations. I wish you all the best, and I'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you Doctor. That's very kind of you. I will, I promise. Goodbye, and thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Queener. Take care, and have a good day. .
