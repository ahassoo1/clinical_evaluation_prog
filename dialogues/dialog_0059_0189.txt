DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Why don't we start by you telling me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about time someone got around to seeing me. It’s my… well, it’s in my stool. Blood. Streaked, mind you. Not a little bit, either. And frankly, at my age, one doesn’t need these kinds of surprises. I haven’t been feeling particularly well, though I doubt anyone bothers to ask about that part.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. That certainly sounds concerning, and you're right to get it checked out. It’s good you came in. And yes, it's important to me to understand how you've been feeling overall, not just this specific issue. To start, can you tell me a little more about this blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… bright red, mostly. Not dark, thankfully. Happens every couple of days now, at least. And it’s not like a little drip, you understand. It’s… noticeable. Been going on for about a week, maybe a little longer. Honestly, I try not to look too closely. It’s unpleasant. Though I have noticed it seems to happen more after I… well, after I eat certain things. Though I haven’t been keeping track. Why would I need to keep track of that? It’s just… common sense, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Bright red blood suggests it’s likely coming from lower down in the digestive tract, which is helpful information. And it's good you've noticed a connection with certain foods, even if you haven't specifically documented them. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe those "certain foods" a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, mostly red meat. Steak, things like that. And tomatoes. Anything really… juicy. Though it's not always after those things, mind you. Sometimes it just… happens. And don't go thinking it’s just my diet, doctor. I’ve eaten steak my whole life. Never had this problem before. It's probably something serious. You young doctors always think it's something simple.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rowbottom, and you're right to want to get to the bottom of this. I assure you, I'm not dismissing anything as “simple” without a thorough investigation. It's good you've mentioned the steak and tomatoes, that’s a helpful starting point. And you're right to point out this is a new development for you, despite a long history of eating those foods. Now, aside from the blood, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… I suppose they’re a bit looser than usual. Not watery, mind you, but… not firm. And… I don’t go as often as I used to. Used to be like clockwork, you understand. Now it’s… unpredictable. And sometimes I feel a bit of cramping beforehand, though that could just be my age. Everything aches, you know. Don’t even get me started on the constipation when I don’t have… the other problem. It’s a constant battle, really. A constant battle.
DOCTOR: I understand. So looser stools, less frequent bowel movements, occasional cramping before going, and alternating with some constipation. That gives me a better sense of things. Have you noticed any pain during a bowel movement, or any blood on the toilet paper even when there isn't blood in the stool itself?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, sometimes a bit of a twinge, mind you. Nothing major. I’ve lived a long life, aches and pains are to be expected. And yes, there’s usually a bit of red on the paper. Not a lot, just… a smear. Happens almost every time, even when the stool itself isn’t… dramatic. I really don’t enjoy looking, you understand. It’s unpleasant. You doctors and your questions. Always poking and prodding. It’s a bit invasive, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if my questions feel invasive. I assure you, I'm only asking these things to get a complete picture of what's going on and to help determine the best course of action. So, to summarize, you’ve been experiencing bright red blood in your stool, happening a couple of times a week for about a week or so, often associated with red meat or tomatoes, but not always. You’ve also noticed looser stools, less frequent bowel movements, occasional cramping beforehand, and a small amount of blood on the toilet paper almost every time. Is that an accurate summary?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s about right. You’re good at repeating things, I’ll give you that. Though it all sounds rather… alarming when you say it like that. It’s probably something serious. I just have a feeling. My father had… well, never mind. It’s not relevant. But it was something unpleasant. Very unpleasant. I expect you’ll want to poke around, won’t you? Is there anything… invasive I should prepare myself for? I’m not a young man, you understand. Everything takes longer. And hurts more.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Mr. Rowbottom, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s good to be thorough. Given your symptoms and your family history, a proper investigation is definitely warranted. Yes, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a physical exam, including a rectal exam. This will allow me to check for any abnormalities. I understand your concerns about discomfort, and I'll do everything I can to make it as comfortable as possible. We can take it slow, and if at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. I would also like to order a stool test to check for blood and other potential issues. And depending on the results of those tests, we may need to consider a colonoscopy to get a more detailed look at your colon. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Good heavens. That sounds… dreadful. Poking around inside me? No, I don't like the sound of that at all. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't you just… give me something for it? Something to stop the bleeding? I don’t want to be poked and prodded. I’ve lived a long life, doctor. I don’t need any more unpleasantness. I suppose… a stool test is alright. But no colonoscopy. Absolutely not. I'm not putting up with that. You young doctors and your fancy procedures. It's all just… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom. A colonoscopy isn't the most pleasant procedure, and I respect your wishes. We can certainly start with the stool test. However, I do want to be upfront: without a colonoscopy, it will be difficult to determine the exact cause of the bleeding and rule out any serious underlying conditions. The stool test will give us some information, but it won't be as definitive. We can discuss the results once they come back, and then we can reassess the situation and decide on the best course of action. For now, let's focus on getting the stool test ordered. I'll give you instructions on how to collect the sample. I'll also write you a prescription for a stool blood detection kit. In the meantime, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
