DOCTOR: "Bula and hello, Tasmia. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have all day. The blood pressure thing… my husband made me come. He worries too much. It was high at a check-up, that’s all. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: "Okay, I understand. It's good your husband looks out for you, and it's good you're here getting it checked out, even if you feel fine. Sometimes blood pressure can be high without any symptoms. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little more about that check-up?
PATIENT: Thorough? Honestly. It was at that quick clinic over by the highway. Just a standard thing with the new job. They took my blood, weighed me… you know, the usual. Didn't even really talk to me about it, just handed me a paper saying it was a little high and to see a doctor. It was probably just the machine. Those places aren't exactly known for having good equipment.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that gives me a little more to work with. It’s good to know it was a new job physical. And you're right to question if the machine was accurate. We'll definitely check it again here. Do you happen to remember what the reading was, or anything else on that paper they gave you?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. I threw the paper away. Honestly, it was just numbers. Something like… 140 over… 90? Maybe? I don't sit around memorizing blood pressure numbers. It was a while ago, too. Like, a month maybe? I've been perfectly normal since then, as far as I can tell. I've been busy with work, haven’t had time to worry about it.
DOCTOR: "Okay, 140 over 90… that is a little elevated, yes. And a month ago is good information. Just to get a better picture, have you ever been told you had high blood pressure before this check-up?
PATIENT: No. Never. My mom’s side is healthy as horses. She lived to be ninety-something. My dad… well, he had everything, but that wasn’t from blood pressure. I’ve always been… fine. I eat okay, I don’t sit around all day, I’m not stressed. It’s probably just… a fluke. Can we just take my blood pressure and be done with it? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: "I understand your wanting to get this over with quickly. We can definitely check your blood pressure, and we will. But before we do, just to be thorough, let me ask a few quick questions about your overall health. It helps me get a complete picture, even if everything feels normal. Have you had any other medical problems, like diabetes or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I’m fine. And I don’t do medical problems. My husband is the one who always ends up with something. No diabetes, no kidney problems, nothing. He worries about everything. Can we please just get this over with? I really don’t have time for a life story. I work a lot of hours, you know. Civil engineering isn’t exactly a relaxing job.
DOCTOR: “Okay, I appreciate you telling me that. No history of medical problems is good to know. Just one more quick question, then we will get your blood pressure checked. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes. But that’s it. Seriously, that’s it. My husband tries to get me to take all sorts of things, but I don’t believe in filling my body with stuff it doesn’t need. He’s always reading about things online. It’s ridiculous. Can we please just take the reading now? I’m starting to get a headache from all this.
DOCTOR: “Alright, Tasmia, let’s do that. We’ll get your blood pressure checked. I’m just going to have you sit here for a few minutes and relax. Then I'll take a reading. Just try to breathe normally, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry up about it. I have a meeting later. And try not to poke me too much with that thing. I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: “No needles today, just the cuff. I’ll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. I’m just wrapping this around your arm now… and breathe normally for me. It will squeeze for a few seconds.” "Okay, that was 148 over 92. A little high, unfortunately.”
PATIENT: Ugh. See? I knew it was a bad machine. It’s probably just nerves being here, okay? This whole thing is stressful. Can we just try it again? Maybe if I relax a little more? I really don't want to have to take pills. I don't do pills.
DOCTOR: “That’s perfectly reasonable, Tasmia. It’s good we're checking it again. Being in a doctor’s office can raise your blood pressure a bit. Let’s take another reading in a few minutes after you’ve had a chance to relax. Just try to focus on your breathing… deep breaths in, and slow breaths out. We’ll give it five minutes.” “Just sit quietly, and we’ll get this sorted out.”
PATIENT: Whatever. Five minutes. Don’t expect miracles. This whole thing is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: “Okay, Tasmia, let’s try that blood pressure reading again. Try to relax… deep breaths.” “Okay, that’s 152 over 94. Still elevated.” “Unfortunately, that’s consistently high. It’s not just the machine, and it doesn’t seem to be improving with relaxation.”
PATIENT: Ugh. Seriously? See? This is what happens when I go to the doctor. It's always something. Okay, fine. What does this mean? Is it going to kill me? I have things to do, okay? I can't just be… sick. My husband is going to be thrilled. He's been trying to get me to come in for years. What now? Pills? I told you, I don't do pills!
DOCTOR: “Okay, Tasmia, let's take a deep breath. It’s not going to kill you, and we’re going to figure this out together. Consistently high blood pressure, or hypertension, means your heart is working harder than it should. It can increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems down the road, but it’s very manageable. And we have options. “Pills are often the most effective treatment, but they’re not the only option. First, we need to do some more testing to see why your blood pressure is high. That might include blood work and a urine test. We also need to talk about lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise. It's possible we can get it under control with those changes alone, but we need to monitor it closely. "Before we get into those details, do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? Like what? You want me to start running marathons? I work a twelve-hour day, okay? I don’t have time for that. And blood work? Urine tests? Seriously? This is ridiculous. Is it going to be expensive? My insurance is okay, but… Look, my husband handles all that stuff. He's the one who's always worried about everything. What about… what about just waiting a month and trying it again? Maybe it was just stress. This whole thing is stressing me out more! I don’t see why I need all these tests.
DOCTOR: “Okay, I understand your concerns, and you’re right to ask about cost and time commitment. Running marathons isn’t necessary! Lifestyle changes can be as simple as making small adjustments to your diet – reducing salt intake, eating more fruits and vegetables, and incorporating a little more physical activity into your day. Even a 30-minute walk a few times a week can make a difference. “As for the tests, they help us determine why your blood pressure is elevated. It could be something easily treatable, or it could be a sign of an underlying issue we need to address. Ignoring it won't make it go away, and it could lead to more serious problems down the line. We could try waiting a month, but I strongly recommend against it, given your consistently high readings. "The blood work is pretty standard – it checks your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. The urine test checks for protein, which can be a sign of kidney damage. I can give you a list of labs that are covered by your insurance. And I'll be happy to discuss the results with you in detail. Would you be willing to consider the blood work and urine test?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But my husband is going to kill me if I have to take time off work. He's already complaining that I'm not eating enough vegetables. And if it costs a fortune, I’m blaming you. Can’t you just… give me something for it? A pill or something? Just so I can get this over with? I have a deadline next week, okay? This is really bad timing. Just… the least amount of testing possible, okay? And a pill if you can.
DOCTOR: "Okay, I understand. We can certainly start with the least amount of testing possible, and we can discuss medication options if the initial tests don't give us a clear picture. I’ll order a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel – those will give us a good starting point. We can hold off on the urine test for now. "As for medication, there are many different types of blood pressure pills available. Some have side effects, while others don’t. It might take some trial and error to find the right one for you. We'll start with the lowest possible dose and monitor your blood pressure closely. “I’ll write you a lab order and give you a list of covered labs. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Two weeks? Ugh. Okay, fine. But if I have to take time off work, I'm blaming you. And no complicated pills, okay? Just something simple. And if I feel weird, I’m calling you. I don’t want any side effects messing up my schedule. Just… get me the paper, okay? I want to get this over with. And tell me which labs take my insurance. My husband does all the paperwork, but I'll have to tell him. He's going to be thrilled. Seriously.
DOCTOR: “Okay, absolutely. I’ll make sure to write down the names and addresses of the labs that accept your insurance. I'll also include information about potential side effects of common blood pressure medications. And please, please call me if you feel weird or experience any unusual symptoms – that’s what I’m here for. “Here’s the lab order, and here’s a list of covered labs. I’ve also included a handout about hypertension and lifestyle modifications. I’ve scheduled your follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No. Just… let me get this over with. I have a meeting. .
DOCTOR: “Okay, Tasmia. You have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll see you in two weeks.”
