DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Abady, you say? Yes, well, it’s all rather…new. New town, new doctor. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why they sent me. Something about a…social visit? Medicare insisted. It’s all quite bothersome, really. I’m perfectly capable, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It seems Medicare sometimes initiates these wellness visits to ensure everything is running smoothly, especially with a recent relocation. It’s a good precaution, even if you’re feeling quite well. So, to clarify, you were not experiencing any specific health concerns that prompted you to seek medical attention yourself?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not! I assure you, I am in…reasonable health. A bit of creaking, perhaps, you understand. Being my age. But nothing a sensible woman can’t manage. Honestly, all this fuss… What exactly are you hoping to find? It feels like a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your feeling that it may be a waste of time, Candice. And I assure you, my intention isn’t to find something that isn’t there. This is simply an opportunity for us to get to know each other, review your overall health, and ensure you have the resources you need to maintain your well-being. Perhaps we can start with a brief review of your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, dear. That's a long story. And frankly, I don't recall half of it. Doctors come and go, you know? They scribble things down, and then…well, who knows where it all ends up? I suppose I've always been fairly…robust. Not much bothers me. Though my husband, bless his heart, insists I saw a specialist for my…blood pressure, years ago. But it was nothing serious, I’m certain. Really, I don't have time for all this recounting. Can't we just skip it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with remembering details from the past, Candice. It’s perfectly alright if you don't recall everything. We can certainly keep it brief. Knowing about that past history of blood pressure is helpful, even if it was years ago. Do you recall approximately when that was, or what specialist you saw?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years…decades, I should think. It was back when we lived…somewhere else. Not here, obviously. A different state, perhaps? And the doctor’s name… entirely escapes me. A young man, I believe. Very…attentive. Everything is such a blur, you understand. I truly don't want to waste your time digging through the recesses of my memory. Is it absolutely necessary? Perhaps my husband remembers. He has a knack for those things.
DOCTOR: I understand your difficulty recalling specifics, Candice. It's not crucial to pinpoint the exact details right now. However, knowing if you’ve been treated for high blood pressure in the past can help us assess your current risk. Perhaps we can proceed with a quick check of your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then we can discuss any current medications or allergies you might have?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Blood pressure, you say? Very well. But do hurry. I have appointments, you know. And honestly, I haven’t the slightest idea what I take. My husband manages all of that. He has a little chart…somewhere in the kitchen, I believe. It's terribly organized, which is both a blessing and a curse. Allergies? No, I don’t think so. Unless you count dust, and frankly, who doesn't react to dust?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. This will only take a moment. And no worries at all about the medications; we can certainly look into that later. It’s quite common for family members to manage those things. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92. Your pulse is 78, and your temperature is normal at 98.6. Given this slightly elevated reading, it may be worthwhile to discuss some lifestyle adjustments and potentially monitor your blood pressure at home. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Honestly! I’ve been perfectly fine all morning. It must be the…the environment. This town is terribly stressful, you know? New faces, new shops…it’s all quite unsettling. Lifestyle adjustments? What on earth does that involve? I eat a sensible diet – mostly – and I get plenty of…sitting done. I fail to see what adjustments are necessary. Monitor it at home? Do you mean I have to…poke myself with needles? I absolutely refuse. This is becoming quite ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Candice. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed with a new environment, and that can certainly affect your blood pressure. To clarify, we wouldn’t be poking yourself with needles. We could provide you with a simple blood pressure monitor to use at home, and you would simply wrap a cuff around your arm to take a reading. It’s a painless process. However, if you are not comfortable with that, we can certainly discuss other options. Perhaps a one-time blood pressure check at a local pharmacy would be a good starting point?
