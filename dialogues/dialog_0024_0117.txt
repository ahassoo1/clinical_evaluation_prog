DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Look, I ain't got a lot of time. Been coughin’… and there’s… stuff. Red stuff. When I cough. I smoke, see? Always have. It's probably that. Just want to know if it’s… bad. Real bad.
DOCTOR: “Probably” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Reyno. And while I understand your…concerns about time, a proper assessment is crucial. “Red stuff,” you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, red. Like… when you get a cut, you know? Not a lot, but enough to worry me. It ain’t just clear stuff anymore. Happens mostly in the mornings, I think. Or after I've been workin’ a long shift. Dispatchin’ power… it's stressful. I forget things easily, so it’s hard to say exactly when.
DOCTOR: Dispatching, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Power. To the towns around here. Keeps the lights on, the water pumpin’. It’s… a lot of responsibility. Long hours. Been doin’ it… a long time now. I really just need to know if this cough is gonna get me outta commission. I got bills to pay.
DOCTOR: So, a chronic cough with hemoptysis… potentially linked to your… lifestyle choices and occupation. Have you ever been formally diagnosed with anything respiratory, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Hemop… what now? Look, Doc, I just told you I smoke. That’s probably it. Never been told I had anything wrong with my lungs. Just… always coughed a little. Gets worse when it’s cold, or dusty. Never seen a specialist, never had no tests. Just… cough drops and kept workin’. You know how it is. Can’t afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: I see no previous pulmonary evaluations documented here. And while self-diagnosis is… convenient, it is rarely accurate. Now, beyond the cough and… red expectorate, have you experienced any shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, or fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I figured it was the heat. Shortness of breath… sometimes, yeah. When I walk up hills. But I'm not a young man anymore. Chest pain… not really pain, exactly. More like… a tightness. Like somethin’ heavy sittin’ on me. Happens when I cough a lot. Mostly when I'm tired. Does that make sense? I forget things, see?
DOCTOR: “Forget things,” you say again. Is this a recent development, or has this been ongoing?
PATIENT: It's… always been a little bad. But worse lately. Like… I’ll start a sentence and forget what I was gonna say. Or I’ll walk into a room and not remember why. It ain’t good for dispatchin’, let me tell ya. Gotta remember codes, procedures… everything. It’s scary, actually. But I don’t got time to worry about that right now. I need to know about the cough. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. I need to auscultate your lungs, check your oxygen saturation, and assess your overall condition. Please remove your shirt. I understand your time is valuable, but a proper assessment is paramount.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. I don’t like doctors much. Always poking and proddin’. Hurry it up, if you can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… and again. Diminished breath sounds bilaterally, with scattered rhonchi in the lower lobes. Oxygen saturation is 92% on room air, which is… less than ideal. No significant edema noted. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. Dullness to percussion in the lower lobes bilaterally. Mr. Reyno, I'm concerned. These findings suggest… possible underlying pathology. We need to order a chest X-ray immediately. And I recommend a sputum culture to rule out infection.
PATIENT: X-ray? Sputum… what? Look, Doc, is this gonna be expensive? I got Medicare, but… you know how it is. And… is it bad? Like, really bad? I got work to do. People depend on me. I can’t be laid up in a hospital. Just tell me straight. Is it my smokin’? Is that all it is?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis without further investigation. However, your smoking history is undoubtedly a significant contributing factor. The hemoptysis, diminished breath sounds, and rhonchi are all concerning findings. While it could be a simple bronchitis, we must rule out more serious possibilities, such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or even… malignancy. The X-ray and sputum culture are necessary to determine the extent of the problem. As for cost, I cannot estimate that. You will need to contact Medicare directly. And frankly, your immediate concern should be your health, not the expense. I will have the nurse draw up the orders for these tests. We need to act quickly, Mr. Reyno. Nurse, please prepare the orders for a chest X-ray and sputum culture for Mr. Reyno. STAT. We will discuss the results as soon as they are available. Now, are there any other symptoms I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Malignancy? You mean… cancer? Oh, Lord. No. No, that can’t be it. I… I ain’t felt nothin’ else. Just tired. Real tired. And… a little short of breath. But that’s the hills, right? I walk a lot. For work. To check the lines. No fever, no night sweats, nothin’ like that. Just… tired. And this cough. Look, Doc, can’t I just… get some stronger medicine? Antibiotics or somethin’? I gotta get back to work. People need the power. I can’t… I can’t afford to be sick. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, I understand your concerns, but prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis is… irresponsible. A simple antibiotic will not address potential underlying pathology. The fatigue and shortness of breath could be related to a number of factors, including a respiratory infection, COPD, or even… a more serious condition. We must investigate this further. I will order the tests. The nurse will schedule them for you immediately. I strongly advise you to follow up with a pulmonologist as soon as possible to discuss the results and determine the appropriate course of treatment. Now, is there anything else you wish to discuss before I conclude this examination?
