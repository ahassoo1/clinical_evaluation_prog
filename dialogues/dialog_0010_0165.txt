DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just…fevers. Keep comin’ back. It’s been botherin’ me for a bit now, honestly. Not fun, especially in this heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, fevers… and how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Started… back in June, I guess. On and off. It’ll go away for a few days, then bam, it’s back again. Maybe a week or so at a time when it is back. It's hard to keep track, to be honest. I'm retired now, so the days kinda blend together.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. On and off since June. And when the fever comes back, can you tell me about any other symptoms you experience with it?
PATIENT: Well, usually I just feel really tired. Like, really tired. And achy, all over. Nothin’ major, but enough to make me wanna just lay around. Sometimes a little bit of a cough, but not a bad one. No chills, though. And I haven’t been sick to my stomach or anything like that. Just…tired and achy with a temperature.
DOCTOR: Okay, tired, achy, temperature, and a mild cough. No chills or gastrointestinal symptoms. Have you been checking your temperature at home, and if so, do you know what the highest it’s been?
PATIENT: Yeah, my wife makes me. She worries. Usually around 101, 102 when it’s bad. Sometimes a little higher, but not much. It usually comes down with some Tylenol, but then it just comes back a day or two later. I really don’t like taking pills, Doc. Just want to figure out why I keep getting this fever.
DOCTOR: Alright, 101 to 102 with the Tylenol helping temporarily. I understand your reluctance to take medication. Let’s see if we can get to the bottom of this. Have you noticed any patterns to when the fever returns?
PATIENT: Patterns… hmm. Not really, not that I can think of. It doesn’t seem to be after I eat anything specific, or after bein’ in the sun. I used to think maybe it was when I helped my son with yard work, but even when I take it easy, it still comes back. Honestly, it just seems kinda random. Which is what’s so frustrating about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear triggers that you’ve been able to identify. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently – even within the country – in the past few months?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven't left Puerto Rico in… oh, must be five years now. My wife and I used to travel a lot more, but… well, getting older, you know? It's just easier to stay close to home these days. Everything we need is right here.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. No recent travel. And have you been exposed to anyone else who has been sick recently?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. My grandkids came to visit last month, but they were all healthy as horses. My son and his wife, same thing. Nobody’s been coughin’ or sneezin’ around here, so I doubt it’s that. Honestly, Doc, I'm startin' to think it’s just somethin’ old people get. Is that even a thing?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily something old people get, Mr. Brege, but sometimes our immune systems change as we age, and that can make us more susceptible to certain things. Let's go over your medical history a bit to see if we can narrow things down. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. High blood pressure, Doc told me to watch my salt, but that's about it. And my back… it gets achy sometimes, that’s why I see a chiropractor regular. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for my age. Used to be real active, played softball for years. Just slowin' down a bit now, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with diet, and back pain treated with chiropractic care. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had my appendix out when I was a kid, that's about it. Real simple operation, back in the 60s. Everything else, just bumps and bruises, nothin’ serious. Never had to go under the knife since then. Thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removed as a child, otherwise no surgeries. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to nothin'. My wife’s the one with allergies. Pollen, dust, cats… she's got a whole list. I just get a little sniffly when it's cold. Not a big deal.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – besides the Tylenol for the fever?
PATIENT: Just the Tylenol when I need it, Doc. And sometimes a little bit of something for my back, but that’s it. My chiropractor gives me some cream to rub on it. Otherwise, I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. They always make me feel weird.
DOCTOR: Alright, just Tylenol and topical cream for your back. Okay, Mr. Brege, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your temperature. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, Doc. Whatever you need to do. Just want to get this figured out. I got things to do, you know? Grandkids comin' over next week, gotta be able to play with 'em.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale. Okay, good. Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. Feels… normal, I guess. A little bit sensitive sometimes, but I think that’s just from gettin’ older. My wife says I gotta watch what I eat, but I like my food!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No significant tenderness. Temperature is 101.2 Fahrenheit. And let me just take a look at your throat… Throat is a little bit red, but no obvious signs of infection. Your lymph nodes don’t feel swollen. Alright, Mr. Brege, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your recurring fevers right now. It could be a viral infection that keeps coming back, or something else. Given your age and the fact that it’s been going on for a while, I’d like to order some blood work just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Blood work’s fine. Better to be safe than sorry, right? Just… how long’s that gonna take? And will I need to fast or anything? I like my breakfast.
DOCTOR: You’re right, better to be safe. The blood work shouldn’t take too long, just a standard panel. And no, you don't need to fast. You can have breakfast as usual. The lab is just down the hall; I’ll have a requisition slip ready for you. It will take a few days for the results to come back, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, continue to manage your fever with Tylenol as needed. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that's it, Doc. Just get these tests done and hopefully figure out what’s goin’ on. Thanks for listenin’ to me. I appreciate it. Now, where's that lab you were talkin' about?
