DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my back. It’s been…painful, yeah. Just really bothering me lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, “painful lately.” Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… where to start? It's not like a sudden thing, you know? It’s been building up for a few weeks now, I guess. It’s mostly in my lower back, right around here . It feels kinda dull most of the time, but sometimes I get sharp pains if I bend over or try to lift something.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over a few weeks, lower back pain, dull ache with sharper pains on bending or lifting. Does anything relieve the pain, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, good question. Lying down flat usually helps a bit. And… warm baths, those feel good too. But it doesn’t last long, you know? As soon as I get up and start moving around, it starts acting up again.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lying flat and warm baths provide some temporary relief. And it worsens with movement. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs, or any numbness or tingling in your feet or toes?
PATIENT: You know, now that you mention it… yeah, a little. Not constant, but sometimes I get a bit of tingling in my left foot. It’s not too bad, but it’s definitely there sometimes. It's more like a pins and needles feeling, you know? It comes and goes. .
DOCTOR: Alright, tingling in the left foot, intermittent pins and needles sensation. Have you experienced any weakness in either of your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. I haven’t really noticed anything, not really. Maybe a little bit slower getting out of a chair sometimes, but I just figured that was getting old, you know? It’s hard to say if it's weakness or just…slower. I haven’t dropped anything or tripped or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no noticeable weakness, just a sense of being slower getting up from a chair. Have you had any recent changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Bowel or bladder habits…? Not that I've noticed, Doctor. Everything seems pretty normal there. Sorry, that’s a bit of a personal question, isn’t it? .
DOCTOR: It is a bit personal, and I apologize if it made you uncomfortable, Mr. Way. We just need to rule things out. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis or diabetes?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Nothing major. I had high blood pressure for a little while, but the doctor said it was okay now. Just gotta watch my salt, he said. And… I think I had a bad case of the flu a few years back, but that’s about it. I don't really go to the doctor much. . Never had any surgeries or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: Okay, previously diagnosed with high blood pressure that’s currently managed, and a past bout of the flu. No surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… My mom had arthritis in her knees, pretty bad towards the end. And my dad… he had heart trouble, I think. He passed away when I was pretty young, so I don’t remember a whole lot about it. Nothing else really sticks out in my mind. A lot of us just… get old, you know? .
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis in your mother and heart trouble in your father. And before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to any medicines the few times I have needed them. Penicillin, aspirin… I think I’ve taken both at some point. No problems. .
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a multi-vitamin, every morning. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for the pain, when it gets really bad. Nothing else, Doctor. Really. . I try not to take too much of the ibuprofen, though. It doesn't seem to help much anyway, long-term.
DOCTOR: Okay, multi-vitamin daily and ibuprofen as needed for pain. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam of your back?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Go ahead. I figured you'd want to take a look. I'm ready when you are. .
DOCTOR: Great. First, I'm going to have you lie face down on the examination table. Okay, now I’m going to gently palpate your lower back to check for tenderness and muscle spasm. Please let me know if anything is particularly painful. Okay, I'm noticing some tenderness right here, on the left side. And there's some muscle spasm, as well. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion. Can you bend forward as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Yeah, that spot is tender. Ouch. Okay, bending forward… It’s kinda hard, you know? It feels tight. I can't bend as far as I used to be able to, that's for sure. It really hurts when I get to about here. .
DOCTOR: Alright, limited range of motion with pain at a certain point. Now, I’m going to have you lie on your back. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Your reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, I’m going to lightly touch your legs and feet with this, and tell me when you feel it. Okay, sensation is intact on both sides. Finally, I'm going to do a straight leg raise test. Can you keep your leg straight as I lift it up?
PATIENT: Okay, on my back now. Alright, lifting my leg… Oh, yeah, that makes the pain shoot down my leg a little bit. Not too bad, but I definitely feel it. More in the back of my leg, kind of like a tingling. . It's not a sharp pain, more like… a stretching feeling. But definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. The straight leg raise test elicited pain radiating down your left leg. Okay, based on the physical exam and your history, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain with possible sciatica. The muscle spasm and tenderness in your lower back point to the strain, and the radiating pain down your leg suggests some irritation of the sciatic nerve. To confirm this and rule out other causes, I recommend getting an X-ray of your lumbar spine. It will help us see if there are any structural problems contributing to your pain. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. A lumbar strain… sciatica… I think I’ve heard of that. An X-ray… yeah, that sounds good. If it helps figure out what's going on, absolutely. I’d rather know, you know? It's just… I don’t have insurance, Doctor. How much would that cost? .
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Way. I understand not having insurance can make things complicated. Let me check the cost for a lumbar spine X-ray at this clinic. Okay, the X-ray itself is $150. There is a small fee for the radiologist to read it, which is another $75. So, the total cost would be $225. We do have a payment plan option available, if that would be helpful. In the meantime, while we wait for the X-ray results, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, applying heat or ice to your lower back, and gentle stretching exercises. Avoid any heavy lifting or activities that worsen your pain. I can give you a handout with some recommended stretches. Would you like the handout and information about the payment plan?
PATIENT: $225… Okay, that's… manageable, I guess. Still not ideal, but manageable. Yeah, a handout with the stretches would be great, Doctor. And information about the payment plan too, just to see what my options are. Thank you. I appreciate you checking for me. It's good to know there's something I can do in the meantime besides just… hurting. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Way. I'm glad we could discuss the options. Here’s the handout with some gentle stretches you can try at home. Start slowly and don't push yourself too hard. The handout also describes some things to avoid. And here is the payment plan information. You can take it home and review it at your leisure. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment after you’ve had the X-ray, to discuss the results and create a more tailored treatment plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much for everything. I'll definitely take a look at this handout and the payment plan. And yes, a follow-up appointment would be great. Let's just get this figured out, you know? . I really appreciate your patience with me and explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m happy to help. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the X-ray for you and then we can get a follow-up appointment on the calendar. Is there a particular day or time that works best for you to schedule the X-ray?
PATIENT: Any weekday morning would be fine, Doctor. I’m retired, so I don’t really have a set schedule. Just whatever’s easiest for them. Don't want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll let the receptionist know you’re flexible with weekday mornings. They’ll call you to confirm the appointment time. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. You've been very helpful. Thank you again for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I feel a lot better just knowing what might be going on and having a plan. I'll see you after the X-ray then.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Mr. Way. Remember to start those gentle stretches and don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Take care.
