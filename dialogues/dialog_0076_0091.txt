DOCTOR: Right, Bianca Zicarelli. 63. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, good morning, Doctor. Well, is just... I does be very, very thirsty lately. And hungry too. Is not a normal hungry, you know? Is like I can eat and eat and still feel empty. Is happening for maybe, two, three weeks now.
DOCTOR: Two, three weeks… alright. And… any weight loss with all this eating?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm... I not sure, Doctor. I have not really check the scale. My husband, he does that usually. But I does feel... lighter, maybe? Not a bad lighter, but not like I gain weight either, you understand? Is hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you… urinating more frequently than usual?
PATIENT: Urinating? Yes, Doctor, I does go to the bathroom more times. Especially at night! Is disturbing my sleep, it does. I have to get up, maybe two, three times in the night. Is not good for an old woman like me, you know?
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, nocturia… Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm... Well, I does feel a little tired all the time. Not sick tired, just... weary, like. And sometimes, my vision does get a little blurry, especially when I look far away. Is that important, Doctor? I not sure if is connected, you understand. Old age does things to you, eh?
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, fatigue… alright. Let's have a quick look at your vitals, and I’ll do a brief physical exam. Just to rule things out. Blood pressure, pulse… and I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Then we’ll see. Don’t get too worried, probably just something minor.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sound good. I trust you. You does seem to know what you doing. I just want to feel normal again, you understand? This thirst and hunger is really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Heart sounds… regular, but a little rapid. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes… and I'll do a quick foot exam. Reflexes are normal. Feet seem okay, no loss of sensation. Now, I'm going to order some blood work. Basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and a hemoglobin A1c. That will give us a better idea of what's going on.
PATIENT: Blood work? Okay, Doctor. Is that to check the sugar, yes? My mother, she had the sugar, you understand? Is that what you thinking? I hope is not that.
DOCTOR: It’s just standard procedure, Mrs. Zicarelli. We need to rule things out. The A1c will give us an average blood sugar level over the past few months. It could be diabetes, but it could be something else entirely. Don't jump to conclusions. The lab results will take a couple of days. We’ll call you with the results. In the meantime, try to limit sugary drinks and snacks. And I’ll give you a requisition form for the lab. Don’t worry too much. We’ll figure it out.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I understand. No sugary drinks, yes? I does like a little juice sometimes, but I will try to cut back. Is this the address for the lab? Is not too far from my house, I hope? My husband, he does the driving, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the address. It’s on Elm Street, not too far from the bakery. Should be easy enough to find. Now, is there anything else you want to tell me before you leave?
PATIENT: Hmm... Well, my hands does feel a little numb sometimes, you understand? Not all the time, but in the mornings, especially. I thought is just old age again, you know? And I does get very, very thirsty even after I drink water. Is strange, yes? Like the water does not stay in me. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Numbness, persistent thirst… Look, I've got other patients waiting. We'll see what the blood work says first. I’m going to write you a referral to an endocrinologist. They specialize in these types of issues. It’s best to get a specialist involved. Here’s the referral. Call their office to schedule an appointment. Now, if you'll excuse me…
PATIENT: Oh. An endocrinologist? Is that… serious, Doctor? I just want to know what is wrong with me, you understand? This thirst and hunger is really worrying me. Is… is it bad? I hope is not too bad. I will call them, yes. Thank you, Doctor. .
