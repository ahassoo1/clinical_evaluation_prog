DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Yes... well, my nephew, he says I need... a check-up. For the... the team. He says they need to make sure this old body can still... move. I don't really understand all the fuss, but he insisted. Something about a physical? Is that right?
DOCTOR: A “check-up” is a reasonable way to put it, yes. A physical exam will allow us to assess your overall health. It sounds as though this is related to some sort of team activity?
PATIENT: Team... yes. He plays... softball, I think? And he wants me to try out. Can you believe it? I haven't played in… oh, goodness, years. Decades, maybe? It's just a local thing, nothing serious. He's making a big deal out of nothing, if you ask me. But he says they need this paper from a doctor. Something about insurance... Medicare, I think?
DOCTOR: Right. Insurance requirements are… commonplace. And it’s prudent to ensure you are physically capable of participating, regardless of the level of competition. Medicare will likely require documentation of a health assessment before covering any potential injuries. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? No, not really. I used to have a doctor back… back in the city. But that was… a long time ago. Things were different then. I mostly just… dealt with things as they came up. A little ache here, a little pain there. Nothing a good rest couldn't fix. I don’t even remember his name, to be honest. It was… Dr. something. Old man, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Hmm… let me think. There was that time… oh, what was it… I fell off a ladder. Fixing the roof. Broke my… my arm, I think? It was a bad break. Needed a cast. That was… a long time ago, though. Before the divorce, definitely. And… I think I had pneumonia once. Very bad fever. But that was… a long time ago, too. Everything feels like a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. Just… sometimes I take something for my stomach. It gets a little upset sometimes. Something for heartburn, I think? The little pink pills. I buy them at the drugstore. Don’t even know the name of them. And… sometimes a little something for my knees. They ache, you know? Especially when it’s cold. But that’s it. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. I eat everything. Always have. My ex-wife, she was always worried about everything, always checking labels. I never paid much attention to it. Maybe… maybe I got a little itchy once, after eating some shellfish? But it could have been anything. It was a long time ago. I really don’t know. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives have had any serious medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That’s a tough one. My mother… she had… something. With her heart, I think. She was always tired. And my father… he worked in the construction trades, like me. He had bad back problems. Always complaining about his back. And… my sister, she had… I don’t know. Something with her blood pressure, maybe? She lived in Florida, so I didn’t see her much. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t remember a lot of details. It was a long time ago, and we weren't very close.
DOCTOR: Very well. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Tried it once, back when I was younger, but didn't like it. Made me cough. Drink? Sometimes. A beer or two with my nephew, on the weekends. Nothing serious. And… recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a working man, Doctor. I don’t have time for that nonsense. Always have been. Always will be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Thank you for that information, though I must say it’s… somewhat limited. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of your current health status. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical… examination? Yes, I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have things to do, you know. But… alright, go ahead. Just… be gentle, if you could. This old body isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll proceed as efficiently as possible. First, I'll check your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Please sit here on the examination table. Relax your arm, please. And try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Breathing... yes, I can do that. It’s just… these places always make me nervous. Too many smells, you know? And all the instruments… What are all those things for, anyway? It’s not like I’m expecting to be… operated on, or anything. Just a check-up, right?
DOCTOR: 142/88. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Breathe normally, Mr. Bartok. Just relax. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Lungs are clear, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's likely benign, but we'll want to monitor it.
PATIENT: A murmur? What’s a murmur? Does that mean something’s… broken? My mother had something with her heart, you know. Is that what this is? I told you, Doctor, I shouldn’t have come here. This is just going to cause me stress. I just wanted to get this paper for my nephew, so he’d stop bothering me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, a murmur simply means there is an extra sound when your heart beats. It doesn't necessarily indicate anything is broken. It can be perfectly normal, especially with age. However, it warrants further investigation to rule out any underlying issues. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arm relaxed. And tell me if you feel anything.
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, I felt that! What are you trying to do, check if I’m a robot? I have feelings, you know! And my knees ache, remember? That can't be a good sign. This is ridiculous. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: The reflex test assesses the function of your nervous system. A diminished response can indicate various conditions. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, which is not uncommon at your age, but we'll need to consider it in the context of your overall health. Now, I'd like to examine your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness.
PATIENT: My abdomen? What are you looking for in there? I ate a sandwich for lunch, is that going to matter? This is very uncomfortable, Doctor. And frankly, a little insulting. I’m a perfectly healthy man, or at least I was before I came here. Just tell me what you need for the paper, and let me go. I have things to do, you know. And my stomach is a little upset… maybe that’s what you’re feeling.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is slightly tender to palpation in the lower quadrants. It could be due to a number of things – indigestion, gas, or something more significant. Given your history of intermittent stomach upset, it’s difficult to determine the cause without further investigation. Now, I’d like to check your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ouch! No! I can’t do that! My back… it’s bad, you know? Very bad. I told you, I worked in construction. Years of heavy lifting. I can barely reach my knees, let alone my toes. This is pointless, Doctor. Absolutely pointless. You’re just going to find more things wrong with me. Just give me the paper, and let’s be done with this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, based on this limited examination and your incomplete medical history, it’s difficult to provide a definitive assessment of your overall health. However, I’ve identified several areas of concern: elevated blood pressure, a heart murmur, diminished reflexes, abdominal tenderness, and limited range of motion. I recommend further testing, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG, and potentially an abdominal ultrasound. Additionally, I advise a consultation with a cardiologist and a gastroenterologist. I cannot, in good conscience, provide you with a blanket clearance for strenuous activity without a more thorough workup. It would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous.
PATIENT: What? Tests? Cardiologist? Gastroenterologist? You want to put me through all that… for a softball game? This is absurd! My nephew is going to laugh at me. He’ll think I’m crazy. I just wanted a simple check-up, a piece of paper, and then I could get on with my life. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous! I don’t need any tests. I feel fine. Mostly fine. Just… give me something to sign, something that says I’m healthy enough to play. Please. I’m begging you.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your reluctance, but I have a professional and ethical obligation to ensure your safety. Providing you with a clearance without adequate evaluation would be negligent. I cannot, and will not, sign a document stating you are healthy enough to participate in strenuous activity based on the information we have gathered today. However, I am willing to compromise. I can provide you with a summary of my findings and recommendations, which you can then present to your nephew. He can decide whether or not to proceed, but I strongly advise against participating in any physically demanding activities until you have been properly evaluated. This form will outline my concerns and the tests I recommend. It will also state that I cannot provide a clearance without further evaluation. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine… fine. Do whatever you have to do. Just… get it over with. I don’t want to argue anymore. Just… write your little notes, and I’ll take it to my nephew. He can decide. But don’t expect him to be happy about this. He’s going to be very disappointed. This whole thing… it’s a disaster. A complete and utter disaster.
DOCTOR: Here you are. As I stated, this is a summary of my findings and recommendations. Please schedule these tests with your primary care physician as soon as possible. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Thank you for your time, Mr. Bartok. .
PATIENT: Yes… alright. Thank you… I guess. This has been… most unpleasant. I'll… I'll see myself out. .
