DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Shanor. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, hello Doctor. I… need check for referee. For fitness. I want to be sure I’m okay to work games. Not get hurt, you know? It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need a physical exam to make sure you’re cleared to referee fitness games. That’s good, it’s always smart to get checked out beforehand. Just to clarify, are you currently working games, or are you hoping to start?
PATIENT: Trying to start. I… was doing it before, but… then things happened. Now I want to be sure I’m strong enough. Don't want problem. So, need check. Fast if possible? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. You want to get cleared to start refereeing again after a break, and you’d like to make this as quick as possible. I’ll do my best to be efficient. To start, can you tell me a little bit about what “things happened” refers to?
PATIENT: …It was… long time ago. My wife… she got sick. Very sick. I… stopped everything to take care of her. Then… she passed away. Now… I try to get back to normal. But I want to be sure my body is okay first. It's… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Shanor. It takes a lot of courage to get back to things after something like that. It’s completely understandable you want to make sure you’re physically able to handle it. Okay, let's focus on that now. Can you tell me about your general health?
PATIENT: General… I think okay. I don’t… get sick much. Maybe cold sometimes, like everyone. No big problem. I eat… okay food. Try to. Not much time to cook, but… I try. I walk sometimes. Not run. Walk. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy, occasional colds, you try to eat well, and you do some walking. That’s good. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never hospital. I… broke arm when little kid. Fall from tree. But… that was long time ago. Everything fixed. No big sickness. I think. Maybe… dentist a few times? Is that count?
DOCTOR: No, dentist doesn't count. So, no major illnesses or surgeries besides the broken arm as a child. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat anything. No problem with… bees or anything. I think. My wife… she had allergies, but… I don't. No, I'm good. Never had trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… sometimes painkiller for head, if headache. But not… regular. Only when need. Otherwise… no. No pills. No medicine. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Uh… my father… he had… high blood pressure. I think. He… didn’t take care of himself very well. Always smoking, eating bad food. My mother… she okay. But she… died old. So… maybe nothing. I don’t… know much about family history. We didn’t talk about it much. Sorry. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Shanor. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history. High blood pressure in your father is good to know. Before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… I work. A lot. I fix… the inside of the furnaces. Hot work. Heavy work. Sometimes I am tired. I don't drink much. Maybe beer sometimes, with friends. Not every week. I don’t smoke. Never did. I… try to sleep. But work keeps me busy. Is that enough? I don’t have… hobbies, really. Just work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you do physically demanding work, you don't drink or smoke, and you try to get enough sleep, although work is demanding. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam then. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Do quick. I… have to get back. But yes. Do it. I want to know. Quickly if can. Okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 130/85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. And finally, I’m just going to have you do a few simple movements to check your range of motion. Can you raise both of your arms overhead?
PATIENT: Yes. Like this? A little… tight. Haven’t done this in long time. Maybe because work? Heavy lifting all day. It feels… okay. But not easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. A little limited range of motion in both shoulders, likely from repetitive strain at work. And how about bending forward and touching your toes?
PATIENT: Uh… like this. Not… very good. Back feels… tight. Again, work I think. Lots of bending, lifting. Old now, maybe? Not like when young.
DOCTOR: Okay. Limited range of motion in your lower back, with some reported tightness. I’d like to get some baseline blood work done. Just a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, blood sugar, and electrolytes. It's a standard precaution. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Blood test. Fine. When? Fast? I… need to work. Can I do it tomorrow? Or after work? Quick blood test? Is possible? I want to know if okay to work games. That’s important.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s certainly possible. We can schedule the blood test for tomorrow morning, first thing, before you go to work. That will give us the most accurate results. The lab is right across the street, and it usually doesn't take long. While we wait for the results, I'm going to recommend some gentle stretching exercises for your shoulders and back. Also, be mindful of your posture at work and avoid any heavy lifting if possible. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and determine if you’re cleared to referee games. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Tomorrow. Blood test. Stretching… I try. Work is hard to not lift. But I try. You think okay to try referee games after the blood test? If the results are good? That's all I want to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Shanor. If the blood work comes back within normal limits, and you continue with the stretching exercises, you can likely try refereeing games, but listen to your body. If you feel any pain, stop immediately. I'll have the lab send the results directly to my office. You can call tomorrow afternoon to check if they're in, and we can schedule a quick follow-up phone call to discuss them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
