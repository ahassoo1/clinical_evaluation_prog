DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. Been gettin' worse, I think. Not sure exactly when it started, though. Old age, probably. Don't remember specifics so well anymore, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be hard to pinpoint when things started. A shaking… and you’ve noticed it’s been getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Yeah, worse. Or… more noticeable, maybe? I used to just… not think about it. Now it's hard to hold a cup steady, things like that. Makes life a bit… fiddly. I don't drink much coffee anymore because of it, truth be told. Spills everywhere.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s primarily in your hands, making it difficult to do things like hold a cup. And you’ve reduced your coffee intake because of the spills?
PATIENT: Right. Mostly hands, though sometimes… sometimes it feels like it’s in my whole arm. Not all the time, mind you. And… well, I wouldn't say reduced coffee. More like… stopped. Completely. Easier that way, you know? Less mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s mainly in your hands, but occasionally you feel it in your whole arm. And you’ve completely stopped drinking coffee now to avoid the spills. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… Let me think. My divorce… that was a few years back. Doesn't feel recent anymore. I… I used to do a lot of gardening, but my knees aren't what they used to be, so that’s slowed down quite a bit. And… I don't see my daughter as much as I'd like. But that's just life, I suppose. Nothing medically changed, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Jezik. Those are all important things to consider. When you say nothing medically changed, do you mean you haven’t been diagnosed with any new conditions recently, and you haven’t started any new medications?
PATIENT: No new… diagnoses, no. And medications… just a little something for my blood pressure, years ago. Stopped taking that a while back, too. Doctor said I didn't need it anymore. Can't remember which doctor, though. Everything's a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you previously took medication for blood pressure, but you’ve been off of it for some time. And no other new medical conditions diagnosed recently. Now, let’s talk about the shaking itself. Does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Thinking about it… yeah, stress, definitely. Or… when I’m trying to do something precise. Like… threading a needle. Forget about that now. Completely impossible. And… when I'm tired, it’s always worse. Honestly, most of the time it’s just there, a constant little… buzz.
DOCTOR: Okay, so stress, tasks requiring precision, and fatigue all seem to worsen the shaking. You described it as a “constant little buzz” most of the time. Do you notice any other symptoms associated with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… not that I’ve noticed, really. Maybe a little clumsy, generally. But I was always a bit clumsy. I've been falling a bit more lately, but I chalked that up to my age and my knees. It's hard to say what's causing what, you know? Everything just aches.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It can be difficult to sort out what's causing what when you have multiple things going on. Okay, Mr. Jezik, I’m going to do a brief physical exam. I’d like to check your reflexes, coordination, and balance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I just… I’d like to get this sorted out, if possible. Been putting it off for too long, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik, if you could please extend your arms in front of you, palms up. Just relax. I’m noticing a slight tremor in both of your hands, even at rest. It seems more pronounced on this side. I also notice some slight stiffness when I move your arms. Could you try tapping your fingers together, as quickly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it used to be. Always been a bit slow, though. My daughter used to tease me about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Jezik. Just a few more things. And please, don’t worry, we’ll figure this out. I’m also noting some slight difficulty with your balance. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the exam – the tremor, the stiffness, the difficulty with balance – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with essential tremor. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. We’ll need to do some blood work to check for things like thyroid problems and vitamin deficiencies. It would also be beneficial to get a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Essential… tremor? Never heard of it. Sounds… complicated. Blood work… okay, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. A neurologist… is that a specialist? More doctors… I just want to be able to hold a cup of coffee again, you know? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Jezik, that is not too much to ask. And I completely understand your frustration. A neurologist is a specialist in disorders of the nervous system, so they're the best qualified to diagnose and manage conditions like essential tremor. Essential tremor is a common condition, and while there's no cure, there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms. We'll start with the blood work to rule out other causes, and then I'll get a referral to a neurologist for you. In the meantime, I can offer some suggestions to help make things a little easier. Using larger cups with handles, stabilizing your arms when you eat or drink, and avoiding caffeine can sometimes help. I'm going to order the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and the neurologist referral. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood work, follow-up… neurologist. Bigger cups… no caffeine… I've already stopped the caffeine. Easier said than done, this whole thing. Just… let me know when I need to come back. I'll do whatever you say. I just want this… shaking… to stop. Is there anything else I need to do right now?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Jezik, there’s nothing else you need to do right now. Just head down to the lab when you have a moment, and they'll take care of the blood work. The results usually take a few days to come back. My nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they're available. In the meantime, if the shaking suddenly worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as difficulty speaking or walking, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Just… a lot to take in. Thank you, Doctor. For… listening. And for trying to help. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’ll take this one step at a time. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and take care.
