DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Kobler. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 25 years old. Welcome to the clinic. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, twenty-five is correct. Um...it's a bit difficult to explain, honestly. I've been feeling…short of breath, I suppose. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It's been happening for a little while now, but it's getting…noticeable. I don't really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: “Short of breath and dry mouth and eyes…occurring for a while.” Alright. It’s perfectly alright if it's difficult to explain; we’ll get there. When you say “a while,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A rough estimate… that is hard. Perhaps…a few months? Maybe longer. Time…it feels a little blurry, I’m afraid. I don't recall a specific date or event that made it start. It just…gradually became more apparent. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Gradually becoming more apparent. I understand. And is this shortness of breath constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I believe. It’s not always there, but it happens more frequently now. When I exert myself, it definitely gets worse. Like…walking up a hill, or even just a quick pace. Sometimes it happens when I'm resting too, though, which is…concerning. It's not a severe struggle for air, just…a tightness, and I need to consciously breathe deeper.
DOCTOR: So it's exacerbated by exertion, but also present at rest occasionally. And is this “tightness” anywhere specific, or is it generalized?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It feels…mostly in my chest, I think. Not a painful tightness, exactly, but…uncomfortable. A little like a band around my chest, perhaps? It doesn’t radiate anywhere else, as far as I can tell. I just feel… constricted. I hope that makes sense. I'm not very good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, chest tightness, not radiating, and not described as pain. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this, Ms. Kobler?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it… I have been feeling very fatigued lately. Just…tired, all the time. And my eyes feel gritty, even when I’ve slept well. And, um…sometimes my mouth feels like it's full of cotton. It's hard to explain. It's more than just being thirsty. Does that…sound right?
DOCTOR: Fatigue, gritty eyes, and a dry mouth that isn’t relieved by hydration. Are you experiencing any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. No fever, no chills, and I haven’t noticed any weight loss. My appetite is…normal, I suppose. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes haven't felt any looser or tighter. And no night sweats, thankfully. I do sleep quite warmly, though. Is that…relevant?
DOCTOR: Sleeping warmly isn’t necessarily relevant, Ms. Kobler. Now, have you been taking any medications currently, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any regular medications. I very rarely get sick, so I don't usually need anything. I don’t use any supplements either. Just…tea, sometimes, if I'm feeling a little unwell. Mostly herbal tea, nothing medicinal. Does that include things like vitamins? I don't take those regularly either.
DOCTOR: No current medications, supplements, or vitamins. Alright. Do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t believe I have any allergies. I've never had a reaction to food, medications, or anything else, as far as I know. I haven’t been stung by a bee or exposed to poison ivy, so… I'm pretty fortunate, I think. Is that unusual?
DOCTOR: Not unusual, Ms. Kobler. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses – things like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune conditions…?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s…another difficult question. I honestly don't recall ever being diagnosed with anything, Doctor. I grew up in a fairly remote area, and…medical care wasn't always easily accessible. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing…serious. I don't believe I’ve ever been told I had asthma or diabetes, or anything like that. My parents…they weren’t the type to take me to the doctor unless it was absolutely necessary. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Childhood illnesses only, no known chronic medical conditions. And have you ever had any surgeries, Ms. Kobler?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never had any surgeries. Not even a tonsillectomy or anything like that. I’ve been very lucky in that regard, I suppose. I’ve always been fairly healthy, until…recently. Is that important? Does not having any surgeries mean something? I apologize for my constant questions. It’s just… I don’t want to forget anything important.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Kobler. No past surgical history. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh. My family… That’s…complicated, Doctor. My mother… she passed away when I was very young. And my father…we weren’t close. I don’t really know much about his side of the family. I have an older brother, but we haven’t spoken in many years. As far as I know, there weren’t any major health problems on either side of the family. No heart disease, cancer, or anything like that. But… I truly don't know much beyond that. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Limited family history available, mother deceased, distant relationship with father and brother. Alright. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Social history… Well, I’m a writer. I mostly work from home. I was divorced about five years ago. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I don’t use any recreational drugs. I live alone. And…I don't have many close friends. I spend a lot of time reading and writing. Is there anything specific you need to know? I hope that wasn’t too…sparse.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Kobler, that is sufficient. It's…unusual to present with such a vague history. Alright. I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule things out. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. A physical examination sounds…sensible. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement. I just want to understand what's happening, and hopefully find some relief. I don’t have any objections at all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table and I'll begin. Take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Again… deep breath in… and exhale. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but I do note a slightly elevated respiratory rate. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly tachycardic. Blood pressure is 130/80. Now, open your mouth and say “ah.” Throat is clear, no visible signs of infection. Mucous membranes appear slightly dry.
PATIENT: Um…that doesn’t sound…too alarming, does it? A slightly elevated rate and tachycardia… Is that something I should be worried about? I’m not a medical professional, of course, but…it doesn’t sound good. Is my throat being dry relevant? I do feel quite thirsty, even though I’ve had plenty of water.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, mild tachycardia and an elevated respiratory rate can be caused by a number of things, including anxiety or dehydration. It's not necessarily cause for alarm. Your dry mucous membranes could indicate dehydration, but it's also consistent with your subjective report of dryness. Given your vague history and these mild findings, I suspect this may be related to stress. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test.
PATIENT: Stress…that is possible, I suppose. I have been rather preoccupied lately with my writing, and…adjusting to life on my own again. But… to be certain, the tests seem prudent. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. Yes, that sounds sensible. Will these tests require a lot of blood? I confess, I’m not fond of needles. And…how long will it take to get the results? I apologize for my continued questions, Doctor. I just want to understand the process.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, it will require a standard amount of blood – a few vials. It's a relatively quick procedure, and the phlebotomist is very experienced. As for the results, it typically takes 24 to 48 hours for the lab to process them. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and attempting to manage your stress levels. If your symptoms worsen – if you experience chest pain, difficulty breathing, or dizziness – you should seek immediate medical attention. I will have the lab order sent to the front desk. You can schedule your blood draw at your convenience. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, um…no, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. Increasing fluids, managing stress, and…scheduling the blood draw. Yes. Thank you for your time and attention. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience with my…vagueness. I suppose I’ll go speak to the front desk about scheduling the tests. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Kobler. Please let the front desk know if you have any difficulties scheduling the appointment. And Ms. Kobler, I strongly advise you to consider seeking counseling if your stress levels are significantly impacting your quality of life.
