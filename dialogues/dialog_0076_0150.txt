DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Shteynberg, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, don't waste my time. I'm 51, and frankly, I’d like to have a baby without… complications. I’ve heard things can get tricky at my age. I want to get this sorted quickly, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Complications… yes, well, age does introduce certain… considerations. “Sorted quickly,” you say. Right. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Have you been trying for long?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not exactly. I haven't started trying, that's the problem! I want to know if I can, before I… well, before I get my hopes up and waste time. Is that clear enough? I'm not looking for a lengthy process. I need to know if this is even feasible, and if so, what steps – minimal steps – I need to take.
DOCTOR: Minimal steps… of course. Look, Mrs. Shteynberg, biology isn’t always… cooperative. But alright. Let's start with the basics. Any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: One. Years ago. A divorce and a very…unpleasant experience. It ended normally, if you want to call it that. A healthy boy, but… that was a long time ago. Don’t need the details, I assume? I just want to know if my… equipment is still functioning properly, so to speak.
DOCTOR: Details are rarely relevant. One previous pregnancy, healthy outcome… good. Alright. Any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Nothing major. High blood pressure, controlled with medication. And a bit of arthritis, but that's what happens when you spend decades fixing bicycles. Doesn’t affect anything important. Really, I’m quite healthy for my age, you know. I don't need a full workup. Just tell me what needs to be done to see if I can have a baby, quickly.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, arthritis… Medicare, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Medicare. And please, hurry. My time is valuable. I have a shop to run, you know. People rely on me for their bicycle repairs. It’s not like I’m sitting around doing nothing all day. Just… the tests. What tests are we talking about? And how long will they take?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Look, Mrs. Shteynberg, I'll be frank. At your age, a basic fertility evaluation is… advisable. We’ll need some blood work to check hormone levels – that’s fairly standard. And a pelvic ultrasound. Possibly an assessment of your husband’s sperm, but we can discuss that later. It's not a five-minute process, regardless.
PATIENT: Husband? I don’t have a husband. I'm divorced. I was hoping to… use a donor. Is that even possible with Medicare? And frankly, I’m not keen on having a man involved in any of this. Just tell me what tests I need, and if they cover donor insemination. Don't waste my time with irrelevant questions.
DOCTOR: Donor insemination… right. Look, Mrs. Shteynberg, this is getting increasingly… complicated. Medicare can cover some aspects of donor insemination, but there are stipulations. And yes, the blood work is still necessary to assess your hormone levels and overall reproductive health. It's not about wanting to involve men; it's about basic medical procedure. We'll need to check your ovarian reserve, thyroid function… standard things. Let me pull up the appropriate forms… It’ll take a few days to schedule everything, and the lab results will take another week or so. This isn't going to be instantaneous.
PATIENT: A week? A week just for the results? Unbelievable. Fine. Just… get it over with. I suppose. But if it turns out to be a huge ordeal, I’m walking out. And don't expect me to jump through hoops. What paperwork do I need? And can I at least schedule the blood work for tomorrow? I have a shop to run, you know. I can’t be away for days on end.
DOCTOR: Here. These are the standard consent forms, insurance verification, medical history... the usual. And this one is specifically for fertility testing. Fill out everything completely. As for scheduling... I'll see if we can squeeze you in for blood work tomorrow afternoon. No promises. The lab is very busy. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No. None. And please, hurry. The longer I sit here filling out forms, the less time I have to run my shop. It's bicycles, Doctor. People need their bicycles. Just tell me what pen I should use on these things. Black ink, I assume? Don’t tell me I need a special one.
DOCTOR: Yes, black ink is fine. Just… complete the forms as thoroughly as possible. I need accurate information to proceed. And please, try to be patient. This is for your benefit. Next question... any current medications you're taking?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure medication. Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. And honestly, Doctor, are you even listening to me? I told you this already. I'm wasting valuable time here. I'd appreciate it if you could focus, and perhaps expedite this process. Bicycles are calling. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Lisinopril, ten milligrams. Noted… again. Right. Look, Mrs. Shteynberg, I have other patients to see. Fill out the remaining sections of the form and I'll see what I can do about scheduling the blood work. And please, try to understand that this is a medical assessment, not a bicycle repair.
