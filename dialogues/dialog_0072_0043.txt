DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. It’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, feels like a tight band squeezin’. Been botherin’ me for a couple weeks now, on and off. Not terrible, but enough to notice, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, a headache that feels like a tight band, primarily in the back of your head, coming and going for about two weeks. Can you describe for me how often these headaches occur?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it’s not every day, definitely. Maybe three or four times a week? Sometimes it's just a little somethin’, barely there. Other times it’s enough to make me wanna lie down for a bit. Usually in the afternoon, I think. I haven’t really kept track, to be honest. Old man forgets things, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Three or four times a week, more noticeable in the afternoons. And would you say anything makes them worse, or better?
PATIENT: Well now, that's a good question. I don't think so, not really. I haven’t noticed anything specific that sets ‘em off. Bright light doesn’t bother me, loud noises don’t bother me… stress, maybe? But I'm retired, Doctor, so what stress do I have? I mostly just potter around the garden. Sometimes I’ll be workin’ out there for hours, and sometimes I’ll sit inside and read. Doesn’t seem to matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear triggers identified. No association with light, noise, or activity. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with these headaches?
PATIENT: No, not really. No dizziness, no blurry vision, no nausea… just the headache. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, but I figured that’s just from bendin’ over in the garden all day. I haven’t noticed anything else, nothin’ out of the ordinary. I sleep alright, eat alright… just an old man, Doctor, mostly workin’ on keepin’ busy.
DOCTOR: Alright. No associated symptoms like dizziness, vision changes, or nausea. You mentioned some neck stiffness, which could be related to your gardening. Have you experienced any fever, weakness, or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And no weakness or numbness. Everything feels… normal, except for this headache, of course. My arms and legs are workin’ just fine – I need ‘em for the garden! I can still haul bags of compost, so I think I’m doin’ okay. It’s just this naggin’ headache that’s botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Good. No fever, no neurological deficits. Let's review your medical history then, Mr. Gibbel. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, years ago – must’ve been thirty years now – I had high blood pressure. The doctor put me on some pills for it. I took ‘em for a while, but he said I could come off ‘em if I watched my salt intake and exercised. So I did, and he took me off ‘em. Haven't had any trouble with it since. Apart from that… I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. No diabetes, no heart trouble… I think that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of hypertension, well-controlled with lifestyle modifications, and an appendectomy in childhood. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I don’t believe in takin’ pills if I don’t have to. I try to stay healthy, you know? A little bit of gardenin’, a little bit of readin’, and a whole lot of avoidin’ the doctor! I might take an aspirin if I got a really bad ache, but that's about it. And that doesn't happen very often. Mostly just tough it out.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife, bless her soul, she was the one with the allergies. Pollen, dust… all sorts of things. I always just breathed easy. I didn’t have to worry about that part, thankfully. So, no, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had arthritis. Bad in her hands, couldn't do much gardenin' herself. And my father… he had some heart trouble when he got older. But other than that… not really. My siblings are all still alive, and they're mostly healthy, knock on wood. No cancer, no diabetes… Just the usual old-age stuff, you know? I think that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis and cardiac issues. Now, let’s briefly discuss your social history, Mr. Gibbel. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. My wife used to say I was too stubborn to let anything control me, even a cigarette! And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's about it. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I'm an old man, Doctor, not a wild one. Just like my gardenin’ and my readin’. Simple pleasures.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, no recreational drug use. Now, Mr. Gibbel, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a neurological assessment to evaluate your reflexes and sensation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Sounds just fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. Can’t hurt to check things out, I suppose. Though I feel perfectly alright, mostly just this headache. But do what you gotta do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Sensation is intact to light touch in all extremities. Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact. No focal neurological deficits noted. Well, everything seems within normal limits, Mr. Gibbel. Your neurological exam is normal, heart and lungs sound good. Blood pressure is a little high, but it could be due to being in the office. Neck is supple, no significant tenderness.
PATIENT: Well, that's good to hear, Doctor. I appreciate you checkin' everything out. So, what do you think it is, then? Just a tension headache, maybe? From bendin' over in the garden too much? I've been workin' pretty hard on it lately.
DOCTOR: Based on your history and the physical examination, a tension headache is the most likely diagnosis. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, and your age, it is important to rule out other potential causes. We could order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and thyroid levels, just to be sure. We could also consider a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities, though I don’t think it’s necessary at this time, given your normal neurological exam. What are your thoughts on those options?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds like a lot of tests, Doctor. I’m not much for poking and prodding, if I’m honest. And a CT scan… that sounds serious. If you think it's just a tension headache, maybe we could try somethin’ simpler first? Like… I don’t know… some over-the-counter pain relief? Or maybe some stretches for my neck? I really don’t want to go through all that unless you absolutely think it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gibbel. You are right to question the necessity of extensive testing. Given your normal neurological exam and the characteristics of your headache, a trial of conservative management is a reasonable approach. We can start with over-the-counter pain relief, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as needed. I would also recommend gentle neck stretches and maintaining good posture. If your headache persists or worsens despite these measures, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, we should reconsider further investigation. I'll write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant as well, to help with the neck tension. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better, Doctor. Over-the-counter pain relief, some stretches, and that muscle relaxant… that's what I was thinkin'. I appreciate you listenin' to me. I just don’t want to get worked up over somethin’ that’s probably not serious. And thank you for writin’ that prescription for me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel. I’ve printed a prescription for cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant. Take it as directed, and be aware it can cause drowsiness. Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking it. I will also provide you with a handout on neck stretches and exercises. I want you to monitor your symptoms closely. If the headache doesn’t improve within two weeks, or if you develop any new symptoms, please schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and your patience. You've put my mind at ease. And thank you again for not jumpin' straight to all those tests. I really appreciate that. I’ll give those stretches a try and see if they help. I guess I'll be seein' you if things don’t improve. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Mr. Gibbel. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. We’ll see you then if needed. .
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor. You too. .
