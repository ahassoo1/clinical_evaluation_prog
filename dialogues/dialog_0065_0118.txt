DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Hmm… let me see. It’s… something about a certification, I believe? A renewal, perhaps? Honestly, these things all blur together after a while. It's to do with my… profession, naturally. I wouldn't be here otherwise, would I?
DOCTOR: A certification renewal… right. While I appreciate you seeking medical attention, Mr. Oriley, this is a medical clinic. I'm a physician specializing in internal medicine. Are you experiencing any health concerns that prompted you to schedule an appointment with me specifically?
PATIENT: Internal medicine, you say? Well, this is… peculiar. I was told quite specifically this was the place to go for the… the requirement. Some form, some document… it stipulated a medical examination. Perhaps I misunderstood. It’s all rather… disorganized, isn’t it? I’m a healthcare practitioner myself, you know. One expects a certain level of… competence.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, it sounds as though you may have been misinformed. This clinic provides medical care. If you require documentation for a professional certification, that is not within my purview. However, since you are here, and I have your chart in front of me, I can certainly perform a general medical examination. But I need to understand why you believe you require one. Are you feeling unwell?
PATIENT: Unwell? No, not precisely. I feel… perfectly adequate, thank you. It’s simply… a formality. A box to be ticked, as it were. Though I must say, I find your questioning rather… intrusive. I assure you, I maintain excellent health. Regular exercise, a sensible diet… I’ve always taken care of myself. But if it requires a cursory examination to satisfy some bureaucratic whim, I suppose I can indulge you.
DOCTOR: Very well. A “cursory examination” it is. But for the sake of proper medical documentation, I will need to ask a few standard questions. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Oriley. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… hmm. That’s a rather broad question, isn't it? I’ve had the occasional… ailment, naturally. Who hasn’t? A cold, a touch of the flu… But diagnosed? No, I wouldn't say so. Nothing that required… extended attention. I’ve always prided myself on my robust constitution. Though, now that you mention it, there was a rather bothersome ache in my lower back a few years ago… but that resolved itself quite quickly. It’s hardly worth mentioning, really.
DOCTOR: A lower back ache… right. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. There was… something when I was quite young. A tonsillectomy, I believe. A very common procedure, back in those days. And… perhaps another. A minor procedure on my knee, years ago. A sports injury, if I recall correctly. Though the details are rather… hazy. It was a long time ago, you understand. I've lived a full life. Is this all terribly important? It feels rather… exhaustive for a simple certification requirement.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, while I understand your… skepticism, a complete medical history is essential, even for a “simple” examination. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s… a rather extensive topic. My mother… she lived to a good age, thankfully. But she had… something. A nervous condition, I believe. And my father… he was a robust man, but he suffered from… gout, I think. It was terribly painful for him, apparently. And my grandfather… he had… well, something to do with his lungs, I vaguely recall. A rather unfortunate cough. It's all rather… distant now, you understand. A long time ago, and not something I dwell on. Perhaps this is all rather unnecessary for a certification?
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, your constant dismissiveness is hindering this examination. I am attempting to gather information to ensure your well-being, regardless of your reasons for being here. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. A dreadful habit. I’ve always considered myself a man of… refinement. I enjoy a good glass of wine with dinner, occasionally, but smoking? Never. It's simply… barbaric. I trust you don’t partake yourself, Doctor? It would be… discouraging.
DOCTOR: That is… irrelevant, Mr. Oriley. How about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: As I mentioned, a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. On occasion. Certainly no more than the recommended allowance. I am a moderate man, Doctor. Everything in moderation, that’s my philosophy. A small indulgence, to be savored. I certainly don’t “indulge” to excess. Is this all terribly important for… the certification, you said?
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I'm beginning to suspect this entire visit is… predicated on a misunderstanding. However, since you are here, I will proceed with a basic physical examination. Please sit back and relax. I’ll start with your vitals, then listen to your heart and lungs. Can you please remove your shirt?
PATIENT: Remove my shirt? Good heavens, no! That is… quite unnecessary! And frankly, rather impertinent. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. A cursory glance should be sufficient. This is becoming… increasingly uncomfortable. I came for a certification, not a… a medical striptease! Perhaps I should simply leave. This is a complete waste of my time. I believe there’s been a terrible error. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, please remain seated. I understand your frustration, but a basic physical exam is standard procedure. I am a physician, and I am obligated to assess your health. I will not perform a “medical striptease,” as you so dramatically put it. I simply need to listen to your heart and lungs. It is a non-invasive procedure. If you refuse to cooperate, I cannot provide a medical opinion.
