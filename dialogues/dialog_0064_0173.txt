DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I've just been getting chills. It's been going on for a couple of days now, and it's a bit annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills, you say. A couple of days… Alright. And are the chills constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, yeah. Not all the time. Like, yesterday I was fine most of the day, but then this morning I woke up feeling really cold and shaky. Then it warmed up a bit, and now it's kinda back again. It's weird.
DOCTOR: Hmm, intermittent chills. That is a bit unusual. And besides the chills, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think... I've been a little tired, I guess. More tired than usual. And maybe a tiny bit of a headache, but nothing major. Oh! And my throat feels a little scratchy. Is that important?
DOCTOR: A scratchy throat is definitely good to know. Okay, so tiredness, a mild headache, and a scratchy throat along with the chills. Have you had a fever at all, or felt hot?
PATIENT: I haven't taken my temperature, actually. I don't really have a thermometer at home. But no, I don't feel hot. Definitely cold when the chills hit, but not feverish, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Alright. And have you been coughing, or experiencing any congestion, like a stuffy nose?
PATIENT: No cough, and my nose is clear. Honestly, it's mostly just the chills and feeling a bit worn down. It's just...not normal for me to feel this off. It's making me a bit anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling unwell when it's unusual for you can be unsettling. Let's get a better sense of things. Have you been around anyone else who's been sick recently?
PATIENT: Um... not that I know of. My ex-husband's daughter had a cold last week, but I only saw her briefly when I dropped off their weekend bag. And that was like, a week ago already. It wasn't a close contact, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a distant contact with someone who had a cold. And just to cover all bases, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. No stomach issues, no muscle aches… Oh! Wait. My appetite hasn't been great. I haven't been very hungry the last couple of days. But other than that, I think that's it. I'm really trying to remember everything!
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Reduced appetite. Alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had really bad asthma when I was a kid, but I grew out of it years ago. I haven't had any issues with it since I was maybe ten. Other than that, nothing major. Just the usual things, I guess – colds, flu, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood asthma that has resolved. Good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. No surgeries, no major illnesses, nothing like that. I'm usually pretty healthy. That's why this is throwing me off so much!
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about medications?
PATIENT: I don't take anything regularly. Sometimes I'll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's about it. No prescriptions or anything. Just over-the-counter stuff when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I'm pretty boring that way, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. That’s good. Now, just a few more questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Does anyone in your family have a history of serious illness?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mum has high blood pressure, and my dad had diabetes, but that's about it, really. No history of anything like heart disease or cancer, as far as I know. My brother’s healthy as a horse, too. Nothing major on either side of the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and diabetes. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a health education specialist, so I'm pretty active during the day, mostly talking and doing presentations. I try to eat healthy, lots of fruits and vegetables, but I'm not perfect, I admit. I don't smoke, and I only drink socially, like a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I don't really have any big hobbies, just… relaxing at home mostly. It’s pretty low-key, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your throat, and feel your lymph nodes, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Please go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Heart sounds are regular. Lymph nodes are slightly tender, but not significantly enlarged. Throat is a little red, some mild inflammation, but no obvious signs of infection. Temperature is 98.9 Fahrenheit. Okay, everything seems relatively normal, Jailenne. Your temperature is just slightly elevated. The mild tenderness of your lymph nodes and throat redness could be consistent with a viral infection, but given your intermittent chills and fatigue, I want to be a bit cautious.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s good to know, I guess. But what does that mean? Is it… the flu? Or something else? I’m just worried about it dragging on. I have a presentation next week that I really need to be on top for.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair concern. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing. It could be a mild viral infection, like a common cold or a very mild case of the flu, but the intermittent chills are a bit unusual for those. We could do a rapid flu test, and also a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection. That would help us rule out other possibilities. However, given your presentation next week, I'd also like to consider the possibility of something a little less common. Sometimes, fatigue and chills can be early symptoms of other illnesses. To be on the safe side, and to give you peace of mind, I recommend we run those tests. What do you think?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that sounds sensible. I think I’d feel better knowing for sure. I don’t want to be caught off guard. So, a flu test and a blood test? Is the blood test going to be a big needle? I’m not great with needles, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It's a standard blood draw, Jailenne, nothing too bad. The needle is small, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. We can also put a cold compress on your arm afterwards to help with any discomfort. It's just a few vials of blood. Okay, I'll put in the orders for the flu test and the CBC. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and we'll get the results back as quickly as possible, usually within a couple of hours. In the meantime, I recommend you get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, and avoid strenuous activity. Would you like a note for work, just in case?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A note for work would be great. Just to explain that I’m not feeling well. And thank you for being so patient with me. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I understand it's unsettling when you're not feeling your best, especially with important commitments coming up. Here's the note for your work. It explains that you are experiencing symptoms of an upper respiratory illness and recommends rest. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She'll explain the process to you. Do you have any other questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Smetak. I really appreciate your thoroughness. I’ll just… wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. Please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if anything changes or if you have any further concerns. I'll check back with you as soon as the results are available. It's good you came in to get checked out. It's always better to be safe. .
