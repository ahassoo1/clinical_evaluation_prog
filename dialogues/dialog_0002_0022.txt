DOCTOR: Hi Soila, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, my belly feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. It just doesn’t feel right, you know? Not hungry. It’s been… a little while now, I think. Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your belly feels full and you've lost your appetite, and this has been going on for a bit. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this feeling of fullness and not wanting to eat?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I notice? That’s a tricky one. Things get… mixed up, you see. Maybe… after the summer started? Yes, I think it was warm weather. But before that, I was eating okay. Not a big eater, never was, but… enough. It just sort of… faded away, the wanting to eat. It wasn’t sudden. Slow. Like a… a quiet rain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started gradually around the beginning of summer, and you’ve slowly lost your appetite since then. And you mentioned your belly feels big – is that bloating, or does it feel like you’ve gained weight?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not weight, no. I don’t think so. It feels… puffy. Like a balloon. Not hard, just… full of air, maybe? It’s strange. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable. And it looks bigger in the evenings, I think. Yes, definitely bigger when I sit down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more of a puffy feeling than weight gain, and it seems to get worse in the evenings when you’re sitting. Has anything specific made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… better or worse? That’s a good question. Nothing makes it better, I don’t think. Not really. Sometimes… when I lie down, it feels a little less… tight. But worse? Maybe… eating too much? But then I don’t want to eat much anyway! It’s a puzzle, isn’t it? Oh, and… maybe when I get excited? When I talk a lot, it seems to get bigger.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down seems to help a little, and getting excited or talking a lot might make it worse. That’s good information to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? Oh, you mean… going to the bathroom? Hmm. Well, it's… not as regular as it used to be. I don’t go every day. Sometimes… every few days. And it’s… harder, I think. Not very… smooth. Sorry, is that too much information?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Soila. It's important information. So, your bowel movements are less frequent and the stool is harder. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in the color?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear, no. Not that I’ve seen. And the color… hmm. It’s… brown, I think. Regular brown. Maybe a little lighter sometimes? But I don’t pay much attention, you know. I just… go. Sorry if that’s not very helpful. Old age, you see. Things get… blurry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Soila. You’re doing great. So, generally brown stool, sometimes a little lighter. Now, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain at all?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. No throwing up. And no pain, not really. It's just… uncomfortable, like I said. A fullness. A tightness. It doesn’t hurt, it just… bothers me. Like a too-tight dress, maybe? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea, vomiting, or pain, just fullness and tightness. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. That’s a difficult one, Doctor. I’ve always been… small. And I don’t weigh myself, you see. Never have. My clothes… maybe a little looser? But that could just be… the washing. Or old age. It’s hard to say, isn’t it? I just… feel weaker, maybe? Not strong like I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, you haven't been weighing yourself, but your clothes might be a little looser and you feel weaker. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh dear. That’s a long time ago, Doctor. I had… something with my heart, a long time ago. When I was young. But they fixed it, I think. A long operation. And… arthritis, I think? In my hands. They ache sometimes. But nothing serious. And I don’t go to the doctor much, you see. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, you had a heart condition when you were younger that was treated with surgery, and you have arthritis in your hands. Do you recall the name of the heart condition, or approximately when you had the surgery?
PATIENT: Oh dear, the name… no, I don’t remember the name. Long, long ago. Maybe… sixty years ago? Or more? It was in a hospital. A big hospital. They cut me open. And… I think they put something in my heart? A valve, maybe? But I don't really know. Things get… mixed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heart condition requiring surgery about sixty years ago, possibly involving a valve replacement. And arthritis in your hands. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, I used to. For my hands. But I stopped. They didn’t seem to do much good, and I didn't like taking pills. Just… something for the pain. A long time ago now. Now I just rub them.
DOCTOR: Okay, you used to take medication for arthritis pain but stopped taking it some time ago. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don’t like fish. Never have. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… don’t like it. No, I don't think I have any allergies. I've been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s a long story. My mother… she lived a long life. Very strong woman. But she had… something with her stomach, I think. A long time ago. She was sick for a while. And my father… he had heart trouble. But I don't remember much about it. They both… passed away a long time ago. It’s all a bit blurry now, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had stomach problems and your father had heart trouble. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What a question! I don’t do much, Doctor. I live alone. I read a lot. And I watch television. I used to go for walks, but my legs aren't as good as they used to be. I don't smoke. Never have. And I don't drink much alcohol. A little glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. Just to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, enjoy reading and watching television, and have limited mobility. You don't smoke and only drink a small glass of wine occasionally. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Blood pressure… heart and lungs… yes. Do what you need to do. I trust you. Just be gentle, please. My old body isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I will be very gentle. Okay, Soila, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140 over 85. Your heart sounds regular with a mild murmur, which is common at your age. Your lungs sound clear, and I feel some fullness in your abdomen, but it doesn’t seem to be painful. I also noted your abdomen is soft to the touch.
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated, you say? Is that… bad? And a murmur? My heart? Fullness… I knew my belly felt big. So… what does this mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The elevated blood pressure is something we’ll want to monitor, and we can discuss ways to help lower it. It’s not an immediate emergency, but it’s good to be aware of. The murmur is also very common in people as they get older, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. As for the fullness in your abdomen, that’s consistent with what you’ve been describing. Given your symptoms – the gradual loss of appetite, the feeling of fullness, the slower bowel movements, and the mild weight loss – along with your age and history, it could be several things. It could be related to decreased digestive function, which is common with age. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work to check your complete blood count, kidney and liver function, and electrolytes. I also recommend a stool test to check for any bleeding or infection. Finally, I think it would be beneficial to get an abdominal CT scan to get a better look at your organs and rule out anything more serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood work… stool test… a scan? That sounds… a lot. Is it… serious, Doctor? Is something very wrong? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Soila. It does sound like a lot, and I apologize for that. I'm ordering these tests not because I think something is definitely wrong, but to be thorough and get a clear picture of what’s going on. It's better to rule things out and have a solid understanding, so we can get you feeling better as quickly as possible. These tests will help us identify if there's anything concerning, such as a blockage, inflammation, or another underlying condition. They're relatively simple and generally well-tolerated. The blood work involves a small sample taken from your arm. The stool test requires you to collect a small sample at home. And the CT scan is a painless imaging procedure that takes just a few minutes. I will explain all the tests in more detail before we proceed, and I will be here to answer any questions you may have. We’re taking these steps to ensure we give you the best possible care. Does that help ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: Well… if you think it’s necessary. But please, be gentle. I don’t like needles. And I don’t want to… be poked and prodded too much. And explain everything clearly, please. I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Soila. I promise to be as gentle as possible with everything. We'll take things at your pace, and I'll explain each step in detail before we do it. For the blood work, the phlebotomist is very skilled, and we can use a smaller needle if that makes you more comfortable. For the stool test, I’ll give you clear instructions and a collection kit. It's a simple process, and you can do it in the privacy of your own home. And for the CT scan, the technician will guide you through everything and make sure you're comfortable. It’s a painless procedure, and you won’t need to do anything except lie still for a few minutes. I’ll also write down all the instructions for you, and you can bring a family member or friend with you if you’d like. Let’s start with scheduling the blood work. I have a nurse who can assist you with that right now. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds alright. A nurse… yes. Perhaps… if she can explain it all again. I get so flustered, you see. And… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. It’s all a bit much to take in.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. That’s what I’m here for. I understand it’s a lot to take in, and I’m happy to take things at your pace. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. She’s very good at explaining things and answering questions. While we wait for the nurse, do you have any questions for me right now, before she arrives?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well… how long will it take to get the results? I don't like waiting. And… will these tests hurt? I know you said they won't, but… I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Soila. The blood work results typically take about 2-3 business days to come back. The stool test results usually take a little longer, about 5-7 business days, as it needs to be processed in the lab. And the CT scan results are usually available within 24-48 hours. As for pain, the blood draw will feel like a quick pinch, but it shouldn’t be very painful. You might feel a slight discomfort afterward, but it usually goes away quickly. The stool test is completely painless, and the CT scan doesn't involve any pain at all. It's like taking an X-ray, but more detailed. I understand your nervousness, and I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to make you as comfortable as possible. We’ll also discuss the results together as soon as they're available, and I’ll explain everything in detail. Here comes the nurse now. Her name is Maria, and she's very kind and patient. She will go over the blood work instructions with you. Maria, could you please explain the procedure to Soila?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: It was lovely meeting you, Soila. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you soon.
