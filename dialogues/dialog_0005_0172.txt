DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. My husband insisted. Something about… settling in? We just moved, you see. Rural, you say? It’s… different. I suppose a check-up is always… sensible. Though I haven’t felt unwell, not precisely.
DOCTOR: Settling in, right. Well, a preventative check-up isn't a bad idea, even if you're feeling alright. It's good your husband encouraged you to come in. We’ll just go through the motions, make sure everything is as it should be. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor for a while now?
PATIENT: A “regular” doctor… well, I suppose. Back in the city, there was Doctor… something. A young man, very efficient. I can't recall his name, unfortunately. It was… a large practice. Lots of waiting. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I doubt any of that information is relevant now, is it? We’ve been away for quite some time.
DOCTOR: It can be helpful to have a baseline, even if it’s from a while ago. But alright, we'll focus on what's going on now. Let’s try this. Any major illnesses or surgeries you’ve had in your life?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Major illnesses… that's a rather broad question, isn't it? I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps... nothing serious. And… well, there was a hysterectomy, decades ago. A very standard procedure, I believe. And… a tonsillectomy. As a child, naturally. Honestly, Doctor, I have a perfectly good memory for social events, but medical details simply… escape me. It's dreadfully inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… oh dear. My husband, Arthur, is perfectly healthy, thank goodness. Always has been. My mother… she lived to a good age, though she suffered from… something with her joints, I believe. Arthritis, perhaps? It wasn’t pleasant. And my brother… well, he passed some years ago. Not a healthy man, unfortunately. A weak constitution, always catching colds. Nothing particularly relevant to me, I shouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to cover all the bases, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, Arthur insists. He's very particular about these things. I take a small, white pill every morning for… well, for my blood pressure, I believe. And a vitamin D supplement. He says I don’t get enough sunlight. Honestly, I can't tell the difference. It’s all rather… tedious, really.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I've always had a rather robust constitution, as I said. Nothing bothers me. Well… perhaps a slight aversion to shellfish. But that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. I'm not prone to sensitivities, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And one final question for now. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not! Doctor, really! I’m a woman of… a certain age. And a married woman, at that. Such questions are quite unnecessary, don’t you think? Arthur would be horrified. We occasionally enjoy a sherry with dinner, a very small glass, but that’s hardly… recreational. And smoking? Heavens, no! It’s dreadful for one’s complexion.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just the basics – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, that sort of thing. Do you have any particular areas of concern you'd like me to focus on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A physical exam. Well, I suppose that’s… standard. No, no particular concerns, Doctor. Though my knees do ache a bit after gardening. But that’s simply a matter of age, I assure you. Let’s get this over with, shall we? I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back for me. I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit distant. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Very well. My knees, you say? They've always been rather… delicate. There. Is that sufficient? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not particularly flexible. It’s probably just the weather. Dampness affects them dreadfully.
DOCTOR: There's some crepitus and mild swelling in both knees. Range of motion is limited. It’s likely osteoarthritis, which is quite common at your age. It doesn’t require any immediate treatment, but we can discuss some pain management options if it bothers you. We’ll probably want to get some X-rays to confirm it, though.
PATIENT: Osteo… what was it? Arthritis? Oh, dear. Just as I suspected. It’s simply age, isn’t it? I really don't want to bother with X-rays, Doctor. Honestly, all that radiation. Is it absolutely necessary? Perhaps a nice warm compress will suffice? And a bit of liniment? My mother always swore by liniment.
DOCTOR: While a warm compress and liniment might provide some temporary relief, X-rays are necessary to rule out any other underlying causes and to assess the severity of the condition. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Engelhaupt. It's a quick and relatively painless procedure, and the benefits of having a clear diagnosis far outweigh the minimal risk. I’m recommending a referral to Dr. Abernathy at the imaging center. He’s quite good. Here's the information. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory to help with the pain and swelling in the meantime.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Dr. Abernathy, you say? Honestly, all this… fuss. And a prescription, as well. I suppose I have no choice. I trust this won't take up too much of my time? I have numerous commitments, you see. A luncheon, a bridge game… Is there anything else? I'd really like to be on my way. It’s been… a rather draining morning.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Engelhaupt. That will be all for today. Just schedule the X-rays with Dr. Abernathy at your convenience and follow up with me after you've had the results. And try to get some rest. Have a good day.
