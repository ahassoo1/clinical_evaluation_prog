DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why they scheduled me for this. My wife insisted, you see. Something about my… complexion. I feel perfectly fine, just… tired, naturally. At my age. It’s probably just the sun. Though, I haven’t been out in the sun much lately. Honestly, it’s all rather bothersome. Can we get this over with quickly?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We’ll try to be brief. So, your wife is concerned about your complexion… is that a recent change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual? Honestly, Doctor, I barely remember what I had for breakfast yesterday, let alone the precise timeline of a slight change in skin tone. It’s been… some time. Perhaps a few weeks? Months? It’s hardly a pressing matter. It’s not as if I'm ill. It's just… darker. And I feel rather fatigued, but that is to be expected. Really, I don’t see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Okay. A few weeks to months of gradual darkening, and fatigue. Any other changes you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Changes? Goodness, where do I even begin? I’m eighty-five years old! Things change. My knees ache, my eyesight isn't what it used to be… is this relevant? Honestly, I’m a working man, Doctor. Reinforced iron and rebar doesn't exactly lend itself to a long and youthful existence. Are we getting anywhere with this or are we simply cataloging the natural decline of a perfectly functional, albeit aging, body?
DOCTOR: Right. Aches and pains consistent with age. Let’s focus on the complexion for a moment. Is it localized, or all over?
PATIENT: Localized? Everywhere, I suppose. It’s not as if I've got patches of color… it’s just… a general dullness. A sort of… sallow appearance, my wife said. Though, she tends to exaggerate. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure this requires my time? I have responsibilities. And frankly, this is all rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay. General dullness and sallow appearance. Have you noticed any itching, pain, or blistering associated with this?
PATIENT: Itching? Blistering? Good heavens, no. Are you suggesting I have some sort of… affliction? I’m a sturdy man, Doctor. I work with iron, not… delicate flowers. No, no itching, no blistering, just… tiredness and a slight change in coloration that, frankly, I hadn’t even noticed until my wife made a production of it. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Just one moment, Mr. Drahota. Let's just do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Really, Doctor? At my age? I assure you, I’m quite familiar with my own body. But… fine. Get it over with. Quickly, please. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to take a look at your skin, your eyes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Nothing too strenuous. Let's start with your skin. Please roll up your sleeves. I notice some general hyperpigmentation on your forearms and hands. Any recent injuries or cuts on these areas?
PATIENT: Hyperpigmentation? Doctor, are you attempting to frighten me with medical jargon? Injuries? Goodness, no. I work with metal. There are scrapes and bruises, naturally. It comes with the territory. Nothing of consequence. Minor abrasions, at worst. And I assure you, I'm quite adept at tending to my own wounds. Get on with it, please. This is rather… invasive.
DOCTOR: Okay. And your eyes?
PATIENT: My eyes? What about them? I can see perfectly well enough to get by, thank you very much. Perhaps a little…dimmer than they used to be, but that is to be expected. Are you looking for… cataracts? I haven’t been officially diagnosed with anything, if that’s what you’re implying. And honestly, I find this whole process rather…degrading.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Some mild pallor of the conjunctiva. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a little shallow.
PATIENT: Diminished heart sounds? Are you telling me something is wrong? Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine, aside from the usual aches and pains of an aging body. And I’ve never had any issues with my lungs. I work outdoors, remember? Strong lungs are essential. This is becoming increasingly… alarming. What exactly are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay. Mr. Drahota, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, and noting your lack of insurance, I'm concerned about potential anemia and the possibility of underlying fatigue contributing to your complexion changes. The diminished heart sounds could be age-related, but it's worth investigating. We need to get some blood work done to check your hemoglobin levels and rule out any deficiencies. I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. Would you be able to get those done at the clinic lab tomorrow?
PATIENT: Blood work? Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. I haven't the time for such nonsense. And the cost, I presume, will be… substantial? Honestly, Doctor, I came here because my wife insisted, and now you're suggesting invasive and expensive procedures. I feel perfectly well, and I assure you, I don't need your medical intervention. I’m going home. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your concerns, but I strongly recommend getting these tests done. I'm not trying to alarm you, but it’s important to rule out anything serious. The lab work is relatively inexpensive, and we can discuss payment options if needed. We can get a better understanding of your overall health and address any underlying issues. I can also provide a referral to a specialist if you’d like a second opinion. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially at your age.
