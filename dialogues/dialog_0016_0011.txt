DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Honcoop. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon. Yes, well, I got a paper… from a place. They need a doctor to say it's okay. Some… fixing. Don't rightly remember all the details, to be honest. Just want to get it over with. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can definitely work with that. It sounds like you may have a referral for some sort of procedure, and they need my medical clearance. No problem at all. To help me understand what's going on and make sure it’s safe for you, could you tell me anything you do remember about why you're needing this "fixing," as you put it?
PATIENT: Look, I ain’t one for details. It's… cosmetic. A fella told me I could look younger. Something about my face… sagging, he said. I work with towers, you see. Climbing 'em. Ain't got time for vanity, but… well, it was a good deal. Honestly, I just want the doctor's note and be done with it. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Honcoop, that’s not hard at all. I understand wanting to get things done efficiently. It's good you're upfront with me. Knowing it’s a cosmetic procedure helps. Just to be thorough, and to make sure I can provide the best clearance possible, could you tell me where on your face this procedure is being done?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens. It’s… the neck, I think. And maybe around the jawline. Honestly, I wasn't really paying attention to the specifics. He showed me pictures, and it looked… tighter. That's all I recall. Look, I’m a practical man. Towers don’t climb themselves. This whole thing is a waste of my time, with all due respect.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. We’ll try to make this as quick as possible. Alright, so a procedure to the neck and jawline for cosmetic tightening. Before we proceed with the clearance, I just need to ask a few routine questions to get a better understanding of your overall health. It's standard procedure, and it helps me make sure you’re a good candidate for this. First, do you have any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Goodness gracious. Alright, alright. Let me see… I… I don’t rightly know about all those fancy names. I get a little tired sometimes, climbing them towers. And my knees ache. But that’s just old age, I reckon. Never been to a doctor much. Don’t have the time, and frankly, I don't trust 'em. I ain't got any of them… conditions, if that's what you're asking. Just a working man, trying to keep up. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and knee pain. That's helpful to know. And no known medical conditions. Thank you. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had nothin' cut open. Too busy workin'. And like I said, I don’t trust doctors to be pokin' around. Towers don't fix themselves, you know. This is really all I need - a signature on a paper. Are we gettin' anywhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting there, Mr. Honcoop. I appreciate your patience. No prior surgeries. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. A working man doesn't have time for all that nonsense. Just coffee. Lots and lots of coffee to stay awake on those towers. And sometimes a little something for the knees when they really bother me, but it's just… a cream, I think. From the drugstore. Nothing a doctor needs to know. Can we please get this over with? I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just coffee and an occasional knee cream. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I eat just about anything. I’m a simple man. Never had a problem with… pollen or anything like that. I work outside all the time. I'd know if I was allergic to somethin'. Look, are you almost done? This is taking forever. I got a schedule to keep, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. We're almost finished with the initial questions, Mr. Honcoop. Just a few more about your family history, and then we can do a quick physical exam. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any serious medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family history… Now that's a question. Haven’t seen my family in… decades. Moved away when I was young. My mother… she got sick, I think. Old age, mostly. And my father… he worked hard, like me. Never really talked about health. Just… tough people, mostly. No one sat around complainin’ about sickness. Honestly, I couldn’t tell you if anyone had any fancy diseases. Is that alright? I ain’t one for rememberin’ old family stories. Just wanna get this note and be done.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Honcoop. It's common to not have that information. Okay, so limited family history available. Last question before we move on to the physical exam: do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute! I am a hardworking man! I need my strength for climbing those towers, you know. I drink a little coffee, as I mentioned before, to stay alert. But smoke? Drink? Drugs? Absolutely not! I have a reputation to uphold! I am a professional! This is an insult! Can we please just get this over with? I don’t have time for these ridiculous questions!
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions offended you, Mr. Honcoop. That was not my intention at all. I simply need to gather all necessary information to ensure your safety and provide the appropriate medical clearance. I understand you don't smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs. Alright. Now, to complete the process, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your neck to assess the area for the planned procedure. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I got things to do. Towers aren't gonna climb themselves, you know. But make it quick, alright? I haven't got all day. And don’t poke around too much. I don’t trust doctors. Just… get it done. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Honcoop. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, normal breathing sounds on both sides. Now, let’s take a look at your neck. I’m feeling the tissues… some expected age-related laxity, but no obvious abnormalities or tenderness. Skin is intact. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I touch here?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just… feels normal, I guess. Old age, like you said. I spend all day lookin' up at those towers. I reckon my neck gets a little stiff sometimes. But it ain't nothin' serious. Just get it over with. Are we almost done? I gotta get back to work. I got a schedule to keep, you know. This is takin' forever!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I’m finishing up the neck exam now. No concerning findings. Based on my brief examination and your medical history, you appear to be generally healthy enough to proceed with the planned cosmetic procedure. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and it would be beneficial to monitor it regularly and discuss strategies to lower it with your primary care physician. I will provide you with a note stating my clearance for the procedure, contingent upon a follow-up with your primary care doctor regarding your blood pressure. Do you have a primary care physician I can send the note to?
PATIENT: Primary care physician? Good heavens, no. Haven't seen a doctor in decades, as I mentioned before. I just… take care of myself. Towers don't wait for sick days, you know. Just… give me the note. I'll sign whatever you need me to sign. Just get it over with. I got work to do. I ain’t got time for doctors and fancy paperwork. Just… the note. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand. I will provide you with the note stating my clearance for the procedure. However, I strongly recommend you establish care with a primary care physician for regular check-ups and to monitor your blood pressure. It’s important for your long-term health. I’ll also provide you with a list of local physicians. Here is the note and the list of doctors. Please read the disclaimer on the note regarding my recommendations. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That's all. Just what I needed. A piece of paper. Now I can get back to work. Thank you… I guess. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Honcoop. I wish you all the best with your procedure and a safe return to work. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a good day.
