DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Segretto, is it?
PATIENT: Segretto, yeah. Arlan Segretto. Though, honestly, half the time folks get it wrong. Doesn’t much bother me anymore. Just… getting old, I suppose. You Dr. Sink? A nice, young woman, if I recall correctly.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Sink. And you are correct, time does have a way of…blurring things. Now, let’s not dwell on names. What brings you in today, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this… bathroom business. Going too often, you see. More often than a fella should, anyway. It’s… disruptive. Especially at night. Wakes my wife up, and she… well, she’s not a happy camper when she doesn't get her sleep. It’s been going on for a while now, I reckon. A few months, maybe? Hard to say exactly, time gets away from you.
DOCTOR: Disruptive…right. And you say this has been ongoing for several months?
PATIENT: Months, yeah. Seems like it. Though, to be honest, I don’t keep track of such things. It just… started happening. More and more often. Not painful, mind you. Just… frequent. It’s a nuisance, mostly. Makes it hard to get a good night’s rest, and, like I said, bothers the wife. She’s always been a light sleeper. A good woman, my wife, but… particular.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination…and no pain. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. I suppose it looks… normal enough. The usual color, I guess. Nothing cloudy or anything like that. Honestly, I don’t spend a lot of time examining it, if you know what I mean. Just… goes in, goes out. Not something I generally dwell on. Is it supposed to look different if something's wrong? I wouldn’t know the first thing about it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, some changes can indicate a problem. Have you noticed any difficulty starting to urinate, or any weakness in the stream?
PATIENT: Weakness? No, not really. It comes out alright. Not like a garden hose, maybe, but… adequate. Never had any trouble getting it started either. Just… goes when it’s time. Maybe a little bit slower than it used to be, now that I think about it. But I'm an old man. Things slow down, don't they? It's just part of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven't been sick. Not a bit. Chills, no. And pain… well, a little bit of stiffness sometimes, but that's just my age, you know? The arthritis acts up now and then. But no sharp pain, not in my belly or anywhere else. You're asking about things I haven't got, Doc. Are you sure this bathroom business is serious? It just seems like a nuisance. A bothersome nuisance, but… hardly a reason to be poking around.
DOCTOR: It's important to rule things out, Mr. Segretto. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, I got the arthritis, like I said. And my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, but the doctor put me on a pill for that. Can’t remember the name of it, honestly. Takes a handful of pills every morning, all look the same to me. Oh, and I had my prostate checked… years ago. Seemed alright then, but I don't recall the details. Things get foggy when you get old. It's a bother, really. Do you need a list? My wife probably has something written down somewhere. She’s the organized one.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. We can try to access your records electronically. Let me just… pull up your chart. Medicare can be…slow at times. Now, any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was a long time ago. And… I think I had some work done on my knee, years and years ago, when I was farming. Something about a torn cartilage, maybe? Honestly, I don't recall much about it. It all blurs together after a while. Not much call for surgeries these days. Try to stay out of the hospital, if I can. Dreadful place, hospitals. Dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my father… he lived a long life. Heart trouble, eventually. My mother… she had something with her stomach, I think. But honestly, Doc, we weren’t a family for talking about ailments. You just… dealt with them. Didn’t spend much time worrying over what your relatives had. It’s not something I'm much help with, I’m afraid. A lot of farmers, you know. Hard work, not much time for genealogy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… a beer with dinner now and then, maybe. Nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? What do you take me for? I’m a farmer, Doc. Not some… city fellow. Honestly, these questions… are you quite sure this bathroom business is serious? Seems like a lot of fuss over something so… common.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Segretto. Now, lastly, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Besides the blood pressure pill… Let me see… there's something for my arthritis. Little white pill, I think. And… oh yes, a something for my knees. Can't recall the name of either, honestly. They all look the same, little pills. My wife keeps track of all that, she has a chart. She’s very organized, my wife. Much better at remembering things than I am, I can tell you that much. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule a few things out. It’s a standard procedure.
