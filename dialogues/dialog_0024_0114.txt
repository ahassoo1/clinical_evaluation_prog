DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s about my breathing. It gets… difficult when I try to lie flat. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It’s quite bothersome, really. I prefer to sleep propped up with pillows.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A month, you say. And it’s specifically when lying flat?
PATIENT: Yes, specifically. Sitting up is no problem at all. And walking… walking is fine. It's just when I attempt to lie down. It feels… like something is pressing on me, though I can’t quite explain it. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable and makes it hard to breathe deeply.
DOCTOR: Right. And has this gradually worsened over the month, or has it been relatively stable?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely gotten worse. At first, I just needed one pillow. Now, I’m using two, maybe three, to feel comfortable enough to sleep. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least. I do worry about it continuing to get worse, naturally.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me think… Not that I’ve noticed, no. My shoes feel the same as always. I haven’t had to loosen them or anything. I do have… a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that’s a different matter entirely. It doesn’t affect my feet, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any… chest pain, palpitations, or a rapid heartbeat accompanying this difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, Doctor, not at all. My heart feels… normal, as far as I can tell. It doesn’t race or anything like that. Just the breathing, like I said. It’s a strange sensation. It’s not a fluttering, or a pain, just… difficult. Is that making sense? I don’t do well with… complicated descriptions.
DOCTOR: Adequate sense, Ms. Vanderwiele. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any heart conditions, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. High blood pressure, yes, many years ago. They put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it a while back. My doctor at the time said it wasn’t too serious, and I haven't been back to that doctor in… well, quite some time. No diabetes, and no heart problems that I know of. I did have a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was decades ago. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Pneumonia is noted. And what about your medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, just the pills for my hands, the arthritis. They’re… Naproxen, I believe. And sometimes I take something for sleep, but just when I’m really having trouble. It's a very small dose. I can’t remember the name offhand, I'm afraid. My daughter usually handles refilling them.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, thankfully. I haven’t taken anything new recently, so it’s unlikely to be that. I pride myself on a good constitution, you see. I do hope we can figure out this breathing issue, though. It's quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, let’s do a brief physical examination. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your legs for any swelling. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. . I suppose that’s necessary. . Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. This table is rather… firm.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but there is a slight… S1 gallop. Legs show no edema, as you stated. Blood pressure is elevated – 160/90. Do you routinely monitor your blood pressure at home, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh dear. No, Doctor, I do not. I haven't owned a blood pressure machine. I used to have my blood pressure checked at the doctor’s office, but as I mentioned, it’s been a long time since I visited one. I always felt alright, so I didn't see the need. This is… concerning, isn’t it? It sounds like I should have been paying closer attention.
DOCTOR: Concerning is… a fair assessment, Ms. Vanderwiele. Given your history of hypertension, current blood pressure reading, and reported symptoms, I suspect you are experiencing symptoms consistent with congestive heart failure. However, we need further testing to confirm this. I'm going to order an EKG, a chest x-ray, and a complete blood count. We will also need to check your kidney function and electrolytes.
PATIENT: Oh my. Congestive heart failure? That sounds… dreadful. Tests? I suppose that’s what one must do. . Very well, Doctor. What do I need to do? And will these tests be… painful? I do dislike needles, you see. I just want to get this sorted out, as quickly as possible. It’s… unsettling, to hear something like that.
DOCTOR: The EKG is non-invasive, Ms. Vanderwiele – simply electrodes placed on your chest. The blood work requires a small needle prick, but it is brief. The chest x-ray involves no discomfort. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the imaging studies immediately. In the meantime, I am prescribing you a low-dose diuretic to help reduce fluid retention. It’s important to adhere to this medication regimen. I also strongly advise you to follow a low-sodium diet. I’ll have the nurse provide you with a dietary handout. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. A diuretic… to reduce fluid. And a low-sodium diet. . That sounds… restrictive. But if it helps, I will certainly try. . So, the nurse will be coming in shortly? To take blood? Very well. . I do appreciate you explaining everything, though I confess, it’s all rather a lot to take in. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be in shortly. I also recommend a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist. I'll have my assistant schedule that for you. It’s crucial to have a specialist evaluate your condition thoroughly. We will review the test results at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that’s all for now. . Thank you for your time and attention. I will… follow your instructions to the best of my ability. I just hope these tests don’t take too long. . I do appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will assist you. .
