DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, my chest… it hurts a little. Not all the time, but… yeah, it hurts. It's like… a dull ache, mostly. I don't know why. It's my… breast.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Bulaong. It's good you came in to have it checked out. When you say it hurts, can you tell me more about that ache?
PATIENT: Um… it's not like a sharp pain. More like… when you use your muscles a lot, and they feel sore the next day? Like that, but… in my chest. And it's… both sides. Not just one. Sometimes it feels… full, too. Like… heavy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Bulaong. “Sore” and “heavy” are helpful descriptions. And you mentioned it’s on both sides. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Some days I don't feel anything. Other days… like today… it's there almost all day. It's worse… when I move around a lot, I think. Like when I’m working on the roof. I’m a roofer, you know? Lots of lifting and… reaching.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information – your occupation. Roofing involves a lot of physical exertion. And you’re experiencing more discomfort with activity. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or did it just start gradually?
PATIENT: I think it started… slowly. Maybe a month ago? I didn’t think much of it at first. Just… sore muscles. But it hasn’t gone away. And it's… I don’t know… worrying me a little now. No, nothing specific made it start. Just… happened.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, Mr. Bulaong, have you noticed any changes to the skin in that area?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? I haven’t really looked at it, to be honest. I mean, I feel the pain, but I don't… check it. Is there something I should be looking for? I’m sorry, I don’t know much about this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s good you’re here, and we can take a look together. I was just asking about any redness, swelling, dimpling of the skin, or changes to the nipple, if you have nipples. It's important to rule out anything concerning. Would you mind if I performed a brief physical exam of your chest and surrounding areas?
PATIENT: Um… nipples? Yes, I have nipples. I haven't noticed anything different about them. No redness, no… dimpling, whatever that is. Okay, I guess… a physical exam is okay. I mean, if you think it’s important. I just… hope it’s not something bad. I need to work, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bulaong. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Dimpling is when the skin sort of looks like it's been pulled inwards, like an orange peel. We’ll check for that and other things. Okay, I'm just going to press gently around your chest and feel for any unusual lumps or areas of tenderness. Alright. I'm not feeling any distinct masses at this time. There is some mild tenderness to palpation on both sides, which seems consistent with what you've described. No visible redness or skin changes. I would like to also listen to your heart and lungs to rule out any other causes of chest discomfort. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good. I’m glad you didn’t feel anything bad. Listening to my heart and lungs is okay, too. I hope everything is okay. It’s just… worrying, you know? My wife… she gets worried too. I don’t want to scare her.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bulaong, and we'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it could be musculoskeletal pain – meaning pain originating from the muscles and tissues in your chest wall, potentially aggravated by your physically demanding job. However, given your discomfort and to be thorough, I would like to order some basic blood work to rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Okay. If that’s what you think is best, then yes. I trust you, Doctor. Musculo… whatever that means… sounds good, I guess. But if it’s not just muscles… what else could it be? I don’t want to worry my wife, but… I need to know.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Mr. Bulaong. While musculoskeletal pain is a likely possibility, chest pain can sometimes indicate other issues, though less common given your description. It could be related to inflammation in the cartilage of the rib cage, or, less likely, could be a sign of something more serious like a cardiac issue or, rarely, a lung problem. The blood work will help us rule out inflammation and assess your overall health. I'll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and some inflammatory markers. It’s a standard set of tests. We can also discuss lifestyle modifications and pain management options while we await the results. Would you like me to explain those options now?
PATIENT: Okay. So… blood work, and then… maybe some medicine? And… lifestyle stuff? Yes, please. Tell me about the lifestyle stuff. I mean, I work on roofs. What can I even change? I don't have much choice about that, you know? My wife… she worries about me falling, too. It’s a dangerous job.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out – your occupation is a significant factor. The lifestyle modifications wouldn't necessarily mean stopping your work, but rather minimizing strain and preventing further aggravation. Things like proper lifting techniques, taking frequent breaks, and ensuring adequate hydration. We can also discuss stretching exercises to improve flexibility and muscle strength. Regarding pain management, over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce discomfort. If those aren't sufficient, we can explore other options, but let's start with the blood work and see what that reveals. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?
PATIENT: Okay. Stretching… and being careful. I can try that. Ibu… whatever those pills are… I can get those. Yes, that sounds good. Blood work first. Then see what happens. I hope it's just… muscles. I really hope so. My wife… she’ll be so relieved. Can I still work while we wait for the results? I need the money, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bulaong. As long as you’re mindful of your discomfort and avoid activities that significantly aggravate the pain, it’s generally okay to continue working while we await the results. However, if the pain worsens or you experience any new symptoms – such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or radiating pain in your arm or jaw – please stop working immediately and seek medical attention. I’m ordering the blood work now. The lab is located just down the hall, and the receptionist will give you the necessary paperwork. Once the results are back – typically within 24-48 hours – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I feel a little better just… talking about it. And knowing what's going on. I’ll go get the blood work done now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or experience any changes. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
