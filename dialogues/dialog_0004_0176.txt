DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been… oh, let me think… more than two days now, I think. It's really getting annoying.
DOCTOR: More than two days of persistent hiccups. Annoying is… a rather understated way to put it, I suppose. Alright. Can you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… regular hiccups, I guess? You know, that little jerk in your chest, and you gasp? It’s not painful, just… startling. And they come on and off, but mostly on at this point. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water quickly… all the usual things people tell you, but nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Holding your breath and drinking water… standard maneuvers. And you’ve tried those repeatedly over the last two days with no relief. Any particular triggers you've noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggers? Not really, Doctor. Nothing I can think of. I was making lunch yesterday when they started, but I make lunch every day. And before that… I was just sitting, watching television. I hadn’t eaten anything unusual or done anything different, really. It just… began. Which is what's so frustrating.
DOCTOR: No clear inciting event. That makes it… less straightforward. Alright, Ms. Redeye, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my gallbladder out… oh, about fifteen years ago? And I had some bad back pain a few years back, but that cleared up with physiotherapy. Nothing major, really. I'm generally pretty healthy, for my age. I do get a little heartburn sometimes, if I eat something spicy, but I take those over-the-counter tablets for it. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, back pain resolved with physiotherapy, occasional heartburn managed with OTC medication. Good. Any other surgeries or hospitalizations I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No, not at all. Just the gallbladder. And a tonsillectomy when I was a little girl, but that was… a very long time ago. Honestly, I barely remember it. I haven’t been in a hospital for anything serious in decades.
DOCTOR: No other surgeries or hospitalizations reported. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes. And my brother, he… well, he had some heart trouble a few years back, but he’s doing okay now, thankfully. Nothing else that I can think of that’s relevant, really. I don’t see how any of that would relate to hiccups, but you asked.
DOCTOR: A family history of hypertension, diabetes and cardiac issues. Not directly relevant to hiccups, but important to note. Now, Ms. Redeye, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of, anyway. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications I’ve taken before. I take those heartburn tablets occasionally, like I said, and I've taken painkillers for headaches, but never anything serious. No swelling, no rashes, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, really.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Excellent. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Just the heartburn tablets, when I need them. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I've been a bit forgetful lately, so it's not regular. Honestly, I can't even remember the last time I took one. It’s been a bit of a chaotic few weeks. And no herbal remedies or anything like that, I don't really believe in those things.
DOCTOR: No regular medication, occasional heartburn tablets and sporadic multivitamin use. Alright. Ms. Redeye, I'm going to need to do a brief physical exam. It's unlikely the hiccups are due to anything serious, but it's best to rule things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I understand. It's just... they're very distracting. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no guarding. No masses palpated. Everything appears normal on initial examination. However, persistent hiccups for this duration warrant further investigation. I’m going to order some blood work to check your electrolyte levels and rule out any underlying metabolic imbalances.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Blood work sounds fine. I hope it doesn't take too long to get the results. It's just… I have a dinner reservation on Friday, and I'd really like to be able to enjoy it without hiccuping constantly. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Perhaps a specific diet?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your dinner reservation. The blood work should take 24-48 hours. As for diet, there's no specific diet known to cure hiccups, but avoiding carbonated beverages, spicy foods, and very hot or cold foods may help reduce irritation. Avoid alcohol as well, just to be safe. Try to eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of large ones. And I know you've tried holding your breath and drinking water, but continue those maneuvers. Sometimes, they work intermittently. If the hiccups become more frequent, or if you develop any other symptoms like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. No carbonated drinks, spicy foods, or anything too hot or cold. Smaller meals, and keep trying the breathing and water. And if anything gets worse, go to the emergency room. That's all clear. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. Hopefully, the blood work will give us some answers. Would I need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in three business days to discuss the results. We’ll review the blood work then and determine the next steps, if any are necessary. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a written summary of these instructions, and a requisition form for the blood work. The lab is located… …just across the street. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your time and attention. You've put my mind at ease a little, at least. I appreciate you taking this seriously. I'll go and get the blood work done right away. And I'll look forward to hearing from the nurse about the follow-up appointment. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. Get the blood work done as soon as possible. And don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any concerning symptoms before your appointment. Have a good day, Ms. Redeye.
