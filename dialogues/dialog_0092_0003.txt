DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, Doc, I don't have all day. It's this…shaking. My hand. Been happening for a while now, and it's getting worse. Makes it hard to…well, never mind what it makes hard to do. Just fix it, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. We'll do our best to figure out what's going on and find a solution. “A while now” is a bit vague, though. Could you tell me roughly how long you’ve been noticing the shaking, and has anything specific seemed to trigger it or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Honestly, I don't pay attention to those things. Old age, probably. It just started happening, Doc. Maybe six months ago? A year? It's all a blur, you know how it is. I used to have steady hands, could direct a whole film, now…well, look at it. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I see. It does appear you have a tremor present. And you’re right, it’s important to figure out the cause. While age can sometimes be a factor, there are several possibilities we need to rule out. Does the shaking happen constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I guess. Mostly when I'm trying to do something precise. Like…eating soup. Or signing things. Which I don’t do much of anymore, thankfully. Look, are you going to poke at it all day, or are you going to do something? I got things to get to. Old friends, you know? Not much time left for pleasantries.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I assure you I’m working to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. Knowing when it happens is very helpful. Let's start with a bit more about your medical background, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Other conditions? Oh, jeez. What am I, a walking hospital? Let me think… My wife, bless her soul, kept all those records. She was very organized. I… I had my prostate checked a few years back, I think. And my cholesterol was a little high. But honestly, Doc, I haven't spent my life worrying about my health. Too busy making movies! You know, important work. Not like sitting around taking pills.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It sounds like you've lived a full and active life. Knowing about the prostate check and cholesterol is helpful. Do you recall if you were prescribed any medications for either of those?
PATIENT: Ugh, medications…probably. Little blue pills for the prostate, I think. And something for the cholesterol…a statin, maybe? They all blur together after a while. My wife handled all of that. She’d bring them to me, I’d swallow them. I honestly don’t remember the names or doses. Really, Doc, are you grilling me about pills from ten years ago? It’s not going to help this shaking!
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m asking too many detailed questions, Mr. Baide. It’s important to have a complete picture, and medications can sometimes have side effects that could contribute to a tremor. Do you currently take any medications at all – even over-the-counter ones, or vitamins?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I don’t like taking things. Makes me feel…sluggish. I get by on coffee, mostly. Black, strong, like a good film. And maybe a little brandy now and then, to settle the nerves. But that's it. No pills. No vitamins. I'm a simple man, Doc. Simple. Just fix my hand and let me go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. No medications currently. Before we move on to a physical exam, let's briefly discuss your family history. Are there any neurological conditions – like Parkinson’s disease or essential tremor – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Parkinson's… essential… look, my family was Italian! We had everything. Heart problems, high blood pressure, bad tempers. But nothing fancy like…tremors or whatever you said. My father was a carpenter, my mother kept house. A very practical family. Not many doctors, let me tell you. Waste of time and money, if you ask me. Can we just get to the poking and prodding? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. We can proceed with a physical examination. I’m going to check your reflexes, coordination, and strength, and listen to your heart and lungs. This will help me gather more information. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Relax? Easy for you to say. Fine, fine. Just…be quick about it. And don't poke too hard. This old body doesn't bounce back like it used to. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I’m going to gently tap on your knees and elbows. Just let your legs relax, and don’t try to pull away. That's good… slightly diminished on the left, but within normal limits. Now, let's check your coordination. Could you please extend your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Arms out. What am I, a scarecrow? Hurry up, Doc. This is embarrassing. Everyone can see how unsteady I am.
DOCTOR: I see the tremor, Mr. Baide. And it appears a bit more pronounced with movement. Now, could you please touch your finger to your nose, then to my finger, repeatedly?
PATIENT: This is…this is ridiculous. I used to direct entire scenes with precision, now I can't even touch my nose? Look, Doc, you see? It’s awful. Just…what’s wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on the exam, you have a noticeable tremor, particularly with intentional movement, and some difficulty with coordination. The diminished reflexes are also worth noting. While these findings are suggestive of several possibilities, I don't have enough information to make a definitive diagnosis at this time. I'm going to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation and potentially imaging of the brain. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: More tests? A neurologist? Oh, for crying out loud. Look, Doc, I'm an old man. I've lived a long life. Do I really need to spend my remaining days running around getting poked and prodded? Can't you just give me something for the shaking? A pill, maybe? Anything. Just make it stop. I have friends to see, you know. I don't have time for all this…fuss. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I respect your wishes. However, simply masking the symptom without knowing the underlying cause could be detrimental. There are several potential causes for a tremor, some of which are easily treatable, while others require more intensive management. I want to ensure we are taking the best possible approach for your overall health. I can discuss medication options with you, but I strongly recommend at least consulting with a neurologist first. They can perform more specialized tests to determine the exact cause of the tremor and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan. For now, I will order the blood tests to rule out any obvious underlying medical conditions. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any activities that exacerbate the shaking. Would you be willing to at least consider a neurology consultation?
