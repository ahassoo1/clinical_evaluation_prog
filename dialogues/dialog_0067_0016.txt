DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. It’s…fine. Look, it’s about my bruising. It's getting worse, and frankly, it’s concerning. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, Warfarin…or whatever it’s called. And I bump into things, normal things, and I end up looking like a plum. It’s just…not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're concerned about increased bruising, especially given you're on Warfarin. It's good you brought this to my attention. To start, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this bruising becoming more frequent or severe?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s been…gradual. It’s not like one day it was fine and the next I was covered. But maybe…the last month or so? It feels like I’m bruising from nothing. A slight knock against the doorframe, things like that. And the bruises themselves…they seem bigger. And last longer. It’s just…annoying, really. Though my wife…well, she would get worried. She always did.
DOCTOR: Okay, so over the past month or so, you've noticed a gradual increase in bruising with even minor impacts, and the bruises are larger and taking longer to resolve. That does sound concerning, especially with the Warfarin. Just to be thorough, can you describe a recent bruise for me?
PATIENT: Well…let me think. Just yesterday, I was moving a small side table in the living room – nothing heavy, really. Just shifting it a bit. And I think I bumped my shin on the leg of it. Not hard. Anyway, now I've got a bruise there. It’s…purplish, already. And it's about the size of a silver dollar, maybe a bit bigger. It’s not excruciatingly painful, just…tender. Like a really bad ache. It's not like I’m falling down stairs or anything. It’s just…normal movements.
DOCTOR: Okay, a purplish bruise about the size of a silver dollar on your shin after a minor bump, accompanied by tenderness. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides what might be causing the bruising?
PATIENT: Well, I had…high blood pressure for a while. They got that under control with pills, years ago, though. And I had my gallbladder removed, decades ago. Other than that…not much. I was always a pretty healthy man, even if I do say so myself. I was a good athlete in my youth. This bruising…it just doesn't fit. It feels…wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of controlled high blood pressure and a gallbladder removal, but generally consider yourself healthy. That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications besides the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Just the Warfarin, Doctor. And a little something for my…well, for my sleep. Nothing major, just a low dose. The doctor said it would help me rest easier. Can’t remember the name of it, honestly. It's a small, white pill. I take it before bed. That's it. I try to keep things simple. Too many pills, you know? Makes you feel worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin and a small white pill for sleep. We'll try to get the name of that sleep medication later, just to be sure. Now, have you had any recent illnesses or infections?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had a little cold a few months back, but that was it. Nothing serious. Just a sniffle and a cough. Got over it quickly enough. I haven’t been to the hospital for anything in…well, ages. Aside from regular check-ups, of course. This bruising is the problem, not some illness. It’s the blood thinner, I just know it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent illnesses or infections. Let's talk about your family history. Do any of your family members have a history of bleeding disorders or easy bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. My father…he was a hearty man, always working, never sick. My mother, she was…delicate. She did bruise easily, I remember that now. But we just thought she was…frail. She didn't have any real medical problems, as far as I know. No one ever talked about bleeding disorders or anything like that. Just…normal things. It wasn’t something we discussed.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother bruised easily, but no known history of bleeding disorders in the family. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive, mind you. Just one or two glasses. Helps me relax. My wife…she used to say I needed it. Not every night, of course. Just when I’m feeling a bit stressed. It doesn’t interfere with anything. I’m not a…drinker, if that makes sense. Just a social drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional social drinking – one or two glasses of wine with dinner. And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I was raised better than that. I’ve never touched the stuff in my life. My wife would have…well, let's just say she wouldn't have approved. I’m a respectable man, Doctor. A retired pathologist. I've spent my life treating people, not…indulging in such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recreational drug use. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. Not to penicillin, not to shellfish, nothing. My wife used to make me try all sorts of things, just to be sure. She was very careful. She always worried about me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Farson, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then, I'd like to take a closer look at the bruise on your shin, and check for any other signs of bruising or bleeding. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get on with it, then. I just want to know what's causing this. It’s unsettling, you know? I don’t like feeling…fragile.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Heart and lungs sound good. Now, let's take a look at that bruise on your shin. Okay. The bruise is about two inches across, tender, and there are a few smaller bruises on your forearms as well. I don't see any signs of swelling or warmth. I’m also going to check your capillary refill. Capillary refill is normal. Everything looks okay outwardly, but these multiple bruises with minimal trauma are concerning, especially given you're on Warfarin. To get a better understanding of what’s happening, I’d like to order some blood work. It will check your Warfarin level, your complete blood count, and some coagulation studies. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…sensible. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out. Frankly, I’m a bit worried it’s something serious. A man my age doesn’t want to be…falling apart. What do I need to do? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. It’s good we’re getting this checked out. Okay, I'll have the nurse draw some blood from you before you leave. The results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. We'll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause injury. Be careful with sharp objects, and let someone know if you're feeling unsteady. I’m going to advise you to temporarily hold one dose of your Warfarin, just to be cautious, and we’ll adjust the dosage based on your blood work results. Do not stop taking it completely unless I specifically tell you to. I also want to rule out any other potential causes of bruising. If you develop any new symptoms – like bleeding gums, nosebleeds, blood in your stool or urine, or severe headache – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hold one dose? That’s…alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t cause any problems. And I’ll be careful. What about…the sleep pills? Could those be contributing to this?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. It's less likely, but some medications can interact with Warfarin and increase the risk of bleeding. It’s another reason why getting the name of that sleep medication is important. We'll need to check for potential drug interactions once we know what you’re taking. For now, continue taking the sleep pills as prescribed, but let me know the name of it as soon as you can remember or if you have the bottle with you. I’ll add it to your chart so we can review it thoroughly. I also want to mention that sometimes, bruising can be a sign of an underlying medical condition. We’ll be running a complete blood count, which will help us rule out things like anemia or other blood disorders. Do you have any family history of bleeding problems, even if you weren’t sure about it before?
PATIENT: Hmm…now that you mention it…my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had some sort of…problem with her blood. I remember my mother talking about it, vaguely. She said she bled easily after minor surgeries. But it was a long time ago, and I don't know any details. They didn’t have the same medical technology back then, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information. A family history of easy bleeding, even if it wasn’t fully diagnosed, is something we need to consider. It might indicate a genetic predisposition to bleeding disorders. We’ll keep that in mind as we review your blood work results. Alright, Mr. Farson. I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood and give you instructions on holding one dose of your Warfarin. We’ll call you within 24 to 48 hours with the results. In the meantime, please be careful, avoid injury, and let me know if you experience any new symptoms. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Just…get the results as quickly as possible, Doctor. I don’t like feeling like this. And thank you…for taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. We will do our best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. I understand your concern, and we’ll work together to figure out what’s going on. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day, and take care. .
