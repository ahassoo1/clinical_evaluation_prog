DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. My name is Dr. Solero, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Welcome to the clinic. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just… won't stop. It’s been over two days now, and it's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Hiccups lasting for over two days can be quite disruptive. Let's try to figure out what might be causing them. To start, can you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Oh, they’re… regular, I suppose. Not super strong, but consistent. Every few seconds, boom. It doesn’t really matter what I'm doing – eating, drinking, sitting, walking… they just keep happening. And it feels… strange, like a little flutter in my chest each time. Not painful, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, “regular” and consistent, not painful, just annoying, and you feel a flutter in your chest with each one. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don’t think so. I was having lunch with a friend yesterday, and they started right up mid-conversation. Before that… I was just getting ready for bed, I think. Nothing special. I tried drinking water, like you always hear, but that didn’t do anything. I haven't changed my diet or anything either. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Okay, no obvious triggers, water hasn’t helped, and no recent changes in your routine or diet. Alright. Have you experienced hiccups like this before, or is this a new experience for you?
PATIENT: This is… unusual. I get hiccups sometimes, like anyone, but they usually go away pretty quickly. A few sips of water, and they’re gone. This is the longest they’ve ever lasted. I don't remember having them go on for this long before, not ever. It's really starting to worry me, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially since this is different from what you’ve experienced before. We’ll certainly look into it. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… the usual things. High blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. And some arthritis in my knees, but that’s all. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was a long time ago, and everything was fine after that. I don’t really go to the doctor much, honestly. I try to stay healthy. And I take my blood pressure pills every day, like I'm supposed to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so managed hypertension and a history of gallbladder removal. That’s good to know. And you take your medication regularly, that’s excellent. Any family history of… unusual medical conditions, or anything that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a tricky one. My mother had diabetes, and my father had heart problems. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had something with her nerves, I think. It made her shake a lot. I don’t really know much about it, to be honest. We weren’t very close, and she lived far away. It wasn't something we talked about much, even at family gatherings. It was just… a thing. Do you need me to be more specific? I’m not very good at remembering medical details.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Ivette. Knowing about diabetes, heart problems, and a possible nerve condition in your aunt is helpful enough. We can always look into it further if needed. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But I try not to take it too often. It doesn't agree with my stomach. I usually just try to rest when my knees are bad. I've been trying some over-the-counter creams too. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and occasional ibuprofen for your knees. That's good to know. Before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've eaten everything, pretty much. And I haven’t had any reactions to any medications in the past. I haven’t had any trouble with the blood pressure pills, or anything else, for that matter. My mother was very careful about what I ate when I was a child, so I’m pretty sure I haven’t come across anything I'm allergic to. She wouldn’t let me have too much sugar, or anything with artificial colours. She was a bit of a health nut, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ivette. No known allergies is certainly helpful. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your throat and chest. Just a quick check to make sure everything looks and sounds okay. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want these hiccups to stop, honestly. They're driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll do our best. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lung sounds are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let me take a quick look at your throat. Say “ah” for me. Throat is clear, no signs of inflammation. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your chest to check for any tenderness. No tenderness to palpation. Everything feels normal. Your chest wall feels fine, no obvious abnormalities.
PATIENT: Okay… that all sounds good, I guess. It doesn't feel like anything is wrong, so that's reassuring. But these hiccups… they're still there! What could be causing them if everything feels normal? I’m starting to get worried it’s something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ivette. It is frustrating when things don’t seem to have a clear cause, and prolonged hiccups can be worrying. While the physical exam didn’t reveal anything obvious, hiccups can sometimes be caused by things that aren't easily detectable on a routine exam. We can consider a few possibilities. Sometimes, hiccups can be related to irritation of the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm. This can be caused by things like acid reflux, certain medications, or even stress. Less commonly, they can be associated with more serious conditions, but given your otherwise normal exam, that's less likely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a couple of tests. A basic blood panel to check your electrolytes and kidney function, and an upper endoscopy to rule out any irritation in your esophagus. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, okay. I suppose that's what we have to do. I don't like the idea of a scope, but if it rules things out, then it's worth it. I just want to know what's going on. Blood tests are fine. And… what does an endoscopy involve exactly? Is it very uncomfortable? And… will I have to fast beforehand? I have a lunch date on Thursday, and I don’t want to cancel it.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ivette, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. An upper endoscopy involves a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end being gently inserted down your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining. It allows us to check for any irritation, inflammation, or other abnormalities. We would give you a sedative to help you relax and minimize any discomfort. Most patients don’t remember much of the procedure. It typically takes about 15-20 minutes. There is some mild discomfort afterwards, like a slight sore throat, but it usually resolves quickly. Yes, you would need to fast for at least six to eight hours before the procedure. Unfortunately, that would likely mean rescheduling your lunch date on Thursday. I apologize for that inconvenience. We can schedule the endoscopy for another day that works better for you. Would you like me to explain the blood tests in more detail as well?
PATIENT: Six to eight hours… that's a long time. Okay. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. And I guess rescheduling the lunch is okay. It's not a very important date. Yes, please, tell me about the blood tests. What exactly are you looking for? And… will the results take a long time to come back? I just want to get this sorted out as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The blood tests are relatively straightforward. We'll be checking your electrolyte levels – things like sodium, potassium, and chloride – as imbalances can sometimes cause hiccups. We'll also assess your kidney function, as kidney problems can also contribute. And we’ll do a general check of your blood count to make sure everything is within normal ranges. The results usually take about 24 to 48 hours to come back, depending on the lab. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, since the hiccups are persistent, I can prescribe you a medication called Baclofen. It's a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help calm the diaphragm and reduce hiccups. It’s not a guaranteed fix, but it’s worth trying while we wait for the test results. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Baclofen… a muscle relaxant. I’ve never taken anything like that before. What are the side effects? I don't want to feel drowsy or anything. I have to run errands and things. And… is it something I’ll have to take forever? I really don’t like taking medication unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible question, Ivette. It’s important to be aware of potential side effects. Baclofen can sometimes cause drowsiness, dizziness, and muscle weakness. However, these side effects are usually mild and temporary. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If you experience any significant side effects, we can adjust the dosage or discontinue the medication. And no, you wouldn't have to take it forever. We'll use it as a temporary measure to help manage the hiccups while we investigate the underlying cause. Once we have the test results and a clearer understanding of what’s going on, we can adjust your treatment plan accordingly. If the Baclofen doesn’t provide relief or the hiccups worsen, we might consider a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist… that sounds a bit serious. But… okay. If it's necessary, then I guess. And starting with a low dose of the Baclofen sounds good. As long as I don’t feel completely knocked out. So… what do I need to do now? Do I need to make an appointment for the blood tests and the… the scope? And when can I schedule the lunch date for? I should probably get that sorted out before I forget.
DOCTOR: You're right to feel a little overwhelmed, Ivette. It’s a lot to take in. Let's take it one step at a time. Here’s a referral form for the blood tests. You can schedule those at any lab that accepts your insurance. The lab technician will give you instructions on how to prepare. And here's a prescription for the Baclofen. Start with one 10mg tablet three times a day. As for the endoscopy, our scheduling department will contact you within the next 24 hours to arrange an appointment. They'll discuss your availability and insurance coverage. They can also help you reschedule your lunch date if needed. For now, focus on getting the blood tests scheduled and starting the Baclofen. If you experience any concerning side effects, or if the hiccups worsen despite the medication, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I appreciate your patience. I’m still a bit worried, but I feel a little better knowing what we’re going to do. Hopefully, this Baclofen will do the trick. And… if it doesn’t, well, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Thank you again, Doctor Solero. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. You have a good day as well, and please, don’t worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
