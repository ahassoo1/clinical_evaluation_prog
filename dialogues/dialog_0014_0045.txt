DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. My face gets very red. Happens sometimes, not all the time. It’s been… a few weeks now, I think. Maybe a month? Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Right, flushing. A month… okay. And is it just your face, or does it happen anywhere else?
PATIENT: Just my face, mostly. Sometimes my neck feels warm too, when it happens. Not red, just… warm. It doesn’t hurt, you know? Just feels… hot. Like I’ve been working in the sun. But I haven’t been!
DOCTOR: Hmm. And does anything seem to bring it on?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I don't know, really. It just… happens. Sometimes after I eat. Not always the same food. And sometimes when I’m talking… if I get a little excited, maybe? But not always when I talk. It’s very strange. I wish I knew what it was!
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems somewhat unpredictable. And you said after eating sometimes… anything in particular you've noticed?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat a lot of… Indian food, of course. Spicy things, sometimes. But it happens with other things too. Rice, vegetables… it’s very confusing. I had some chicken yesterday, and nothing happened. I had some… samosas the day before, and my face was very red for a bit. I don't know what to tell you!
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it doesn't sound like a simple allergy then, if it’s so varied. Do you have any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. Maybe a little… sweaty sometimes. But only on my face, where it’s red. Not all over, you know? And no… no headache, no dizziness. Just the red face and the warm feeling. Sometimes a little… shaky, maybe? But that could be something else. I get shaky sometimes anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any changes in your medications lately?
PATIENT: Medications? No, no changes. I don’t take anything regularly. Not since… my wife passed. She used to remind me. But… no. No medications. Just a little something for my stomach sometimes, if I eat something bad. But that’s it. Just over-the-counter stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any family history of… skin conditions?
PATIENT: Skin conditions? Hmm… my mother had… something on her hands. Very dry skin, mostly. Nothing on her face. My father… he didn't have any skin problems that I know of. I don't remember. It was a long time ago. No, I don’t think so. Nothing I can remember, anyway. It wasn't something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Right. Well… let’s take a look. If you don't mind. I want to just check your blood pressure and pulse, and I’ll have a quick look at your skin. It's probably nothing, but best to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need. That sounds good. My wife always said I worried too much. Maybe that's what it is. Just worry. But it feels… real, you know?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 135 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78… regular. Now, let me just have a look at your skin. Hmm. Yes, there is some flushing. No rash, no bumps… just redness. Skin feels… warm to the touch. It could be rosacea. Or… sometimes, these things can be related to diet or even stress. It’s difficult to say for sure.
PATIENT: Rosacea? What is that? Is it… bad? I try not to get too stressed. I have a quiet life now, mostly. Read books, watch a little television… Is it something I need to worry about? Is there something I can do?
DOCTOR: Rosacea is a common skin condition that causes redness and flushing, sometimes small bumps. It's not life-threatening, but it can be… bothersome. It tends to flare up and then calm down. As for what you can do… We can try to identify any triggers – things that seem to make it worse. Avoid spicy foods, alcohol, and anything that causes you to overheat. I can also prescribe a topical cream to help reduce the redness. It doesn’t cure it, but it can help manage the symptoms. We can also try a low-dose antibiotic; sometimes these can help with inflammation. But honestly, it often requires a bit of trial and error to figure out what works best for you.
PATIENT: Topical cream… that sounds okay. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. And avoiding spicy food… that might be hard! What about the antibiotic? What are the side effects? And how long would I have to take it? I don't want to try something that's going to make me feel worse.
DOCTOR: The antibiotic is usually well-tolerated, but some people experience mild stomach upset, nausea, or diarrhea. It's usually temporary. We would start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. The course is usually several months, to see if it helps control the inflammation. It’s not a cure, remember, but it can help manage the flares. Honestly, given your history and the fact that you’re not on any other medications, I think we can start with the topical cream and see if that helps. If that doesn’t give you enough relief, we can consider the antibiotic. But let’s try the simpler approach first. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Topical cream first. I can try that. What kind of cream is it? And how do I put it on? And… how long before I should see any difference? I don't want to wait too long and have my face stay red forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, here's a prescription for Metronidazole cream. You apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice daily, after washing your face gently. It might take several weeks to see a noticeable improvement, sometimes even longer. It’s important to be consistent with the application. If you don’t see any change after 6-8 weeks, let me know and we can reassess. Also, avoid harsh soaps, scrubbing, and excessive sun exposure. A broad-spectrum sunscreen is essential. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Metronidazole… okay. Twice a day. And sunscreen. No… I don’t think so. Sunscreen… I used to use that with my wife. No, no more questions. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll try the cream. And I’ll… be careful with the sun.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. If you don’t see any improvement after 6-8 weeks, or if you experience any irritation from the cream, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any other concerns. It was nice to meet you. And please, try not to worry too much. It’s usually a manageable condition. .
PATIENT: It was nice to meet you too, Doctor. Thank you for your help. I will… try not to worry.
