DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. Or… is it brightful?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Galena. Yes, Brightful is correct. It’s… a family name. Though, truthfully, I don’t recall much about the family, if I’m being honest. It’s… been some time.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Family names… they stick around, don’t they?
PATIENT: They do, it seems. You see, I’m here for… clearance? For a surgery I’m considering. I was told I needed to be checked over first. I apologize if I seem… vague. It’s been a difficult few years, and my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Surgery… yes, of course. Clearance. Right. Well, let’s try and get a picture of what’s going on, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. I’m… quite open to discussing things, though I may need some gentle prompting if I’m not recalling details clearly. It's nothing… dramatic, I assure you. Just… gaps. Mostly gaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll take it slow. Now, I see here you’re 29 years old. And… Colombian heritage, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Colombian, on my mother’s side, at least. I… I don't actually know much about my father's side. It’s… a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. But my mother was very proud of her heritage. I grew up hearing stories… though, the details are… fading.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s focus on you then. What kind of surgery are you considering, Mackenzi?
PATIENT: It’s… a facial reconstruction. There was an accident… some time ago. It wasn't… pleasant. I'm hoping to… restore some of what was lost. It’s mostly cosmetic, I suppose, but it would… improve my confidence, certainly. I understand it’s a big decision, and I wouldn’t be here if I hadn’t thought it through very carefully. Though, again, my recollections of the time around the accident are… patchy.
DOCTOR: Facial reconstruction… right. And when did this accident occur, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a difficult question. It was… several years ago. Perhaps… three or four? It’s hard to say precisely. I… I remember the immediate aftermath, of course, and the hospital. But the events leading up to it… and even the details of what actually happened… they’re quite hazy. It feels like a dream, almost. A very unpleasant dream. I apologize for the vagueness. I truly do.
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s alright, Mackenzi. These things happen. Trauma can do strange things to memory. We'll work around it. Do you remember anything at all about how the accident occurred?
PATIENT: There was… a vehicle. I think. And… rain. It was a very stormy night. I recall… a lot of noise. And then… darkness. I believe I was a passenger in a car, but… who was driving? Where were we going? I honestly can’t say. It’s just… fragments. Like broken glass. I remember feeling… very scared. And then… nothing, until I woke up in the hospital. I’m so sorry. This is incredibly frustrating, isn’t it? I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Right, fragments. Okay. Well, let’s shift gears a little. Are you experiencing any pain currently?
PATIENT: No, not currently. There was pain, of course, after the initial injury, and during the recovery process. But that’s long subsided. Now, it’s more… a feeling of… incompleteness, perhaps? A cosmetic discomfort, rather than a physical one. I do sometimes experience a little… sensitivity to the touch, but it’s nothing severe. Certainly not debilitating. I’m more concerned with the appearance, honestly. It affects my confidence, as I mentioned. And… my ability to… reintegrate, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I haven't been to a doctor in… quite some time, I’m afraid. After… everything. I suppose I should have been more diligent. But truthfully, I… avoided it. It was easier to pretend everything was fine. I’m generally quite healthy, though. I spend a lot of time outdoors, working in the gardens… which is, admittedly, a rather physical job. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink. I just… haven’t had much reason to see a doctor. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant. Though, again, my recollection of the details of my policy are… hazy. I apologize for the constant vagueness.
DOCTOR: Right, gardens… good. Okay. Any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I work with plants all the time, so I would likely know if I had any severe allergies. I sometimes get a little… itchy skin after handling certain flowers, but I always assumed that was just the pollen. It’s never been anything serious enough to require medication. I’ve never had a reaction to food, either, as far as I can recall. I’m quite careful about what I eat, actually. I prefer fresh, natural foods. Though, as I’ve mentioned, my memory isn’t always reliable. Perhaps I’m forgetting something?
DOCTOR: Right. No allergies. Okay. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking any medications at all. I haven’t needed to, thankfully. I prefer to… manage things naturally, if possible. Lots of rest, healthy eating, and… fresh air. I try to avoid relying on pills, if I can. Though, as you may have gathered, my overall healthcare hasn’t been… optimal, in recent years. But I’m hoping to change that now. I’m ready to… face things, and get everything sorted out. If you’ll excuse the pun.
DOCTOR: Right, no medications… okay. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you need me to do, Doctor. I'll try to be as helpful as possible. Just… please be gentle. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, quite some time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. And then we'll listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. 130 over 80. A little elevated, but nothing too concerning. Now, let me listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear… No wheezing or crackles. Skin looks good… No rashes or unusual markings. Overall… things seem alright physically. But we should probably run some blood work just to be sure.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear. Blood work sounds sensible, yes. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. It’s… a relief to finally be taking this seriously, to be honest. Though, I do apologize if I’ve been… a bit of a handful. My memory is… persistently unreliable, as you’ve probably noticed. But I’m trying. I really am. Do you need any further information from me at this time, Doctor? Perhaps regarding the surgery itself? Or… anything else?
DOCTOR: No, no, you've been perfectly fine. It’s just… a lot to piece together. Regarding the surgery… do you have the name of the surgeon?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. I… I believe it was Dr. Ramirez. Yes, that sounds right. Dr. Isabella Ramirez. She came highly recommended by… someone. I’m afraid I don’t recall who recommended her specifically. It was a friend, perhaps? Or a colleague? My memory is… frustratingly vague on those details. I have her contact information somewhere… I believe. I might have it written down in my planner, or… perhaps in my phone. Let me see…
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's get those blood work orders in. And I'll put in a request for your medical records from Dr. Ramirez, if possible. That should help us get a clearer picture of things. Here you go. Just take this to the lab downstairs. They're open until five. And then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week sounds perfectly fine. Whatever works best for you, Doctor. Thank you so much for your patience. And for… everything. It’s a relief to finally be taking this seriously, and I appreciate you helping me piece things together. I’ll head down to the lab right away. Do I need to bring anything else with me? Or… just this form?
DOCTOR: Just the form will be fine. They may ask for your insurance information, though. But don’t worry about it too much. And… try not to stress about it, okay?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. I will do my best. And thank you again for your reassurance. It means a great deal. I think… I think that’s everything for now? I’ll head down to the lab, and I’ll look forward to hearing from you next week. Please… don’t hesitate to contact me if you need anything further. Have a good day, Doctor Galena. And thank you once more. .
