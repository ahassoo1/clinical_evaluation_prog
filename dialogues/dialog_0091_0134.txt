DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's... it’s been a bit of a bother, this feeling. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I just don’t feel hungry like I used to. Even when I am hungry, I get full awful quick. It’s just…not right. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. Seems like a while now, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Kelder. It sounds quite bothersome, indeed. It’s helpful you’ve noticed the nausea, decreased appetite, and early fullness. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the nausea a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How to describe it… It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More like a queasy feeling, all the time, or coming and going. It doesn’t always mean I’m gonna be sick, just… unsettled. Sometimes it’s worse in the mornings, I think, but honestly, my mornings all kinda blend together these days. And it doesn’t seem to be tied to anything I eat, not that I've noticed. I used to be able to eat just about anything, you know? Now… not so much. I just don't have much of an appetite. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Kelder. A constant or intermittent queasiness without a clear trigger is certainly helpful information. And the change in your appetite is also important. To further understand what might be going on, could you tell me if you've experienced any other symptoms alongside the nausea and loss of appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Well, I’ve been a little tired lately, more so than usual. But at my age, aren’t we all a little tired? I’ve also lost a bit of weight, I suppose. My clothes are a little looser, but I haven't been weighing myself regularly. Oh! And… sometimes I feel a little bloated, like I’m full of air. But that comes and goes too. It’s hard to say what’s connected to what, with everything. I’m sorry if I’m not being very helpful. My memory just isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Kelder. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling details, and you’ve provided valuable information already. The fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and bloating are all relevant. Now, regarding your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a hard one. Let me see… Well, years ago, the doctor told me I had… something with my stomach. Not ulcers, but something similar. I had to take some pills for it, and it seemed to help at the time. And… I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, a bad one. But other than that… I don’t rightly recall. I've seen doctors, of course, over the years, but I don’t always remember what they said. And… I'm being treated for cancer, right now. That’s… that’s why I’m here, isn’t it? I'm sorry, I just get so confused sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be confused, Ms. Kelder. We can take our time. You mentioned a previous stomach issue and pneumonia, and that you are currently undergoing cancer treatment. Could you tell me what type of cancer you are being treated for, and what treatment you are receiving?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It’s… pancreatic cancer. Stage… I think it's stage two? It's been a while since the doctor explained it all. I'm getting chemotherapy, every other week. And… pills. Lots of pills. I don’t know all the names of them, honestly. They make me tired, and sometimes I get a little sick, but… that’s to be expected, isn’t it? I've been going to Dr. Miller for that, but he's the oncologist. I thought you knew… Is this not about the cancer treatment? I'm so sorry, I'm rambling again.
DOCTOR: You are not rambling at all, Ms. Kelder. It's very helpful to know you are undergoing chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. It’s important to understand the potential side effects of the treatment, and your symptoms could certainly be related to that. To clarify, these current symptoms – the nausea, loss of appetite, early fullness, fatigue, and bloating – are new or have they been present throughout your chemotherapy treatment?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a good question. I think… they've gotten worse lately. I felt a little tired and queasy at the beginning of the chemo, but nothing like this. The fullness… that’s new, I think. And the bloating too. It seems to be happening more and more often, and it’s… uncomfortable. The tiredness… well, that’s always been there, but it’s deeper now, if that makes sense. It’s harder to get out of bed in the mornings, and I just don’t have the energy to do things I used to enjoy. It’s just… different now. More troublesome.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. That distinction is important. Since these symptoms have worsened recently, despite being on chemotherapy, we need to investigate further. Now, regarding your past surgical history, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, yes. Years and years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. And… when I was a little girl, I had my tonsils taken out. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else that I can recall. I had a C-section with my daughter, but that was a long time ago. Does that… does that matter? I'm sorry, I just don’t remember everything as clearly as I used to. It's like looking at old photographs, you know? Fuzzy around the edges.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Kelder, but it's perfectly alright that the details are fuzzy. The gallbladder removal is helpful information. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tough one. My mother… she had stomach trouble for years, but I don’t know what it was exactly. And my father… he had heart problems. My sister… she had diabetes. But other than that… I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. We weren’t a family that talked a lot about those things, you know? It was… not something we did. And a lot of my family… they’re gone now. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… hard to remember. It feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing your mother had stomach trouble and your father had heart problems is helpful. Now, regarding your social history, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven't touched a drop of alcohol since… well, since I got married. And definitely no recreational drugs. I was raised better than that, you know? I always believed in living a clean and healthy life. I do enjoy a cup of tea in the evenings, though. And sometimes a little bit of chocolate. But nothing… nothing bad. I’ve always been a homebody, really. I prefer gardening and spending time with my animals. That's my life, you see? Simple and quiet.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Ms. Kelder. And enjoying tea and a little chocolate is perfectly fine. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy after I’ve been gardening, but that’s probably just the plants. And… no, I don’t have any known allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way, you see? I haven’t had to worry about those things. I think that’s about it. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm getting a little tired now, to be honest. It's been a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Kelder, I believe that covers everything for now. Thank you for being so thorough. Given your history of pancreatic cancer and current chemotherapy treatment, these new or worsening symptoms – nausea, early satiety, fatigue, and bloating – could be related to the treatment itself. However, it is important to rule out other potential causes, especially given the recent increase in symptom severity. I'd like to perform a physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. If you think it’s best. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, you see? I want to enjoy my life again. I just want to be able to spend time with my animals. Whatever you think is best, I’m willing to do. Please, just help me feel better. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kelder. We will do everything we can. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. There’s some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, but no obvious masses. Do you experience pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that feels a little uncomfortable. Not sharp pain, exactly, but a dull ache. Like a heavy feeling. It’s worse when I press down. It’s… it’s been like that for a few days now, I think. It doesn't go away completely, even when you're not pressing. It's just...there. A constant discomfort. It’s just adding to everything else, you see? I don't know what to expect anymore.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to check for any fluid accumulation in your abdomen. There appears to be some mild ascites – fluid accumulation – in your abdomen. Now, I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds. Your bowel sounds are present, though somewhat diminished. Based on the physical exam, the tenderness in your upper abdomen, and the presence of ascites, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. The ascites, in particular, could be related to your cancer, but we need to rule out other causes. I recommend ordering some blood work and an abdominal ultrasound to get a clearer picture. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and an ultrasound… alright. If that’s what it takes to find out what’s going on, then let’s do it. I just want to know what’s happening, you see? I don't want to be left in the dark. If it’s the cancer, then I need to know. If it’s something else… well, I need to know that too. Please, just help me figure this out. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Kelder. We will get to the bottom of this. I'll order the blood work and schedule the abdominal ultrasound for you as soon as possible. The blood work will help us assess your liver function, kidney function, and check for any signs of infection. The ultrasound will allow us to visualize your liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen, and assess the amount of ascites. I will have the lab draw the blood now, and the ultrasound will be scheduled for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, vomiting, or difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I just need to… process it all, I suppose. Tomorrow morning for the ultrasound… alright. And if anything gets worse, go to the emergency room. I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening to me, and for taking the time to figure out what’s going on. It means a lot. It really does. I’m just… tired. But I’m glad I came in today. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. That’s what I’m here for. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your ultrasound tomorrow. We'll discuss the results as soon as they're available. Get some rest, Ms. Kelder. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way.
