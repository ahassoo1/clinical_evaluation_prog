DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s…well, it’s nothing terribly important, Doctor. Just a bit of…darkening, I suppose. And fatigue. Quite a lot of fatigue, actually. I’ve been working, you see. Always working. Reinforcing iron. It’s honest work, unlike some…but that’s beside the point. I simply wish to know if it’s anything…serious. And frankly, I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: “Darkening”… are you referring to a change in your skin color, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is precisely what I meant. Is your profession to question how I articulate my ailments? It’s darkening. My skin is becoming…less bright. And it accompanies this wretched tiredness. It’s quite obvious, isn’t it? I should think a physician would notice these things without needing…elaboration.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mr. Drahota. I simply want to be certain I understand correctly. It’s important to get the details right. When did you first notice this darkening, and where on your body is it most prominent?
PATIENT: Honestly, details… It was…some time ago. Weeks, perhaps? Months? It’s all rather blurred, you see. I work. I sleep. The cycle continues. As for where… well, on my hands, mostly. And my face, I suspect. It’s hard to say. I don’t spend a great deal of time admiring myself in the mirror, Doctor. It’s a waste of valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned fatigue. Is this a new fatigue, or have you generally felt tired?
PATIENT: New fatigue? Doctor, I am eighty-five years old. Fatigue is a constant companion. But this is…worse. More debilitating. It’s difficult to explain. It feels…deeper. It’s not merely being tired after a long day of work. It's being tired while working. And before. And even…when resting. It’s quite bothersome, really. Are you going to ask me about my diet next? Because I assure you, it’s perfectly adequate.
DOCTOR: No, I won’t pry into your diet unless it becomes relevant. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the darkening and fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, my joints ache. But that’s hardly new, is it? Old age, Doctor. It comes with the territory. And I’ve been…a bit more forgetful than usual, perhaps. Though, to be fair, my mind has never been a steel trap. No, I can’t think of anything else particularly noteworthy. Are we nearing the end of this, Doctor? I have…commitments.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more questions. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Perfectly normal. I eat when I’m hungry, and not when I’m not. It’s quite simple, really. I fail to see how that's relevant. Honestly, Doctor, are you certain you're qualified for this? You seem to be focusing on trivial matters. Is this standard procedure? This…interrogation? I simply want to know if I'm gravely ill or not. And if not, I’d like to be on my way.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your frustration. I'm trying to gather information to help determine the cause of your symptoms. A change in appetite can be relevant. Now, have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now there’s a question. Perhaps a little. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, you understand. It's not as if I'm obsessed with such things. But my clothes… they might be a bit looser. It's barely noticeable. It could be the heat. Or simply the natural process of… diminishing. Is that satisfactory? Can we conclude this now? I assure you, I'm not on the verge of collapse. Just…tired. And a bit darker.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a quick look at your hands and face. Just a brief examination, to get a better sense of the darkening you’ve described. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Very well. But make it quick, Doctor. I haven’t got all day. And please, be gentle. My hands are tools, you see. I need them for my work.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some darkening on your hands and face, as you described. The skin also appears a bit dry. Do you use any creams or lotions on your skin?
PATIENT: Creams and lotions? Doctor, I am a reinforcing iron worker, not a socialite. I use grease and grime. That’s what protects my hands. What sort of question is this? Honestly, I’ve spent my life building things, not pampering myself. Is this getting us anywhere? Or are we simply cataloging my…lack of refinement?
DOCTOR: Alright. Mr. Drahota, based on what you’ve told me and this brief exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing your darkening and fatigue. It could be related to sun exposure, especially given your work, or it could be something else. Given your age and symptoms, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, for heaven’s sake. More poking and prodding? I suppose it’s inevitable. Very well, Doctor. But if it’s going to involve a lengthy wait and a complicated procedure, I want no part of it. And I expect a clear and concise explanation of the results. No medical jargon, please. Just… tell me if I’m dying or not. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: .
