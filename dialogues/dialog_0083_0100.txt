DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Let me see… right, the paperwork said something about a… a check-up? Or maybe a test? Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. Something about making sure I’m… okay to keep doing what I do. It's… the job, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you scheduled an evaluation for continued employment purposes. That's perfectly alright, many employers require these. To get a better understanding of your current health status, could you tell me a little more about your job?
PATIENT: Oh, right, the job. Well, I… operate some pretty big machines. You know, the ones that smooth out roads and stuff? And… pack down the dirt? It’s… loud. And dusty. Been doing it a long time, though. A long time. Before… well, never mind that. It keeps me busy, that's for sure. Is that what you needed to know? I sometimes forget the details, sorry. It’s… been a while since I really talked about it.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Hughston. That's very helpful. Operating heavy machinery, especially in a loud and dusty environment, gives me a good starting point. And you mentioned doing it for a long time. Could you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… hmm. It’s… over twenty years, I think? Maybe closer to twenty-five? It feels like forever, honestly. Started right after… well, after things settled down. My husband… he used to help me with the bookkeeping. But that was a long time ago. Everything sort of… blends together after a while, you know? I just know I’ve been at it a long, long time. Does that make sense? I'm terrible with dates.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Hughston. Twenty to twenty-five years is a significant amount of time. And it's perfectly understandable that dates can become blurred. Given the nature of your work and the duration, I'd like to ask a few more questions to get a comprehensive picture of your health. We’ll start with your current symptoms, if any. Are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or fatigue lately?
PATIENT: Oh, symptoms… hmm. Well, my back aches a bit sometimes. It's just… old age, I guess. And… I get tired easily. But that could be anything, really. I don't sleep as well as I used to. Mostly just… a general feeling of being worn out. Nothing major, you know? Just… things aren't as easy as they used to be. Does that count? I haven't been to the doctor in… well, a long time. So I'm not really sure what's "normal" anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Ms. Hughston. Back pain and fatigue are certainly things we should investigate, especially given your occupation. And it's perfectly fine that you haven’t been to the doctor regularly – we can work together to get you back on track. To get a better understanding, could you describe the back pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Well, it’s mostly… lower back. Sort of a dull ache, most of the time. But it flares up after a long day on the machine. Like… a really heavy ache, then. It doesn't shoot down my leg or anything. Just… a solid ache. And it gets better if I lie down. I try to stretch a bit, but… it doesn't always help. It's just… something I live with, really. Been that way for… years, I guess. It's not… unbearable, but it's there. Always there.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain that's dull and worsens after a long day, relieved somewhat by lying down. That gives me a better picture. Now, you mentioned fatigue. Is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. It’s worse at the end of the day, of course. But some days are better than others. Like, if I don’t sleep well, it’s just… awful. Really dragging. But on a good night, I can usually get through the day. It’s… hard to explain. It's not like I’m falling asleep standing up or anything. Just… everything feels heavier. Like I'm pushing through mud. And… I get a little forgetful sometimes. But I always have been, haven't I? Maybe that’s just… me. Is that what you mean by fatigue? I’m not really sure what I’m supposed to be feeling.
DOCTOR: You're explaining it perfectly, Ms. Hughston. That description – everything feeling heavier, more effort required, especially after poor sleep – is very helpful. And yes, fatigue can manifest in many different ways. The forgetfulness is also something we'll note. Now, I’d like to ask about other areas of your health. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, appetite… hmm. Not really. I eat when I'm hungry, I guess. Not a huge eater, never have been. Maybe a little less hungry lately, but I just figured that was from being tired. Weight… I haven’t weighed myself in… goodness, I don't even remember. Probably a bit less, maybe? But nothing drastic. I just wear the same clothes, you know? And they still fit. I don’t pay much attention to that sort of thing. I'm more concerned with getting the job done. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking for. It’s just… life, you know? Everything sort of blurs together.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like your appetite and weight haven't changed significantly. We’ll note that. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, the doctor… years ago, he said my blood pressure was a little high. But he gave me some pills, and I took them for a while. I… don't really remember if I finished them or not. And… I had a little trouble with my heart a long time ago, but it cleared up. Nothing major, though. Just… a little flutter now and then. And… I think I had a touch of arthritis in my hands, but it's not bothering me much these days. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit fuzzy. I don't really keep track of those things. My husband used to handle all the medical stuff. He was very organized. It’s just been me for… well, a long time. I mostly just try to keep moving. Does that make sense? I’m sure I’m forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Hughston. And it’s alright that things are fuzzy – we’ll work through it together. So, we have a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, some previous heart palpitations that resolved, and a little arthritis in your hands. We will note all of that. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I remember that. And... when I broke my arm when I was little. Just a simple break. Nothing serious. And... I was in the hospital for a few days after I gave birth, of course. But that was a long, long time ago. No other surgeries that I can recall, and no other hospital stays. Honestly, I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. I mostly just try to avoid doctors if I can, you know? It's never good news when you go to the doctor. That's what my husband always said. It’s been a long time, though. Maybe I’m forgetting something. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, a broken arm, and hospitalization for childbirth. That’s helpful to know. Now, thinking about your family, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had heart trouble, I think. She passed away when I was young. And… my father, he had diabetes, I believe. He lost a leg to it. And… my sister, she had cancer, a long time ago. But she’s alright now, thank goodness. But yes, there's a lot of… trouble in my family, you know? It's never good news, with my family. And my husband's side… I don’t really remember, honestly. We didn’t talk about those things much. It was always just… sad news, you know? It’s a long time ago, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I'm probably forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Hughston. That gives me a good starting point—a family history of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. We’ll note all of that. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband smoked for a while, but I always hated it. He quit, thankfully, years ago. No, I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Just… old age catching up with me, I guess. I try to eat right and keep moving, you know? That’s what my husband always said—keep moving. It's good for you. But yes, I’ve never smoked. And I don't drink much, either. Just a glass of wine now and then. Nothing serious. Does that make sense? I’m sure I’m forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Hughston. No smoking or excessive alcohol use. Now, I'd like to ask about any allergies you may have—to medications, foods, or anything else.
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I haven’t really had any problems with allergies. Maybe a little itchy skin now and then, but nothing serious. I haven't had any reactions to any medications that I can recall. And… no food allergies. I eat pretty much everything. I haven't really had any problems with that either. Honestly, I’m pretty lucky, all things considered. Just… old age catching up with me, I guess. I haven’t really paid much attention to those things, you know? My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s been a long time, though. I’m sure I’m forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hughston, that's a lot of helpful information. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that’s fine. I haven’t had a physical in… well, a very long time. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… don’t be too rough, alright? I’m not as young as I used to be. And… I’m a little ticklish, just warning you. It's been a long time, though. I’m sure I’m forgetting something important. Just… do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hughston. I will be as gentle as possible. And I'll be mindful of the ticklishness. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 148/88, and your pulse is 72. That’s a little elevated. We’ll want to monitor that. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. We'll listen again later. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your reflexes are slightly diminished. I notice some mild swelling in your hands and feet. I’ve noted some mild swelling in your hands and feet, slightly diminished reflexes, a slight heart murmur, and your blood pressure is a bit elevated. This, combined with what you've told me about your fatigue and back pain, suggests we should order some blood work to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. A murmur? Swelling? I’m not surprised, honestly. I haven’t been feeling very well lately. Blood work… alright. Yes, do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… don’t tell me anything too scary, alright? I’m a little nervous already. It's been a long time, though. I'm sure I’m forgetting something important. And… is this going to be expensive? I’m on Medicare, you know. Just… let me know what I need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hughston. We'll take things one step at a time, and I'll explain everything clearly. The blood work will help us rule out a number of possibilities and get a better understanding of what’s going on. It's standard procedure, and we’ll discuss the results together. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover most of the blood work. Our billing department will verify your coverage and let you know of any potential out-of-pocket expenses. I'll have them reach out to you after the appointment. I'm ordering a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate test to check for inflammation. We'll also do a urinalysis. I'll need a urine sample, and then we’ll draw some blood. The lab is just down the hall. Once the results are back—usually within a few days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that sounds… alright. Urine sample and blood work… just down the hall, you say? I think I can manage that. Just… tell me where to go, alright? I'm a little shaky on my feet. And… how much blood are you going to take? I don't like needles. And… what does all that mean? CBC, CMP, TSH, ESR… it's all a bit much. Just… tell me where to go, and I'll try not to faint. It’s been a long time, though. I'm sure I’m forgetting something important. And… will I need to fast beforehand? Just… tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hughston. Let me walk you down to the lab. It's just around the corner, and the phlebotomist there is very skilled. She'll make you as comfortable as possible. As for the blood draw, it's a standard amount—a few vials. The phlebotomist will let you know exactly how much they need. And you're right to ask about the tests. The CBC checks your red and white blood cell counts, which can indicate infection or anemia. The CMP checks your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolytes. The TSH test checks your thyroid function, which can affect your energy levels. And the ESR test checks for inflammation in your body. Don’t worry about memorizing all of that. I’ll explain the results in plain language when they’re back. And yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We can reschedule the appointment if that’s a problem. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Twelve hours… no food… except for water. I think I can manage that. It's just… I usually get hungry around lunchtime. And… I get a little grumpy when I’m hungry. But yes, I can fast. It's just… a long time. I'm sure I'm forgetting something important. Is there anything else I need to do? And… will it hurt? I don’t like needles, you know. Just… tell me everything one more time, alright? I’m a little… frazzled. It’s been a long day. And… will I get a call when the results are back? Just… tell me everything one more time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hughston. It's perfectly alright to feel frazzled. Let's go over everything one more time, slowly. We’ve decided to do some blood work to get a better understanding of your fatigue, back pain, and other symptoms. The blood work includes four tests: a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate test. You will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw—that means no food, but you can drink water. It’s best to schedule the blood draw first thing in the morning. The phlebotomist will draw a few vials of blood. It’s a quick procedure, and she'll be very gentle. You may feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. After the blood draw, the results will typically be back in a few days. Our office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I'll explain everything in plain language, and we'll make a plan based on the results. Is that clearer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That… that’s much clearer. Twelve hours, no food, water okay. Blood draw… a pinch. Results in a few days… a phone call. You'll explain everything. Yes. That’s much better. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very patient. I get… flustered easily. It’s just… a lot. It’s been a long time, though. I’m sure I’m forgetting something important. But yes. That’s much better. I think I can manage that. Just… where do I go now? And… will I need to fill out any more paperwork? Just… tell me what I need to do. One last time. And… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. It's just... things haven’t been easy lately.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It's my job to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. Just go to the reception desk over there. They will likely have you sign a consent form for the blood draw and update your insurance information. They will then direct you to the lab. No other paperwork is required. The phlebotomist will handle everything from there. Just take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask if you need anything at all. I'll see you in a few days. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I think that’s everything. Just… the reception desk. Sign a form. Update my insurance. And… the phlebotomist will handle everything else. Yes. That’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I… appreciate your patience. It’s just… a lot to take in. No, I think I’m alright. I can manage. Just… thank you. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hughston. Take care, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
