DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Shteynberg, let's get down to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have time for a lot of fuss. I want to… well, I want to have a baby. And I want to make sure it happens without any… problems. I’m not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, time is a factor for many patients. So, you’re seeking preconception counseling to optimize your chances of a successful pregnancy. Understandable. Let’s start with some basics. Have you been trying for a specific amount of time, or is this more… exploratory?
PATIENT: Exploratory is a… polite way to put it. I just got divorced, finally. And I’m… considering it. I don’t want to waste my time, or frankly, a doctor’s time, if it’s going to be a struggle. I haven’t started trying, if that answers your question. I want to know if there’s anything I need to… prepare before I even bother.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no current pregnancy attempts. We'll call this planning, then. Very efficient. A divorce can certainly be… disruptive to these things. Alright. To get a good baseline, let’s go through some history. First, have you had any children previously?
PATIENT: No. Never. And frankly, that’s why I’m here. I don’t want to find out later there's something… wrong. It's quite simple, really. I'm 51, not 25. Things aren’t as… automatic as they used to be, I imagine.
DOCTOR: “Automatic” is… an interesting way to put it. And you're right to be proactive, especially considering your age. We will certainly run some tests. Let’s start with your medical history. Any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Nothing major. Usual things. I had the flu a couple of times. A bad knee when I was younger, but that's been operated on. I’m on Medicare now, so they probably have everything down somewhere. I don’t spend my life listing ailments to doctors, if you understand. It’s rather… vulgar, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Medicare records are… comprehensive, yes. It takes a bit to sift through. I see a history of osteoarthritis in the left knee, surgery in 2018. Anything else?
PATIENT: That’s it. Really. I’ve always been fairly healthy, for a Hungarian woman, anyway. We’re not exactly known for our delicate constitutions. I eat… reasonably. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink. I fix bicycles all day, so I’m not exactly sedentary. That should count for something. Are we getting anywhere, or are you just compiling a list of everything I don't do wrong?
DOCTOR: It's not about what you don't do wrong, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s about assessing potential factors. Bicycling is good – it’s active. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Just… ibuprofen sometimes. For my knee, when it flares up. That's it. Absolutely nothing else. I don't believe in filling my body with chemicals unless absolutely necessary. And I certainly haven't been taking anything… special if that's what you're implying. I’m a practical woman, not a fool.
DOCTOR: I wasn’t implying anything, Ms. Shteynberg. Ibuprofen, noted. Alright. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. I eat everything. I've lived in a few countries, you learn to be adaptable. No allergies, no sensitivities, nothing. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m back in school, filling out forms. Is this process going to take all day?
DOCTOR: It won't take all day, Ms. Shteynberg. But a thorough assessment is important. Especially given your age. We need to evaluate your ovarian reserve, hormone levels, and overall health. Before we get to blood work, let's briefly discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any history of infertility?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. A disaster, frankly. My mother had… heart trouble. My grandmother, diabetes. My aunt, some kind of… cancer, I think. It was a long time ago, and we weren't close. It's all very… vague. Look, my family isn't exactly known for longevity, okay? I'm being proactive because of that. Do you need a complete genealogical chart, or will "bad genes" suffice?
DOCTOR: “Bad genes” is… not a medical diagnosis, Ms. Shteynberg. But it gives us something to work with. Alright. We’ll proceed with some blood work to assess your hormone levels and ovarian reserve. We may also want to do a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate your uterus and ovaries. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable? It’s hardly a picnic, is it? But yes. Do it. I want to know what I'm dealing with. Just… please don't keep me waiting all day for the results. My time is valuable. And I'd appreciate it if you could explain everything in plain English, not… medical jargon. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all. We’ll expedite the lab work as much as possible, and I assure you, I’ll explain everything in clear, understandable terms. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood now, and then we can schedule the ultrasound. After we have the results, we can discuss a plan, if necessary. Does that sound… agreeable?
PATIENT: Agreeable. Finally. Let's get this over with. I have bicycles to fix, you know. And… other things. Just send someone in. The sooner I have answers, the better. Don't make me wait weeks for a phone call. It's quite simple, really. Efficiency. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. We will contact you as soon as the results are available. .
