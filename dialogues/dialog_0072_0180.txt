DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. My name is Dr. Hembrey. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time. Just… tired. Really, really tired. And… I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but… I just… have to sometimes. It’s stupid, I know. Don't even ask. It just feels… right, I guess? Is that enough? Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: “Right.” While I appreciate your…directness, Ms. Cantoran, I do require a bit more information to properly assess your condition. You say you’re tired. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What do you mean elaborate? I'm tired! Like, all the time. Even after sleeping. It's…heavy. Like my bones are full of lead or something. It’s been getting worse for…a while now, I guess. Months? I don't really keep track of that stuff. Just…worse. And then… the dirt. It started around the same time, maybe. Look, I just want to know if I'm dying or something, okay?
DOCTOR: “Dying is…unlikely, Ms. Cantoran, though we certainly need to investigate. ‘Heavy’ tiredness, as you describe it, can have numerous causes. And the…geophagy, as we call the compulsion to eat earth, is…uncommon. It's often associated with mineral deficiencies, though not always. Let's start with some basics. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the fatigue?
PATIENT: Ge-what-now? Look, I told you, I don’t do fancy words. Just…everything feels slow. Like I’m walking through mud. And my stomach…it hurts sometimes. Not bad bad, just…off. And I get…cold. Even when it’s warm. And I…I don’t really eat much else anymore. Except, well, you know. The dirt. Is that enough details for you?
DOCTOR: “Yes, Ms. Cantoran, that is…more informative. ‘Slow,’ you say. Can you describe that sensation further?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s like…everything takes effort. Thinking, moving, even talking. It's… draining. Like my battery is always on low. And I get… confused sometimes. Forget things. Just… little things, mostly. Like what I had for breakfast. Or why I walked into a room. It’s annoying, honestly. My head feels…fuzzy. Is that what you want to know? Because I’m telling you, this is miserable.
DOCTOR: “Alright, Ms. Cantoran. This is concerning. We need to rule out several possibilities. Let’s start with a thorough physical exam. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and examine your abdomen. It’s possible this could indicate an underlying anemia, thyroid issue, or even a neurological concern. Do I have your permission to proceed with the examination?
PATIENT: Look, poke and prod if you have to. Just don't take too long. I have things to do. And… please don’t ask me about what kind of dirt I eat. That's just… embarrassing. It's not like I choose this, you know? It just…happens.
DOCTOR: “Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. I will begin with your vital signs, and then proceed with auscultation of your heart and lungs. Please try to relax, Ms. Cantoran, and let me know if you experience any discomfort.” “Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 138/85. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit.” “Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally.”
PATIENT: Diminished? What does that mean? Look, I don't like this. It sounds…bad. Is something seriously wrong? My…my husband, he always went to the hospital for everything. They always used big words and…and he didn't come home one time. Just…tell me straight, okay? Is this going to kill me?
DOCTOR: “Ms. Cantoran, I understand your anxiety. ‘Diminished’ heart sounds simply mean they are quieter than expected. This can be caused by a variety of factors, none of which automatically indicate a life-threatening condition. However, it does warrant further investigation. I'm concerned about the fatigue, the confusion, and the geophagy. It’s a rather unusual combination of symptoms. We need to run some blood tests to check for anemia, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid function, and other potential causes. I'm also going to order a complete metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood tests…great. Just what I needed. More poking and prodding. Look, I don’t even have insurance. How much is all this going to cost? I can barely afford groceries, let alone…whatever fancy tests you want to do. And…and I don't like needles. At all. Seriously.
DOCTOR: “Ms. Cantoran, I understand your concerns about the cost. We can discuss options for financial assistance after the tests are completed. I will also have my staff explore potential resources available in the community. As for the needles…unfortunately, blood tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. We’ll take it slowly and make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. I'll order the tests now. It's a standard panel, nothing too extensive. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan of action. In the meantime, please refrain from consuming any dirt for at least 24 hours before your follow-up, if possible. It can interfere with the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. No dirt. But it's not like I can promise anything. It…it just happens sometimes. And 24 hours is a long time. Look, when will I get these results? I don't want to be waiting around for weeks. I have things to do, remember? And…and can I get a copy of these results? For myself, I mean.
DOCTOR: “The results typically take between 3-5 business days to return. My staff will contact you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. And yes, you are entitled to a copy of your lab results. We can provide them to you electronically or in paper format, whichever you prefer. Before you leave, I want to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Chronic? Ugh. My husband…he had everything. Diabetes, heart problems, the works. I mostly just took care of him. Me? I don't really…get sick. Except this tiredness. And…the dirt thing. I had a bad flu once, a long time ago. But that's about it. I don't really go to doctors. Never have. Honestly.
DOCTOR: “Very well. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…hmm. Let me think. No, I don't think so. Not me. My mother had her gallbladder out, a long, long time ago. And my husband…he had a hip replacement, and something with his heart. But me? No. Never. Nothing.
DOCTOR: “Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family… that's… complicated. My mother…she died young. Something with her stomach, I think. My father…he just…disappeared when I was a kid. Never knew him. And my husband…his family was huge. Lots of heart problems on his side. Everyone smoked, too. That’s about all I remember. Honestly, I didn’t really keep track. We didn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: “Understood. Now, a few questions about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, I’m not a… a wild woman, okay? No smoking. My husband smoked, like a chimney, but I hated it. A little wine sometimes, with dinner. Just a glass, maybe. And definitely no… other stuff. I have standards. I just want to feel better, not… whatever you’re thinking. Honestly.
DOCTOR: “Alright. And finally, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies? No. Not that I know of. I mean, I get itchy sometimes, when I'm around cats, but that’s just… cats. My husband was allergic to penicillin, but not me. Honestly, I don’t really pay attention to that stuff. I just take whatever the doctor gives me, if I have to. I just want this interview to be over.
DOCTOR: “Very well, Ms. Cantoran. I believe that concludes the initial consultation. As I mentioned, we will run the necessary blood tests, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. In the meantime, please try to rest and avoid consuming dirt, if possible. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe confusion, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. None. Just…get the tests done. Quickly. And please, don't make me come back if it's nothing. I really don't have the time for this. Stop.
DOCTOR: “Very well, Ms. Cantoran. My staff will assist you with scheduling the blood tests. Have a good day.” .
