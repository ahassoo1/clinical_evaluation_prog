DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been… off balance, I suppose. Just feeling unsteady on my feet. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it's… concerning. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling unsteady can be quite unsettling. It’s helpful that you’ve come in to get it checked out. Let's try to pinpoint what might be causing this. You mentioned it’s been happening for a “little while.” Could you give me a more precise timeframe, if possible?
PATIENT: That’s the frustrating part, Doctor. A “little while”… perhaps a few months? Maybe longer? It’s all a bit… fuzzy. I work quite a bit, out on the rigs, and things get… hectic. I suppose I haven't really focused on when it started, just that it has. It’s not constant, not every moment, but often enough to worry me. I truly don’t recall a specific date or event that marks the beginning.
DOCTOR: I see. Working on the rigs certainly can be demanding, and it’s easy for things to slip your mind when you’re focused on the job. Alright, let's focus on the present then. Could you describe what this unsteadiness feels like?
PATIENT: It's… hard to describe. It’s not like I’m going to fall over immediately, usually. More like… walking on a boat, perhaps? A gentle sway, even when I’m standing still. Sometimes it’s worse than others. And occasionally, I feel… a little dizzy, but not a spinning dizziness, just… lightheaded. It's unsettling, and makes me feel… vulnerable, I suppose. Especially with the work I do; I need to be steady.
DOCTOR: That’s a helpful description – the sensation of being on a boat is quite telling. And you’re right to be concerned, given the nature of your work. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… worse… I believe it's more noticeable after a long shift, when I’m tired, naturally. And… when it’s very hot, I feel it more. The sun… it affects me, I think. Better… honestly, I haven't really noticed anything that makes it significantly better. Just resting, I suppose. But that’s not always possible. I drink plenty of water, I try to eat well, but it doesn’t seem to make a large difference. It's… subtle, but persistent.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. I’ve been… a little more forgetful than usual, perhaps? Though, as you know, my work is stressful, so that could just be that. And… sometimes I feel a bit… off, like I’m not quite present. Difficult to explain. Not a headache, not a fever… just… distant. I don’t think I’ve fallen or bumped into things more often, thankfully, but I feel less coordinated, if that makes sense. I’m not sure if those things are connected, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful information. The forgetfulness and feeling of being “distant” are worth noting. Now, let's move on to some more general questions to get a fuller picture. Do you have any medical conditions that you are currently being treated for?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't have any medical conditions, not that I'm aware of. I have private insurance, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups, and everything has always been… normal. I take a multivitamin, but that’s all. I… lost my husband a few years ago, and I think the stress since then has taken a toll, but no specific diagnoses. Nothing chronic, at least.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. Grief can certainly have a significant impact on health. And it’s good to hear you are proactive with regular check-ups. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. No, not that I recall. I broke my arm as a child, a simple fracture, and they set it in a cast, but that was decades ago. No major surgeries, no. Nothing that would… affect this, I wouldn’t think. I’ve had the usual things, vaccinations, wisdom teeth removed, but nothing significant.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather on my father’s side… he had some issues with his balance when he was older, but I don't know the specifics. He lived in Ethiopia, and medical records weren’t… readily available. No history of stroke or… neurological conditions, as far as I know. It’s difficult to say, really. My family isn’t… very forthcoming with medical details. It’s not something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s not uncommon. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well, as I mentioned, I'm widowed. My husband and I… we didn’t have children. I live alone now. I work long hours out on the rigs, so I don't have much time for… socializing. I have a few acquaintances from work, but I wouldn't call them close friends. I don't drink alcohol, and I don't smoke. I try to stay active when I can, but it's difficult with the demands of my job. It’s… a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I eat most foods without issue. No environmental allergies, like pollen or dust. I’ve always been… fairly resilient, in that regard. Perhaps too resilient, until recently. I truly can’t think of anything I’m allergic to.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Snerling. That’s a very thorough history. Now, if you’ll permit me, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. We’ll start with your vital signs and then assess your balance and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement. I just… I'd like to get to the bottom of this. It’s unsettling to feel so… off balance, especially with the nature of my work.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat, we’ll begin with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let’s assess your balance. Could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright. Oh. It’s… difficult to stand still like this. I feel… unsteady. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Snerling. It is not uncommon to feel some sway when closing your eyes. I see some mild unsteadiness, and you are compensating by widening your stance. Now, let’s try a Romberg test. Could you please stand with your feet together, close your eyes, and extend your arms straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: This is… even more difficult. Oh dear. I… I don’t think I can hold this for very long. It feels like I’m going to fall.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling, that’s quite alright. No need to push yourself. I noticed significant unsteadiness with the Romberg test, and a tendency to lose balance quickly. You also reported some mild trembling. Now, let’s check your coordination. Could you please touch your finger to my finger?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That was… unnerving. Here. Oh. That was… not very precise. I apologize. It feels like my hand isn’t quite under my control. I’m usually much steadier than this.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Snerling. It’s important to understand what we’re observing. I see some tremor in your hand and a slight difficulty with smooth coordination. Now, let's assess your reflexes. I'm going to lightly tap your knees with this small hammer. Please keep your legs relaxed. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. No clonus is present.
PATIENT: Alright. Hmm. That… felt normal, I think. It didn't cause any discomfort. So, what does all this mean, Doctor? Is something seriously wrong? I’m starting to worry. I need to be steady for my work, and this… this is concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling. Based on the examination, we have some findings that require further investigation. You exhibit some unsteadiness, a mild tremor in your hands, and some difficulty with coordination. Your reflexes are normal, which is reassuring. Given your symptoms and the findings on the examination, I suspect several possibilities. It could be related to inner ear issues, which can cause balance problems. It could also be a sign of mild neurological involvement, although that’s less likely given your normal reflexes. Stress and fatigue can certainly contribute to these symptoms as well. However, to get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Finally, I would like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: MRI… and a neurologist? That sounds… serious. If that's what's necessary to find out what's going on, then yes, that’s acceptable. I want to know what’s causing this, and I trust your judgement. Blood tests, MRI, neurologist… It's a lot to process. How long will it take to get the results of the tests? And… what if it is something serious? What are the possible treatments?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Snerling. It is a lot to process, and I want to assure you that we are taking a systematic approach to investigate this. The blood tests should take approximately 2-3 business days to come back. The MRI will take a little longer, potentially 5-7 business days, as it requires interpretation by a radiologist. As for possible treatments, it depends entirely on the diagnosis. If it’s related to inner ear issues, there are medications and exercises that can help. If it’s a neurological issue, we may consider other treatment options depending on the specific cause. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. It’s also important to stay hydrated and eat a healthy diet. I will schedule the blood tests for you today, and we will get the MRI scheduled as soon as possible. I will also prepare a referral to a neurologist. Once we have the results, we will discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: A few, Doctor. Will the MRI require any… contrast dye? I’ve heard some people have reactions to those. And… will I be able to drive myself home after the tests? I don’t have anyone who can take me, unfortunately. And… what if it is something serious? What kind of timeline are we looking at for treatment, if it comes to that? I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, Doctor, but it’s… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Snerling, and I'm glad you asked them. Yes, the MRI will likely require a contrast dye to get a clearer image. The risk of an allergic reaction is low, but we will ask you about any allergies you have before the procedure and have emergency medication on hand just in case. They will also monitor you closely during the scan. Regarding driving, I recommend not driving yourself home after the MRI, especially if they administer contrast dye. It's best to have someone accompany you or take a taxi or ride-sharing service. We can discuss arranging transportation if needed. As for the timeline for treatment, it depends entirely on the diagnosis. If it’s a relatively simple issue, we may be able to start treatment within a few days. If it’s more complex, it may take longer to develop a plan. We will discuss all options with you in detail once we have the results. To put your mind at ease, I would like to order some additional blood tests to rule out any vitamin deficiencies that can sometimes cause similar symptoms. It's a simple step, and it may provide some answers. I will also give you a written summary of our conversation today, including the list of tests we are ordering and the referral to the neurologist. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. Thank you. I truly appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so thoroughly. It’s… reassuring to know that you’re taking this seriously and that we’re taking a systematic approach. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the results of the tests. And try to rest, as you suggested. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Snerling. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. My nurse will schedule the blood tests and MRI for you before you leave. And remember, rest is important. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
