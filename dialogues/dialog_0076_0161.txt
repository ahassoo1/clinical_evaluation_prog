DOCTOR: Right. Helaina Trefren, 55. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, to be honest, I saw a flyer at the community center about… something to help prevent HIV. I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask about it. I don't really understand all the details, though. It was PrEP, I think they called it?
DOCTOR: PrEP… yes. Pre-exposure prophylaxis. Look, it’s… a lot of fuss for something that’s really quite uncommon in people your age, honestly. But alright. Tell me, are you… at risk?
PATIENT: At risk… that sounds…serious. I’ve never been married, and I haven’t been with anyone regularly in… a long time. But, you know, sometimes you meet someone. And I want to be careful. Is that what you mean? I just want to protect myself, if that makes sense. It's better to be safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: “Sometimes you meet someone.” Right. Well, casual encounters are… how shall we say, not the most sensible way to go about things. But alright. Have you had any recent encounters?
PATIENT: Recent… not exactly. A few months ago, maybe? It was just one time. And honestly, it wasn't… planned. I wouldn't call it a relationship. It was just… something that happened. I didn't even really think about needing anything, to be honest, until I saw that flyer. Does that matter? Is one time enough to worry about?
DOCTOR: One time… Honestly, people worry about everything these days. Still. We have to document things, I suppose. Any condom use?
PATIENT: No. No, we didn’t. It… happened quickly. It wasn’t like we were… prepared, if that makes sense. I feel awful even talking about this. I just want to know if I need to worry, and what this PrEP thing involves. Is it a lot of pills? I already take medicine for my blood pressure, and I forget things sometimes, so…
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, right. Adds another layer of complication. Look, PrEP is a daily pill. A daily pill. If you can’t reliably remember your blood pressure medication, I doubt you’ll manage this. We can run some tests, of course. Basic HIV screening, STI panel… but frankly, it sounds like you’re just creating unnecessary worry. Still. Let’s get it over with. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, that doesn't sound easy. I do try to remember my blood pressure pills, it's just… sometimes life gets in the way, you know? And I don't want to be a bother. As for allergies… hmm. I think I’m allergic to penicillin, but that was a long time ago. And maybe some kinds of pollen, but nothing serious. Just a sniffle. Is there anything else I can do besides a pill every day? Like, a shot or something? I’m really not good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: A shot?
PATIENT: Yes, like… an injection. I read something online about a shot you get every couple of months. It sounded a lot easier than a pill every single day. I know I'm probably being difficult, but I'm just trying to figure out what's best for me, and what I can actually do. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I don’t want to mess it up and end up unprotected. Is that shot even available?
DOCTOR: Look, there is a long-acting injectable, yes. Cabenuva. But it requires two initial injections, and then follow-up appointments every month. And it has… side effects. More serious than a little pill, frankly. Plus, you need to be on it for a while before it's effective. It's not a simple solution. Honestly, if you’re this concerned about remembering a daily pill, perhaps you shouldn’t be… engaging in activities that require this level of precaution. But fine. Let’s proceed with the initial bloodwork. I'll have the nurse draw some samples. We'll check for existing infection, assess your kidney function… standard things.
PATIENT: Kidney function? What does that have to do with anything? I just… I don't want to be a burden. I just saw the flyer and thought it would be a good idea to be safe. And now it sounds like it’s going to be a whole ordeal. I guess… I guess if you think the bloodwork is necessary, I’ll do it. But please, just explain everything clearly, okay? I don't want any surprises. And if it turns out it’s too complicated, or I can’t handle it… can I just stop?
DOCTOR: Of course you can stop. But we need to rule out any existing conditions before we start any medication. Kidney function is important because these medications are processed by the kidneys. And frankly, if your kidneys aren't functioning properly, you shouldn’t be on anything. The nurse will explain the blood draw process. It's standard. Don't worry about it. Let's just get this over with. Nurse, can you take Helaina Trefren for bloodwork?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. That sounds… good. I appreciate you explaining things, even if it’s a lot. I just… I just want to be healthy and safe. Hopefully, the bloodwork won’t take too long. Is there anything else I need to do right now?
DOCTOR: No. Just… try to relax. And perhaps reconsider your lifestyle choices. It sounds like you’re creating unnecessary complications for yourself. The nurse will guide you to the lab. Patient expresses concerns regarding adherence to medication regimen. Discussed potential lifestyle modifications. .
