DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, it's about my grandson. He’s hoping to come visit from overseas, and I believe he needs some shots to be allowed into the country. I want to make sure everything is done properly, you see. I’m Karry Skarbek, by the way.
DOCTOR: It's a pleasure to meet you too, Karry. That’s very thoughtful of you to get everything sorted out for your grandson’s visit. It’s good to be prepared. So, to clarify, you’re bringing your grandson in today to discuss required vaccinations for international travel?
PATIENT: No, no, I’m not bringing him in today. He’s still over there. I’m here for myself. I need to know what I need to get done, so he can visit. I’m a bit older, you see, and I want to be sure I’m healthy enough to travel too, if needed. And what shots do I need to show to get him here? Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Karry. My apologies for the misunderstanding. You're wanting to ensure you are up-to-date on vaccinations, both for your own health and to facilitate your grandson’s visit. Let’s focus on getting you prepared. To start, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fully. Before that… honestly, it’s been mostly just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older. I don’t have any regular illnesses, like diabetes or heart trouble. Oh, and I lost my wife a few years ago, and it’s been a bit lonely since then, but that’s not a medical thing, I suppose. Does that give you a start? I'm afraid I don't remember much beyond that.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Karry. I'm sorry to hear about your wife. It’s perfectly normal to feel the effects of such a loss. And it’s good to hear you've generally been healthy. Pneumonia a few years ago is good to know. Do you recall approximately when that occurred – the year, even a rough estimate would be fine?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was after my wife passed, so… hmm. It must have been about three years ago, maybe a little more. It was winter, I remember being very sick during the holidays. I had to stay in bed for nearly a week. It was a bad one, but the doctor at the time said I recovered well. I don't recall the exact month, I’m afraid. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Karry. Three years ago is helpful. And it’s good to know you had a full recovery. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Never had a surgery in my life. I've been lucky, I suppose. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years, nothing that required a hospital stay or anything like that. I always tried to stay active, and I think that helped. Though these old bones are starting to protest a bit these days, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Karry. Avoiding surgery is a good thing. Staying active is certainly beneficial. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe, but she lived a long life. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart later in life, but again, he lived to be quite old. On my wife’s side, her brother had some issues with his lungs, but that's all I can really recall. Nothing too serious that I know of, though my family wasn’t one for talking much about health problems. Does that help at all? It's hard to remember back that far.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Karry. High blood pressure and heart trouble are good to know, and lung issues as well. We'll keep those in mind. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t had any trouble with medications in the past. I don’t take any regular pills, thankfully. Just an occasional pain reliever for my arthritis, but nothing strong. I'm pretty fortunate that way.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Karry. No known allergies is very good. And you mentioned arthritis pain. What medication do you use for that, when you take it?
PATIENT: Oh, just over-the-counter stuff, Doctor. Ibuprofen, mostly. Sometimes acetaminophen. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. Just whatever you can get at the drugstore. It helps take the edge off, but it doesn’t completely get rid of the pain, if I’m honest. It’s just part of getting older, I suppose. A little bit of discomfort. I don’t mind too much, as long as I can still get around.
DOCTOR: Okay, over-the-counter ibuprofen and acetaminophen for arthritis. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My wife didn't care for smoking, and I didn't want to upset her. And honestly, I never had the desire to start. I always thought it was a bad habit. I’ve always tried to take care of my health, as best I could. I preferred being outdoors, enjoying the fresh air, rather than being stuck inside with smoke.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Karry. Never smoking is excellent. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, occasionally. I might have a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but nothing regularly. And not very much, just a small glass. Mostly on special occasions, or if I’m feeling particularly celebratory. It’s not a habit, and I don’t need it to enjoy myself. I don't go out to bars or anything like that. Just a quiet glass of wine at home sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional small glass of wine. And do you have any significant travel plans coming up, aside from your grandson’s visit?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing planned. Just hoping my grandson can come visit. That’s my main focus right now. I haven’t traveled much in recent years, to be honest. My wife and I used to travel a bit when we were younger, but after she passed, I haven’t really had the desire to go anywhere. It’s mostly just staying close to home these days. I’m looking forward to potentially traveling to see my grandson, though. That would be a nice trip.
DOCTOR: Alright, Karry. That gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks good. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I want to be sure I’m healthy enough for this visit, and for traveling, if needed. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142 over 88. We can monitor that. Your pulse, temperature, and breathing are all within normal limits. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but I do hear some mild wheezing. Do you experience shortness of breath or cough frequently?
PATIENT: Wheezing, you say? Oh, my goodness. Well, I do get a bit of a cough sometimes, especially during the winter months. It’s usually just a little tickle in my throat, nothing too serious. And I do get a bit winded if I walk uphill, but I just figured that was because of my age. I haven't really thought much of it. My wife used to say I had “old man lungs,” bless her heart. But it’s never been bad enough to warrant a doctor’s visit, I didn’t think. Is that something to be concerned about? I’m starting to worry now.
DOCTOR: It's good you're letting me know, Karry. The mild wheezing, combined with your history of winter cough and occasional shortness of breath, suggests there might be some underlying mild asthma or COPD. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it's something we should investigate further. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your extremities have good pulses and no swelling. Your reflexes are normal. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test, which measures how well your lungs are working. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray and a lung test? Oh, my goodness. That sounds…serious. I’ve never had either of those done before. Are you saying something is really wrong with my lungs? I just thought it was old age! I suppose if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. But I must admit, I’m a bit nervous now. Will it be painful? And what will it cost? I’m on a fixed income, you see. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Karry. It's completely normal to feel anxious when facing unfamiliar tests. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong; it’s simply a precaution to get a better understanding of your lung function, given your symptoms and what I heard during the exam. The chest X-ray is painless—it's just a quick image of your lungs. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a mouthpiece – it takes about 15-20 minutes. It might feel a little tiring, but it's not painful. Regarding cost, I’ll have my staff check with your insurance company to get an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses before proceeding. We can discuss that before scheduling anything. We want to make sure you’re comfortable with the financial aspect of things. In the meantime, let’s focus on getting the information we need to ensure your health.
PATIENT: That… that does make me feel a little better, Doctor. Knowing the cost beforehand is very important. And the fact that it’s not painful is a relief. I just don’t like surprises. Okay, then. Yes, let’s go ahead and do the tests. If you think it’s necessary, then I trust your judgment. But please, let me know how much it will cost before you do anything. I don’t want to be caught off guard. And I hope it’s not anything too serious. I’m looking forward to seeing my grandson, and I don’t want anything to get in the way of that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Karry. I completely understand. My staff will contact your insurance company immediately to determine your out-of-pocket costs for both the chest X-ray and the pulmonary function test. We won't schedule anything until you've had a chance to review those estimates and are comfortable proceeding. While we're waiting for the insurance information, let’s discuss vaccinations. To determine what you might need, can you tell me if you've ever received a flu shot?
PATIENT: Oh, the flu shot. Yes, I try to get one every year. My wife always made sure we both did. It’s usually at the pharmacy, just a quick little poke. I think I had one last fall, but honestly, I can’t quite remember. It all blends together after a while, you know? It's just routine, something I do to try and stay healthy. I haven’t missed too many years, if that helps. But I don’t keep a record of it, I’m afraid. Just what the pharmacist tells me.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Karry. Getting a flu shot annually is excellent. Now, aside from the flu shot, have you ever received a pneumococcal vaccine?
PATIENT: Pneumo… what was that now? Pneumo… Oh, goodness. I don't believe so. I don't recall ever getting a shot with that name. My wife handled most of those things, you see. She was very organized. I just went along with whatever she said. I don't remember anything about a pneumococcal vaccine, I'm afraid. Does that help? I’m beginning to think I should have kept better track of these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Karry. Many people don't keep track of all their vaccinations. The pneumococcal vaccine protects against a type of pneumonia, and given your history of pneumonia a few years ago and the mild wheezing I heard today, it would be a good idea to ensure you’re up-to-date on that. It's typically given in two doses. To summarize, we’re going to get the insurance estimates for the chest X-ray and pulmonary function test, and we’ll check your records to see if you’ve had the pneumococcal vaccine. Once we have that information, we can create a plan to ensure you’re fully protected and healthy for your grandson’s visit. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very thorough. And I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. The more information, the better, I always say. Checking on the pneumococcal vaccine is a good idea, and I trust your judgment on everything else. I just want to be sure I’m healthy enough to travel, if needed, and to enjoy my time with my grandson. Alright, then. Let’s do it. Let me know when I need to come back, or if you need any more information from me. I'll be patient. I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Karry. My staff will contact you within 24 hours with the insurance estimates and to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your cough, shortness of breath, or develop a fever, please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. Thank you for coming in today. We’ll get to the bottom of this and make sure you’re ready for your grandson’s visit. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was very nice meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you for your kindness and patience. I feel much better knowing I’m in good hands.
