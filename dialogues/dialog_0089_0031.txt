DOCTOR: Hi Nixon, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrogh. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. And… the nurse mentioned something about my heart not being regular? I’m not entirely sure what that means, but it's been happening before.
DOCTOR: Okay, a swollen left leg and some irregularity with your heart rhythm… I see. Let's start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… about three days ago, I believe. It wasn’t much at first, just a little puffiness around my ankle. But it’s gotten worse each day, now it’s up to my calf, quite noticeable, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, three days ago, starting in the ankle and progressing up to your calf. Is it painful?
PATIENT: Yes, it is a bit painful, Doctor. Not terribly, but it’s a dull ache, especially when I stand for too long. And it feels… heavy, if that makes sense? Like it's difficult to lift.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache and a feeling of heaviness, worse with standing. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no redness. And it doesn’t feel particularly warm to the touch, no. It just feels… swollen and uncomfortable, mostly. It doesn’t feel hot or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no redness or warmth. Have you experienced any injuries to your left leg recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I haven’t had any falls or bumps or twists, not recently anyway. I’m usually quite careful, truth be told. I teach computer science, so I'm mostly at a desk.
DOCTOR: Alright, no injury. And you teach computer science, so mostly desk work. Now, about this irregularity with your heart – has this happened before, as you mentioned?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. A doctor told me, a while back, it was called… atrial fibrillation? I don’t really understand it, but they said my heart sometimes beats too fast and unevenly. I had it checked then, but I don’t know what happened after that, to be honest. It comes and goes, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, atrial fibrillation – that's helpful. Do you remember if they put you on any medication for it, or recommended any specific follow-up?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question, Doctor. I honestly can’t recall. I was quite young then, and my mother handled most of the arrangements. I think they gave me something, a small pill, but I stopped taking it after a while because I felt… fine. I should have paid more attention, shouldn't I? I don’t remember any follow-up appointments, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, you were prescribed something for the atrial fibrillation but stopped taking it, and no follow-up. Do you experience any other symptoms when your heart feels irregular – like shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes I do. When my heart is… off, I get quite tired, very easily. And a bit breathless, even when I’m not doing much. I wouldn’t say chest pain, no, but sometimes a fluttering feeling in my chest, if that makes sense? And occasionally a bit dizzy, though that's not too common.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue, breathlessness, and a fluttering sensation in your chest when your heart is irregular. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your leg for any signs of a blood clot. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please do. I trust your judgement. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest, but I want to know what’s going on. I’ll just sit here, won’t I?
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, your heart rate is a bit fast and irregular, as you described. I can hear some extra beats. Your lungs sound clear. Now, your leg… there is some swelling, and it’s tender to the touch. I'm feeling for a pulse in your foot and ankle… good, present. There is some pitting edema, meaning the swelling leaves a dent when I press on it. It's good that you have a pulse, but the swelling and tenderness are concerning, especially given your history of atrial fibrillation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Concerning, you say? What does that mean, exactly, Doctor? Is it something serious? I must admit, I'm getting quite worried now. Is it the heart causing the leg, or something else entirely?
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, let's not jump to conclusions. "Concerning" just means we need to investigate further to understand what's going on. The leg swelling could be related to your atrial fibrillation, or it could be something else entirely – like a blood clot, for example. It's important to rule out a blood clot, as that needs immediate treatment. Given your symptoms and my examination findings, I want to order a D-dimer blood test to check for signs of a blood clot, and an EKG to get a more detailed look at your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A blood test and… an EKG? Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A blood clot sounds… frightening. Is it very common with this… atrial fibrillation? And will the EKG be painful? I’m not very good with medical things, I’m afraid. I much prefer computers!
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, that’s perfectly understandable. An EKG is a very simple, painless test. We’ll just put some stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. As for blood clots and atrial fibrillation, people with atrial fibrillation are at a higher risk of forming clots, but it doesn't mean you will get one. That's why we're doing the D-dimer test – to check if one is present. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and get you set up for the EKG. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible. In the meantime, let's talk about your medical history a little more. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Yes, actually. When I was a child, I had my tonsils removed. A very long time ago, now. And… I broke my arm when I was about eight years old, so I had a cast on for a few weeks. Nothing else, I don't believe. Oh! And I have a filling in one of my teeth, does that count? It was a very big one, years ago. Not exactly a surgery, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils removed as a child, broken arm, and a large filling. That's helpful. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, not that I remember. I eat everything, and I've taken all sorts of medicines over the years without any problems. My mother always said I was a very hardy child. Unless… bees? I don't particularly like bees. But I wouldn't say I'm allergic, exactly. More just… frightened of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a slight aversion to bees. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I'm not taking anything at all. Not a single pill, cream, or anything like that. I don’t really believe in taking medicines unless absolutely necessary, if I can help it. I try to stay healthy with a good diet and plenty of exercise, although my job does involve a lot of sitting. Perhaps I should get up more often!
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I've never smoked a cigarette in my life, and I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine at Christmas, that's all. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I'm a very sensible person, you see. I need to keep my mind clear for my work! Computer science requires a lot of concentration, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. Finally, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, stroke, blood clots, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather, on my father's side, he had a stroke, many years ago. I don’t think anyone else had anything particularly serious. My father was always very healthy, right up until… well, never mind. He passed away a few years ago. I don’t think there was any history of blood clots or diabetes, no. It's all a bit vague, to be honest, I never paid much attention to those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother and stroke in your grandfather. That’s helpful. Alright Nixon, that gives me a good overview. We're waiting for the results of the D-dimer and the EKG. While we wait, I’m going to recommend a compression stocking for your left leg to help reduce the swelling. The nurse will fit you with one shortly. It’s important to take things seriously, but also not to panic. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I want you to be aware, however, that if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, you should go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. A compression stocking, and to go to the emergency room if I have chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. I’ll remember that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and I feel… a little less worried now. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I’ll be sure to ask the nurse about the compression stocking.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. We’ll get those test results back shortly, and then we can discuss the next steps. The nurse will be in to fit you for the stocking now. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask. I'll be around.
