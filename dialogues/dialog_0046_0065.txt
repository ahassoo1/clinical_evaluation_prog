DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I don’t understand why. It’s quite bothersome, actually. I haven’t changed my eating habits, and I'm usually quite active with my work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Selbitschka. Weight gain can be concerning, and it’s good you’re addressing it. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about how long you’ve been noticing this weight gain?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started, I believe, around… February, perhaps? Yes, February of this year. It’s been steadily increasing since then, maybe five or six pounds a month, give or take. It's difficult to be precise, but it's noticeable in my clothes, certainly. And on the scale, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, so roughly six months of gradual weight gain. And you mentioned you haven’t changed your diet or activity level. Could you describe a typical day for me, in terms of what you eat and how much physical activity you get through your work?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, I work as an orderly at the hospital, so I'm on my feet most of the day – walking, lifting, helping patients. It's quite physical, really. As for food… I usually have a small breakfast – perhaps some toast and coffee. Lunch is usually a sandwich and an apple, something I pack myself. And dinner… my husband cooks, usually a simple meal – meat and potatoes, or soup and bread. I don't snack much between meals. I really haven't altered my routine at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, a fairly active job and a consistent diet. Have you noticed any other changes along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not particularly, no. I haven’t been feeling more tired than usual, though I am always a little weary after a long shift. I suppose my joints ache a bit more, but that’s to be expected with the work I do. I haven't noticed any swelling or… anything unusual, really. It's just the weight. And it's rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant changes in energy levels, no swelling, and just a bit more joint ache, likely related to your work. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits or urination patterns?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, no, not really. Everything is… regular, if you understand what I mean. No changes there at all. I apologize, I'm not quite sure what that has to do with the weight gain, but I assure you, those functions are normal.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Selbitschka. I ask about those things routinely to get a complete picture. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as thyroid problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No chronic conditions at all. My family… my mother had some arthritis in her later years, but that's the extent of it. I've never been diagnosed with anything like thyroid problems or diabetes, no. I’ve had regular check-ups with my family doctor, and everything was always fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine care?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, that’s the only surgery I've ever had. And I’ve only been hospitalized for the birth of my children, and a bout of the flu when I was very young. Nothing significant since then. I pride myself on staying healthy, so I avoid hospitals whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, so tonsillectomy as a child and deliveries – no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications regularly. I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, if needed, but that's it. I try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. No supplements, vitamins, or anything of that nature either. I prefer to get my nutrients from food, when possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything and take most medications without issue. I've never needed an EpiPen or had to rush to the hospital due to an allergic reaction. My husband always jokes that I have an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Selbitschka, that's very helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also palpate your thyroid gland and abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I understand it's necessary, and I want to get to the bottom of this weight gain, so I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I hope you don't mind if I ask questions if something feels… unusual?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Selbitschka, please feel free to ask any questions you have. Alright, if you could please have a seat on the examination table, we'll get started. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your heart rate is 72 beats per minute, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Both your blood pressure and heart rate are within the normal range. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear bilaterally. Your thyroid gland feels normal in size and consistency. There are no nodules or tenderness. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don't feel any masses or organomegaly. The physical exam didn’t reveal any obvious abnormalities. Given your weight gain and normal physical exam, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol levels. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your weight gain. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests seem a logical step. I’d be grateful if you could investigate further. I'd like to understand what's going on, and I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead and order whatever tests you deem necessary. When will I receive the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, a lipid panel, and a hemoglobin A1c to check your average blood sugar over the past three months. The lab typically takes 24 to 48 hours to process the results. I will have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Typically, that means you should expect a call within three business days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your usual diet and activity level. If you notice any new or worsening symptoms, such as excessive fatigue, shortness of breath, or changes in your bowel habits, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Three business days is perfectly acceptable. I will, of course, contact the office if I experience any new symptoms. I appreciate your thoroughness and your time. It’s a relief to finally be taking steps to understand this. Thank you again, Doctor Glowka.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm glad I could help. We’ll get these tests ordered, and hopefully, we’ll have some answers for you soon. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
