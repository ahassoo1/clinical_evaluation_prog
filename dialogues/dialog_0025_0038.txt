DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Buoniconti, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I understand it has something to do with making plans for…the future, should something unforeseen occur. I believe my solicitor suggested I inquire about a document…an Advance Directive, perhaps? Or a POLST form, she mentioned. Honestly, I’m rather vague on the details.
DOCTOR: An Advance Directive… a POLST form. Yes, those are both ways of ensuring your wishes are known if you become unable to communicate them yourself. It’s… prudent thinking, I suppose. Though at your age……still, best to be prepared. Let's start with the basics. Are you experiencing any current health issues that are prompting this now?
PATIENT: Current health issues…not that I’m aware of, no. I feel… reasonably well, all things considered. It’s not a matter of feeling ill, Doctor. More a… a sense of responsibility, I suppose. My solicitor, Mr. Davies, he simply suggested it would be wise, given…well, given my recent…circumstances. My divorce, mostly. It made me think about things. I don’t recall any specific incident that prompted this, though. Just…a general feeling that I ought to be organised.
DOCTOR: A divorce… yes, that can certainly make one re-evaluate priorities. So, no specific illness or symptom that led you to think about this. Just…proactive planning. Alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed…hmm. That’s…difficult to recall. I was quite young when I left Mongolia, and the medical care was… rudimentary, at best. I believe I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, perhaps? Chickenpox? But nothing serious, I don’t think. And since coming to America… I’ve had the standard annual check-ups, and a bout of the flu a few years ago. Nothing major. I truly don’t recall any specific diagnoses, Doctor. I apologize for my vagueness. It’s rather frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Buoniconti. Don’t apologize. Childhood illnesses are…common. And a history from a different healthcare system can be challenging. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No… I don’t believe so. Perhaps…wisdom teeth removal when I was very young? But that feels…distant, and I’m not entirely certain. It’s possible, but I wouldn’t swear to it. My memory is simply not what it once was. I spent a considerable time in a remote region while working on etchings, and medical records were… scarce. I’m sorry. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It’s…relevant, Ms. Buoniconti. Knowing your surgical history helps us understand your overall health profile. But if you don’t recall anything definitive, that’s alright. We’ll proceed with caution. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of serious illness in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… That's… complicated. My parents both passed away when I was very young. I was raised by my grandmother, and she… she didn't speak much about the past. I know my father was a… a herdsman. And my mother… she was a weaver, I think. As for illnesses… I don't recall hearing about any specific conditions that ran in the family. Perhaps heart problems? Old age, mostly. They lived… a hard life. I’m afraid I can’t offer much in the way of concrete information, Doctor. It’s a rather frustrating blank, I know. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. A lack of detailed family history…not ideal, but we’ll make do. Let's discuss your current medications. Are you taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I take nothing. Absolutely nothing. I’ve always prided myself on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Fresh air, good food…that’s been my approach. I occasionally take a pain reliever for a minor headache, but that's infrequent. I avoid medication whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, if I can. Really, I have no regular prescriptions or supplements of any kind. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. Good. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to food, drugs, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions that I’m aware of. I eat most foods without issue. I’ve been stung by insects on occasion, naturally, while working outdoors, but no severe reactions. I haven’t noticed any sensitivities to any medications, either. It’s one of the few things I can state with certainty, I suppose. No known allergies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. No allergies. Alright, Ms. Buoniconti. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I’d like to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed. I understand the need for a thorough examination, even if I’m unable to provide a comprehensive medical history. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Just… please be gentle. I’m not accustomed to frequent medical procedures.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please have a seat. Blood pressure is 122 over 78. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6. Within normal limits. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. All within normal limits, Ms. Buoniconti. Everything appears… unremarkable, physically. Now, given your recent life changes and desire to document your wishes, we can discuss the specifics of an Advance Directive and POLST form. Do you have any initial questions about either of those?
PATIENT: That's… reassuring to hear, Doctor. Unremarkable is good. I suppose. As for the forms…I recall Mr. Davies mentioning something about designating a healthcare proxy? Someone to make decisions on my behalf if I'm unable to do so myself? Is that correct? And the POLST form…he said it was more…immediate? Concerning specific treatments? I’m afraid I’m rather confused about the distinctions between the two. Perhaps you could explain it in simpler terms? I want to be sure I understand everything before proceeding. It feels… important.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're correct. A healthcare proxy – or durable power of attorney for healthcare – designates someone you trust to make medical decisions if you become incapacitated. It's about your overall values and preferences. The POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is different. It's a medical order, specifically outlining your wishes regarding things like CPR, intubation, and artificial nutrition. It's for situations where you're seriously ill or frail and unable to communicate. Think of it this way: the proxy is for future possibilities, broader decisions. The POLST is for immediate medical care, very specific instructions. Does that clarify things… somewhat?
PATIENT: I think… yes, that’s a little clearer, thank you. So, the proxy is more… philosophical? About what I would want in general? And the POLST is… practical? For situations where immediate action is needed? I believe I would prefer to focus on the Advance Directive first, then. I’m not currently seriously ill, and the thought of outlining specific treatments feels… premature. I’m more concerned with ensuring my wishes are known, should something unforeseen occur in the future. Would that be acceptable? And… perhaps you could explain the process of designating a healthcare proxy? Who is eligible? What are the requirements?
DOCTOR: Very well. Focusing on the Advance Directive first is…reasonable, I suppose. It’s the more…common approach. As for the healthcare proxy, any adult – over the age of 18 – who you trust to make informed decisions on your behalf is eligible. They don’t have to be a family member, but they should understand your values and wishes. They also need to be willing to advocate for those wishes, even if they disagree with them personally. The requirements are fairly straightforward. You need to complete the form, sign it in the presence of two witnesses – who are not your proxy or your beneficiaries – and it's preferable, though not always legally required, to have it notarized. It's a fairly simple process, really. I have the forms here. I can walk you through it, or you can take it home and consider it at your leisure. It's important to choose someone you truly trust, Ms. Buoniconti. Someone who will… represent your best interests. Do you have anyone in mind?
PATIENT: Someone in mind… That’s…difficult. My life has been…rather solitary in recent years. I have a former colleague, Dr. Anya Volkov. She was a research assistant when I was still actively involved in etching. She’s… intelligent. And I believe she would be… objective. Although we haven’t spoken frequently in recent years, I trust her judgment. I suppose it would be best to list her as a potential proxy. And… perhaps I should contact her before proceeding, to ensure she’s willing to take on that responsibility? I wouldn’t want to list someone who isn’t prepared to fulfill those duties. Would that be acceptable? And… where would I find the specific requirements for witnesses and notarization in this state?
DOCTOR: Contacting Dr. Volkov beforehand is… prudent. It's best to have her consent, certainly. The specific requirements for witnesses and notarization are outlined in that pamphlet. It details the state laws regarding Advance Directives. I’d advise you to read it carefully. Here’s the form. Fill it out as completely as possible. Be specific about your wishes. And remember, Ms. Buoniconti, this is about your choices. I’m simply here to guide you through the process. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so… not at this moment. I think I’ll take some time to review the pamphlet and consider my options. And I’ll contact Dr. Volkov to discuss the possibility of listing her as my proxy. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… helpful, despite my rather vague recollections. I appreciate your patience. I believe that will be all for today, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. Take your time, Ms. Buoniconti. And don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions. Have a good day.
