DOCTOR: Hi Albino, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. It’s my back, see? Lower back. Been botherin’ me for… well, a while now. Feels kinda achy, mostly. Not sharp, just…old. Like it's gettin' worse little by little.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain. “Old” is a good way to put it, I understand. And you said it’s been getting worse gradually?
PATIENT: Yeah, gradually. It didn’t just happen one day. It's like… I used to be able to do things, ya know? Gardenin’, walkin’ a bit… Now, bendin' over is… a problem. And sittin’ for too long? Forget about it. Makes it real stiff.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it's impacting your ability to do some of the things you enjoy – gardening and walking – and prolonged sitting makes it worse. Can you tell me a little more about when it’s worst?
PATIENT: Hmm… when it's worst… Mostly in the mornin', when I first get outta bed. Real stiff then. And like I said, after sittin'. Even just watchin’ TV for a bit. But… not so bad when I’m actually doin' somethin’. Walkin' a little, that’s okay… for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse in the mornings and after sitting, but a little better with some activity. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Better… well, nothin’ really makes it better, per se. Warm showers help a little, feel good while I’m in ‘em. But it comes back quick enough. Maybe… layin' down for a bit? But I can't just lay all day, ya know?
DOCTOR: Right, laying down is temporary relief. And warm showers help while you’re in them. Have you had any pain that goes down your legs?
PATIENT: No, no pain down the legs. Just in my back. Right in the lower back. Not shootin' down or nothin’ like that. Just… achey. Sometimes feels kinda… weak, too. Like it's gonna give out when I try to lift somethin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain radiating down your legs, just localized lower back ache with some weakness. Have you ever had any injuries to your back, like a fall or a twist?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No big falls, no. Not that I remember. I used to do a lot of heavy liftin’ when I was younger, workin' with… well, it doesn't matter what I was workin’ with. But that was a long time ago. Never felt a pop or nothin', if that makes sense. Just…always a little somethin’ there, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific injury, but a history of heavy lifting in the past and a persistent ache. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions. Do you have any other medical problems, like arthritis or diabetes?
PATIENT: Arthritis… I don't think so. The doctor never told me nothin’ about that. And no, no diabetes. I used to be a little heavy, but I lost some weight a few years back. Other than that…just gettin’ old, I guess!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known arthritis or diabetes. And you mentioned losing some weight. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never been a big fan of pills, if I can help it. Just… some vitamins sometimes. But that's it. And not even regularly, ya know? When I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to anything, like medications, food, or environmental things like pollen?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to nothin'. I like flowers, I garden, ya know? So if I was allergic to pollen, I'd know!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. I’ll have you lie on your back on the examination table, and I’ll check your range of motion and feel around your back. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds alright. Go ahead. Just be gentle, okay? It's a little sore.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I'm just going to gently feel along your spine. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. ...And can you point to where the pain is the worst right now?
PATIENT: Right here. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. And kinda feels… stiff all around it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to palpation in the mid-lower back, slightly to the left of the midline. And you described it as a dull ache with some stiffness. Now, I'm going to have you gently bend forward and try to touch your toes, as comfortably as you can. Just go as far as you can without forcing it. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… not so good. Can't get down very far. Feels tight, ya know? Like somethin's blockin’ me. And a little pain when I go down, and even comin’ back up.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion with forward flexion, pain with both flexion and extension. I'm also going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs, just to make sure everything is working normally. Okay, your reflexes and strength seem good. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you have a muscle strain in your lower back. It's very common, especially with your history of lifting and getting older. Given your age and the fact you're not insured, I'm going to recommend a conservative approach initially. This involves things like rest, ice or heat, over-the-counter pain relievers, and gentle stretching. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Rest… ice or heat… over-the-counter… Okay. So, no pills, if I don’t need ‘em? And what kind of stretchin’? I don’t wanna make it worse, ya know? And how long should I rest? I got a garden to tend!
DOCTOR: Right, no pills if you can avoid them. We can talk about some options if it gets too painful, but let's start with trying to manage it without medication. As for stretching, nothing aggressive. Gentle hamstring stretches and knee-to-chest stretches can help. I can show you a couple of simple ones before you leave. And regarding rest, it's not complete bed rest! More like avoiding activities that aggravate the pain. Short walks are good, but listen to your body. If something causes pain, stop. As for how long, aim for a week or two of modifying your activities and doing the stretches. If it doesn't improve after that, or gets worse, then we need to re-evaluate. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, a week or two… and listen to my body. I can do that. Show me those stretches, that would be good. And…is it somethin’ serious? Like, will I be able to garden again?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, let's go over those stretches. Now, regarding your concern about gardening – it’s unlikely this is anything serious. Most muscle strains resolve with conservative treatment. It's possible you'll have some lingering soreness, but I fully expect you to be able to return to gardening eventually. However, it's important to be mindful of your posture when you do return, and avoid lifting anything too heavy. We'll also want to reassess if things don't improve, just to rule out anything else. Here's what I'll document: Lower back pain, likely muscle strain, conservative management recommended. I'm going to give you a handout with these stretches and some tips for proper posture. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. The handout sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I was worried it was somethin’ really bad.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Albino. I'm glad I could help ease your worries. Remember to listen to your body, and don't hesitate to reach out if things don't improve or get worse. I’ll have the nurse bring you that handout, and if you need a work note, just let me know. .
