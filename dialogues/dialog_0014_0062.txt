DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Rayshun, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Rayshun Knabenshue. It is a pleasure to meet you, Doctor… Osterholm, is it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Osterholm. Deepa Osterholm. Though, let’s not bother with formalities. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s about the masks at work. My job, Protective Services, requires a lot of face-to-face contact, and frankly, I’m having a difficult time with them. It’s… a discomfort, and I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption or alternative solution. I understand the need for safety, of course, but I’m wondering if we can find something that works for both myself and those I serve.
DOCTOR: Masks. Of course. Another one. And what specifically is this "discomfort," Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain precisely. It feels like my breathing is restricted, a tightness in my chest, and it makes me a bit lightheaded after a short time. Not a panic, exactly, but… unsettling. I’ve tried different types – the paper ones, the cloth ones – and none seem to alleviate the problem. I find myself constantly adjusting it, which I understand isn’t ideal either. It impacts my ability to focus on the individuals I’m assisting, and that is my primary concern.
DOCTOR: Lightheadedness, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Not severely, mind you. It’s more of a… a feeling of being slightly disconnected, like the room is spinning just a bit. It passes when I remove the mask and get some fresh air. It doesn’t happen every time, but frequently enough that it’s becoming a concern. I want to be fully capable when I am with someone who needs help, and this… this makes me worry about that capability.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Any history of asthma or other respiratory problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I am aware of. I’ve never been diagnosed with asthma or any lung conditions. I was a rather active child, always running around outdoors, and I haven't had any significant breathing difficulties until recently, with the masks. I’ve always been considered quite healthy, all things considered. My mother always said I had “strong Lakota lungs,” though I suppose that’s not a medical diagnosis.
DOCTOR: Right. And any heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No heart problems at all. I’ve had regular check-ups over the years, and everything has always been in good working order. My blood pressure is generally good, and my heart rate is steady. I’m not on any medication, and I don’t have any family history of heart disease that I’m aware of. I pride myself on taking care of my physical well-being, as my job demands a certain level of strength and stamina.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, then. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. It's probably nothing, but we should rule things out. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I am happy to cooperate in any way that will help determine the cause of this discomfort. I will do my best to relax. Please proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, rate around 70. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing, no crackles. Blood oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Normal. This is… puzzling.
PATIENT: Puzzling indeed, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me thoroughly. I must admit, it is a strange situation. It’s not as though I am feeling unwell otherwise, just this… this constriction and discomfort when wearing a mask. Perhaps it’s a sensitivity of some sort? I'm open to any suggestions you might have. Perhaps a different material, or even a different style of mask?
DOCTOR: It’s probably just anxiety, honestly. A lot of people get worked up about these masks. But, we can indulge your… concerns. Have you tried one of those N95 respirators?
PATIENT: Anxiety, Doctor? I hadn’t considered that, though I suppose it’s possible. I do experience a certain level of stress in my profession, it is true. However, this discomfort feels… physical, rather than emotional. As for the N95 respirators, no, I have not. My employer provided only the standard paper and cloth masks. I haven’t purchased one myself, as I was hoping to determine if an exemption was possible before incurring that expense. Would you recommend trying one, despite the initial discomfort? Perhaps it’s simply a matter of finding the right fit?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Knabenshue. I’ve seen plenty of people claiming all sorts of things. The N95 is the best protection, if you can tolerate it. Try one. If you still have issues, then… I don't know what to tell you. We could do a stress test, but frankly, it sounds like a waste of time and resources. I’ll write you a note recommending you try an N95. If it doesn't work, you may need to explore… other career options.
PATIENT: I understand your perspective, Doctor. And I appreciate your honesty. While I respect your professional judgment, I must respectfully disagree that “other career options” are the answer. I am dedicated to my work in Protective Services, and I find it deeply rewarding. I am willing to try the N95 respirator, of course. And if that proves unsuccessful, perhaps we could explore other possibilities? Could a different type of face covering be considered? Or perhaps a temporary accommodation while we investigate this further? I am confident that we can find a solution that allows me to continue serving my community effectively and safely. Would you be open to discussing those alternatives, should the N95 not provide relief?
DOCTOR: Fine. If the N95 doesn’t work – and I doubt it will – we can… consider a referral to an allergist. They can rule out any sort of… unusual sensitivity. But don’t get your hopes up. Allergists are notorious for finding nothing. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: An allergist would be a reasonable step, should the N95 prove ineffective, yes. I appreciate you being willing to consider that option. I understand your skepticism, Doctor, and I am prepared for the possibility that no definitive cause may be found. No, at this time, there is nothing else. I believe we have covered all the pertinent information. Thank you for your time and your consideration. I will acquire an N95 respirator and report back if my symptoms persist. I wish you a pleasant day, Doctor Osterholm.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get out of here then. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you again. .
