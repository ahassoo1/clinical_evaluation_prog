DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. Honestly, it’s this… stuff. My stool. It’s black. Like… tar. And I take those pain pills, you know, for my arthritis. Been taking 'em for years. I figured it might be that, but I thought I should get it checked, just in case it's something… worse. I haven't got all day, doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, black, tarry stools… and you mentioned pain medication for arthritis. Yes, that’s good information. Which pain medication are you taking, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Ugh, names. Always with the names. Let me think… It’s the orange one. No, the yellow one! Round pills. No, wait… they’re caplets. Long and… yeah, caplets. I get them from the pharmacy, of course. They start with an ‘I’, I think. Ibuprofen? Is that it? Yes, Ibuprofen. 800 milligrams. I take two, twice a day. Don't bother writing all that down, I remember perfectly well. It's just… recalling the exact name is a bother.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen 800 milligrams twice a day. Alright. And how long have you been noticing this black stool?
PATIENT: Oh, a few days now. Maybe three? Four? It’s not like it’s been every time, you understand. Just… sometimes. And it’s not like it's a huge amount, just… darker than usual. I'm not an idiot, doctor. I know what normal looks like. Honestly, all this fuss over stool. It's probably just the pills. People take pills all the time.
DOCTOR: Right, a few days. And you haven’t noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? What do you mean? Like what? I eat, I sleep, I take my pills. Everything's the same, mostly. I suppose I've been a bit… tired lately, but honestly, who isn't tired these days? I don't go looking for trouble, you know. It’s just the stool. Don’t make a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or fever?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I'm not sick, doctor. Just… concerned. A bit of black stool doesn’t mean I’m on my deathbed. I feel fine, apart from the arthritis, of course. And that's why I take the pills, remember? Honestly, I don't appreciate being questioned like this. I’ve lived seventy-three years, I think I know my own body. It's probably just a side effect. Can we be done now? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your frustration. However, black, tarry stools can be a sign of bleeding in the digestive tract, and it’s important to rule out more serious causes, even if you’re feeling well. I'm going to do a quick abdominal exam, and then I'd like to order a stool test, just to be safe. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A test? Honestly. All this fuss over a bit of… well, you know. Fine. Do your test. But don't expect me to come back if it's just my pills. And make it quick, I haven't got all day. And try not to poke too much, my stomach’s sensitive. It’s all this questioning making me nervous, you know. Really, I think I’m perfectly fine. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I’ll be gentle. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first, and then I’ll palpate it lightly. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Deep breaths, please.
PATIENT: Deep breaths. As if I haven't been breathing for seventy-three years. Honestly. There. Happy? It doesn't take a doctor to hear my breathing, you know. It's perfectly normal. And don’t poke too hard. I'm telling you, I’m sensitive. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just checking for any areas of tenderness or masses. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! There! That’s… a bit tender, actually. See? I told you I was sensitive. You’re poking around in there like… like a mechanic working on an engine! Honestly, doctor, have a little respect. It's probably just gas, but still. Stop poking now, please. You’re making it worse. It's probably just the pills. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I’ll stop. Just noting some tenderness in the lower abdomen. We’ll send a stool sample to the lab to check for blood. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Hatchard. We need to rule things out. Do you have a stool collection kit at home, or do you need me to provide one?
PATIENT: A kit? What do you think I am, a child? Of course I don't have a kit! Honestly. Just give me the kit. The sooner I get this over with, the sooner I can get home and forget this whole ridiculous ordeal. And try to explain it clearly. I don't need a lecture, just instructions. Don’t treat me like I’m stupid.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here you go. It’s fairly straightforward. There are instructions inside. You’ll need to collect a small sample—about the size of a walnut—in the container provided. It's important that the sample doesn't contain any urine. And try to get it to the lab within 24 hours. They’ll call you with the results. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A walnut. Honestly. Fine. A walnut. I can manage a walnut. And no, I don't have any questions. Don't treat me like I'm an idiot, I understood perfectly well. Just...get me out of here. I've wasted enough of my day already. And I expect a call with good news, mind you. It's probably just the pills. Really. .
