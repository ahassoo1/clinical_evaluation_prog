DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Andraca. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it's about the sun, really. I’ve been getting really bothered by it lately. More than usual, anyway. It feels like my eyes are extra sensitive, and my skin gets red super easily, even when I'm just out for a little bit. It's been happening for a few months now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sensitive eyes and skin that reddens easily with sun exposure for the past few months. That's good information to start with. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you notice this happening?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It’s definitely worse when it’s really bright out, obviously. But even on cloudy days, if I’m outside for a while, I start to feel it. It’s like… the light just feels too intense. And it doesn’t matter if I’m wearing sunglasses or not, really. It's just… uncomfortable. It's hard to explain. It's not painful, not exactly, just… a lot. It started subtly, I think, and slowly got worse. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. So, even on cloudy days and despite wearing sunglasses, you're experiencing this sensitivity and redness. And it’s been a gradual worsening. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this sensitivity?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… Well, sometimes my eyes feel a bit gritty, like there’s something in them, even when I know there isn’t. And, now that I think about it, I've been getting headaches more often. Not terrible ones, just… dull ones, especially after being in the sun. Oh! And my skin feels… kind of dry all the time, even when I use lotion. Is that related, do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, gritty eyes, more frequent dull headaches after sun exposure, and consistently dry skin. Those are all potentially relevant details. Let’s dig a little deeper. Have you noticed any blistering or peeling of the skin with the redness, or any changes in your vision – like blurriness or seeing halos?
PATIENT: No, no blistering or peeling, thankfully. And my vision seems okay, I think. No blurriness, and I haven’t seen any halos or anything like that. I did need to get a new prescription for my glasses a few months ago, so maybe it was that? But the optician said it was just normal age-related changes, nothing to worry about. I just thought I’d mention it, in case it’s connected. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you had your vision checked recently and it was attributed to age-related changes. That’s helpful information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies... Let me think. I don't think so. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. No food allergies, no hay fever, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. I do get bug bites really easily though, but that's not an allergy, is it? Just annoying! I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything.
DOCTOR: No, bug bites aren't typically considered allergies, just a common reaction. Okay, good to know you have no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, just a basic one, but that's it. And occasionally ibuprofen for headaches, but not regularly. I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible, to be honest. I prefer to just rest if I can. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, definitely. And no creams or anything like that on my skin, except for regular lotion, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin occasionally and ibuprofen for headaches, no regular prescriptions or topical medications. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… this is a little difficult to talk about. My wife… she passed away a few years ago. We were married for a long time. She had… lupus. It was tough. I helped take care of her. I remember her being really sensitive to the sun, which is… maybe why I'm mentioning all this about my own sensitivity now. But I haven't been diagnosed with anything myself. No, never. Just the usual colds and flus, I guess.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry for your loss, Arbin. That must have been incredibly difficult. It's understandable that you'd be more aware of sun sensitivity given your wife’s experience with lupus. It’s good that you're being proactive about your own health now. Just to be clear, you have not been diagnosed with lupus or any other autoimmune condition yourself, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. No, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. I just… I keep thinking maybe it’s something like that, because of my wife. But I never had any tests or anything. I just wanted to mention it, so you know. It’s probably nothing. Honestly, I just feel silly worrying about being a little sensitive to the sun. It’s not like I’m sick or anything. But it's been bothering me more and more, so I figured I’d get it checked out. It’s probably just getting old, right?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’d be thinking about lupus, especially given your wife’s experience. It's good you came in to get it checked out, and you are not silly for worrying about a change in your health. It's my job to investigate these things. Just getting older can cause some changes, but it’s always best to rule out other possibilities. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone else in your family has had lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or any other autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… that’s a good question. My mother’s side of the family… they're from Ghana, and we didn’t really talk about medical stuff much when I was growing up. It wasn't really a thing. She had a lot of siblings, but I didn't know them well. I don't recall anyone specifically having lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, no. My father’s side… he was an only child, and I didn’t know his parents very well either. They passed away when I was young. I honestly don’t have much information about their medical history, sorry. I wish I did. It’s probably not helpful, is it?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Arbin. It’s very common not to have a detailed family medical history. We’ll proceed without it for now. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life, and I don’t use any other tobacco products. My wife didn’t smoke either, so it was never around the house. I try to stay healthy, you know? I drink a little bit of wine sometimes, with dinner, but that's it. Nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And how much alcohol would you say you drink in a typical week?
PATIENT: Oh, not much at all. Maybe two or three glasses of wine. Spread out over the week, of course. Like I said, just with dinner sometimes. I don't drink beer or hard liquor, just the occasional glass of red wine. It helps me relax, I guess. But it’s really not a habit. I don’t drink every day, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds very moderate. And finally, what do you do for work, and do you spend a lot of time outdoors as part of your job or hobbies?
PATIENT: I’m a dental assistant. So, I’m mostly indoors, thankfully. It’s a pretty steady job, not too stressful. I don’t spend much time outdoors at work. For hobbies… I like gardening, a little bit. But not a lot. I mostly do it in the mornings, when the sun isn’t too strong. And I like reading, and… well, that’s about it, really. Mostly indoor stuff. I used to go fishing with my wife, but… it's not the same without her.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily indoor work and hobbies, with some gardening in the mornings. Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Arbin. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and just take a look at your skin, especially in areas exposed to the sun. We'll also check your eyes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Dr. Andraca. Go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning at this moment. Your pulse is 72, which is normal. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I do notice some mild redness on your cheeks and the back of your hands, which is consistent with sun exposure. There are no obvious rashes or lesions. The skin feels slightly dry to the touch. Now, let me check your eyes quickly. Your pupils are equal and react to light. The retinas look normal, but there is some mild dryness of the conjunctiva, which could contribute to the gritty feeling you described. Okay, everything looks reasonably normal so far, but the mild redness and conjunctival dryness are worth investigating further. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, I'm considering a few possibilities, including photosensitivity – meaning your skin is unusually sensitive to the sun - and a potential for mild dry eye syndrome. The headaches and history of sensitivity could also point to other things, so we'll need some further testing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Testing sounds good. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? I’m glad you’re taking it seriously. Photosensitivity sounds about right, honestly. I’ve always been a little sensitive to bright light, but it’s gotten worse. What kind of tests are we talking about? Will it be painful? I don’t really like needles…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about needles. We'll try to minimize any discomfort as much as possible. The tests I’m thinking of are mainly blood tests. We'll check for inflammation markers, autoimmune antibodies – these can help rule out conditions like lupus – and also assess your vitamin D levels, as vitamin D deficiency can sometimes contribute to sensitivity. We may also do a Schirmer test to measure tear production and confirm if you have dry eye syndrome. The blood test will involve a small sample drawn from your arm. The Schirmer test is painless – it just involves placing a small strip of paper under your lower eyelid to measure tear volume. Would you like me to explain any of those tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… not too bad, I guess. Blood tests, I can handle. And a painless test sounds good. Vitamin D… I guess that makes sense. I don't spend much time in the sun, like I said. I think I understand, but could you explain a little more about the autoimmune antibodies? What are we looking for exactly? And what would it mean if they were found? I just want to be prepared, you know? I get a little anxious about medical stuff. It just reminds me of my wife… and all of that. Sorry. I shouldn't be going on about that.
DOCTOR: You're not going on about anything at all, Arbin. It's perfectly understandable that this is bringing up difficult memories, and it’s important to address your concerns. Autoimmune antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that mistakenly attack the body’s own tissues. In the case of lupus and other autoimmune conditions, these antibodies target various organs and tissues, causing inflammation and damage. The blood test will check for specific types of these antibodies, like antinuclear antibodies , anti-dsDNA antibodies, and others. If these antibodies were found, it wouldn't necessarily mean you have lupus. Many healthy people can have low levels of ANA without having any symptoms. However, high levels, especially if accompanied by other symptoms and findings, could suggest an autoimmune condition. If that were the case, we would need further investigations to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. We're just gathering information at this point, Arbin. It’s important to rule out potential causes and get a clear picture of what’s going on. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a lot more sense. So, it’s not a definite diagnosis if the antibodies are there. Just… a sign that we need to look closer. Okay. I think I understand. So, what happens next? Do I need to fast before the blood test? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a few appointments next week, so I want to make sure I can schedule something if needed.
DOCTOR: Exactly. It's a piece of the puzzle, not the whole picture. Yes, you do need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood test. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We typically draw the blood in the morning, so you can have your last meal the night before. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. We can discuss the timing of that appointment once the results are available. I will order the blood tests now and give you a lab requisition slip. It will have all the necessary instructions. The lab is located at [Lab Location - inserts address]. Do you have any questions about getting to the lab or the fasting requirements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I know where that lab is, it’s not too far from here. And I understand the fasting. No food, just water. I think I can manage that. Thank you, Dr. Andraca. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I feel a lot better now, knowing what’s going on and what to expect. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and answer all my questions, especially with… everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and we’ll be in touch soon.
