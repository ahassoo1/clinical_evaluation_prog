DOCTOR: Right. Oreste Guilds, 83 years old. So, Mr. Guilds, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Well, I… I’m gettin’ short of breath, see? Not always, but… more and more. And my mouth feels like the Sahara Desert. And my eyes… like sandpaper. It’s botherin’ me. A lot. Don't know what's causin' it.
DOCTOR: Short of breath, dry mouth, dry eyes… Okay. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Long? A while now. Months, I guess. Maybe longer? Time… it kinda all blurs together, you know? I ain’t been keepin’ track. It’s just… worse lately. Definitely worse. I used to be able to walk to the store... now? Not so much.
DOCTOR: Months… right. And would you say this shortness of breath comes on with activity, or does it happen even when you’re resting?
PATIENT: Mostly when I try to do somethin'. Walkin’… even just gettin' up outta my chair. But sometimes… even when I’m sittin’ here, watchin’ the TV, I gotta take a few deep breaths. It’s… annoying, mostly. And thirsty work, that’s for sure. Don't know what it could be.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any chest pain with this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Not really… well, sometimes a little tightness. Not like a heart attack or somethin', mind you. Just… uncomfortable. Like someone’s sittin' on my chest. It comes and goes. It ain't a sharp pain, if that makes any sense. More of a… squeeze.
DOCTOR: A squeeze… alright. Any cough accompanying this, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Cough? Not much. I used to… years ago, I had a bad cough. But not lately. Maybe a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothin' serious. It’s the breathlessness and the dryness that’s botherin’ me. Feels like I’m walkin’ through a desert, I tell ya. And my eyes feel gritty.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and take your blood pressure. Then we’ll see what we've got. Please, sit back. And try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Fine. But don’t take too long. I got my stories on at three o’clock. And I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. But… alright. Just… be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay. Lungs are… diminished breath sounds bilaterally, with some mild wheezing. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit distant. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 88. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or COPD, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Asthma? COPD? Never heard of ‘em. I used to smoke, a long time ago. Cuban cigars, the best you ever tasted. But I quit… oh, must be fifty years ago. Doctor never said nothin’ about any of those things. Just told me to quit smokin'. Which I did. Didn't say anythin' about breathin’ problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history of smoking and your current symptoms, it's possible you have some chronic bronchitis. The dryness could be related to that, or simply dehydration. It's difficult to say definitively without some further testing. We should probably get a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious. And I'd like to order a basic metabolic panel to check your electrolytes and kidney function.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for goodness sake. More poking and proddin'? Look, Doc, I’m an old man. I ain’t got time for a whole bunch of tests. Can’t you just give me somethin’ for the dryness? My mouth feels like… well, like sandpaper, I told ya! And maybe a little somethin' to help me breathe easier? I just wanna be comfortable. All this testin' seems like a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your frustration, but I need to rule out anything serious before I can simply prescribe something. We need to know why you're feeling this way. It could be something minor, but it could also be something significant. The X-ray and blood work will give us a much clearer picture. As for the dryness, I can prescribe a lubricating mouthwash, but that’s only a temporary solution. We need to address the root cause. Now, are you willing to let me order these tests, or not?
PATIENT: Root cause? Look, Doc, I been feelin' old for twenty years. You think you're gonna find the "root cause" of that? I just want a little relief. But… alright. Fine. Do your tests. But don't keep me all day, and don't expect miracles. I got stories on, remember? And if it's somethin' serious… well, I ain’t lookin’ for trouble. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll write the orders for the chest X-ray and the basic metabolic panel. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions for the X-ray. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a lubricating mouthwash. It's over-the-counter, but it should provide some relief from the dryness. Here you go. And try to drink plenty of fluids. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Plenty of fluids… like that’s gonna fix everything… Stories on at three… gotta remember that. .
