DOCTOR: Right. Candis Hardenburgh, 79. Good. Well, Ms. Hardenburgh, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this tiredness. Just… dragging. And it’s not just regular old tired, you know? It’s…different. And I’ve been… well, it's embarrassing to even say, but I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, but…clay, mostly. From the garden. Don’t look at me like that. It helps, okay? Though it doesn't stay helpful.
DOCTOR: Eating…clay?
PATIENT: Yes, clay. Like I said. From the garden. Red clay. And sometimes… just earth. It's hard to explain. It just… settles something. Though, like I said, it doesn’t last. And it makes me feel worse later, but for a little while… it's the only thing that does. Look, I haven’t gone completely senile, alright? I know it’s not normal. I just… what else am I supposed to do?
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, let's focus on this tiredness. When did it start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… hmm. It’s crept up on me, you know? Not a sudden thing. Maybe… six months ago? No, longer. A year, maybe? It’s hard to say, really. I just… started needing more naps. And then the naps weren’t enough. I used to be able to get everything done, garden, house, even volunteer at the church… now, I'm lucky to make it through the day. Honestly, I just thought it was… old age. But it’s getting worse, and then this started, so…
DOCTOR: Any other symptoms accompanying the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… I’ve been a bit breathless lately. Not with anything strenuous, just… walking up the stairs, things like that. And I suppose my appetite isn’t what it used to be. Everything tastes… flat. Bland. Though, I wouldn’t say I’ve lost weight. Just not as hungry. And sometimes… my stomach feels a little upset after… you know. After the clay. Though I don't need you to tell me that's probably not helping things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Really? Do we have to talk about this? Look, I’m an old woman, not a medical textbook. But… yes. It’s… different. Harder. More difficult. Look, I’m not going into details, alright? It’s just… not normal. Is that good enough? I just want to know what's wrong with me, not be interrogated about… that. Honestly. I’ve never had trouble with… that, before. Not until… recently. And definitely not until this tiredness started.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We don’t need to delve into specifics. Have you noticed any bleeding, or changes in color?
PATIENT: Bleeding? No! No bleeding. Good heavens, no. Just… harder. And… different colored. Darker, I suppose. Not black, don't panic. Just… not right. Like I said, everything is just not right. Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? I’m just telling you what’s happening. It’s frustrating, constantly having to explain things! I feel awful, I’m eating dirt, and everything is… off. What is wrong with me? Is this something serious? I just want a straight answer.
DOCTOR: We need to do some blood work. And I'd like to check your iron levels, given your… dietary habits, and the changes in your bowel movements. It could be a number of things. Anemia is a possibility. We should also rule out other deficiencies. And, frankly, this clay ingestion is concerning. It can cause blockages, or lead to toxin absorption. We'll get everything checked, okay?
PATIENT: Toxin absorption? Blockages? See! I knew it wasn't good. Honestly, you could have just told me that earlier! You’re making me worry now. Okay, fine. Blood work. Whatever. Get it over with. But hurry, alright? I haven't got all day. And please, don't give me a lecture about eating dirt again. I know it’s bad, I’m trying to figure out why I’m doing it. So, just… get the tests done. And tell me what’s wrong. Soon. I’m tired of feeling awful. .
DOCTOR: Right. Let's get the lab tech in here. Just a routine blood draw, and we'll see what we find. Ms. Davies, could you please come in here for a blood draw?
