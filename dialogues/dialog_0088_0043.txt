DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I'm Dr. Piet. Welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. It’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, goodness, maybe a couple weeks now. Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. A headache for about two weeks, coming and going… Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a pounding headache, you know? More of a… a dull ache. Feels like pressure, right at the base of my skull. Sometimes it goes up a little, into the sides, but mostly back there. I noticed it more when I’m readin’ or sittin’ at my computer workin’ with numbers. But it’s happened just watchin’ TV too. It doesn’t make me sick or anything, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache, pressure at the base of the skull, sometimes radiating to the sides. It’s worse with reading or computer work, but also happens with TV. No nausea or vomiting. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Layin’ down seems to help some. And… if I take a little walk, that usually takes the edge off too. Not a cure, mind you, just… less bad. I haven’t really tried anything specific, like medicine. Just tryin’ to rest it mostly. And drink plenty of water, like my daughter always tells me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so resting and a short walk seem to help a little. And you've been staying hydrated. Have you had any changes in your vision lately, Percell?
PATIENT: Vision? No, not that I’ve noticed. Everything looks pretty clear. I wear glasses for readin’, have for years now, but the prescription hasn’t changed recently. Last check-up was… oh, let me see… must've been last November, I think. The eye doctor said everything was lookin’ good then. No blurry spots or double vision or anything like that. I can still see the small print on my financial reports, so I figure my eyes are okay.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you had any fever, neck stiffness, or any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No fever at all. And my neck… well, it gets a little stiff sometimes, but that's just from sleepin' wrong, I think. Happens every now and then. No weakness or numbness anywhere. I can still walk just fine, and my hands are steady enough to work with my calculator and write things down. I was just helpin' my grandson build a birdhouse last weekend, needed a steady hand for the hammerin'! No problems there.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, Percell, have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. I've had headaches on and off for years, you know, just regular headaches. But this… this feels different. Not as sharp, more like a constant pressure. The other ones would come and go quick, maybe from stress or not enough sleep. This one lingers. It’s been goin' on longer, that’s for sure. I can't rightly say I've had this particular headache before, no. It's new.
DOCTOR: Alright, so this headache feels different and is lasting longer than your usual headaches. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with medicine years ago. I stopped takin’ the pills a few years back, said my numbers were lookin’ good at the check-ups. I have a little arthritis in my knees, but it’s not too bad, mostly just a little stiff in the mornin’. And… oh, I had my gallbladder out maybe twenty years ago. Other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. I try to eat healthy and stay active. No major illnesses or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled high blood pressure in the past, arthritis in the knees, and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. Any surgeries besides the gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. And… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was a long, long time ago. Don't think that's relevant now. Mostly just the gallbladder, really. I haven't had to go under the knife since then, thankfully. I don’t like hospitals much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Percell, are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had diabetes, but she got it pretty late in life. My father… he had heart trouble, I think. Had a stroke, actually. And my sister… she had some problems with her kidneys, I think. But other than that, nothin' major that I can recall. It's been a while since we talked about family history, to be honest. Everyone kept to themselves mostly. We weren’t a family that shared a lot of medical secrets.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smokin’ for me. Never took to it. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, on special occasions. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested in those, and never have been. I always liked a clear head for my numbers.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can take most medicines without any problems. I haven’t had a reaction to anything in years, not that I recall. My daughter always asks, and I always say no. She worries a lot, that girl. But no, no allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. That gives me a good picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. Then we can talk about what might be causing your headache and what we can do about it. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. I'm not afraid of a little exam. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 148 over 86. Heart sounds are normal, but your heart rate is a little fast. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and some basic strength in your arms and legs. Just relax, and I'll let you know what I'm doing. Okay. Everything seems normal so far – reflexes are good, strength is good. There's some mild tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull, which could be contributing to your headache. I don't see any other obvious signs of anything serious.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. Mild tenderness… that makes sense. I do feel a little stiff back there sometimes. So, what do you think is causin’ it? Is it somethin’ serious? I get worried sometimes, you know. Old age and all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Percell. Based on what you've told me and the exam, I don't think it's anything serious. It sounds most likely like a tension headache, possibly related to some muscle strain in your neck and shoulders. The elevated blood pressure could be contributing to it as well. Sometimes stress, poor posture, or even just spending a lot of time focusing on something like numbers can cause these types of headaches. However, because your blood pressure is a little high, and you haven't had it checked recently, I want to be thorough. I’d like to order some blood work just to rule out anything else that could be causing your headache and to get a better handle on your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work sounds sensible, Doctor. Better to be safe than sorry, right? I haven’t had a full check-up in a while, so that’s probably a good idea. And you think it’s just tension, from all my work? I do spend a lot of hours lookin’ at those spreadsheets…
DOCTOR: Exactly. And the spreadsheets don't help! We'll check your thyroid, kidney function, and a complete blood count, just to be sure. While we're waiting for those results, I recommend a few things. First, try to incorporate some relaxation techniques into your day. Deep breathing exercises or even a short walk can help relieve tension. Second, make sure you're maintaining good posture while you're working. And third, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage the pain. I'm also going to recommend you check your blood pressure at home a couple of times a day for a week and keep a log of the readings. I can give you a simple form to use. If the blood pressure stays consistently high, we'll need to discuss medication options. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds like a plan, Doctor. Relaxation, good posture, and pain relievers… I can try that. And checkin’ my blood pressure at home… alright, I can do that too. You have a form for that? That’d be helpful. I’m not very good at rememberin’ things, so a form would be a lifesaver.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here you go. Just write down the date and time, and your blood pressure reading. Bring that with you when you come back for your follow-up appointment. I’ll also give you a prescription for a mild muscle relaxant to take as needed if the pain is particularly bothersome. But try the over-the-counter pain relievers first. I want to see you back in two weeks to discuss the blood work results and how you’re feeling. If your symptoms worsen significantly before then, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, or weakness, please call the office immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes perfect sense. Blood pressure log, muscle relaxant as needed, and follow-up in two weeks. And call if things get worse. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me and not brush it off as just old age. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. I'm glad I could help. Remember, it's always better to be safe and get things checked out. If you have any questions at all before your follow-up appointment, don't hesitate to call the office. I'll have the nurse come in and give you discharge instructions, and then you can schedule your follow-up appointment on the way out. Have a good day, and try to relax!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
