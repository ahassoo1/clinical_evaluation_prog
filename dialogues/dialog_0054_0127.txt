DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain. I’ve been getting weaker, you see. My muscles just feel… tired, all the time. And my eyelids, they’ve been drooping. It’s getting noticeable, and frankly, a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids… that’s definitely something we want to look into. Can you tell me a bit more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I think, a few months ago. Just a little bit of trouble lifting things, nothing major. I thought it was just getting older, to be honest. But it’s… progressed. Now it’s harder to get up from a chair, or even hold things for a long time. It’s mostly in my arms and legs, I’d say. Not so much in my hands, thankfully. And it seems worse at the end of the day. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So it's been progressive over a few months, mostly affecting your arms and legs, and worse at the end of the day. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been feeling more tired than usual, generally. And… now that you mention it, I’ve been having a bit of trouble swallowing sometimes. Not every time, and it’s not severe, but food does occasionally feel like it’s getting stuck. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable. I also seem to be bruising more easily, I think, but I haven’t really kept track. Is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, difficulty swallowing occasionally, and possibly easier bruising. Those are all things we should definitely explore further. Just to clarify, when you say difficulty swallowing, is that with solids, liquids, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly with solids, I think. Liquids are usually fine. It’s more like… if I don’t chew things very thoroughly, or if I eat too quickly, then it feels like it gets stuck. It doesn't happen every meal, but enough to make me pay attention to it. It's a strange feeling, really. It's not like choking, just… a delay, or resistance.
DOCTOR: Alright, a delay or resistance with solids. Thank you for clarifying. Now, let’s go through some more general questions. Have you had any fever, weight loss, or any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: No fever, thankfully. And… I don’t think I’ve lost any weight. My clothes still fit the same, at least. As for my vision, no, nothing noticeable. No blurriness, double vision, or anything like that. Though… I haven't had my eyes checked in a while, if that matters. I suppose it’s been a few years. Is that relevant to what’s going on?
DOCTOR: It's good to know you haven’t had a fever or noticed any weight loss or vision changes. The lack of a recent eye exam is noted, and it could potentially be relevant, so we might consider that later. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been managed with medication. Aside from that, no, not really. I’ve been generally healthy, all my life. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I also had my tonsils removed when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Does the blood pressure medication matter? I've been taking it regularly, as prescribed.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication – that’s important to know. And you've been consistent with taking it, which is good. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s Lisinopril, I believe. 20 milligrams, once a day. I can give you the exact name and dosage if you’d like. I keep the bottle at home, but I can try to remember precisely. It's been the same prescription for a while now.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Knowing the exact name and dosage is helpful. Lisinopril 20mg once daily. Good. And besides Lisinopril, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the Lisinopril. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. I might take a vitamin C tablet occasionally if I’m feeling a cold coming on, but that’s it. Definitely no regular supplements. I try to eat a healthy diet instead.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the Lisinopril, and occasional vitamin C. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods, and I haven't had any issues with medications in the past. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. Though… I sometimes get a bit of a stuffy nose in the spring, but I don’t think that’s an allergy, just seasonal. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Seasonal stuffiness doesn’t count as an allergy for our purposes. Good. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had arthritis, quite badly, when she got older. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. He passed away a few years ago, so I don’t remember the exact details. He was a smoker, for many years, so it was likely related to that. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. She lives in another country, so we don’t talk as often as we used to. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother and heart problems in your father. That’s helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I'm divorced, actually. It was a few years ago now. I live alone, in an apartment. I work as a facilities manager, mostly office buildings. It's a fairly stressful job, to be honest. I don’t smoke, and I only drink occasionally – maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. I don’t do a lot of exercise, I'm afraid. I used to play football when I was younger, but I haven’t had the time or energy for it in years. Is that the sort of thing you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly the sort of thing I’m looking for. Okay. Let’s move on. Finally, have you noticed any rashes, joint pain, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No rashes at all. And no joint pain, thankfully. My muscles are weak, as we discussed, but not painful. And no, I haven't had any shortness of breath. I can walk up the stairs without any trouble, and I don't feel winded easily. I feel… tired, generally, but not particularly breathless. I think that's everything, Doctor. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no rashes, joint pain, or shortness of breath. That’s good to know. Thank you for providing such a thorough history, Gedalya. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your strength seems a little diminished in your arms and legs, as you described, but no obvious atrophy. I’m also checking your reflexes now… they’re a little sluggish. I’m now examining your pupils… they are equal, round, and reactive to light. Finally, I’m checking your cranial nerves… they appear intact. Based on this initial exam, and your history, I’m concerned about a few possibilities, including something affecting your muscles or nerves. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Blood tests sound sensible, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best, then please do. I want to get to the bottom of this, as quickly as possible. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for them? Fasting, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Good. Yes, I would like to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a creatine kinase level. The CK level is particularly important as it can indicate muscle damage. For the CK level, it’s important that you avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours before the test, as that can artificially elevate the results. Otherwise, you don't need to fast. The other tests can be done without any special preparation. I'll also order a Vitamin D level, as deficiencies can cause muscle weakness. Do you have any insurance that covers these tests?
PATIENT: Unfortunately, no, I don’t have any insurance at the moment. It’s… a long story. I was hoping to get things sorted out before needing to see a doctor, but… here we are. Will that be a problem? I can pay out of pocket, if necessary. How much are we likely looking at? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can certainly work with that. I'll have the lab provide you with the cost of each test upfront, so you can make an informed decision. The cost can vary, but roughly, these tests will be around $200-300 total, possibly a bit more. We can also see if the lab offers any discounts for paying cash upfront. I'll write you a lab requisition form now. Once you have the results, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we’ll discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – such as increased weakness, difficulty breathing, or severe difficulty swallowing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand perfectly. $200-300 is… manageable, thankfully. And I’ll be sure to keep an eye on things, and go to the emergency room if anything gets worse. Thank you for being so clear and understanding, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this quickly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gedalya. I’m glad I could help. The lab is just down the hall, and they usually have a quick turnaround time for the results. Once you have the results, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. We can discuss them, and determine the next steps. In the meantime, try to get some rest, and avoid any strenuous activities. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. I think I have everything I need to get the tests done. Thank you again for your time and assistance. I’ll be sure to call the office once I have the results. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gedalya. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day as well.
