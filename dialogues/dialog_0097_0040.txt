DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this pain in my side, mostly. Comes and goes, but it’s been happening quite a bit lately. And I seem to get water infections… frequently, you might say. The doctor back home – he said something about my kidneys, but my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I didn’t quite catch all of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, side pain and frequent water infections. I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don't remember everything – that’s what I’m here for! Let's start with this side pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s on my right side, lower down. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. Sometimes it feels like a pressure, like something is full. It comes on and off, and it doesn’t always last long – maybe an hour or so at a time. It doesn't go all the way through to my back, if that makes sense. Sometimes it's worse if I've been eating, but not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, right side, lower abdomen, dull ache or pressure, comes and goes, about an hour at a time, not radiating to the back. And sometimes worse after eating… That’s helpful. Do you notice anything specific that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Lying down sometimes helps, yes. Especially on my left side. And… warm baths, definitely warm baths seem to ease it a little. Not a cure, mind you, but a bit of relief. It's hard to say if anything completely gets rid of it, though. It just… fades on its own eventually.
DOCTOR: Alright, lying down, especially on your left side, and warm baths provide some relief. That’s good to know. Now, you mentioned frequent water infections. How often would you say you're experiencing those?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It feels like every few weeks now, Doctor. Maybe once a month, sometimes more frequent. It's… uncomfortable, to say the least. And tiring, always having to go to the bathroom. I try to drink plenty of water, but it doesn't seem to make much difference. I usually just get over-the-counter medicine for them, but they keep coming back.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly every few weeks, sometimes monthly, despite drinking plenty of water. You’ve been treating them with over-the-counter medication… Do you remember what you've been taking for those infections?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe it’s something called… Azo? Yes, Azo Standard. The red box. It helps with the pain and burning, but it doesn't stop them completely. Just makes it bearable for a bit, then it wears off and it starts all over again. I’ve been using that for… well, a while now. I suppose a year, maybe more? It's all a bit blurry, sorry.
DOCTOR: No, don't apologize at all, Mr. Espinueva. A year or more of using Azo Standard… Okay. And have you seen a doctor about these recurring infections, or is this the first time discussing them in detail?
PATIENT: It’s alright, Doctor. Yes, the doctor back home… he did some tests, a few years ago now. He said something about… cysts on my kidneys? Polycystic something-or-other. He gave me a leaflet, but I seem to have misplaced it. He said it wasn’t anything to worry about too much, but to keep an eye on it. That's why I’m here, really, to see if it’s getting worse. And why these water infections keep coming back.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… Okay, that explains a lot. And you're right to want to get it checked out, especially with the recurring infections. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then I'll review your chart more thoroughly and we can discuss some potential next steps, including some lab work. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. A physical exam is good. I trust your judgement. And any tests you think are necessary, I'm happy to do them. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie down on the table for me, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen and back, and gently feel around. I'll also check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. It won't take long. Okay, everything sounds and feels okay so far, but I did notice some mild tenderness in your right flank. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that can be common. I’m going to access your EHR now to see the results from your previous tests.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you for checking. I appreciate you taking your time. I do get a little nervous at the doctor, so please don’t hesitate to tell me if you see anything concerning. This side pain does worry me a bit, but I try not to dwell on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m seeing here from three years ago, you had an abdominal ultrasound that showed multiple cysts on both kidneys, consistent with polycystic kidney disease. The report noted that the cysts were small at the time, but it does recommend regular monitoring. There’s also a note about a urine analysis that showed some bacteria present, but it wasn’t considered a significant infection at the time. Given your recurring water infections and the tenderness in your right flank, I’d like to order a repeat urine analysis and a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney function. I also think it would be wise to get another abdominal ultrasound to see if the cysts have grown. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. A repeat urine analysis, a check of my kidney function… and another ultrasound. All good ideas. It’s good to know what's going on, really. And if the cysts have grown, then at least we’ll know. Yes, please, let’s go ahead with all of that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’ve ordered those tests for you. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment for your blood work and urine sample. The radiology department will also contact you to schedule the ultrasound. While we’re waiting for those results, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – water is best – and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. It may also help to avoid foods that can irritate your bladder, such as spicy foods and citrus fruits. I'm also going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics to treat your current water infection. It's important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it's finished. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Plenty of fluids, avoid caffeine and spicy foods… and a course of antibiotics. I can definitely manage that. And I will definitely finish the entire course of the antibiotics, you can be sure of that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. Here’s the prescription. I'm prescribing you Nitrofurantoin 100mg twice a day for five days. We'll review the lab results and ultrasound images together when they're available. If you experience any fever, chills, or worsening flank pain, please contact the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I feel much better knowing what we're doing, and having a plan. Thank you again for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. Remember to take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Here’s a copy of the instructions we discussed today, and a list of resources on polycystic kidney disease. Have a good day, and I’ll see you when the results are back.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well. And I will see you soon. Bye bye.
