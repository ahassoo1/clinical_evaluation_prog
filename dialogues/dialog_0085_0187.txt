DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Lahn. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Just… chest pain. And my heart… it feels funny. Like it’s beating too fast. And the nurse, she said my blood pressure was… high. Very high. I don’t like hospitals. Let’s make this quick, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand. We'll do our best to be as efficient as possible while still making sure we get a good understanding of what's going on. Chest pain and a fast heartbeat are definitely things we need to look into. First, can you tell me a little more about this chest pain?
PATIENT: Look into? What is there to look into? It hurts! Like… a squeezing. Not always, you know? Sometimes it just… aches. It happens when I… walk. Especially uphill. And when I get… upset. My wife, she says I worry too much. Is that what this is? Worry? I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re describing it to me, Mr. Sobkowicz. A squeezing pain that comes and goes, and is worse with activity or when you're feeling stressed… that helps us narrow down what could be going on. It could be related to stress, but chest pain should always be taken seriously. When you say it happens with activity, about how far do you typically walk before it starts?
PATIENT: Walk? Not far! These days… maybe a block. Used to walk miles, you know? Before… before things got slow. Now, even going to the market… makes me tired. It's not like the old days. Everything is harder. My son, he tells me to exercise, but… what’s the point? It just makes the pain worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is impacting your daily life, and that's concerning. It's good you’re aware of the changes. Okay, so pain with about a block of walking. Does the pain radiate anywhere – like to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiate? What does that even mean? It just… hurts here. <points to center of chest> Sometimes… my left arm feels a little… heavy. Not always, mind you. Just… sometimes. And I get… short of breath. Like I can’t get enough air. Is that the radiating? I don't know these fancy words. Just tell me if it’s serious.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. We don't need to use fancy words. “Radiate” just means does the pain spread anywhere else from your chest. And yes, pain in your left arm could be related. Shortness of breath is also something we want to pay attention to. Okay, let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any other medical problems, like diabetes or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Cholesterol… maybe? The doctor, a long time ago, said something about it being… a little high. I don't remember. I take a water pill, that's all. For… swelling. My legs. My wife handles the pills. I just take what she gives me. She knows best. Don't bother her though, she's busy.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a water pill for swelling in your legs, and a history of slightly high cholesterol. That’s helpful to know. And it’s good your wife helps manage your medications. Have you ever had any surgeries or been in the hospital for anything else?
PATIENT: Hmph. A long time ago… when I was young. Appendix. And… a broken leg. Fell off a roof fixing it. Stupid thing to do. That was… many years ago. I don’t remember much else. Don't ask my wife, she'll tell you everything about my past mistakes. It’s embarrassing. Can we be done soon? I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix and a broken leg a long time ago. We don’t need to dwell on past mistakes, Mr. Sobkowicz. Now, just a few questions about your family. Has anyone in your family had heart problems – like a heart attack, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Heart problems… my father, yes. He… he died young. Heart attack. Very sudden. My mother… she had… something with her blood pressure. Always complaining about it. And my sister… she had a stroke. Bad one. So yes, lots of problems. Bad genes, I think. Is that what this is? Bad genes? Just like my father. Can we get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very important information, Mr. Sobkowicz – a family history of heart attack, high blood pressure, and stroke. It does sound like there's a family predisposition, which means you may be at higher risk. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your blood pressure again. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be quick about it. And don’t tell me everything is going to be alright. I don’t like false promises. Let's just get it over with. Hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. <pauses, listening> Your breathing sounds a little… congested, but not severely. Now, let’s check your blood pressure again. <I take his blood pressure> Okay. Your blood pressure is elevated – 160 over 95. That is higher than we’d like to see. And your heart rate is a little fast - 92. I also notice a slight swelling in your ankles. I want to be thorough, so I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, and a blood test to check your cholesterol levels and other important markers. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? What's the point? It's just like my father. <sighs heavily> Fine. Do whatever you think you need to do. Just… tell me the results quickly. I don’t want to be waiting around. And don't give me a long lecture about lifestyle changes. I know I should walk more. Just fix it. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. We'll get these tests ordered right away, and I'll do my best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. They’ll help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. While we wait for the results, I do want to emphasize the importance of addressing the high blood pressure. It can significantly increase your risk of a heart attack or stroke, especially given your family history. We can discuss some options once we have the test results. But for now, I'm going to write you a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication to start while we wait for the lab work. It might help lower your blood pressure and relieve some of your symptoms. It’s important to take it as prescribed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don’t think so. Never had any problems with pills before. My wife handles all of that. She knows what I can and can't take. She reads all those little leaflets. Just… write whatever she usually gets. She’s a good wife. <pauses, looking away> Just… make sure it doesn't make me too tired. I need to be able to… do things. Is that understood? And hurry up with the prescription.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’ll write the prescription for a low-dose medication that is generally well-tolerated. It's important to start it as prescribed, even if you don’t feel immediate relief. It can take some time to see the full effects. I’ll also give you a printout explaining the medication and potential side effects. Please read it carefully, and if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask your wife, or call the office. We will contact you with the test results as soon as they become available, typically within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain that is severe or doesn't go away, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Hmph. I understand. Just… don’t bother me unless it’s important. I have appointments, you know? And tell your nurse to be quicker next time. Wasting my time. Here. <hands back the printout> My wife can read it. She's better at these things. Now, can I go? <stands up slowly> I’m tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand. I’ll make a note for the nurse. Please take care, and remember, if you experience any worsening symptoms, don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. We will be in touch soon with your test results. .
PATIENT: Hmph. <nods curtly and slowly walks towards the door, leaning slightly> Goodbye. <exits the room>.
