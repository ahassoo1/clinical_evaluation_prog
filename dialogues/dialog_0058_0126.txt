DOCTOR: Right. Christen Erxleben, 32 years old. Hello, Christen. I'm Dr. Todoroivch. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been terribly thirsty lately, and… unusually hungry as well. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it's starting to become quite disruptive. I feel like I’m constantly reaching for a drink, and then soon after, something to eat.
DOCTOR: Okay. A few weeks of increased thirst and hunger… disruptive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, disruptive. It’s… difficult to concentrate on work, to be honest. I’m a shipping clerk, so I need to be precise, and constantly feeling this need is… distracting. I find myself thinking about the next drink or snack more than I should be. It's also making my shifts longer, as I'm needing more breaks.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes alongside the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not particularly, no. I suppose I’ve been… a bit more tired than usual, but I put that down to the longer hours at work. No dizziness, no… unusual bathroom habits, nothing like that. Just the thirst and the hunger, really. Though, now that you mention it, I have lost a little bit of weight, I think. Not a significant amount, but my trousers feel a bit looser.
DOCTOR: Weight loss with increased appetite… that’s… interesting. Do you have any family history of diabetes, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: To my knowledge, no. My mother had high blood pressure, but nothing major. My father was… quite healthy, actually, lived to a good age. No diabetes that I'm aware of, on either side of the family. I wouldn’t say I’ve had any significant illnesses myself, other than the usual childhood things. I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but that was all.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. And no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. I’ve always been quite robust in that regard. I had a slight sensitivity to pollen when I was younger, but I’ve mostly grown out of that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then I’ll take a look at your throat and a quick neurological exam. It’s standard procedure. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Sounds perfectly reasonable. I’ll do my best to relax, though I must admit, I’m eager to find out what’s causing all of this. Time is… valuable, you understand.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little on the higher side, 142/90. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, open your mouth for me, please. Throat looks normal, no signs of infection. Let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Finally, a quick check of your feet. Good sensation in both feet, no obvious swelling. Height is 170cm, weight is 93kg… BMI is 32.2, which puts you in the obese category. Everything seems… fairly normal, but with the weight loss and the increased appetite, and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some blood work. Specifically, a fasting blood glucose, a complete metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Obese, you say? That’s… unexpected. I’ve always considered myself to be of a solid build, not… obese. But, yes, blood work sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and if that requires some tests, then so be it. When can I expect the results? I have commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Solid build is… subjective. The numbers are what we go by, unfortunately. The lab usually takes 24-48 hours to get the results back to us. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for three business days from now to discuss them. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Three business days… that’s acceptable, I suppose. Though, I was hoping for something a bit sooner. But, alright, three days it is. Will I need to fast beforehand for these tests? And is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? I'd appreciate knowing if there is anything I can do to… mitigate the symptoms, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood work. No food or sugary drinks, water is fine. As for mitigating the symptoms… honestly, until we know what's going on, it’s difficult to say. Try to drink plenty of water, which you’re already doing, and avoid sugary snacks and drinks. While it might be tempting to eat when you're hungry, try to focus on healthy, balanced meals if you can. But don’t restrict yourself too much. I don’t want you to get overly anxious about it. We'll get this sorted out. I’ll write you a lab requisition now. And I’ll have the receptionist schedule that follow-up appointment for you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's… reassuring to hear. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate this. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. I'll try to follow your advice, and I'll see you in three days. And if anything drastically changes in the meantime, should I contact you?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. If you experience any severe symptoms – excessive thirst that can’t be quenched, blurred vision, confusion, or any significant weakness – contact the clinic immediately. Don't hesitate. Otherwise, we'll discuss the results in three days. Here's the lab requisition. You can head to the lab now. It's just down the hall on your left. Have a good day, Christen.
PATIENT: Right. Excessive thirst, blurred vision… noted. I shall keep a close eye on things. Thank you again, Doctor Todoroivch. A good day to you as well. I do hope it isn't anything too disruptive. .
DOCTOR: We'll find out. Goodbye, Christen. .
