DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I… I believe I’m here for a check-up before a surgery? A cosmetic one. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, and the details are a little… fuzzy. I just know my doctor recommended I get cleared by someone before proceeding.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Brightful. A pre-operative assessment is quite standard. No need to worry about the details being fuzzy; we can certainly sort everything out. To begin, could you tell me what type of cosmetic surgery you are planning?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It… it has to do with my face, I think. Something about… lifting? And maybe… smoothing things out? I truly wish I could be more specific, but it was discussed quite some time ago, and I wasn’t feeling myself then, either. It was shortly after… well, never mind. It was a difficult period. Is that… is that enough to go on?
DOCTOR: That gives me a general idea. It sounds like you’re considering a facelift, possibly with additional procedures. To help me determine if you’re a suitable candidate for surgery and ensure your safety, I'd like to gather some more information. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Let me see… I don’t believe so. My late husband always handled the doctor’s appointments, and he kept excellent records. I know I was perfectly healthy at the time we… well, again, never mind. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly since then. I feel quite well, generally, though I do tire easily. And sometimes my hands tremble a little, but I always assumed that was just… nerves. I really couldn’t say definitively, Doctor. I apologize. Is there a way to check?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. That's why we're here. We can certainly check. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. I used to have a bit of a sensitivity to pollen as a child, but that cleared up years ago. I've never had any reactions to medications that I'm aware of. My husband always double-checked everything before I took anything, you see. It’s… it was just his way. I’m truly sorry, I know I’m not being very helpful. It’s just… difficult to remember these things.
DOCTOR: You are being perfectly helpful, Ms. Brightful. It's understandable to have gaps in your memory, especially with everything you've been through. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t believe in taking pills unless absolutely necessary, and… well, there hasn’t been a need, thankfully. I drink a lot of herbal tea – chamomile mostly, for calming. But that's hardly a medication, is it? I haven't taken anything prescribed by a doctor in… well, a very long time. I really wish I could recall more details for you.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. We'll continue to gather what we can. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your surgical history?
PATIENT: Surgical history… Oh dear. I don’t believe I’ve had any surgeries. At least, not that I recall. A tonsillectomy when I was a child, perhaps? But that was… ages ago. Nothing significant, certainly. Nothing since I’ve been an adult. No… I’m fairly certain I haven’t had any surgeries. Does that… does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Brightful. Now, a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if any of your close family members—parents, siblings, or grandparents—have had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a difficult one. My mother… she passed away when I was quite young, from… a heart ailment, I believe. And my father, he had diabetes, towards the end of his life. I don’t recall anything specific about my grandparents, I’m afraid. We weren’t very close, and it was… a long time ago. I’m sorry, Doctor. My memory is… so fragmented. I wish I could be of more assistance.
DOCTOR: You’re providing as much information as you can, Ms. Brightful, and that is perfectly adequate. Now, regarding your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. Never have, never will. My late husband… he smoked for a while, unfortunately, but I always detested it. I've always considered it terribly unhealthy. And I wouldn't dream of putting anything harmful into my body. It caused him so much trouble, in the end. So, no. I do not smoke.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally, Doctor. Very occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on a special occasion. But I wouldn’t say I drink regularly. Not at all. I find it doesn’t… agree with me, and I prefer herbal tea, as I mentioned before. It’s more soothing. Just a glass of wine now and then, that’s all.
DOCTOR: And finally, could you tell me a little about your general activity level?
PATIENT: Well… I wouldn’t say I’m terribly active, Doctor. I enjoy gardening, of course, which involves some physical exertion, but… Since my husband passed… I haven’t been doing much else, to be honest. I mostly stay around the house. It's rather difficult to motivate myself, sometimes. I used to enjoy long walks, but… I haven’t felt much like walking lately. I suppose you could say I’m rather sedentary.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Brightful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. This will help me to assess your overall health and determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I understand it's all part of the process. I’ll do my best to be still. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Very good. First, I’ll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated. I hear a faint murmur. It’s likely benign, but we may want to investigate further if it persists. Lungs are clear. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Please, take your time.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetrical. Throat is clear. Do you have any pain anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at the moment. Occasionally, my hands ache a little, especially in cold weather, but that's about it. And sometimes, I have a bit of stiffness in my neck, but I suspect that’s from sleeping in a bad position. Nothing truly concerning, I assure you. Just a little bit of discomfort now and then.
DOCTOR: I don't see any significant swelling or redness in your hands. Now, could you please sit up again?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is everything alright? You seem… thoughtful.
DOCTOR: Everything is alright, Ms. Brightful. I am just compiling my findings. Based on the brief examination, your overall health appears stable, but there are a few things I'd like to address before we can proceed with your surgery. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and I detected a faint murmur. It’s not necessarily cause for concern, but we need to investigate further. I recommend a few tests: an electrocardiogram to evaluate your heart rhythm, a complete blood count to assess your overall health, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it will ensure my safety, then absolutely. Please, do whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment completely. I just want to be sure I’m fit and healthy enough to go through with it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the orders for the lab tests now. The lab technician will draw blood, and we’ll need to schedule an ECG. It's a quick, non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of your heart. The results should be available within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with a healthy lifestyle: eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and managing your stress levels. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve explained everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience, and I’m relieved we’re getting everything checked out. Just… when do you think we’ll know whether or not I’m a good candidate for the surgery? I’m rather anxious to get started, but I understand it’s best to be cautious.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Once the lab results and ECG are back, I'll review them carefully. I anticipate having the results within 3-5 business days. I'll contact you as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We'll review the risks and benefits of surgery based on your individual health profile. If everything looks good, we can proceed with pre-operative preparations. If there are any concerns, we can discuss alternative options or further testing. Do you have any questions about scheduling the lab tests or the ECG?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe I’m alright. I trust your office will contact me with the details. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, and for putting my mind at ease. Well, I suppose that’s everything for today. Thank you again for your kindness. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. It was a pleasure meeting you. The staff will contact you shortly to schedule the tests. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
