DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you. Well, I suppose you could say I’m hoping for a little… revitalization. I’m getting on, you see, and things aren’t quite as peppy as they used to be. I just want to feel a bit more… like myself again, if you understand. A sort of jumpstart, perhaps?
DOCTOR: "Revitalization," right. And how long have you been feeling… less peppy, as you put it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's not sudden, you understand. It's been… gradual. Perhaps the last six months or so? It's hard to pinpoint, really. I still do things, of course. I volunteer at the school, I keep up with my garden… but I find myself more tired afterwards. And little things… remembering names, things like that. Nothing alarming, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Six months. Okay. And is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. Some days I feel quite alright, even energetic! Other days… well, getting out of bed feels like a chore. It’s not every day, certainly. It's just… unpredictable, you see? I used to have such a routine, but it’s become harder to maintain it lately. I apologize for rambling.
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s fine. Unpredictable fatigue is… helpful to know. Now, let's go through some basics. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my appetite hasn't been quite what it used to be. I don't exactly lack an appetite, but I don’t enjoy food as much as I once did. And… sometimes my joints ache a little, especially in the mornings. Nothing severe, just a bit of stiffness. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite and morning stiffness. Yes, those are relevant. Any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that at all, Doctor. Definitely no fever or chills. And I haven't been losing weight, if anything I think I’ve… gained a little. Just a bit around the middle, you understand. Old age, I suppose! No night sweats either. I sleep quite soundly, actually, though sometimes I wake up a little earlier than I’d like.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, night sweats, unexplained weight loss. Earlier awakenings. Alright. And do you have any trouble with your bowels?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Doctor, are you asking about… well, you know? I apologize, but those aren’t things one typically discusses so openly! I suppose… no, not particularly. They’re… regular enough. Sometimes a little slow, perhaps, but nothing concerning. Is that what you were asking? I hope I haven’t offended you.
DOCTOR: It's my job to ask, Ms. McNabb. Constipation is common, and relevant. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past illnesses or conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. Later in life… well, my gallbladder, years ago. They removed it, probably twenty years ago now. And I had a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it’s been quite mild and well-managed. No other major illnesses, thankfully. I’ve always been quite healthy, all things considered. I do have a touch of high blood pressure, though, and take a small pill for it. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, arthritis, hypertension. Yes, that matters. What medication do you take for your blood pressure, and how much?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... It's Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once a day, in the morning. My doctor, Dr. Reyes, prescribed it years ago. It seems to keep it under control, thankfully. He’s a lovely man, but he’s… rather busy, you see. That’s why I thought I’d come to you. Perhaps a fresh perspective?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, ten milligrams. Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've always been lucky in that regard. I used to help my mother in her garden, and we grew all sorts of things, and I never had a reaction to anything. Even shellfish, which some people are so sensitive to. No, no allergies at all, thankfully. Is that unusual? I hope I’m not forgetting something… my memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. We'll proceed. Now, have you had any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, just the gallbladder. And… oh! When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out, but that was ages ago, practically a lifetime! Does that count? It was so long ago, it hardly seems relevant now. Other than that… no, no other surgeries. I’ve always been careful, you see. Avoided anything too risky. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy. Right. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… Well, my husband, God rest his soul, passed away ten years ago. We didn't have any children, sadly. I have a sister, Maria, who lives in California. She’s quite healthy, as far as I know. She’s a bit younger than me. My parents… they’re both gone now, passed away many years ago. As for medical history… I believe my mother had some trouble with her heart later in life, but I'm not entirely sure of the details. It was a long time ago, and my sister doesn't discuss it much. Does that help? I apologize if I'm being vague.
DOCTOR: Husband deceased, no children. Sister healthy. Mother with heart issues. Alright. And finally, what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… well, I try to stay active, you see. I volunteer at the elementary school, reading to the children. And I love gardening, it’s my passion. I don't smoke, never have. And I only have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps once or twice a week. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables, but my appetite hasn’t been what it used to be, as I mentioned. I walk a bit, but not as much as I used to. My joints… they sometimes ache, you see. It’s a simple life, but it’s a good life. I used to be very involved in the community, but I've slowed down a bit in recent years.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. McNabb. I’ve got a reasonable picture now. It sounds like you've been experiencing a gradual decline in energy and appetite, accompanied by some joint stiffness and forgetfulness. Now, I'm going to perform a brief physical exam. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I’ll check your reflexes and range of motion. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment completely. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure is 138 over 76. Not terrible, but a bit elevated. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Range of motion is slightly limited in your knees and hips, with some mild discomfort. We'll need to rule out some common causes for these symptoms, including thyroid issues and vitamin deficiencies. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. We should have the results in a few days. I'd also like to check your B12 levels. I suggest you refrain from eating or drinking anything for the next 12 hours, as we might need to run further tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I'm happy to follow your instructions. A complete blood count, thyroid panel, vitamin D and B12 levels… it all sounds very thorough. Twelve hours of fasting… I suppose I can manage that. It's better to be safe, of course. Will these tests be painful? I'm not fond of needles, you see. And thank you for being so patient with me. I apologize if I ramble on too much.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will be a brief pinch, Ms. McNabb. Nothing significant. And no, you don’t ramble too much, but let's try to be concise. While we wait for the lab results, I suggest you continue your regular activities, but avoid any strenuous exercise. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please contact my office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. No strenuous exercise, and contact your office if I experience any new symptoms. Chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness… I will certainly be mindful of those. A brief pinch… I suppose I can endure that. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel a bit more reassured already, knowing we're taking steps to address this. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Perhaps some paperwork? Or should I just schedule a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: There is some paperwork, yes. Just standard consent forms and a medical history update. The results should be back in three to five business days. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they are available. Let's aim for next week. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. And Ms. McNabb, try to get some rest, and drink plenty of fluids. It’s a start.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will certainly fill out these forms to the best of my ability. And I will try to rest more and drink plenty of fluids. Just one question, if you don't mind… on this section about current medications, do I include the occasional glass of wine? It seems a rather silly question, I apologize. .
DOCTOR: No, Ms. McNabb, you do not need to include the occasional glass of wine. We're focusing on prescription medications and supplements. Please focus on completing the forms, and I’ll be with you in a moment.
