DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I'm Dr. Hembrey. Welcome to the clinic. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. It's about my stomach. Been bleedin' a bit, see? Not a pretty sight, I assure you. Thought I'd best get it checked before it gets...worse. It's been goin' on a few days now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Bleeding is certainly something we need to investigate promptly. "A few days now," you say. Can you describe the bleeding for me, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean describe it? It's blood, Doctor. Red blood. Comes outta... well, you know. Not a little trickle, either. More than a splash, let's put it that way. And it's makin' me feel weak, frankly. Like somethin's drainin' the life outta me, which... well, it kinda is, isn’t it? I don't need a lecture on the importance of hydration, by the way. I know my body.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I simply need a clearer picture of what's happening. When you say "comes out," are you referring to blood in your stool, or is it rectal bleeding specifically?
PATIENT: Rectal, alright? Definitely rectal. Look, I'm not one for bein' overly descriptive about... personal matters. Is that good enough? Stool's normal enough, as normal as it gets, I suppose. It's the other end that’s the problem. And it's not like I'm enjoyin' talkin' about it, you know? This whole thing's… undignified.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Gentz, rectal bleeding. Thank you for clarifying. And I assure you, this is a standard part of a medical evaluation. Now, has this bleeding been constant since it began, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, mostly. Worse after... well, after I use the bathroom. Though sometimes it just...happens. Not a predictable thing, at all. And it’s not like a fountain, Doctor, if that’s what you're thinkin’. Just enough to worry a man, see? Enough to stain things. And I don't appreciate stains. It’s… messy. Especially for someone who keeps a tidy house. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mr. Gentz. Intermittent bleeding, worse after bowel movements. Let's move on to some other questions. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits lately – diarrhea, constipation, or a change in the caliber of your stool?
PATIENT: Caliber? You’re askin’ about the size of my… Never you mind. Look, it's been…regular, mostly. A little harder than usual, maybe. Old age, I reckon. Though I'm not that old, despite what some folks say. And no diarrhea, thankfully. I value my privacy, Doctor. This whole thing is just...a nuisance, a very inconvenient nuisance. It's not like I've got time for this.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you noticed any abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or vomiting alongside this bleeding?
PATIENT: Pain, yeah, sometimes. A dull ache, mostly, low down. Not sharp, just…uncomfortable. Bloated, a bit, especially after I eat. And nauseous, now that you mention it. Not throwin' up, but feelin' queasy. Like somethin's just...off. It's all connected, isn't it? This whole mess. And frankly, Doctor, it's probably somethin' serious. I can feel it. You know, I had a feeling this was gonna happen. My father... well, never you mind. Bad genes, probably.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gentz. Given your symptoms – rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, nausea, and a change in bowel habits – a physical examination is necessary. I'll need to palpate your abdomen and, unfortunately, a rectal exam will also be required to assess the source of the bleeding. I know this is…unpleasant, but it’s crucial for an accurate diagnosis. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Really? Look, I’m a man of a certain age. I’ve been to doctors before, and I’ve never had to… endure that. Is there absolutely no other way? Can’t you just give me somethin' for it? Some pills, maybe? I don’t need you pokin’ around down there. It’s undignified, and frankly, I’m not comfortable with it. A waste of time, if you ask me. You’re a doctor, shouldn't you be able to tell what’s wrong just by lookin' at me? I’ve always prided myself on my constitution. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with all due respect, medicine is not about guesswork. I understand your discomfort, but a physical examination is a fundamental part of evaluating your condition. It’s not a matter of preference; it’s a matter of providing you with the best possible care. Without a proper examination, I cannot rule out serious conditions such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or, more concerningly, potential growths. I am obligated to conduct a thorough assessment, and I strongly advise you to allow me to proceed. Refusing a necessary examination could have serious consequences. Are you willing to reconsider?
PATIENT: Growths? You think I have… growths? That’s just wonderful. Just what I needed to hear. Fine. Fine, do your… examination. But I want you to be gentle, alright? And quick. I haven't got all day, you know. And I expect a full explanation afterward. None of this medical jargon, understand? Just plain English. And I want to know what caused this. Don’t tell me it’s just stress. It’s not stress. It’s…something else. Get on with it, then. But I’m warnin’ you, I'm a sensitive man.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gentz. I will proceed with the examination as quickly and gently as possible. Please lie on your left side with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I will explain each step as I go. And I assure you, I will do my best to provide a clear explanation of the findings afterward, using language you understand. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if you feel any pain.
