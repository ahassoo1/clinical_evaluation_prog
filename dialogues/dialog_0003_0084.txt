DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s try to be efficient, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Yackey. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Efficient is good. I’ve been… feeling a bit unwell, and I appreciate you seeing me.
DOCTOR: “A bit unwell” is rather vague, Ms. Kobler. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Sorry. It’s just… difficult to explain. I’m getting very breathless, even when I’m not doing much. And my mouth… it feels so dry, all the time. My eyes too, they’re scratchy. It’s been happening for… well, I’m not certain how long, truthfully. A while now.
DOCTOR: A while now… Right. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Hmm. Let me think. Not that I recall, no. My life is… rather simple. I divorced last year, and I’ve been focusing on my writing since then. I haven’t traveled anywhere new, haven’t started any new hobbies… I did redecorate the living room, but that was a few months ago. It shouldn’t matter, should it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, while I appreciate the details, we must focus on relevant information. The redecorating is unlikely to be contributing to your shortness of breath and dry mouth. When did you first notice these symptoms, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, my apologies, Doctor. You are quite right. It’s just… hard to remember things sometimes. Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, just a little tired feeling, and then the dryness. The breathlessness came later, I believe. It's all a bit… fuzzy. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Six months… vague, but alright. And are you experiencing any chest pain, palpitations, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. And my heart feels… normal, I think. No fluttering or anything like that. As for swelling… I haven’t really checked my ankles, truthfully. I’ll have to look when I get home. I mostly wear slippers, so I wouldn't notice easily.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I'll need to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your vital signs. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Yes, please do. I will try to relax. It’s a little difficult, with everything, but I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Kobler… and exhale slowly. Again… Good. Your respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and I detect some diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let me listen to your heart… Heart rate is regular, but a little fast. No murmurs detected. Blood pressure is… 130/80. Temperature is normal. I’m noting some dryness of the oral mucosa as well. Alright. We will need to run some tests.
PATIENT: Tests…? Oh. What sort of tests, Doctor? Is it… something serious? I confess, I am feeling a little anxious now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, it is far too early to speculate about the seriousness of anything. We need data. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. We should also get a chest X-ray to rule out any pulmonary issues. It’s standard procedure. The lab will draw blood now, and we will schedule the X-ray for this afternoon. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work and an X-ray. I suppose it’s better to know, even if it’s not good news. Will the lab tell me the results, or will you tell me? I confess, I sometimes struggle to understand medical… jargon.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, the lab will provide the results to my office, and I will interpret them and discuss them with you at a follow-up appointment. I will ensure I explain everything in a manner you can understand. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, allergies. That's important. I… I don't believe so, no. Nothing that I'm aware of. And medications… just a mild pain reliever occasionally, for a headache. Ibuprofen, I think. Nothing regularly. I try to avoid them if I can. Now that I think about it, my ex-husband used to give me something for allergies… years ago. But I haven't taken it in ages, and I don't recall the name. It wasn't anything serious, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen… Occasionally. Very well. And, Ms. Kobler, to be thorough, could you briefly outline your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Oh. What exactly do you need to know, Doctor? I… I don’t really have much of a social life. I mostly stay at home and write. I divorced last year, as I mentioned, so… I don’t have a partner. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps… a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. That's about it, really. It’s a very quiet life.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, I appreciate your candor, however brief. Now, let’s conclude this consultation. The lab work and X-ray will provide a clearer picture. I will contact you with the results, likely within 3 business days. If your symptoms worsen significantly – chest pain, severe shortness of breath, dizziness – please proceed to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any further questions before I excuse myself?
PATIENT: No, I… I don't think so. Three business days. And go to the emergency room if things worsen. I appreciate your time, Doctor Yackey. And your patience. It's just… difficult to explain things sometimes. I will wait for your call.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Kobler. .
