DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I’m Dr. Sink. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Sink, it's… confusing, really. My wife, she keeps saying I have these… episodes. Moments where I just… don't know where I am, or what I’m doing. It’s not all the time, thankfully. But it worries her, and frankly, it’s starting to worry me a little too. I always know eventually, but… it’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Episodes, right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? At first it was just forgetting where I put my tools – a normal thing for an old man, you know? But then it started being… bigger things. Like forgetting what day it was, or who I was talking to for a few seconds. My wife says I asked her who she was last week. I don’t recall that, but she swears on it. She has a very good memory, my wife. Better than mine, certainly.
DOCTOR: Six months. And are these… moments, as you call them, happening more frequently?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. At the start, it was maybe once a month, if that. Now? It feels like… every couple of weeks. Last week it happened twice. Once at the hardware store – couldn’t remember why I was even in there. Then again, the next day, trying to fix the fence. My wife had to remind me what I was doing, step by step. It’s… embarrassing, Doctor. I’ve always been a practical man. Good with my hands. I shouldn’t be forgetting things like this.
DOCTOR: Practical, you say. And do you experience any other symptoms with these episodes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… sometimes I feel a little… unsteady on my feet right before it happens. Like I’m going to fall, but I haven't yet. And I get… a bit flustered, I suppose. Like my mind is searching for something, but I don't know what. No pain, no headaches, nothing like that. Just… lost. And then, eventually, it comes back to me. Though sometimes it takes a bit longer than it used to. Is that… normal, Doctor? I always pride myself on being sharp, you see. I used to be able to quote prices and measurements off the top of my head. Now… well.
DOCTOR: Unsteady…flustered. Alright. Any history of falls?
PATIENT: No, no falls. Never had a bad fall, thankfully. A few scrapes here and there over the years, working with stone and tile, naturally. But nothing serious. I’m pretty careful, you see. Always have been. I’ve always said a good tradesman respects his tools and his body. I've got good balance, usually. That’s why this is so worrying. It’s not like I’m tripping over things. It just… comes over me. Like a fog. A mental fog, Doctor. A very inconvenient mental fog. Do you… do you think it’s something serious? My wife keeps talking about her Auntie who… well, it’s not a pleasant story.
DOCTOR: We’ll get to the bottom of it. Before we jump to conclusions, let’s go through some basics. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I take something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called? Small dose, doctor said it was just to keep things in check. And then, occasionally, I take ibuprofen for my knees. They ache a bit after a long day. But that’s it, really. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Always preferred a good strong tea for what ails you, but my wife insists. She worries about everything. A good woman, my wife. Very insistent. Are you familiar with Lisinopril, Doctor? I’ve been taking it for… oh, five years, maybe?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, yes. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty robust, you see. My wife says I'm like an ox. Though maybe the ox is getting a bit old now. I used to be able to eat anything, drink anything, work in any weather. But you get older, things change, don’t they? It’s just… this confusion is different. It’s not like a sore back or a bad knee. It’s… unsettling. Are you writing all this down, Doctor? Just to be sure? My wife would want me to be thorough. She’s very organised, my wife. Very, very organised.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting everything, Mr. Lason. Now, have there been any significant changes in your life recently?
PATIENT: Significant changes… hmm. Not really. My grandson started university last year, that was nice. Proud moment, that. And… well, my wife and I celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary last month. A small gathering, just family. Nothing major. We haven’t traveled anywhere. Haven’t taken on any new projects. Just… the usual routine, really. Work, eat, sleep. A bit of gardening. We’ve lived in the same house for thirty years. Very settled, you see. Perhaps too settled. Could that be it, Doctor? Being too comfortable? I always said a man needs a challenge. But I’m sixty-six years old, what challenges are left for a tile setter?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now. Just to check your reflexes and coordination. Please follow my instructions. First, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can stand. Not as spry as I used to be, but I can manage. Just give me a moment. My knees… they complain a bit in the mornings. Though they shouldn’t affect my coordination, I wouldn't think. I’ve always had good balance. I used to walk along the top of scaffolding without a second thought. Though that was thirty years ago, of course. I’m not a young man anymore. Still, I can stand perfectly well. Just be careful, Doctor. I don't want to fall and cause you any trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Let's try a simple Romberg test. Please stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes. Try to maintain your balance for about 30 seconds. I'll be right here if you need me.
PATIENT: Feet together…arms at my sides… closing my eyes… Oh dear. This is… not ideal. I don’t feel quite right. A bit wobbly, actually. It’s not usually like this. I’ve always been steady on my feet. I used to be able to stand on one leg for a good minute, no problem. Doctor? Perhaps I should sit down… I feel… a bit disoriented. This is… unsettling. Are you sure this is necessary, Doctor? I’m starting to feel… quite strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason, please sit down. That was… informative. I noticed some instability. And you reported feeling disoriented. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please extend your arms. A little slow, but present. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can follow your finger. Though it’s… a bit difficult. My eyes… they feel a bit tired, actually. And everything seems a little… blurry. Not terribly blurry, but not as sharp as usual. Are you seeing something wrong, Doctor? I always had excellent eyesight. Could be the lighting in here, perhaps? It’s rather… dim, isn't it? My wife always said I needed more light when I’m working on detailed tile work. She's always right about these things. Are you sure everything is alright, Doctor? This is… concerning. I’m not usually like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I'm going to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your head. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but these tests will give us a clearer picture. We need to investigate possible causes, including vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and neurological problems. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a CT scan? A scan of my head? Oh dear. That sounds… serious, Doctor. What are you looking for, exactly? Is it… is it something bad? Neurological problems? That’s what my wife’s Auntie had, wasn’t it? She… well, she wasn’t herself at the end. I understand you need to investigate, of course, but… this is very worrying. Are you sure these tests are necessary? Perhaps it’s just… stress? I’ve been working long hours lately. Or maybe it is just old age catching up with me. Though I always thought I’d be sharper for longer. I… I don't understand all this talk of deficiencies and issues. Can you explain it to me in simpler terms, Doctor? Please? My wife is going to be very upset about this. Very upset indeed.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your concern. It’s always unsettling when we don’t know what’s going on. The tests are simply to rule things out. A lot of different things can cause these symptoms, and we need to be thorough. The blood tests will check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other common issues. The CT scan will give us a picture of your brain to make sure there are no structural problems. It does not necessarily mean anything is wrong. Think of it as gathering information. I’m going to schedule these tests for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid driving and strenuous activity. I'll also give you a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I think so. Gather information. A neurologist… Oh dear. My wife is going to insist on getting a second, and a third, and a fourth opinion. She’s like that. Very thorough, my wife. But… it sounds… serious. I still think it might be stress. Or just old age. But… if you think these tests are necessary, I suppose I should do them. When will I hear back about the results, Doctor? Will you call me personally? My wife is… she's very anxious. She’ll be calling you every hour, I guarantee it. And… will the CT scan hurt? I’ve never had one before. Is it… dangerous? Perhaps I should call my grandson, he’s studying to be a doctor. He might be able to explain it all. Oh dear, this is all very overwhelming. I think I need a glass of water.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I’ll have the nurse bring you a glass of water. The nurse will also explain the CT scan procedure in detail. It’s a painless procedure, and quite safe. The results will take a few days to come back, and my office will contact you as soon as they’re available. We’ll discuss them thoroughly at that time. And I understand your wife’s concern. Now, do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… no, I don't think so. Just… please hurry. And… tell the nurse to explain everything very clearly. My wife will want to know all the details. Every single detail. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for… trying. I just… I just want to get to the bottom of this. And get my life back. I suppose… I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse. A neurologist… Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll have the nurse in shortly. .
