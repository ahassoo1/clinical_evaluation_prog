DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudeney, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. It’s not that high, is it? My husband keeps telling me to come, but he worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good you’re here, even if it’s just to check things out. Your husband sounds like a caring man. Now, “not that high” is relative, right?
PATIENT: Relative to what? I feel fine. I work hard, I'm on my feet all day doing surveys for road projects. It’s a physical job, you know? Not sitting around like… some people. I eat okay, mostly. My husband tries to get me to eat more… greens. But really, I just need to get this over with so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Right, a physically demanding job. That's good. And it is good you're proactive about your health, even if you don't feel symptoms. Symptoms aren't always present with high blood pressure, that’s the frustrating part. Now, let’s get some specifics. When was the first time someone told you your blood pressure was elevated?
PATIENT: Elevated? I don't remember exactly. The nurse at the school, maybe? When my son was little, for his check-ups. Then again at the quick clinic when I twisted my ankle last year. It was always just a number, never a big deal. Honestly, I don’t keep track of those things. It’s just… numbers.
DOCTOR: Okay, the school nurse documented a slightly elevated reading about five years ago, and the quick clinic noted 142/92 when you came in for your ankle. That is a little high, Ms. Dudeney. Do you know your family history with blood pressure or heart problems?
PATIENT: Family history? Not really. My grandma lived to be old, and she was always eating fried bread. My dad… he smoked a lot, but he died in a truck accident. So, nothing really from high blood pressure, if that’s what you're asking. I don't see the point of dwelling on things that already happened.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember. And ibuprofen when my back hurts from work. That’s it. My husband keeps trying to get me to try some herbal tea, something he got from a friend, but I haven’t bothered. It smells weird. I don't like wasting money on things that won’t actually help.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medications. Good. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again to confirm what the nurse found. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have a survey site I need to be at this afternoon. Don't take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Another one, if you would. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular, but a little… strong. Now let’s check your blood pressure. Hmm. 152/98. Still elevated, and a little higher than what the nurse recorded. Pulse is 78 and regular. I'm also going to listen to your abdomen and check your reflexes. Everything seems normal there. Now, a quick look in your ears... Ears are clear as well.
PATIENT: See? Everything’s fine. I told you. It’s just a little high. Everyone gets stressed sometimes. This whole thing is a waste of my time. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, while you feel fine, consistently elevated blood pressure is not something to dismiss. It can lead to serious problems down the road – heart attack, stroke, kidney problems… I understand you're busy, but this isn't about wasting your time; it's about preventative care. 152/98 is considered Stage 1 hypertension, and it needs to be addressed. It’s not just a number. Now, I want to order some basic blood work, a lipid panel and a comprehensive metabolic panel, to get a better picture of your overall health. And, I'd also like to discuss some lifestyle modifications and potentially a low-dose medication to help control your blood pressure. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Medication? Absolutely not. I don't want to be on pills. Lifestyle modifications… fine. I guess. What does that even mean? I already work hard. More greens and less salt? That’s what you’re going to tell me? Look, I'm a practical person. I don’t have time for a bunch of complicated diet changes. And I’m definitely not taking any medication. I'll just… try to relax more. Is that good enough? Honestly, I think you're overreacting. I just want the paperwork for the blood work so I can get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, I understand your hesitation about medication, and we can certainly discuss lifestyle changes first. But ignoring elevated blood pressure isn't a practical solution. It is a serious health risk, and simply “trying to relax more” often isn’t enough. We need a more concrete plan. And, with all due respect, that's why you came to see a doctor. Now, about those lifestyle changes – it's not just about "more greens and less salt," although that's a good start. It’s about a balanced diet, regular exercise, managing stress, and limiting alcohol and caffeine intake. And, if those measures aren’t enough, we may need to revisit the discussion about medication. I’m concerned about your health, Ms. Dudeney, and I want to work with you to find a solution that’s best for you. But I need your cooperation. Will you commit to making some changes and following up with me in a month to see how things are progressing?
