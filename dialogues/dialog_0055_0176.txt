DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. My name is Dr. Eaddy. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re still going. It's been over 48 hours, definitely. It's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, you say. And they've been persistent for over 48 hours. Hmm. While typically benign, hiccups lasting that long warrant some investigation. To begin, could you describe them?
PATIENT: Describe them? Oh. Okay. Well, they’re…normal hiccups, I guess? You know, that little jerk in your chest, then you gulp air and hic…there they are. Not painful, just…annoying. And they happen pretty randomly. I tried drinking water really fast like my mother always told me, but that didn't help. I’ve also tried holding my breath, but no luck there either. They just keep coming. Sometimes they're close together, sometimes a few minutes apart. It’s really irregular.
DOCTOR: Irregular, occurring spontaneously... and you've already attempted the standard remedies – drinking water quickly, breath-holding. Good. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Hmm… a trigger. That’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, to be honest. I was at a work event on Saturday, a sort of team-building thing, mostly just chatting and eating. That's when they started, but I wasn’t doing anything out of the ordinary. I had a glass of sparkling water, maybe that? But I drink that sometimes and it doesn’t bother me. I really can’t put my finger on it. It just…started. It's so strange.
DOCTOR: I see. No identifiable trigger, onset at a work event…and you've had sparkling water before without issue. Let's move on to some general questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, no, not really. I’ve just been a little tired, but that's probably just because I haven’t been sleeping well with the hiccups, you know? Keeps waking me up. No fever, no pain anywhere else, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. Just…the hiccups. And the tiredness. Is that…normal with hiccups this long?
DOCTOR: Fatigue secondary to interrupted sleep is certainly plausible. We’ll factor that in. Now, regarding your medical history… do you have any pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Nothing major, really. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that’s it. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I do get a little bit of heartburn sometimes, but I manage it with over-the-counter antacids. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in a while, to be honest. Just for checkups, nothing serious. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: It's always advisable to maintain regular checkups, but we'll proceed. You mentioned gallbladder removal ten years ago and occasional heartburn. Any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think... My mother had high blood pressure, and she had arthritis in her knees when she got older. My father, he… he had a stroke a few years back, unfortunately. And my brother, he has asthma. That’s about it, as far as I know. We weren’t a family that talked about health a lot. I really can’t remember much else. Does any of that…matter? With the hiccups, I mean.
DOCTOR: Thank you. We’ll document that. Family history of hypertension, stroke, and asthma… noted. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you please tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just the antacids, like I said. Tums, mostly. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a little bit of melatonin. Just a small dose, though, like 3mg. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I don’t really like them. Is that enough information? Should I tell you which antacids exactly?
DOCTOR: No, specifying the exact antacid isn't necessary at this time. Melatonin, as needed. Alright. I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're amenable. Primarily, I'll be listening to your heart and lungs, and palpating your abdomen. Just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds…fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I’m a little sensitive around my stomach, if you’re pressing. Just…be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Redeye… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Hmm... A little bit, maybe. Just on the left side, under my ribs. It’s not painful pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, if you press on it. It’s been like that on and off for a while, actually. Before the hiccups, too. I just thought it was indigestion, usually. But yes, definitely a little tender there. Should I tell you if it gets more painful?
DOCTOR: Dull ache, left subcostal area, pre-existing. Noted. Please do alert me to any increase in pain. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and motor strength. Everything appears normal. However, given the prolonged nature of your hiccups and the tenderness you describe, I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. These will help rule out any underlying electrolyte imbalances or other abnormalities. Also, I’d like to order a chest x-ray, simply to get a better view of your lungs and rule out any structural issues. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot of tests. But if you think it’s necessary, yes, that’s fine. I just… I really don’t like going to the doctor. But I want these hiccups to stop. So, whatever you need to do. Chest x-ray… that doesn't involve any radiation, does it? I always worry about that. And will I get the results quickly? I'm a bit anxious about all this.
DOCTOR: A chest x-ray does involve a small amount of radiation, Ms. Redeye, but it's a negligible amount and the benefits of ruling out a potential underlying cause outweigh the risks. We will, of course, minimize your exposure. The lab work and x-ray should be processed within 24 to 48 hours. I will contact you with the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, try to remain calm. These tests are simply a precautionary measure. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood now, and then we can schedule the x-ray for later today. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… alright. If you say it’s just a precaution. 24 to 48 hours… I suppose that’s reasonable. I just… I'm not a fan of needles either. But okay. Let's get the blood drawn, then. The sooner we know something, the better. Thank you, Doctor. I really hope it’s nothing serious. And thank you for explaining everything, even if it's a little scary.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll have the technician come in momentarily. Hopefully, we will have some answers for you soon. In the meantime, please rest and hydrate. And I'll see you again when the results are in.
