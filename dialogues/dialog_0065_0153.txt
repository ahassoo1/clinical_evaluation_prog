DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um... right. The... performance thing. They need me to get checked out, I guess. For a show. It's… a physical, they said. Honestly, I don't remember much about why exactly. Lots of standing, I think. Is that what this is for?
DOCTOR: A performance, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. I work at the theater. Mostly ushering, taking tickets… sometimes helping people find their seats. It keeps me moving, you know? Though, honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I'm not sure which performance they specifically need the clearance for. There’s been a few lately.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll need to establish a baseline, regardless. So, let's start with your current symptoms. Are you experiencing any pain, shortness of breath, dizziness… anything at all that’s been bothering you lately, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… pain… not really. My feet get a bit sore after a long shift, standing all day. But that’s… normal, isn’t it? Shortness of breath… no, not really. Sometimes I feel a little… lightheaded, maybe? But that happens rarely. I mostly just get… tired, I suppose. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Tiredness can be caused by many things. Let’s try to be more specific. When do you feel the most tired?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s… worst at the end of the day, naturally. After work. But… sometimes even in the afternoons, I feel a bit sluggish. It's hard to explain. Not like… sick tired. Just… worn out. Like I've been walking a long distance. Even when I haven't.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been a recent development, or has this been ongoing for some time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It’s… gradual, I think. It didn't just start suddenly. Probably… the last few months? Maybe longer. It's… hard to pinpoint. Things just sort of… fade, you know? My memory… it's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we're here to assess that. Now, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… I… don’t think so. I had a bad cold a few years back, but nothing serious. And… I think my blood pressure was a little high once, at the dentist, but they didn’t say anything about it needing treatment. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been pretty healthy. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A long, long time ago. And… I think I had a small mole removed from my back, maybe ten years ago? It was tiny. Nothing major, I assure you. It didn’t even hurt much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That’s… complicated. My mother lived to be a very old age, very healthy. My father… he had some heart trouble, I think. But I don’t remember much about it. It was a long time ago, and we weren’t very close. Honestly, I don't have a lot of information about their medical history. We didn’t talk about such things much.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social… Well, I’m divorced. Been divorced for… many years. I don’t really have a lot of… social life, these days. Mostly just work, and… a little bit of television. I don’t drink or smoke, if that matters. I used to enjoy walking, but… my knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. Maybe… a little bit of trouble with shellfish, once, but it wasn't serious. Just a slight stomach upset. It was a long time ago, and I’ve eaten it since without any problems. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Just… a little bit of vitamin D, in the winter. My doctor recommended it, years ago. And sometimes I take an over-the-counter pain reliever for my feet, after a long shift. Just ibuprofen, nothing fancy. That’s it, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Please step onto the scale. And then we'll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A physical exam, yes. Good, good. I suppose that’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 142 over 90. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds. Your weight is quite low, Mr. Krahn. And your blood pressure is a bit elevated. Are you eating enough?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Is it? Well, I haven’t been feeling very hungry lately. Work keeps me busy, you know? I just… don't think about it much. Is that… bad? And my weight… it's always been a little low. I've never been a big eater.
DOCTOR: It’s concerning, Mr. Krahn. We'll need to investigate this further. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your weight loss and fatigue.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work… Is it… serious? I mean, is something terribly wrong? I just want to be able to keep working, you know? I enjoy my job.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean something is terribly wrong, Mr. Krahn. It’s a precautionary measure. We need to gather more information to determine the cause of your symptoms. We’ll check your basic organ function, your thyroid levels… things that could explain your fatigue and weight loss. It's a standard procedure. I'll also want a urinalysis. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll need a sample of your blood and urine. Do you have any difficulties with giving a urine sample?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no difficulties. I can manage a urine sample. It’s just… all this. It’s a bit overwhelming, isn’t it? I just came in for a performance clearance, and now… blood work, urinalysis… I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a shift tomorrow.
DOCTOR: It will take some time to get the results back. I'll have the lab fax them to me as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend trying to eat more regularly, even if you don't feel hungry. Small, frequent meals are best. And stay hydrated. We'll discuss the results when they come back and decide on a course of action. For now, the priority is to rule out anything serious. I’m also referring you to a registered dietitian. They can help you develop a meal plan that meets your nutritional needs. Here’s the referral information. Please schedule an appointment with them as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… a dietitian. That’s… a lot. I suppose not, not right now. Just… when should I expect to hear back about the blood work? And will it interfere with my shift tomorrow? I really need to be at work.
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes 24-48 hours to process the results. I will call you as soon as they are available. The blood work itself shouldn’t interfere with your shift tomorrow, as long as you stay hydrated. However, I strongly advise you to avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results back, given your low weight and fatigue. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes. I understand. No strenuous activity. Stay hydrated. Blood work results in 24-48 hours. Well… thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing serious. I just want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: We’ll find out, Mr. Krahn. Have a good day. The nurse will escort you out.
PATIENT: .
