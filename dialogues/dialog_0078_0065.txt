DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m…concerned about my weight. It’s been increasing, and I haven’t changed anything in my diet or exercise routine. It’s quite unsettling, actually.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're addressing this now. Weight changes can be concerning, and it's wise to investigate. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about how long you’ve noticed this weight gain, and approximately how much weight we’re talking about?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. It’s been…perhaps four or five months now. It wasn’t sudden, more gradual. And…approximately? Oh dear. I suppose…around fifteen pounds, maybe a little more. It’s difficult to say exactly, I don’t weigh myself religiously. But enough that my clothes feel…snug. It's rather bothersome, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, about fifteen pounds over four to five months. That is a noticeable change. And you haven't made any changes to your diet or exercise habits during that time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I work as an orderly at the hospital, so I’m on my feet quite a bit throughout the day. And my husband and I…we eat pretty much the same things we always have. Mostly home-cooked meals. Nothing extravagant, you understand. Mostly potatoes, vegetables, some meat…typical Lithuanian fare, really. It’s very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Being on your feet at work is good activity. Let’s talk a little more about your overall health. Have you noticed any other changes along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Well…now that you mention it…I have been feeling rather tired lately. More so than usual. And…my skin seems drier, even though it’s summer. I’ve been using more lotion, certainly. And…oh dear, this is probably nothing, but I’ve been feeling a little colder than usual, even when it’s warm. Is that…relevant, Doctor? I worry I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Ms. Selbitschka. These details are very important. Fatigue, dry skin, and feeling cold – those could all be connected. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, or your appetite?
PATIENT: My appetite…no, not really. I eat about the same amount as always. Perhaps a little less lately, now that I think about it. But nothing drastic. And…my bowel habits…well, they’ve been a little…irregular, perhaps. More constipated than usual. I thought it was just the change in the weather, but…it’s been going on for a while now. I apologize for being so…vague, Doctor. It's hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all. This is all very helpful information. It sounds like we have a few things to explore. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing significant. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps…but nothing serious. I had a rather difficult pregnancy with my son, but I recovered fully. No surgeries, no chronic illnesses…I’m generally a very healthy person, which is why this is so perplexing! I haven’t even been to the doctor in years, except for routine check-ups.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No significant past medical history, difficult pregnancy but full recovery, and generally healthy. What about your family?
PATIENT: That’s a bit…complicated, Doctor. My mother had some issues with her…thyroid, I believe. She was always very tired and gained a lot of weight later in life. And my father…he had heart trouble. But that was much later in his life as well. I don’t know all the specifics, truthfully. We weren’t very close. I mostly grew up with my grandmother, and she was very healthy, very active. It’s hard to say what’s relevant, and what isn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of thyroid issues and fatigue, paternal history of heart trouble later in life. That's helpful to know. We'll keep those in mind. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor! Absolutely not. I don’t touch a drop of alcohol, and I certainly don’t smoke or…well, you understand. I’m a very sensible woman. My husband occasionally has a beer with dinner, but that’s the extent of it. I believe in a healthy lifestyle. That’s why this whole situation is so unsettling!
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear, Ms. Selbitschka. And it's perfectly reasonable to be unsettled by unexplained changes. Alright, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and weight – and then listen to your heart and lungs. I’d also like to feel your thyroid gland. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I want to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better. I do have an appointment later this afternoon, so if we could be efficient…I would be very grateful.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let me palpate your thyroid gland. Hmm. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but it's not markedly so, and I don’t feel any distinct nodules. Skin feels dry to the touch. Your reflexes are normal. I will also check your legs for edema. No edema. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, I'm suspecting we should investigate a potential thyroid issue further. While this doesn’t give us a definitive diagnosis, it warrants further testing. We’ll need to draw some blood to check your thyroid hormone levels – TSH, T4, and T3 – to see how your thyroid is functioning. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds…sensible. Blood tests are perfectly alright. I would like that very much. The sooner we have some answers, the better. Will it take long to get the results? And…what if it is my thyroid? What are the options? I apologize for being so anxious, but this is all rather frightening.
DOCTOR: You’re not being anxious at all, Ms. Selbitschka. It's perfectly natural to be concerned when you're experiencing unexplained symptoms. The blood tests usually take a couple of days to come back, typically 2-3 business days. As for what if it is your thyroid, it depends on the results. If it's hypothyroidism – meaning your thyroid is underactive – the treatment is usually a daily thyroid hormone replacement medication. It’s very safe and effective, and most people feel much better once they start treatment. We can discuss all the options in detail once we have the results. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend you continue to monitor your symptoms, and try to maintain a healthy diet and get enough rest. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as the results are available to discuss them. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Two to three business days…I can manage that. And a medication…well, if that’s all it takes to feel better, I would be eternally grateful. I will continue to monitor my symptoms, and try to rest as much as possible. Thank you, Doctor Solero. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kindness. I’m ready for the blood tests whenever you are. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any foods to avoid, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. As for anything else, there’s no need to make any significant dietary changes at this time. Just continue to eat a balanced diet, and stay hydrated. I would advise against self-treating with any supplements, as they can sometimes interfere with thyroid function. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood. They’ll be very gentle. After the blood draw, you can go home and rest. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. I'll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you, pending the results. Does that all sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfect. I will avoid any supplements, and I will call if anything changes. Thank you again for your time and your attention. I appreciate your kindness. I will see the nurse now. .
