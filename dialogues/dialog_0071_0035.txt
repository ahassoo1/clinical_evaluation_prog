DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sucich. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. They just won’t stop. Been going on for… oh, goodness, I’d say about three days now. It’s a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Three days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. And they come and go, you know? Not constantly, thankfully. But they’re quite strong when they do come. It feels like… well, like someone’s giving my insides a little jolt. Not painful, just… startling.
DOCTOR: Right, startling. Okay. And has anything in particular seemed to bring them on, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t think so, not that I’ve noticed. I was gardening on Monday, but I’ve been gardening for years and never had this problem before. I had a fizzy drink – a lemon soda – on Tuesday, but again, I have those sometimes. Honestly, Doctor, they just started.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no obvious triggers. And you mentioned gardening and a lemon soda... have you had any other changes in your diet or routine lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, my grandson, little Timoteo, came to visit last week. We had a bit of a feast, I suppose. Lots of good food, maybe a little too much, now that I think about it. And I tried a new recipe for cassava cake – used a different kind of coconut milk. Could it be that? I haven’t made cassava cake in ages, so I wouldn’t know if it’s usual for it to… affect me this way.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Mrs. Sucich. Different foods can certainly sometimes cause unexpected reactions. And a change in diet is a good thing to consider. Now, besides the hiccups, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. Just the hiccups. No heartburn, no nausea, no bloating… nothing else at all. I'm still eating normally, sleeping alright, feeling… well, feeling pretty much my usual self, except for this annoying little… hic! …interruption. See? There it is again.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think. I take a little something for my arthritis, just to keep things moving, you know? It’s called… let me see… Celecoxib, that’s it. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was a bit low last year. As for allergies… well, nothing I’m aware of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. No bee stings, no rashes… just the usual little sniffles when the pollen is bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Celecoxib and vitamin D. Good to know. Now, and this is just a routine question, Mrs. Sucich, do you have any family history of any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Family history… My mother, she had high blood pressure, towards the end. And my brother, he had… something with his heart, I think. Not sure exactly what. He lived in Suva, you see, and I didn't see him very often. It was a long time ago. My father was as strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. And my grandmother… well, she lived to be ninety-five, so I suppose she was pretty healthy too. It’s all a bit fuzzy, I’m afraid. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. High blood pressure in your mother and something with your brother’s heart are good things to know. Now, Mrs. Sucich, I’m going to just listen to your heart and lungs, and maybe take a quick look in your ears, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you need. It’s good to be thorough, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a nice, deep breath for me... and again... Good. Lungs sound clear. Heart rate is regular, but a little fast. Ears look clear as well. No sign of infection. Now, one quick thing… can you just open and close your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you go. Is everything alright? You seem to be concentrating quite hard. I hope I don’t have anything strange going on in there!
DOCTOR: Everything looks normal, Mrs. Sucich. Your throat is clear. Now, this is a bit unusual, but sometimes hiccups can be caused by something irritating the phrenic nerve, which controls your diaphragm. It could be something as simple as a bit of gas, or, less commonly, something more serious. Given your age and the fact that they've been going on for three days, I'd like to order a chest X-ray, just to rule out anything concerning. And perhaps a blood test to check your electrolytes and rule out any underlying issues. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A chest X-ray and a blood test? Well, if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. I haven’t had an X-ray in… oh, goodness, decades, I expect. Will it be uncomfortable? And the blood test… I’m not terribly fond of needles, you see. But I'll do whatever you think is necessary.
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray won’t be uncomfortable at all, Mrs. Sucich. You’ll just stand still for a moment while the machine takes a picture. As for the blood test, it will be a quick pinch, and then it’s over. We’ll get the results back within a day or two. In the meantime, try sipping some water slowly. Sometimes that can help. And avoid fizzy drinks for a while, just in case. We’ll get this sorted out, don’t worry. Now, I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood, and schedule you for the X-ray. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you. I feel much better knowing you’re taking it seriously. And yes, please, have the nurse come in when she’s ready. I’ll try the water and definitely steer clear of the lemon soda. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness.
