DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I want to… how you say… find out more about where my family come from. Long, long time ago. I hear you can do a test for that now, with spit?
DOCTOR: A test…for your ancestry?
PATIENT: Yeah, ancestry. My daughter, she told me. She said it's with DNA. I make small boats, you know? Wood boats. But I don’t know about… DNA. It's to see where my people, my ancestors, they lived before, right? From the islands?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I am a family medicine doctor, Mr. Scobie. I treat illnesses and manage your health today. While I understand your curiosity about your heritage, ancestry testing isn’t really within my scope of practice. It's not a medical concern. It’s more…genealogical. Do you have any health problems you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I see. Not a health thing. My daughter, she made it sound so easy. I just want to know… where we really come from. Before Marshall Islands. Is that… impossible here? No big problems with health, really. Just old. Everything hurts a little.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Scobie, I appreciate your…interest. But I specialize in treating medical conditions, not fulfilling genealogical curiosities. Perhaps you should consult a genealogist, or look into resources online. There are many companies that offer DNA testing for ancestry. But as far as my practice is concerned, we focus on your well-being now. Do you have any other concerns, something related to your health?
PATIENT: Oh. Online, you say? I don't… I don't have a computer. My daughter helps with things like that. Maybe I ask her. No… no health things right now. Just… always tired. Old tired, you know? That’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Maybe I bother my daughter about the test.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, fatigue is common with age. We can certainly talk about that. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Just… always this tired. Been like this a long time. Not getting worse, not getting better. Just… slow. Like a turtle. I make good turtles too, you know? Wood turtles. Very strong. But me… not so strong anymore.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, “tired” can mean many things. It could be due to a number of factors - diet, activity level, even just getting older. We need to rule out any underlying medical causes. Have you had a recent blood test?
PATIENT: Blood test? I think… a long time ago. When I was sick with the flu, maybe? Doctor on the islands, he poked my arm. But I don't remember… not recently. Everything is blurry now, you know? Old man things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it seems we'll need to do some baseline tests to check your overall health and rule out any potential deficiencies causing your fatigue. I’ll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. These will give us a good starting point. We'll also check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… good. If you think it's good. I trust you, Doctor. Just want to feel… not so slow. Blood… okay. And you check my heart? It still beats, you know. Sometimes a little fast, sometimes a little slow. Like the ocean.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that’s what I’m here for, Mr. Scobie. To check. If you could just take a seat back there, and I’ll be with you in a moment to take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Nurse will come get you for the blood draw after that.
PATIENT: Okay. I’ll sit. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it finds out why I'm so slow. Like a turtle… a very old turtle. .
DOCTOR: We’ll see what the tests show. .
