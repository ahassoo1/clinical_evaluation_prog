DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks. They’ve been botherin’ me again. A lot of botherin’, actually. It's happened before, you see. Several times. I just… want it to stop botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Bothering” – can you tell me a bit more about what's happening with your waterworks?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain. It burns, when I… go. And I feel like I need to go all the time, even when I just have. It's very…uncomfortable. I don't know why it keeps happenin’. It's not like I'm doin' anything different. It just…starts. And it’s quite painful, sometimes. It’s been going on for…well, a while now, off and on. I really don't remember exactly when it started this time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so burning with urination and a frequent urge to go, even after you've just been. And you said it’s happened before, off and on. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go with the urge to urinate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… constant is… no. Not constant. It’s more… when I need to go, then it hurts. And for a little bit after. It doesn't hurt when I'm… not tryin’ to go, if that makes sense. It's a sharp pain, not a dull ache. Though sometimes… after it's over… it feels a bit sore, down there. I don’t know…it’s all a bit muddled, to be honest. I’m not very good at rememberin’ these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Wease. You're doing just fine. A sharp pain with urination, and then some soreness afterward. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit tired, lately. More tired than usual. But I’m sixty-six, so… that could just be old age! I haven't had a fever, I don't think. And… no, nothing else comes to mind. Oh! Sometimes my back aches, but I have a bad back anyway, from all the bendin’ over fixin’ those RVs. Does that count? I really don't know what would count.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know everything, Ms. Wease, so thank you for sharing. Fatigue, and some back pain which you already manage. We'll certainly keep that in mind. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a long story. I haven't been to the doctor much over the years. I'm a Recreational Vehicle Service Technician, you see, and I'm usually too busy fixin’ things to be sick. I had my tonsils out when I was a child. And… I broke my arm once, fallin' off a ladder. And… Honestly, Doctor, I don’t remember much else. I've never been seriously ill. Not that I recall, anyway. I don’t take any regular medicines. I had a husband, once, but we’re divorced now. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Wease. We don’t need a full life story, just any significant medical issues. So, tonsils out as a child, a broken arm, and no regular medications. That’s very helpful. Now, have any close family members – parents, siblings – had any health problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That was a long time ago. My mother… she had a bad heart, I think. She was always tired. And my father… he smoked a lot. He had…coughin’ problems. And my sister… she was always healthy, as far as I know. I didn't see them much after I left home, though. It was a long time ago. I’m not very good at rememberin’ family things. I really don't know much about their health. I apologize. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wease. You’ve told me what you remember, and that's what’s important. Now, just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me see. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don’t much care for liver, but that’s a choice, not an allergy! I’ve never had a problem with bee stings or anything like that. No, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. None at all. I'm quite lucky, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, Ms. Wease, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven't had a drink in… well, a very long time. Not since my husband… never mind. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’m a respectable woman, Doctor. I spend my days fixin’ RVs, not… that. I drink plenty of water, though. Especially when my waterworks are botherin’ me. I just want to get this sorted, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Wease. That’s very helpful to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a rather personal question, isn't it? Well, they're… regular. Mostly. Sometimes a bit… hard. I eat enough fiber, I think. I have a bit of trouble sometimes, gettin' things movin', if I’ve been busy. But nothing serious. Just… a bit of a struggle, now and then. I don’t want to go into too much detail, if you don’t mind. It’s all a bit… embarrassing. I just want my waterworks to stop botherin’ me!
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. You don't need to share anything you're not comfortable with. Just knowing they’re mostly regular is helpful. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll need to examine your abdomen and do a quick pelvic exam, if that’s alright with you. This will help me determine the cause of your urinary issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a pelvic exam? Well… I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. I’m not very keen on… that part, to be honest. But I want this sorted. I really do. I've been puttin’ it off for so long. But I just want my waterworks to stop botherin’ me. Yes, alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. But please be quick. And gentle. I'm a bit… sensitive. And I have an appointment to fix a leaky roof on an RV at three o'clock.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I understand your concerns and will respect your comfort at all times. We’ll take things at your pace. First, let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please sit here for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright. But please hurry. That leaky roof isn't going to fix itself. And Mrs. Henderson is very particular about her RV. I really don't want to keep her waiting. My waterworks… they just keep botherin’ me. I hope you can find out what's wrong. This is just… exhausting. Get on with it, then, Doctor. Before I change my mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently examine your abdomen. Please lie back on the exam table. I’ll start by palpating your lower abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Anything here feel uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a bit cold. Ouch! Yes, there! That hurts a bit. Right… there. Not terribly painful, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s been botherin’ me off and on for a few days now. But my waterworks… they're the main problem. Everything just feels…sore. Is that normal? I really don't like bein’ poked and prodded. This is makin' me anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease. That’s helpful to know. Tenderness in the lower right quadrant. Now, I will need to proceed with the pelvic exam to better assess the cause of your urinary symptoms. I'll explain each step as I go and will stop if you’re uncomfortable at any point. First, I’ll visually inspect the external area. Then, I’ll use a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal and examine the cervix. This may cause some mild discomfort. Finally, I'll perform a bimanual exam to feel the uterus and ovaries. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. I suppose so. But please be quick. And gentle. Very gentle. I really don’t like this at all. I haven't had one of these in… well, a very long time. Are you sure you need to do all of that? Maybe just look at my waterworks? My waterworks are the problem! I just want them to stop botherin’ me! Get it over with, then. But warn me before you do anything. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. I'm just going to take a quick look at the external area now. I’m not seeing anything unusual externally. Now, I will gently insert the speculum. I will let you know when I'm inserting it, and you can tell me to stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. Just taking a look at the cervix now. The cervix appears normal, with no signs of inflammation or lesions. Now, I'll perform the bimanual exam. I'm just going to gently insert two fingers into the vagina to feel the uterus and ovaries. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I'm feeling the uterus and ovaries now. The uterus feels normal in size and shape. The ovaries are… a little bit tender on the right side. Okay, Ms. Wease. That’s all done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… that wasn’t as bad as I thought. But it was still…uncomfortable. A bit awkward. My lower abdomen feels a bit sore now. Is everything alright? What did you find? The tender ovaries… is that bad? My waterworks… are you any closer to figuring out what’s wrong with my waterworks? I really need to know. I have Mrs. Henderson’s roof to fix. And I just want this to stop botherin’ me! Please tell me it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease. Based on the exam, your uterus feels normal, but your right ovary is slightly tender to the touch. This, combined with the tenderness you reported in your lower right abdomen and your urinary symptoms, suggests a few possibilities. It could be an ovarian cyst, a mild infection, or possibly some inflammation. However, to be certain, I'd like to order a urine test to rule out an infection. And I also recommend an ultrasound of your pelvis to get a better look at your ovaries and uterus. This will help me determine the exact cause of your discomfort and the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh… more tests? I just want it fixed. I don't want to keep comin' back here for tests. I have an RV to repair, you know. Mrs. Henderson is expectin’ me. But… I suppose if you think it's necessary. A urine test… that's not so bad. And an ultrasound… is that painful? I really don't like bein’ poked and prodded. Will the tests tell me what's wrong with my waterworks? And will it take long? I really need to get back to work. I just want my waterworks to stop botherin’ me! I'm startin' to feel very anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wease. I wish we could get a definitive answer right away, but these tests are important to rule out anything serious and ensure we’re providing the correct treatment. The urine test is very simple – you’ll just need to provide a sample in a cup. It usually takes a few minutes to process the results. The ultrasound is non-invasive, meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or incisions. A technician will apply a gel to your lower abdomen and use a handheld device to create images of your ovaries and uterus. It shouldn’t be painful, although you might feel some slight pressure. It usually takes about 20-30 minutes. I’ll write you a referral for both tests. The lab and imaging center are located nearby. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. If you experience any fever, severe pain, or bleeding, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about the tests or the instructions?
PATIENT: Plenty of fluids… avoid caffeine… that’s easy enough. But the tests… and waitin’ for the results… That’s what bothers me. I just want this over with. Will the results come quickly? And what if it’s somethin’ serious? I… I don't suppose you could just give me somethin’ for the pain, right now? Just somethin’ to tide me over until the results come back? My waterworks are really botherin’ me, and I have Mrs. Henderson’s roof to fix. I can’t climb a ladder feelin’ like this! And… is there any chance it’s just a simple infection? Could it be somethin’ easy to fix? Please tell me it’s not somethin’ serious. I really don't want to have to deal with any complicated procedures. I just want my waterworks to stop botherin’ me! .
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Wease. It’s completely normal to worry about the unknown. While we need the test results to get a definitive diagnosis, I can certainly prescribe you something for the pain to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild urinary analgesic – it will help with the burning sensation and discomfort. It’s not a long-term solution, but it should provide some relief. It is possible it's a simple urinary tract infection, and that would be easily treated with antibiotics. However, we need to rule out other possibilities first, which is why the tests are important. I want to be upfront with you – based on the exam, it doesn't seem like anything immediately life-threatening. But it’s best to be thorough and get a clear picture of what’s going on. Here’s the prescription. You can take it to your local pharmacy. I’ll also give you a handout with information about urinary health and things you can do to prevent infections. The lab and imaging center should be able to schedule you for the tests within the next few days. Once you have the results, please contact the office and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you feel a little better knowing we have a plan in place?
