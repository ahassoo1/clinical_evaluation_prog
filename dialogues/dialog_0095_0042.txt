DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Londell. Well, I reckon I’m getting on in years, and figured it was time to see if there was anything I could do to keep things running smooth, you know? A little tune-up, maybe. My wife… she always kept up with these things. I’m just trying to stay on top of it now. It's a “Men’s Health Optimization Visit” according to the paperwork, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right – a men’s health check-up. It’s good you’re being proactive, Londell. We can certainly look at things and see what we can do to help you stay healthy. To start, can you tell me a little more about what specifically has been on your mind, or any symptoms you’ve been experiencing – even if they seem small?
PATIENT: Well, not a whole lot of symptoms, to be honest. Just… feeling a little slower these days. Takes me a bit longer to get going in the mornings, and I don’t have the energy I used to for working on my etchings. Not a pain thing, just… tired. And sometimes I get up a few times at night to… well, you know. Nothing terrible, just… more often than it used to be. My memory’s still good, thankfully – I can recall dates and details clear as a bell. But the energy level is what's bothering me most, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and increased nighttime urination. That's helpful. And no pain, and memory is good – that’s good to know. When you say “a few times at night,” roughly how many times would you say?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Most nights it's two, maybe three times. Some nights just the once, and very rarely none at all. It varies, but it's enough to disrupt my sleep a little. I usually get up, and then it takes a bit to get back to sleep. Not a big deal, just… not restful like it used to be. It’s been going on for… oh, six months or so, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. It sort of crept up on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or so of gradually increasing nighttime urination, disrupting your sleep. And you've also mentioned fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I reckon my appetite hasn’t been what it used to be. I don't feel hungry like I used to, and I've probably lost a few pounds. Not intentionally, just… not eating as much. I haven't weighed myself recently, to be honest. My wife used to keep track of that, too. I'm guessing maybe five or ten pounds? It’s hard to say for sure. I'm still fairly active, though – I do my etching work most days, and I try to get outside and walk when the weather’s good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradual weight loss along with fatigue and increased nighttime urination. Any changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing really there. Bowels are… regular, I suppose. Always have been. No trouble in that department. I drink plenty of water, try to eat my fruits and vegetables. Not perfect, mind you, but I take care of myself. Just feeling a little… worn down, you know? I used to be able to work on my etchings for hours and not even notice. Now, I get tired after a couple of hours and have to take a break. It's frustrating, really. I like being busy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're recognizing these changes, and it's good you're staying active. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not as far as I know. Never been diagnosed with anything like that. Had a bout of pneumonia when I was a young man, but that cleared up fine. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. My wife… she had some trouble with her heart later in life, but I don't. No family history of diabetes that I’m aware of, either. Both my parents lived to be good ages, just… normal wear and tear, I suppose. I see Dr. Abernathy down at the tribal clinic for my yearly checkups, but he mostly just checks my blood pressure and makes sure I’m not falling apart too quickly. He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known chronic medical conditions, a past episode of pneumonia, and no significant family history. You see Dr. Abernathy for yearly checkups. Good. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that's about it. Nothing since. No broken bones or anything like that either. I was always pretty careful, never took too many risks. My wife used to say I was too cautious, but I figured it was better to be safe than sorry. And I always took care of my tools, didn’t want to be messing with a rusty blade, you know? That’s important in my line of work.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a one. I don't believe in loading up on pills unless it's absolutely necessary. I might take an aspirin every now and then for a headache, but that's about it. No vitamins, no herbal remedies, nothing like that. I prefer to let my body do its own healing, as much as possible. My wife… she was always trying to get me to take something for my joints, but I always refused. I figured a little soreness was just part of getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Good. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not a one. Never had an allergic reaction to anything in my life. My wife always said I was lucky. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had trouble with bee stings or poison ivy or anything like that. I’ve always been pretty fortunate when it comes to that sort of thing. So, no allergies to report, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information, Mr. Kammann. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to answer any questions you might have, and I'll do my best to cooperate. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m used to being poked and prodded, a little, from working with sharp tools all these years.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the table here. I'll start by checking your blood pressure. 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear, breath sounds are good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I’m just going to briefly check your abdomen. No tenderness, abdomen is soft. Everything seems alright so far. Now, to get a better idea of what might be going on, I’d like to order some blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a PSA test. The PSA test is a prostate-specific antigen test, it’s a standard test for men your age. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible to me, Doctor. Blood work is a good idea. I don’t mind a little poking if it helps figure things out. The PSA test… I’ve heard of that one. My wife’s brother had some trouble with his prostate a few years back, so I reckon it’s good to check. You’re right about it being a standard thing. Yeah, go ahead and order whatever tests you think are necessary. I trust your judgment. Where do I go to get that done? Is there a lab nearby?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm sending the order to the lab just across the street – the one attached to the tribal clinic. Dr. Abernathy’s office can give you directions if needed, but it’s a short walk. They should be able to get you in fairly quickly. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It usually takes a few days. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and maintain your regular activity level. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything pretty thoroughly, Doctor. Just a few days, you said? Okay, that sounds good. I’ll give Dr. Abernathy’s office a call tomorrow and get it scheduled. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not rushing me. My wife used to always say I took too long explaining things, but you didn't seem to mind. So, thank you again. I reckon I'll see you in a few days then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammann. It’s my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll go over the results together, and come up with a plan. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too.
