DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's get this over with. It's this… heartburn. Keeps happening, especially after I eat. Food just… comes back up, you know? It’s unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Right. Unpleasant is certainly an understatement, I imagine. Okay, so you're experiencing heartburn and regurgitation, primarily after eating. Can you describe the sensation of the heartburn?
PATIENT: Sensation? What do you mean sensation? It burns! Right here, in my chest. Like someone lit a little fire. Not a big fire, mind you, but annoying. And then the food… well, it tastes bad coming back up. Is that what you wanted to know? Honestly, it's pretty obvious what it feels like.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand it burns, Mr. Altine. I was attempting to gauge the severity and character of the pain, as that can be helpful. But we can skip the detailed descriptions if you prefer. How often would you say this happens?
PATIENT: Often? Hmm. A couple times a week, maybe. Sometimes more if I have a bigger meal. I had some pierogi last weekend... that wasn't good. Usually after I eat something rich, or spicy. Look, I eat normal food. I don’t go looking for trouble. It's just… happening. And it's interfering with my evenings, alright? I can’t sit and relax after dinner like I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple times a week, worse with richer or spicier foods, and affecting your quality of life. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the heartburn and regurgitation?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don’t know, am I supposed to be looking for things? No, not really. Sometimes a bit of a cough, maybe? It’s probably just from the… you know, the stuff coming up. And I wouldn't say it's pain, exactly, but it’s uncomfortable. Like pressure, in my chest. But honestly, I’m a pretty tough guy. It's not like I'm writhing around in agony here.
DOCTOR: A cough and chest pressure. I see. And this chest pressure, is it related to the heartburn, or does it occur at other times as well?
PATIENT: Well, it's usually after the heartburn, if that makes sense. When the… burning is happening. It feels… tight, you know? Like someone's squeezing me. I don’t get it at other times, not usually. I mean, I'm not a young man anymore, I get aches and pains like everyone else, but this is different. It’s tied to the food. I’m telling you, it has to be the food. I ate too many pierogi. That’s the culprit. Honestly, sometimes I think doctors just want to make things more complicated than they are.
DOCTOR: Right. So, heartburn, regurgitation, cough, and chest pressure associated with meals. You believe it’s related to specific foods, like the pierogi. Let’s go through some of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Other conditions? Look, I’m a reasonably healthy guy for my age. I've had the usual things, a bit of high blood pressure, controlled with medication, obviously. Nothing major. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was ages ago and I haven’t had any trouble with it since. And my wife keeps telling me my cholesterol is a bit high, but I don't pay much attention to that. Mostly I just eat what I like and get on with things. Don’t need to be fussed over by doctors all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of hypertension, currently managed, and a prior cholecystectomy. And elevated cholesterol, according to your wife. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a pill, every morning. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small white one. I’ve been on it for years. Gets me through the day. My wife handles the refills, mostly. She’s good at that sort of thing. Keeps me organized. I don’t really pay attention to the details, to be honest. Just take the pill, that’s what I do. Look, can we wrap this up soon? I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril, daily. And no other medications?
PATIENT: No, that’s it. Just the blood pressure pill. Look, I don't like taking a lot of pills. It makes me feel… weak. I used to be a strong guy, you know? Emergency Management Directors don't get to be successful sitting around taking medication all day. Now, are we getting anywhere with this heartburn or are we just going to keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Let me just quickly review your chart here. I see your last physical was about a year ago, and your blood pressure has been well-controlled on the Lisinopril. Okay. Now, before we proceed with a diagnosis, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. That's the responsible thing to do. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Look, I suppose. But make it quick, alright? I haven't got all day. And don't poke around too much. I'm not made of glass, but I don't need a thorough investigation just because I had a couple of pierogi. Just listen and poke a little, and let’s get this over with. Honestly, the things they make doctors do these days…
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. Your heart rate is regular and there are no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any masses. There is some mild tenderness in the epigastric region, right here. Anything else you want to tell me before I go over my recommendations?
PATIENT: That tenderness… that's where it hurts, yeah. That’s the heartburn area. Look, I told you it was probably the pierogi. Now, are you going to tell me to stop eating all the good food, or are you going to give me something to actually help? I'm not going to sit around eating bland crackers for the rest of my life just because my wife thinks I should. Tell me what I can take when I get a little… indigestion, and let me be on my way. I've got important things to manage. Real emergencies, not heartburn.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it appears you are experiencing symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. The tenderness in your epigastric region supports this. While it could be related to dietary factors like the pierogi, it requires management. I am going to recommend a trial of a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, to reduce stomach acid production. This should help alleviate your symptoms. I am also going to advise some lifestyle modifications, which include avoiding large meals, particularly before bedtime, and elevating the head of your bed. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Proton pump… what now? Look, I don't need fancy medical terms, just tell me what pill to take. And what’s this about lifestyle modifications? You’re not going to tell me I can’t have pierogi, are you? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just give me the name of the pill, the dosage, and tell me if it has any side effects that will stop me from being able to work. I run an emergency management department; I don't have time for all this. And, and I really don't need to elevate my bed. My wife will have a fit. Just the pill. That’s all I need.
DOCTOR: Very well. I am prescribing Omeprazole 20mg once daily, taken in the morning, 30 minutes before a meal. Common side effects include headache, diarrhea, and nausea, but these are usually mild and temporary. It is important to take the medication as directed. As for the lifestyle modifications, they are recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of the medication and prevent future episodes. I would advise you to discuss them with your wife, but they are not mandatory. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Omeprazole… okay. Twenty milligrams, once a day. Before breakfast. Got it. And… mild side effects. Fine. Look, I’ll talk to my wife. She'll probably make me eat even more bland food, but I’ll try. Just… don't expect miracles. I’ve got a department to run, you know. Real emergencies, not heartburn. Now, are we finally done here? I've wasted enough time already. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Altine, you are free to go. If your symptoms do not improve within two weeks, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And, please, do not hesitate to seek immediate medical attention if you experience any chest pain, difficulty swallowing, or unexplained weight loss. Have a good day. .
