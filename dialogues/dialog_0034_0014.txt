DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Hmm… let me think. My wife, she said something about… papers? For when you, uh… need time off? Or maybe can’t work? Something like that. I get so mixed up these days. It’s about that, I think. FMLA, maybe? She mentioned that name. I work with the church, you see. Directing things, religious education and all. It’s a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, FMLA – the Family and Medical Leave Act. It allows eligible employees unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons. It sounds like your wife is proactively getting some information for you, which is good. To clarify, are you currently experiencing a health issue that might require you to take time off from your work at the church, or are you anticipating a need for leave in the near future?
PATIENT: Oh, see, that’s the thing. It’s… hard to say. I’ve just been feeling… off. Not sick, exactly. Just… tired, a lot. And forgetful. Like right now! I can't quite remember why I needed the papers, just that my wife thought I did. Maybe it’s a good idea to have them just in case? I don't want to be a bother if it's nothing. I’ve been doing this work for a long time, and I don’t usually… well, take time off. Is that clear? I’m sorry if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly clear, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you're experiencing some fatigue and memory issues, and you're understandably concerned about how it might affect your work. It's good you're addressing this proactively. It’s certainly not rambling. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m exhausted all the time. It comes and goes. Some days I feel alright, busy as always with the church things. But other days… I just feel drained. Like there’s no energy, even after a full night’s sleep. And it’s not just physical, you know? It’s… mental too. I have trouble focusing, remembering names… small things, mostly. Things I should remember. It's been happening for a few months now, I think. Maybe longer? Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? My wife notices, she says I repeat myself sometimes. She's very observant.
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does slip away. It sounds like this fatigue and memory difficulty has been gradual and intermittent, and your wife has noticed some changes as well. That's helpful information. To get a more complete picture, let’s do a brief review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. As an adult… oh, my blood pressure. The doctor mentioned it was a little high a few years back. I think I was on some medication for a while, but I stopped taking it. It seemed to go down on its own. And I had a bit of a problem with my back a long time ago, but that’s all sorted now. Nothing else that I can recall, really. I try to eat well, you know? Lots of fish, fresh fruit. My wife is very good about that. She keeps me on the straight and narrow. But I don’t see doctors often. I don’t like hospitals.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It sounds like you've generally been in good health, with some past issues with blood pressure and your back, but those seem to be resolved. And it’s helpful to know you prefer to avoid doctors when possible. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, dementia, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s a tough one. My mother, she lived a long life, but she had… I think it was arthritis, bad enough she needed a wheelchair toward the end. My father… he was a strong man, always working. I don't recall him being sick much, but he passed away relatively young, maybe in his sixties. Heart trouble, I think? It was a long time ago. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side… she was a bit forgetful in her old age. Not like me, not yet, but she did misplace things a lot and sometimes didn’t recognize people. That’s about all I can remember, honestly. We didn’t talk about health much in my family. It wasn’t something we dwelled on.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That's helpful. A family history of heart trouble and some memory issues is good to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, nothing like that. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife wouldn't allow it! And I only have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, very rarely. And definitely no recreational drugs. I am a man of the church, you see. I try to live a good, clean life. A simple life. That’s what matters. My wife keeps me in line on all of that as well. She's a good woman, very strict. But it’s for the best, you know? Keeps me healthy and focused. Do you need to know anything else about that? I’m happy to answer, if I can remember.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly clear, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you maintain a very healthy lifestyle, which is wonderful. Now, let's quickly go over any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones, and any allergies you have.
PATIENT: Right, medications… let me think. I don't take anything regularly anymore. Like I said, I used to take something for my blood pressure, but I stopped. Occasionally, I'll take a pain reliever for a headache, just Tylenol, nothing fancy. And I take a multivitamin sometimes, just to be on the safe side. Allergies… hmm. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Nothing serious, anyway. I might get a little itchy sometimes if I'm around certain flowers, but it’s not a big deal. My wife always makes sure I know what's in everything she gives me, just in case. She's very cautious. Do you need me to be more specific? I'm trying my best to recall everything.
DOCTOR: No, that’s very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you're only taking Tylenol occasionally and a multivitamin, with no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological exam to assess your memory and reflexes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam. Hmm. I don't particularly like exams, you know? But… if it will help, I suppose. If you think it's necessary. Just… please be gentle. And don't take too long, if you don't mind. I get a little nervous in these situations. What exactly will you be doing? Just to prepare myself, you see. My wife always tells me to ask questions. She says it's important to be informed. She's a very practical woman.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. I completely understand your apprehension. We’ll take it very slowly, and I’ll explain everything as we go. It will just involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. I'll listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, just to make sure everything sounds normal. Then, I’ll do a quick neurological exam – checking your reflexes, balance, and cognitive function, which includes some simple memory questions. It won’t take long, and I'll be as gentle as possible. Would you like me to start with your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, blood pressure first sounds good. As long as it doesn't take too long. And please tell me what the numbers mean, if you don’t mind. My wife always explains it to me, but… well, I forget things, you know? I don't want to bother you with my poor memory. Just… a quick explanation would be helpful. And is there anything I need to do? Like relax my arm, or breathe a certain way? I want to make sure I do it right. She always says I get too anxious. She's a good woman, my wife. Very patient.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. Absolutely no bother at all. I'm happy to explain everything. The blood pressure reading has two numbers. The top number, called systolic pressure, measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats. The bottom number, called diastolic pressure, measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart rests between beats. Ideally, we want both numbers to be below 120/80. Anything consistently higher than that might indicate high blood pressure. And yes, just relax your arm and try to breathe normally. No need to talk or move while I'm taking the reading. Just a few deep breaths and try to clear your mind. Alright, let’s take a look… Your blood pressure is 142 over 90. That's a bit elevated. We'll need to monitor this over time. We can repeat the reading in a few minutes to confirm. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: 142 over 90… that's… high, isn’t it? My wife will be concerned. She warned me about my blood pressure, you know. I should have listened to her more carefully. She always knows best. Repeating it… yes, that's fine. If you think it’s necessary. But it probably won’t be any different. I just get so nervous in these situations. It always raises it, she says. She's a very practical woman, my wife. Always thinking ahead. Will it mean I need medication again? I don't like taking pills. They make me feel… strange. But if I have to, I suppose I will. For my wife, mostly. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned about the reading, Mr. Limtiaco, and your wife's concerns are valid. Yes, 142/90 is elevated. It doesn't necessarily mean you need medication right away, but we need to investigate further. It's possible it was a one-time spike due to anxiety, as you mentioned, but we need to rule out other causes. Let’s take another reading and see what we get… Okay, this reading is 145 over 92. Slightly higher. To get a better picture, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam to assess your memory and reflexes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Higher again. It’s just my nerves, I’m sure. Everything is always worse when I come to the doctor. Listening to my heart and lungs… and the exam… yes, alright. But please be quick. I don’t want to be here all day. And gentle, if you could. I’m a bit of an old man, you know. And try not to ask me too many complicated questions for the exam. My memory isn’t what it used to be. My wife always says I get confused easily. She's very observant, my wife. Always noticing things I miss. Will it be painful? I don’t like pain. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. I assure you, it won't be painful at all. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope to check for any unusual sounds. Then, the neurological exam will involve a few simple tests of your reflexes, balance, and cognitive function. It's nothing to worry about, just a routine check. I will be as gentle as possible and keep it brief. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No unusual sounds. Now, let's just check your reflexes… can you please extend your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Arms and legs… yes, alright. I haven't done this in ages. My wife keeps me active, but… not with tests like this. She prefers gardening. It's good exercise, she says. Keeps the mind and body busy. Will you be tapping my knees with that little hammer? I remember that from when I was a child. It never felt very nice. And please don't ask me to do anything too complicated for the cognitive test. I get flustered easily. My wife always says I’m a bit of a worrywart. She's a very practical woman, my wife. Always thinking ahead. And she always knows best.
DOCTOR: Yes, I will be checking your reflexes with a small reflex hammer, but it won’t hurt, I promise. It’s just a gentle tap to see how your nerves are responding. And I will keep the cognitive test very simple. No need to worry. Just a few basic questions to assess your memory and orientation. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Now, let’s just do a few simple memory questions… Can you please tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. That’s… difficult. Let me think. Is it… August? Yes, I think so. August… the 2nd? Is it the 2nd? Or the 3rd? Oh dear. I’m so confused. My wife always knows the date. She keeps a calendar, you see. Very organized. I’m terrible with dates. And numbers, mostly. My mind is a bit of a blur these days. Is it August 2nd? Or 3rd? Oh dear. I’m so sorry. I just can’t remember. Is that bad? My wife will be concerned. She always says I need to keep my mind active. She's a very practical woman, my wife. Always thinking ahead.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty with dates sometimes. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. We’ll consider all of this information together. Today is August 2nd, yes. Now, let’s just ask you to spell “world” backwards. Just take your time, and do your best. It’s just a simple test to assess your cognitive function.
PATIENT: "World" backwards… oh dear. That's… difficult. Let me think. I used to be good at spelling, in school. But that was a long time ago. My mind is a bit foggy these days. Is it… “dlrow”? No, that doesn’t sound right. Or is it… “dorlw”? Oh dear. I’m so confused. I can’t seem to get it right. I apologize. My wife always says I need to do puzzles to keep my mind sharp. She's very practical, my wife. Always thinking ahead and keeping me on track. I just can't seem to focus. Is that bad? I'm so sorry to be a bother.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty with that task. It’s not a reflection of your intelligence, just a small indicator that we may need to investigate further. It’s not easy to spell things backwards. Based on what we've discussed today, and the results of the brief exam, I’m concerned about your elevated blood pressure, and some difficulty with memory and cognitive function. It's possible this could be due to a number of factors, including stress, anxiety, or something else. I recommend we order some blood work to check your overall health, including your thyroid levels, vitamin deficiencies, and kidney function. I’d also like to schedule a brain scan, such as an MRI, to rule out any structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A brain scan… oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood work, yes, that’s alright. But a brain scan? Is it necessary? Will it be painful? And expensive? My wife will be concerned, I just know it. She worries about everything. She’s very practical, my wife. Always thinking ahead and making sure we’re covered. I don't like hospitals, you know. Or tests like that. Are you sure it’s necessary? Could it be… just stress? I’ve been a little worried lately, with things at the church. And my memory isn't what it used to be, but… it's just old age, isn’t it? Perhaps some rest would help. And a good garden. My wife always says gardening is good for the soul. She’s a very practical woman, my wife. Always thinking ahead. What will the scan show? Will it be bad news?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Limtiaco. It's natural to be worried about a brain scan, and I assure you, it's not something we take lightly. It's not necessarily indicative of anything serious, but it's a precautionary measure to rule out any structural issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. The scan itself is painless and non-invasive. You'll simply lie down on a table while the machine takes images of your brain. It's relatively quick and safe. As for cost, we can check with your insurance to see what’s covered. While stress can certainly contribute to memory issues, it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions first. We want to get a clear picture of what's going on to ensure you receive the best possible care. To be clear, I'm not saying there's anything seriously wrong. But based on your symptoms, and the brief exam, it's best to be thorough. We can discuss the results of the tests, and develop a plan based on what we find. Would you like me to schedule the blood work and the brain scan?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. My wife will want me to do whatever you recommend. She always says I need to listen to the doctor. She's very practical, my wife. Always thinking ahead. But I’m still worried about the scan. Will it be uncomfortable? And what if it shows something bad? I don’t like hospitals, you know. Or tests. But if it will help… alright. Schedule the blood work, and the scan. But please, be gentle. And explain everything to me beforehand. I get nervous easily. And tell me the results as soon as you can. My wife will be anxious. She’s a very practical woman, my wife. Always thinking ahead. And she always knows best. Just… please be careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we will be as gentle as possible. We’ll schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning at the clinic. As for the brain scan, we’ll schedule it at the imaging center across town. It will take about 30 minutes, and you'll be able to go home afterwards. I will personally explain everything to you beforehand, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. I will also contact your wife to let her know what we’re doing and to reassure her. In the meantime, I recommend you try to get plenty of rest and relaxation. And continue with activities you enjoy, such as gardening. We’ll take things one step at a time and ensure you receive the best possible care. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. My mind is a bit of a blur, you see. And I worry easily. My wife always says I need to be more relaxed. She's a very practical woman, my wife. Always thinking ahead and making sure everything is taken care of. Just… please let me know the results as soon as you can. She will be anxious. And thank you again for being so patient. I appreciate it. Now, I suppose I should go home. My wife will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. You’re very welcome. I understand your concerns, and I will keep you and your wife informed every step of the way. We will contact you as soon as the results are available. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you.
