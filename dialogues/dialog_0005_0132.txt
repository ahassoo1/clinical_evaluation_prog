DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Heat intolerance, you say? Well, that's...something. Honestly, it's not that bad, but my daughter, she worries too much. Keeps telling me I need to get it checked. Says I get flushed and slow down when it's warm. I've been painting houses all my life, you know. Been doing construction since I was a boy in Nepal. A little heat never bothered me before.
DOCTOR: Right. A little heat. Well, daughters do worry. Still, it’s good to be thorough. “A little heat” can mean different things to different people, and even small changes can sometimes point to something we should look at. You say you've been painting houses for a long time... and you're originally from Nepal?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, Nepal. Up in the mountains. Much cooler there, naturally. Not like this…this humidity. And painting…well, I've been doing it so long I practically am paint. Exterior work mostly. Lots of sun. But, like I said, never had a problem before. This started…oh, maybe a couple of months ago? Not right away in the morning, it’s when the sun really gets going. Makes me feel…well, like I’m pushing through molasses. And I get red. Like a beet, my daughter says. She’s always with the comparisons.
DOCTOR: Right. A couple of months ago. And it’s worse with sun exposure, specifically. Okay. So, you’re noticing increased flushing and a general slowing down, feeling like you’re working harder than usual. Is this happening consistently when you’re out in the sun, or does it depend on other factors?
PATIENT: Consistently. Definitely consistently. Doesn't matter if I'm drinking water, or taking breaks. Doesn't matter if it's a cloudy-sunny day, or full blazing sun. If the heat's on, I feel it. And, honestly, I don't see what's so hard to understand about that. It's heat. You get hot, you slow down. It's common sense. I've been working outside for sixty years, I think I'd know.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, common sense is a good starting point, Mr. Coby. But we have to rule things out. It’s why you’re slowing down that’s important. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the flushing and fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. Well, sometimes my heart feels like it's…thumping a little harder. Not painful, just…noticeable. And I've been a bit more…forgetful, maybe? Though, honestly, at my age, that's probably just old age creeping in. My daughter keeps saying I repeat myself, but she's always listening for something to worry about. She means well, but...
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased heart rate and some memory issues. And how long would you say this has been going on, the heart rate thing?
PATIENT: Oh, the heart thing… maybe a month or so. Around the same time as the heat intolerance, really. It’s not bad, you understand. It just…beats a little faster when I'm working in the sun. I wouldn't say it's racing, or anything. Just…present. I’ve always been pretty healthy, you know. Never really been sick. I eat my dal bhat, I get plenty of exercise…well, plenty for a man my age. I don't understand why I'm here wasting my time, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your frustration. But even healthy people experience changes as they age, and it’s my job to investigate these changes. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. But don't expect to find anything. I'm telling you, it's just the heat. But, alright, go ahead. Don't poke too hard, though. I've got work to do, you know. Houses don't paint themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, if you would. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Not drastically high, but worth noting. Skin is warm and slightly flushed, as you mentioned. I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: Swelling? In my ankles? Well, now that you mention it… maybe a little. Not much. I’ve been on my feet a lot lately, doing renovations. Probably just from standing so long. Pain? No, not really. Just…puffy, I suppose. Honestly, you doctors always find something. It's your job, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is my job to be thorough, Mr. Coby. Okay. Let’s run some basic blood tests, just to get a clearer picture. I want to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and rule out any underlying infections. We'll also do a complete blood count to check your red and white blood cell levels. And I’d like to order an EKG, just to look at your heart rhythm more closely. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An EKG? Now you’re just trying to find something! My heart is fine! I've been hauling lumber and climbing scaffolding for decades. It can handle a little heat. But…fine. Do your tests. Just don't expect miracles. And how long is this going to take? I've got a deadline, you know. Mrs. Henderson's porch needs a fresh coat before the weekend.
DOCTOR: It won't take long, Mr. Coby. The blood draw will only be a few minutes, and the EKG is quick and painless. We'll get the results back within a couple of days. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you limit your strenuous activity in the heat. And, with all due respect, I think it's important to take these symptoms seriously, even if you feel otherwise. Let's just get some answers, alright?
PATIENT: Limit my activity… Honestly. Fine. Whatever you say. Just get it over with. And tell that nurse to be gentle with the needle. My veins aren’t what they used to be.
