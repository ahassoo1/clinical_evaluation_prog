DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Limtiaco is fine, everyone calls me that. Oh… what brings me in? Hmm… let me think. My wife, she said something about papers… important papers. Something to do with… time off? I’m not quite sure, to be honest. She handles most of that sort of thing. I think it has to do with my work, though. I'm with the church, you see. Directors, Religious Activities and Education, that's me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like this visit is related to some paperwork for your role at the church. That’s perfectly alright; we can certainly sort through that. Sometimes those administrative details can be a bit confusing. To start, could you tell me a little bit about why you think you need time off?
PATIENT: Time off… right. Well, now that you mention it… I've been feeling… a little off, lately. Not sick, exactly. Just… tired. More tired than usual. And my memory… it’s been worse than usual, if that’s possible. My wife says I ask the same questions five times in an hour, bless her heart. It’s… it’s been going on for a few months, I think. Maybe longer? It's hard to say, really. I just know it’s making things difficult at work.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue and memory difficulties, developing over several months… that's good information to start with, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s definitely worthwhile to look into this further, especially since it’s impacting your work. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe the fatigue a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I can’t do things, you understand. I still go to work, I still do my duties. But… after a few hours, I just feel… drained. Like all my energy’s been sucked out of me. And it doesn’t get better with rest, not really. I wake up tired, and I stay tired. It's a… a heavy feeling, if that makes sense. And sometimes, I feel a bit… foggy. Like my brain isn't working right. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like a persistent, draining fatigue that isn't relieved by rest, accompanied by some mental fogginess. That's helpful. And you mentioned the memory issues – could you give me a specific example of what you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to start? Just yesterday, I was preparing for a meeting, a very important one with the elders. My wife reminded me three times that I needed to bring the… the minutes, I think they were called. And I just… couldn't remember where I put them. I looked everywhere! She ended up finding them tucked away in a file I hadn't even thought of. And then, later that same day, I completely forgot the name of a young man who volunteers with us. He’s been with the church for… oh, I don’t know, a year now! But his name just… slipped my mind. It’s frustrating, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds quite frustrating, Mr. Limtiaco. Difficulty recalling recent events – like the meeting minutes – and forgetting names, even of people you see regularly… these are important details. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… hmm. I don’t think so, not really. I still enjoy my meals, my wife is a wonderful cook. Though, I might not be eating as much as I used to. But I put that down to… well, to just getting older, I suppose. And my weight… I haven’t weighed myself in a while, to be honest. I’m a tall man, you see, and I’ve always been fairly slender. I don’t think I’ve lost any weight, but I couldn’t say for sure. It’s not something I worry about much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant changes in appetite or weight. That’s good to know. Now, have you noticed any difficulties with sleep – trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested even after sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleep… now there's something. I used to be a sound sleeper, could sleep through anything. But lately… I wake up a lot during the night. Just little things, usually. A noise, or a thought popping into my head. And then I lie there, tossing and turning, trying to get back to sleep. It doesn’t happen every night, but it’s frequent enough to be bothersome. And even when I do sleep, I don’t always feel rested in the morning. It's a… a light sleep, not the deep, refreshing sleep I used to have.
DOCTOR: Frequent awakenings and a less restful sleep… okay. Now, have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, or any numbness or weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. Nothing severe, just a mild ache, usually in the back of my head. I take a little something for it and it goes away. Vision changes… hmm. Not that I've noticed. I still read my Bible every day, and I don't have any trouble seeing the words. And no numbness or weakness. My legs feel a little tired sometimes, but that's just from being on my feet all day, I think. I haven’t had any trouble walking or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to ask a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… my wife handles most of that too. I've been generally healthy, thankfully. I had my share of colds and flu when I was younger, but nothing serious. I don't think I have any… what do you call them? Existing conditions. My blood pressure was a little high a few years back, the doctor put me on a little pill for it, but I haven't had it checked recently. And no diabetes, or anything like that. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and fruits.
DOCTOR: Okay, previously managed hypertension. And you don't currently have a diagnosis of diabetes or other chronic illnesses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, that’s about it. And I was hospitalized once for a bad case of pneumonia when I was in the navy. That was a long time ago, though. Everything went well, I recovered fully. I haven't been hospitalized since then. Nothing major, thankfully. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child and a previous hospitalization for pneumonia. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, dementia, cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother… she had heart trouble later in life, needed a pacemaker, I think. And my father… he had a stroke, I believe, when he was an old man. And my aunt… she had some trouble with her memory when she got older, the doctor said it was… what do they call it? Dementia, I think. Yes, dementia. It runs in the family, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I used to take a little pill for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it a few years back. I don’t think I’m taking anything regularly right now. I might take a little something for a headache now and then, but nothing consistent. And no supplements, no. I don't believe in all those fancy pills, mostly. Just a healthy diet and a good night’s sleep, that’s what I need. Though, lately, that hasn’t been enough.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of this information with me, Mr. Limtiaco. It gives me a much clearer picture of what’s been going on. Based on what you’ve told me – the fatigue, memory difficulties, sleep disturbances, and family history – there are a few possibilities we need to explore. Before we proceed, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment – check your reflexes and balance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam, yes. I suppose that’s a good idea. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. My wife always says I should get myself checked out more often. So, yes. Let's do it. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm comfortably. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s slightly elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go. Is that alright? I'm trying my best not to move my head. It’s a little difficult, to be honest. My neck isn’t as flexible as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine, Mr. Limtiaco. Just do your best. Alright, and now I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits. Your balance seems stable, although slightly reduced. Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That was helpful. Based on the exam and your history, we need to investigate the cause of your fatigue and memory difficulties further. I’m concerned about the possibility of early cognitive impairment, but we need more information to be certain. I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out other possible causes, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or infection. And I’d also like to schedule you for a cognitive assessment with a specialist. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a cognitive assessment… yes, that sounds… thorough. I suppose if that's what you recommend, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. I'd rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. My wife will be relieved too, she's been worried about me. So, yes. Let's do the blood tests and schedule the assessment. When can we get those done? And… what exactly is a cognitive assessment? Is it… difficult?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Limtiaco. A cognitive assessment is a series of tests that evaluate your memory, attention, language skills, and problem-solving abilities. It's not difficult, it’s more like a puzzle or a conversation. It helps us understand your cognitive function and identify any areas of concern. It’s typically administered by a neuropsychologist. As for the blood tests, we can do those right away. I’ll have my nurse draw a few vials of blood. The results usually take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I’ll have my assistant schedule you for the cognitive assessment. We can get that done within the next few weeks. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to prioritize healthy habits – a balanced diet, regular sleep, and gentle exercise. It’s also important to stay mentally active – reading, doing puzzles, or engaging in social activities. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. A puzzle, you say? I do enjoy a good crossword. Alright. Healthy habits… I can try. My wife will be happy to hear that. Um… yes, I do have a question. If… if it is something serious… what happens then? What are the options? I don't want to worry my wife unnecessarily, but I need to be prepared. And… will this affect my work? I enjoy what I do at the church, and I don't want to… lose that.
DOCTOR: Those are very important questions, Mr. Limtiaco, and it’s good you’re asking them. If the cognitive assessment reveals any concerns, we’ll discuss the results thoroughly and develop a personalized plan. The options depend on the specific diagnosis, but they can include medication, therapy, lifestyle modifications, and support groups. There are many resources available to help manage cognitive impairment and maintain your quality of life. As for your work, that's something we'll need to discuss further once we have more information. Many people with mild cognitive impairment can continue to work successfully, especially with appropriate support and accommodations. We can explore options like adjusting your workload or modifying your responsibilities. It's important to remember that a diagnosis doesn't necessarily mean you have to stop doing what you love. Right now, it’s important to focus on getting the necessary information. We’ll take things one step at a time and make the best decisions together. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it, for now. It’s a lot to take in, to be honest. But I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor, and for explaining everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease, a little bit, at least. Alright. Let’s get those blood tests done, then. And schedule the assessment. Whatever needs to be done. Thank you, Doctor Glowka.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll explain the process to you. And my assistant, Emily, will be in touch to schedule your cognitive assessment. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you every step of the way. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Limtiaco. I look forward to discussing the results with you.
