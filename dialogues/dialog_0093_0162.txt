DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, no offense, but I got things to do. It's... my stomach, I guess. Been feeling kinda puffy lately. Bloated. That’s it, really. Don't need a whole song and dance about it.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Mr. Kristofik. I appreciate your directness. "Puffy and bloated" is a good starting point. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, more details. Fine. It happens… mostly after I eat, I think. Though, honestly, I don’t always remember what I ate. Long days, you know? Pile driving... it takes it out of you. It just… gets bigger. Feels like I'm gonna pop sometimes. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. And embarrassing. Look, is that enough? I really don't have time for a twenty-question game.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's quite helpful, thank you. “Mostly after eating, not painful, just uncomfortable and embarrassing.” And you mentioned you sometimes don’t recall what you’ve eaten – that’s useful information too. Just to clarify, when you say “lately,” how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know exactly. Weeks, maybe? Months? It's all kinda blurring together since… well, since my wife passed. Things just… aren’t as routine anymore. I'm not good with dates, doc. Never was. Just started bothering me enough to come in, I suppose. Look, can we skip the history lesson and get to figuring out what’s wrong?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kristofik. I understand. Losing your wife must be incredibly difficult, and it’s completely understandable that routines have been disrupted. We’ll focus on getting to the bottom of this discomfort. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe what you typically eat on a usual day, even if you don’t remember every detail?
PATIENT: Ugh, food. Okay, look, I eat to work. It's gotta be quick, easy. Sandwiches, usually. Lots of protein. Sometimes fast food. I don’t… fuss over it. I grab whatever's convenient. I don’t do a lot of cooking. And, honestly, sometimes I just… don’t eat. If I'm busy, I just forget. Is that good enough? I'm not a gourmet chef, doc. Just tell me if I'm gonna die, alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kristofik. “Quick, easy, protein-focused, sometimes skipped meals.” That gives me a good sense. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… no, not really. I mean, I'm tired a lot, but that’s just… life, you know? Pile driving. Long hours. Bad sleep. I get a little heartburn sometimes, but that happens with pretty much everything I eat. No… I don’t think so. Just the puffiness. And the embarrassment. Really, that’s the worst part. Look, are we getting anywhere? This is kinda annoying, honestly. I got a job to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere, Mr. Kristofik. “Tiredness, heartburn, mostly bloating.” I understand your frustration, and I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Before we proceed, I'd like to ask about your bowel habits. Have you noticed any changes in your frequency or consistency of your stools recently?
PATIENT: Seriously? Doc, do you have to? This is… personal. Look, I go when I go, alright? Sometimes it’s regular, sometimes it’s not. What does that even have to do with my stomach being puffed up? I don’t see the connection. This is… ridiculous. Just tell me if I need a pill or something and let me go. I got things to do, people waiting. I really don’t need to discuss this. .
DOCTOR: You are right to question me, Mr. Kristofik. I apologize if I’m pushing too far. It's just that changes in bowel habits can be relevant, but I completely respect your boundaries. Let’s put that aside. Have you tried anything to alleviate the bloating?
