DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Yadao. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s about… going to the bathroom. Or, not going, really. It’s been difficult lately. Takes me a good while to start, and even then… it’s not a strong stream, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty with urination. Let’s try to get a little more detail here. When did you first start noticing this problem?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It wasn’t sudden, not like flipping a switch. Probably… six months ago, maybe? It started as just taking a little longer to get going, and I figured it was just age. But it’s gotten worse steadily since then. Not a lot at a time, just… little by little. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Gradual onset over six months. And you mentioned not a strong stream. Is it a weak stream from the very beginning, or does it start strong and then weaken?
PATIENT: It starts… well, it’s never strong, if that makes sense. It’s more like… it dribbles a bit to begin with, then gets a little better, but it’s never really powerful. Not like it used to be, anyway. I don’t strain or anything, just… not much pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a weak stream from the start, not a sudden change in force. Do you feel like you completely empty your bladder when you go, or do you feel like there's always some left over?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I think I do, mostly. But sometimes, just a little while after I go, I feel like I could go a bit more. Not a lot, but… a little bit. It’s annoying, really. I have to go back sometimes within an hour or so. Does that happen to people?
DOCTOR: It does happen, Ms. Yadao. That feeling of incomplete emptying and having to return soon after is something we definitely want to investigate. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning, not stinging, nothing like that. It’s just… inconvenient. And a little worrying, I suppose. It doesn't hurt to go, just… difficult and not very satisfying. I don't have any fever or chills either, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, burning, fever, or chills. Good. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: No, not really. It looks pretty normal, as far as I can tell. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink a lot of tea, so I figured that was just from that. The smell is… well, it smells like urine. I haven't noticed anything unusual. I try to drink plenty of fluids, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, have you had any recent illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Nothing major. I had a bad cold last winter, but that was months ago. And I had my gallbladder out… oh, goodness, almost twenty years ago now. That was fine, recovered well from that. No other surgeries or anything serious. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know? Nothing that would affect… this. I don't think so, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent illnesses or surgeries. Now, a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, so I take a small pill for that every day. It’s… lisinopril, I think it’s called. And I was told I was pre-diabetic a while back, but I’ve been watching my sugar intake and it seemed to go down. I haven’t had it checked recently, though. My Medicare covers checkups, but… I’m always putting them off. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does matter, Ms. Yadao. Both high blood pressure and pre-diabetes can affect bladder function. And lisinopril… Okay. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years and never had a reaction. Penicillin, aspirin… all the usual ones. I haven’t taken anything new recently, just the lisinopril for my blood pressure. I'm pretty careful about what I put in my body. I don't like taking pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family had problems with their bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother… she had some sort of trouble with her kidneys when she was older, I think. She was always tired and had to go to the doctor a lot. But she never talked much about it. And my father… he just had the usual things, heart trouble mostly. I don’t remember anyone specifically having problems with their bladder, no. We weren't a very talkative family, if you know what I mean. Everything was kept to ourselves.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll just listen to your abdomen and check your reflexes. It's pretty straightforward. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I don’t mind at all. It's probably a good idea to check everything. Just let me know if it's going to be… uncomfortable, okay? I’m not very good with pain, you know. But I understand you need to do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. Just lie back on the exam table, and I’ll listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. I’ll also gently tap on it. Then I’ll just check your reflexes in your legs. It shouldn't be painful. Okay. Breathing normally. Sounds are… normal. No masses palpated. Reflexes are… slightly diminished, but that could be age related. I'm going to do a quick neurological exam to make sure everything is normal. Everything appears normal neurologically. Now, I'd like to check a urine sample to see if there's any infection or other issues. I'll give you a cup, and just collect a mid-stream sample. There are instructions in the bathroom. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. A urine sample, of course. I figured that would be part of it. I'll go do that now. It's… a little awkward, sometimes, getting everything just right, but I'll manage. Just let me know if you need anything.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Yadao. Just collect a mid-stream sample, and bring the cup back when you're ready. I'll be right here. I’ll analyze the sample once I receive it.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I tried to follow the instructions as best as I could. It wasn’t easy, but I got it. Hopefully it's enough.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. Okay. The dipstick analysis is negative for infection. No blood or protein detected. That's good. However, there is a slightly elevated level of glucose. This confirms what you said about potentially being pre-diabetic, and this can contribute to bladder symptoms. We should probably check your blood sugar levels just to be sure and to get a better baseline. I'll order a complete blood panel. In the meantime, based on your symptoms and the findings so far, it's possible you have overactive bladder, or a mild form of urinary retention. To get a more accurate picture of how much urine you're actually retaining, I’d like to do a post-void residual volume test. This involves using a small ultrasound device after you urinate to see how much urine is left in your bladder. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An ultrasound, you say? To see how much is left… Yes, that sounds sensible. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’d rather know what's going on, than just guess about it. Glucose levels, ultrasound… it all sounds very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out. It's been worrying me a bit, you know. But knowing something is better than nothing. So yes, an ultrasound sounds fine. When can we do that?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I can perform the post-void residual volume test right here in the office. It won't take long. You'll urinate like normal, and then I'll use the ultrasound to measure the amount of urine remaining. I'm also ordering the complete blood panel. I'll need to draw a small amount of blood from your arm. The lab is just down the hall. It’s best to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. While we wait for the blood results, I’m going to recommend some lifestyle modifications. Reduce caffeine and alcohol intake, as those can irritate the bladder. And try to drink plenty of water, but avoid drinking large amounts right before bedtime. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… reasonable. Less coffee, more water, no bedtime drinking. I can manage that. I do enjoy my tea, but I can cut back on that too, I suppose. And getting the blood drawn… I don’t love needles, but it’s necessary, I understand. I guess you want me to go and schedule the blood work now? And then we do the… the measurement, after I go to the bathroom? It sounds like a lot, but I'm glad you have a plan. Are there any brochures or anything I can take with me about overactive bladder? Just so I can read up on it a bit, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're exactly right. Go ahead and schedule the blood work. The nurse at the front desk can help you with that. I've printed a brochure on overactive bladder for you. It explains the condition and some of the treatment options. After you've scheduled the blood work, we’ll do the post-void residual volume test right here. It’s a very simple, non-invasive procedure. Just urinate as normally as possible, and then we’ll use the ultrasound to get a measurement. Based on the results of the blood work and the ultrasound, we can determine the best course of action. It might be as simple as lifestyle changes, or we might need to consider medication. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful and explained everything very clearly. I feel a lot better knowing what’s going on and that we have a plan to figure it out. I’ll go schedule the blood work now and then come back for the… measurement. Thank you again, Doctor Vanochten. I appreciate your time. And the brochure.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Yadao. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask the nurse if you have any questions. I’ll see you soon.
