DOCTOR: Hello Nadene, welcome. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this cough. It just won't go away. It's been… oh, goodness, a good month now, I reckon. It started small, just a little tickle, but now… now it feels like something’s stuck in my chest. And it makes me so tired. I get so winded just walking to the kitchen.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer. It's hard to keep track, you know? Time flies when you're… well, when you're my age! But definitely over three weeks, and closer to a month, I think. It's been getting worse steadily, not sudden-like. More bothersome each day.
DOCTOR: Right, steadily worsening over about a month. And you mentioned feeling tired and getting winded easily… is that new, or have you been feeling that way for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, the tiredness… that’s been creeping up on me for a while now, honestly. Maybe six months or so. I just figured it was… old age, you know? But the windedness… that's more recent. It really started with this cough. Before, I could still get around, do my little chores, but now… even making a sandwich feels like a big job. It feels different than just being tired, it's like I can't get enough air.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the tiredness has been gradual, over about six months, but the shortness of breath is more recent, linked to the cough. Do you have any other symptoms along with the cough and tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my ankles have been swelling up a bit, especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just from the heat, we've had some warm weather lately. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little fluttery in my chest, like my heart is skipping a beat. Not painful, just… noticeable. Oh, and I’ve been waking up a couple of times at night, feeling like I can't quite get comfortable. I have to use an extra pillow to prop myself up.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankles swelling, especially in the evenings, a fluttering sensation in your chest, and waking up short of breath at night needing extra pillows… that’s helpful information. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats with all of this?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or night sweats. Definitely not. I haven’t felt sick like that at all. Just… worn out. And this cough keeps me up, that’s the worst of it. It's a dry cough mostly, doesn't bring up much at all, just feels scratchy. I tried some honey, but it doesn't seem to do much good.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills or night sweats, and a dry cough that doesn't produce much mucus. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it hasn’t been the best, to be honest. I don’t feel hungry, not like I used to. I’m eating, but not much. And I think… yes, I’ve lost a little weight. My clothes feel a bit looser, you know? I haven't weighed myself exactly, but I can tell. Not a lot, but enough to notice. It's probably from not eating as much.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some unintentional weight loss. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my doctor – Dr. Ramirez, before he retired – he told me years ago I had something wrong with my heart. Heart failure, he called it. It's been… well, it's been a long time. I take a little water pill every day to get rid of extra water, and he gave me something for my heart, but I can’t remember the name of it now. I've been taking it for years, though, faithfully. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of getting old!
DOCTOR: Okay, heart failure diagnosed some time ago, you take a water pill and another medication for your heart, and a history of pneumonia. Do you remember the name of that heart medication, even approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I wish I did. It was a little white pill, I think. No, maybe it had a little bit of pink in it? I always took it with my water pill in the morning. It wasn’t a big pill, that’s for sure. I just… it’s been so long. Dr. Ramirez used to send the refills automatically to the pharmacy, and I just took them without much thought. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly in a few years, to be honest. I should have, I know. It’s just… getting out is hard these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, a small white or slightly pink pill taken with your water pill for your heart. I understand it's hard to remember details, and that getting out can be difficult. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat most everything, and I’ve never had trouble with any medicine. I used to get stung by bees sometimes when I was gardening, but that just hurt, it didn’t make me sick or anything. So, no, I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Not even a puff. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I always listened to my mother. My husband, God rest his soul, he smoked a little when he was young, but he quit years before we met. So, no, I've never smoked, and I don’t have any habits like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no history of smoking. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Nadene. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your ankles. Just so I can get a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. My heart always races a little when I get nervous, so don’t be alarmed if you hear that!
DOCTOR: Okay, I will keep that in mind. Just relax as best you can. I do hear a bit of a rapid rhythm, as you mentioned, and a slight murmur. It’s not overly concerning at this point, but we’ll want to investigate further. I also hear some crackling sounds in the lower parts of your lungs, especially on your right side. That could indicate some fluid buildup. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 160/95. And yes, there is some noticeable swelling in your ankles. It feels soft and pitting.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? Fluid in my lungs… just like Dr. Ramirez warned me about. He said my heart wasn't very strong, and that it could cause trouble breathing. Is that what’s happening now? And my blood pressure… I try to eat healthy, but I do love my salt. What do we do now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Nadene, and it's good you remember Dr. Ramirez's warnings. The crackling in your lungs and the swelling in your ankles could indicate fluid buildup due to your heart condition, what we call congestive heart failure. The elevated blood pressure isn’t helping, either. Now, I want to order some tests to get a clearer picture. I'll order a chest X-ray to see how much fluid is in your lungs. I'll also order a blood test – a CBC and a BNP – to check your overall health and a specific marker that helps us assess heart failure. And an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. I'm tired of being tired, and I'm worried about not being able to take care of myself. Will the tests tell me how bad it is? And will I have to stay in the hospital?
DOCTOR: The tests will give us a better understanding of how your heart is functioning and the extent of the fluid buildup. It's too early to say whether you'll need to be hospitalized, Nadene. It depends on the results of these tests. If the fluid buildup is severe and you're having a lot of trouble breathing, then a short hospital stay might be necessary to help get things under control. But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and then we’ll get you scheduled for the chest X-ray. It’s a fairly quick procedure. Would you like me to explain anything about the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand, Doctor. Blood tests and a picture of my chest. It’s alright. Just… when will I get the results? I worry about being alone with this, you know? My daughter lives far away, and I don’t want to bother her unless I really need to.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nadene. It's perfectly reasonable to worry. The lab results usually come back within 24-48 hours, and the X-ray results should be available sooner, within a few hours. I’ll review them as soon as they're available, and the nurse will call you with the results, or schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in person. If anything seems urgent, they will let you know immediately. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you feel your symptoms are worsening at any time. We’re here to help. In the meantime, try to rest and limit your salt intake as much as possible. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while you wait for the results?
PATIENT: That’s… very kind of you, Doctor. Knowing someone is looking out for me helps a lot. I think I’ll just go home and rest, like you said. And I’ll try to be careful with the salt. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it more than you know. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the next steps. Get some rest, and take care of yourself. I will be in touch soon.
