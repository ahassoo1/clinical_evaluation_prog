DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. I see here you're 33 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. The paper… the paper said patient education? I don't… really remember why I'm here. My husband made the appointment. He says I need to… learn something. I work with metal, you know? All day. Lots of noise.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, it’s not uncommon to feel a little unclear about appointments, particularly if someone else has arranged them. It is rather unusual to be referred for 'patient education' without a specific concern noted. Do you perhaps have any symptoms or health issues that your husband may have mentioned?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No, not really. I get tired, of course. Metal is heavy! And my hands… they ache sometimes. But that’s just the job. He just said the doctor wanted to talk about… staying healthy. He worries too much, that man. He always has.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and hand aches… Right. And these aches, are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Mostly when I've been working a long time. Like… after a big job. Not every day. Sometimes I just… rub them. They’re just… work pains. You know? It’s not… a big deal. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Still, it's prudent to investigate any persistent discomfort. Let me just pull up your file here… Hmm. It appears there’s no prior medical history listed. Has it been a long time since you’ve seen a doctor, Ms. Fontanazza?
PATIENT: A long time? Yes. Very long. I… I don't really go to doctors. My husband, he goes. For his… things. I just… work. I haven't needed to. Not until he made this appointment. Honestly, I don’t even know what he wants me to learn.
DOCTOR: Very well. Perhaps he’s concerned about the cumulative effects of your work environment. Noise exposure, repetitive motions… these can lead to various health issues. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about the type of metalwork you do?
PATIENT: Metal… we make… things. For buildings. You know, the… the frame. And… the outside stuff. Lots of cutting and… bending. And hammering. And… the noise. So much noise. It’s loud all day. Very, very loud. Is that what he wanted me to talk about? The noise?
DOCTOR: The noise is certainly a significant factor. Prolonged exposure to loud noise can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus… We'll need to assess your hearing. Are you experiencing any ringing in your ears, or difficulty hearing conversations?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Sometimes. Not all the time. But… after a really loud day, yes. Like a… a high-pitched sound. Very annoying. And sometimes I have to ask people to… speak up. My husband says I don’t listen. He thinks I’m ignoring him. It's the noise, I tell you. The noise makes it hard to hear.
DOCTOR: I see. That's a common complaint with noise-induced hearing loss. Alright, Ms. Fontanazza, I’d like to conduct a brief hearing test. It's a simple procedure, just involves wearing headphones and responding to sounds. It will help us determine the extent of any hearing loss. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Headphones…? Sounds… okay. If it gets him to stop worrying. But it will take time. I have to get back to work this afternoon. We have a big job. The boss is… not patient. Can it be quick?
DOCTOR: Of course. It shouldn't take more than fifteen to twenty minutes. I'll explain everything as we go. Now, if you’ll just follow me to the audiology booth… We'll start there. And then, if you don't mind, I'd like to briefly examine your hands, just to assess the level of discomfort and any potential inflammation.
PATIENT: Inflammation…? My hands are just… rough. From the metal. It’s normal. All the workers have hands like this. But… okay. Headphones first. Then hands. As long as it doesn’t take too long. Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very good. We'll start with the hearing test. It’s a soundproof room, so we can accurately assess your hearing thresholds. Please have a seat and I’ll explain the procedure. It involves listening for a series of beeps at different pitches and volumes. Just indicate when you hear a sound, even if it's very faint. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Beeps…? Sounds… boring. Will it be loud beeps? Because my ears are already ringing a little. And… what if I don't hear them? What if I fail? My husband will be very upset.
DOCTOR: The beeps won’t be uncomfortably loud, Ms. Fontanazza. And there’s no 'failing'. This isn’t a test of your ability, it’s simply a measurement of your hearing sensitivity. We'll adjust the volume to a comfortable level. If at any point you feel any discomfort, just let me know and we'll stop. Alright, let's begin. Just focus on the sounds and raise your hand when you hear something. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Okay… ready. But hurry, please. I don’t like being in here. It’s… strange. Start the beeps. And make them quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now… Do you hear anything?
PATIENT: …No. Nothing. Just… quiet. Very quiet. I told you. It’s the noise. It's ruined my ears. Make them louder. Maybe then I'll hear something.
DOCTOR: Alright… And now?
PATIENT: …Still nothing. Wait… wait a minute… yes! I think… I think I hear something. Very faint. Like a… a tiny buzz. Is that it? It’s very quiet though. Almost nothing.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s good. We'll continue at that level and see if we can identify the lowest volume you can consistently detect. Now… How about these sounds?
PATIENT: …No. Nothing at all. Not even a tiny buzz. Just… silence. This is pointless. I can’t hear anything. I told you the noise… My husband will be very disappointed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. That’s enough for now. It appears there is some degree of hearing loss, particularly in the higher frequencies. We’ll need to discuss the results further. Let’s go back to the examination room and I’ll explain everything in more detail. It's important to address this to prevent further deterioration. And then we can look at your hands. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… please don’t make it take too long. I need to get back to work. And… please don’t tell my husband it’s bad. He worries too much. Just say it’s… a little bit quiet. That's all. I don't want any trouble.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fontanazza. We'll discuss the results cautiously. Now, if you'll please have a seat, I'd like to examine your hands. I’m looking for any signs of inflammation, tenderness, or restricted movement. This won't take long. Just relax and let me take a look.
PATIENT: Fine. But be gentle. They're just… rough. Metal is hard, you know? It’s not… an injury. Just… work. Don’t make a big deal out of it. I’m used to the pain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for manual laborers to experience discomfort. I’m simply assessing the level of any inflammation or tenderness. Do you experience pain in this area when you grip something?
PATIENT: Yes. A little bit. When I’m using the… the hammer. And when I’m bending the metal. It’s not… a sharp pain. Just a dull ache. It gets worse after a long day. It’s normal. All the workers feel it. It’s the price of the job.
DOCTOR: I see. There appears to be some mild inflammation in the carpometacarpal joint of your thumb, which is consistent with De Quervain's tenosynovitis. It’s caused by repetitive hand movements and can cause pain when gripping or twisting. We can try a few things to manage the pain, such as rest, ice, and a thumb spica splint. Have you ever tried any of these methods before?
PATIENT: De… what? And a… splint? What’s a splint? I’ve never heard of any of that. Rest? I can’t rest. I have a job. I have to work. And ice…? That sounds… cold. I just rub them. That's all. I rub them until the pain goes away. Is that enough? It always has been.
DOCTOR: Rubbing can provide temporary relief, but it doesn’t address the underlying inflammation. Without proper treatment, De Quervain's tenosynovitis can worsen over time. We could consider a corticosteroid injection to reduce the inflammation, or potentially refer you to an orthopedic surgeon if it doesn't improve with conservative measures. I understand you need to work, Ms. Fontanazza, but ignoring the problem could lead to chronic pain and difficulty performing your job. Now, regarding the hearing test... It appears there's some hearing loss, especially with high frequency sounds. This is common with noise exposure. We can discuss some ways to protect your hearing... Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Injections? Surgery? No. Absolutely not. I don't want anything… poked or cut. Just… leave my hands alone. They work. That's all that matters. And… the hearing? I’ve always had a little trouble hearing. It's just… quiet sometimes. I don't need to hear everything. I just need to work. I just want to get this over with. What do I need to tell my husband so he stops worrying? That's all I care about.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fontanazza. I respect your wishes. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider if your symptoms worsen. Ignoring these issues could lead to long-term complications. As for your husband, you could tell him that we discussed protecting your hearing with earplugs and managing your hand pain with over-the-counter pain relievers and avoiding strenuous activities when possible. We can document that, if you wish. I can write a brief note for him, outlining these recommendations. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that would be good. Just… keep it simple. Don't make it sound too bad. He worries too much. Just… earplugs and… maybe some cream. That’s all. And please… don’t call him. He’ll just ask more questions. Just write the note. That’s all I want. I need to get back to work. Now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fontanazza. Here you go. This summarizes our discussion. It mentions protecting your hearing with earplugs and managing your hand discomfort with over-the-counter pain relief. I wish you all the best. If your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. Have a good day.
