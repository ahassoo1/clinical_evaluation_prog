DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Beinborn, is it? Yes, nice to meet you too. Um… well, my wife, she says I need to get some papers. Something about… time off? Or maybe help with things… I’m a bit foggy on it all, to be honest. It’s to do with my job, I think. Directors… something with religious activities. That’s what I do. She handles most of the paperwork usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like this visit is partially to address some documentation needs related to your work as a director of religious activities?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Papers for work. She said something about… FMLA? Or… maybe disability? I really don't recall the specifics. It’s been… a bit of a blur lately, to be honest. I just want to make sure everything's alright, and get whatever needs doing, done. Do you handle those kinds of things here?
DOCTOR: Yes, we do handle those types of requests. Before we get to the paperwork though, I’d like to understand why you might need them. Is there something specific happening with your health that's making it difficult to work?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well… it's not… a sudden thing, you see. It's just… getting older, I suppose. My memory isn't what it used to be. I forget things. Important things sometimes. It makes concentrating… difficult. And, uh… sometimes I feel a bit… unsteady. Not all the time, but enough to worry my wife. She says I should get it checked out, and get these papers… just in case. It doesn’t feel like a big deal, honestly, but she worries. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so memory problems and some unsteadiness. And this has been going on for a while now, not something sudden?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Not sudden, no. It’s… gradual. It's hard to say when it started, really. Just… slowly getting worse, I guess. A few years, at least. I still manage things, mostly. It just takes… longer. And I have to write things down constantly. My wife helps a lot, reminds me of things. It’s not ideal, but… well, that’s life, isn’t it? I still go to work every day, though. Still directing things. Still… functioning.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say “unsteady,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not… falling over unsteady, if that makes sense. More like… a bit wobbly. Like I'm not quite… balanced. Especially when I stand up quickly. Or if I turn my head too fast. It doesn't happen every time, but enough to make me cautious. I’ve not had a fall, thankfully. I just… take things slower now. And sometimes, I feel a little dizzy with it. Not a spinning dizzy, just… lightheaded. It's hard to explain. It's not constant, like I said. More… intermittent.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you for explaining that. I'm going to do a brief physical exam now, just to check your balance, coordination, and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven't had a proper examination in… well, a long time, I think. So, anything you want to check, go right ahead. Just… take it easy with the quick movements, if you don’t mind. My wife worries about me getting dizzy.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll take things slow. First, could you please stand up from the chair and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay… here I go. Just a few steps… like this. It feels a bit… wobbly, as you can see. Just trying to keep steady. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That was helpful. Now, could you please stand with your feet together, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright… feet together… eyes closed. It feels… a bit precarious, Doctor. I’m trying to stay steady.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. You can open your eyes now. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please sit back down.
PATIENT: Alright… back in the chair. Yes, that’s much better. Reflexes, you say? Sounds… thorough. Go ahead, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Reflexes are a bit on the slower side, but still present. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Alright… heart and lungs. Sounds good, Doctor. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, a long time. I’m usually quite healthy, you know. Just a bit forgetful and unsteady these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds good, a little fast but regular. Your lungs are clear. One last thing, I'd like to quickly check your vision and hearing. Just a basic screening.
PATIENT: Alright… vision and hearing. Sounds sensible. I haven’t had my eyes checked in a while either. My wife keeps telling me I should, but… well, you know how it is. Getting old, everything starts to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Your vision and hearing are a little reduced, but not dramatically. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some age-related changes, including memory problems, unsteadiness, and some decline in vision and hearing. To get a better understanding of the cause of your memory issues, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'm also going to recommend a neurological consultation with a specialist. They can perform more detailed tests to assess your cognitive function and balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work and a specialist. I trust your judgment. It's good to know what's going on, even if it's just… getting old. My wife will be relieved to hear you’re taking it seriously. And about those papers… the FMLA or disability… will these tests help with those? I need to get back to work, you see. Still got things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, the results of these tests will certainly help in determining if you qualify for FMLA or disability benefits. We can provide documentation to your employer outlining your medical condition and any limitations you may have. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activities that could worsen your unsteadiness. And please, if you experience any sudden changes in your memory or balance, or if you fall, please seek medical attention immediately. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood for the lab work. And I’ll write a referral to a neurologist. They should contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and figure things out. My wife will be very pleased. And thank you for the help with the paperwork, too. It’s a weight off my mind, knowing you'll assist with that. I appreciate it very much. I suppose I'll just wait for the nurse then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly. And don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Take care.
PATIENT: .
