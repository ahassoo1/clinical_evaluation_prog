DOCTOR: Good morning, Lakiya. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pain. A bad pain, really. I don’t… I don’t usually come to doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bad pain. I understand. It's alright to be nervous about coming in—many people feel that way. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s in my back. Lower back. Started… maybe three weeks ago? At first it was just a little ache after work, you know, from bending and lifting. But it’s gotten much worse. It hurts to stand, to sit… even to lie down sometimes. It’s a constant ache, with sharp pains that… shoot down my leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago, starting as an ache after work and now a constant pain with shooting sensations down your leg. That gives me a good starting point. Can you point to exactly where the pain is the worst?
PATIENT: Right… about here. And… it feels like it goes down the back of my leg, all the way to my… to my foot, sometimes. Not always, but often. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I see. And when you say "sharp pains," can you describe what those feel like?
PATIENT: Like… like someone is sticking me with a hot needle. Quick, and then gone, but it makes me gasp. It doesn’t happen all the time, but when it does… it’s very bad. And then just… a dull ache again. It’s… tiring. It keeps me awake at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sharp, shooting pain like a hot needle, followed by a dull ache. And it's disrupting your sleep. That’s important to know. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better or worse besides standing and sitting?
PATIENT: Hmm… lying flat on my back sometimes helps a little. But not much. And… bending over is very bad. Even getting dressed is hard now. It feels like something is… stuck. Like a muscle pulled very tight. Walking doesn't help, and doesn't make it worse, I guess. Just… is.
DOCTOR: Alright. So lying flat offers some minimal relief, bending over makes it worse, and walking doesn't seem to significantly affect it. Have you tried any medications or treatments for the pain so far?
PATIENT: No. I haven't. I… I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. My husband… he always said to avoid them if possible. He… he’s gone now. I've just been trying to rest. And… tough it out. It’s not working very well. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to prefer avoiding medication. And thank you for sharing about your husband. It's good you have Medicare as well, that will help with options. Before we proceed, and to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Not much. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox. Nothing serious. Broke my arm once when I was a little girl. But nothing… chronic. No surgeries, no long-term illnesses. I’m… mostly healthy. I work hard, I eat… okay. That’s about it. I’ve always been strong. This back… this is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a generally healthy history with no chronic illnesses or surgeries. That’s helpful to know. And no known allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not to food, not to anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I… I don't even get much of a cold, usually. This pain… it’s just so frustrating. It's slowing me down. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. And I understand your frustration - wanting to get back to work is important. Now, do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter things like ibuprofen or aspirin?
PATIENT: No. Like I said, I try to avoid pills. I haven’t taken anything. I tried a heating pad a few times, but it didn't really help much. It felt… nice for a minute, but the pain always came back. I just… I don’t know what to do. It’s been three weeks, and it's getting worse, not better.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or significant relief from a heating pad. I hear you, and it’s good you’re telling me it’s getting worse despite trying to rest. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… fine. I guess. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have to get back to work… eventually. Just… be gentle, please. It hurts.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to have you lie down on your back. Can you point to where the pain is the worst right now?
PATIENT: Right… here. It’s… it’s all over, really, but this is the worst part. And… if you press here, it sends a shock down my leg. Be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m going to gently press here. Tell me if you feel any pain, and where it goes. Okay, I’m noticing some muscle spasm on the left side. And you’re right, that does seem to reproduce some radiating pain down your left leg. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. This will just involve me testing how you respond to some simple commands. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… fine. Just… be quick, please. It makes me nervous. I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm testing your reflexes now. And now, can you lift your right leg straight up while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that hurts. I can’t… I can’t lift it very high. It feels like something is pulling on my back. It's… a sharp pain. Can I stop now? I feel a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll stop there. That’s good to know. You’ve got a positive straight leg raise on the left side, which means it’s likely irritating a nerve. And you’re right, that’s concerning. You also have some muscle spasm in the lower back. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may have a lumbar radiculopathy, which means a pinched nerve in your lower back. However, to confirm that diagnosis and rule out other causes, I'd like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An… MRI? Is that… expensive? And will it take a long time? I have work… I need to get back to work. I don't want anything that will keep me from working. What does it… show? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Lakiya. An MRI will give us a detailed image of your spine, showing if there’s anything pressing on the nerves, like a herniated disc or bone spur. Medicare should cover it, but we’ll need to verify your specific plan details. The scan itself takes about 30-45 minutes, and it doesn’t hurt – you’ll just lie still inside the machine. As for seriousness, it could be something relatively minor, like a muscle strain, but it could also be a more significant issue. That’s why we need the MRI to get a clear picture. It’s better to know what we’re dealing with so we can get you the right treatment and get you back to work as soon as possible. Do you have any other health conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just… the pain. And… my husband. He always said… he always took care of things. I don’t know what I’m doing. I just want the pain to stop. And I need to get back to work. That’s all. Can we… can we just get the MRI done? Please? The sooner, the better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lakiya. You're right to want to get this addressed quickly, and I completely respect that. It’s also perfectly understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed right now, especially with everything that’s going on. We will get the MRI scheduled as soon as possible. I’m going to write an order for it now. Our scheduling department will call you to set up an appointment. They'll also verify your Medicare coverage. In the meantime, to help manage the pain, I can prescribe a short course of a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory medication. These can provide some relief while we wait for the MRI results. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that sounds good. If it will help. I don’t want to get… addicted to anything, but if it will make the pain better… yes. Please. Just… the sooner I can get back to work, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your concern about addiction, and I assure you a short course of these medications shouldn’t cause any problems. We’ll keep the dosage as low as possible and only for a limited time. Alright, I’ve sent the prescriptions to your pharmacy. They should be ready within a few hours. I’m also going to give you a handout with instructions on how to take the medications and some gentle exercises you can do to help strengthen your back. Now, I want you to call the office immediately if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or high fever. These could be signs of a more serious problem. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For listening. For trying to help. I just want the pain to stop. And I need to get back to work. That’s all. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lakiya. I’m here to help. Remember, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this and get you back on your feet as soon as possible. Take care, and I’ll see you after the MRI. .
