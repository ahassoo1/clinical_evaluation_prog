DOCTOR: Hi Avril, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. My… how you say… the nice lady on the phone, she told me to come for a check-up. A talk, she said. I am… a little confused, yes? I feel… okay. Just old, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general check-up. No worries about being confused, that happens! It's good you're coming in. Just routine, to make sure everything is as it should be. “Just old” can sometimes mean a few things, and we want to rule those out. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to come in, even if it was prompted by the phone call?
PATIENT: Hmm. My son, Tomas, he worry a lot. He said I should get checked. He say… “Mom, you work too hard, you don’t take care of yourself!” He is right, of course. I fix cars all day. Very strong work, yes? And sometimes… sometimes my back hurts. Not all the time, but… enough to notice. I think he make the call. He always make sure I am… okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tomas sounds like a good son. Fixing cars is very strong work! So, the back pain is the main thing, it sounds like, but let's talk about that more. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It is… hard to say. Not sharp, not like when I fall, you understand? More… dull. Like a heavy weight. Sometimes it goes down my leg, a little. Not always. And after I work all day, it is worse, of course. When I sit for too long, also. Standing is… better, usually. I try to move. I do not sit for long. But the cars… they need fixing!
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache, sometimes radiating down the leg, worse after work and with prolonged sitting, better with movement. That gives me a good starting point. Now, has this pain been getting worse lately?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Not much, but… a little. Maybe a few months now? It used to go away after a good night sleep. But now… it stays a little bit, even after. Tomas, he say I am getting old. Maybe he is right!
DOCTOR: Well, getting older does come with some changes, that's true. But we want to be sure there isn’t something else going on. You said it's been a few months – any specific injury that might have started it?
PATIENT: No, no injury. I… I maybe lifted a heavy engine part, one time. But I do that all the time! It was… maybe six months ago? I don’t remember exactly. It is hard to say. I do a lot of lifting. It just… started to hurt more. Slowly. Like a little fire, always burning.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no specific incident, just a gradual onset of pain associated with work. Let's talk about other things. Do you have any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes my feet feel… tired. After a long day, you understand? But not numb. Not weak. I can walk fine, I can stand all day. I can drive my truck, no problem. Tomas, he worry I will fall. But I am careful. Very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or weakness, just fatigue after a long day. That’s good to know. Now, let’s move away from the back pain for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions - things like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm. Doctor told me… many years ago… my blood pressure was a little high. But I take the pills. Every day. I think it is okay now. I go to the doctor, he check. Everything was… good, he said. I don't remember exactly what he said. I do not have… the sugar problem. No, no sugar. I like sweet things, but… I try to not eat too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, currently managed with medication. That’s good you’re keeping up with that. Do you know the name of the medication you're taking?
PATIENT: No, I do not remember the name. It is… a small white pill. I take it every morning with my coffee. The doctor, he give it to me. He write the name on the… paper. But I lose the paper. I am sorry. I just take the pills. It is okay now, the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: That's alright, don't worry about it. We can look it up. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. I have no problem. I have been… everywhere, you understand? I eat all kinds of food. No… itchy skin, no… trouble breathing. Nothing. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. And just to confirm, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: No, only the small white pill for my blood pressure. I do not take anything else. Just the pill. And sometimes… sometimes I take a little bit of… how you say… for the pain. When the back is very bad. But not often. It is… a blue pill. I buy it at the… the store. Not from the doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you occasionally take a blue pill for pain, purchased over-the-counter. What is the name of that pill, if you recall?
PATIENT: I… I do not remember the name. It is… for pain. Like ibuprofen, maybe? Or… naproxen? Something like that. It helps a little bit, but not much. I do not like to take it. Only when the pain is very bad. I try to rest instead. It is… not good to take too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father… he had a bad heart. He was sick for a long time. And my mother… she had arthritis. Very bad in her hands. She could not… hold things. And my sister… she had… how you say… the woman sickness. Cancer, I think. She was very young. It was… very sad.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear that. That’s a lot. Okay, so a history of heart disease, arthritis, and cancer in your family. Finally, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. My husband… he smoked, but he stopped many years ago. And no, no alcohol. I do not like it. It makes me… dizzy. I drink water. Mostly water. And coffee, of course. Every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Where should I go?
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, if you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be perfect. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. I hope my back is not too… noisy.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a few deep breaths for me, please. Everything sounds clear so far. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from talking or just a bit of anxiety. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Good, good. Both reflexes are present. Finally, I’m going to check the range of motion in your back. Can you bend forward, and then bend backward?
PATIENT: Okay. Oh… that is… a little sore. But I can do it. It is my back, you understand. It always hurts a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. There is some tenderness, and your range of motion is slightly limited. I also notice some muscle spasms. Okay, and does this hurt when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, right there. That is… very sore. Like a… a knot. Very tight. That is where it always hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like you have some muscle strain and spasms in your lower back. Given your history and the exam findings, I’m thinking this is likely related to your work – lifting heavy objects repeatedly. To rule out anything more serious, like a pinched nerve or a problem with the discs in your spine, I'd like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Hmm. Is it… safe? I have heard things… about the… the radiation. But… if you think it is necessary, yes, okay. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever is best to find out what is wrong. But… not too much radiation, please?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. The amount of radiation from an X-ray is very low these days, and the benefits of finding out what's going on far outweigh the risks. We take every precaution to minimize your exposure. Okay, great. I'll write an order for the X-ray, and the technician will call you to schedule it. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen, as you mentioned – and some gentle stretching exercises. I’ll give you a handout with those instructions. Also, it's really important to focus on proper lifting techniques at work. Do you have any back support or a lifting belt?
PATIENT: No, I do not have a lifting belt. Never used one. I just… lift the cars. Carefully, I think. But… maybe a belt would help. Thank you. This is very helpful. I will try the stretching exercises. And I will try to be more careful. Tomas will be happy to hear I am taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. A lifting belt can definitely provide some extra support. We can discuss that further if the X-ray doesn’t show anything significant. For now, let's review these instructions together. It outlines the recommended dosage for the pain relievers, as well as some gentle stretches you can do several times a day. If the pain doesn’t improve after a week or two, or if it gets worse, please call the office and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You explained everything very clearly. Stretching… and the pills… and be careful lifting. And the X-ray. That is a lot. Maybe… should I stop lifting heavy things until I know what is wrong? Tomas would say I should. But… I have work to do.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question. Ideally, yes, it would be best to avoid heavy lifting until we get the results of the X-ray. That will give your back a chance to rest and recover. I know that's not always easy, especially with your work, but it could prevent further injury. If you absolutely have to lift something, try to use proper technique – keep your back straight, bend your knees, and lift with your legs. Avoid twisting or bending while lifting. I will write a note for your work stating that you have been evaluated for back pain and are under my care, and recommending limited lifting for now. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That would be very helpful. A note for my work… that would be perfect. Tomas will be so relieved. He always worries about me. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind and patient. I feel much better now, knowing what to do. I think… I think that is everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help. Here's the note for your work. Just to recap: We’ve ordered an X-ray of your lower back. I’ve recommended over-the-counter pain relievers and gentle stretching exercises. I’ve also written a note for your work, recommending limited lifting. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like numbness, weakness, or difficulty controlling your bladder or bowels – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that is everything. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburrough. You have been very helpful. I will call when the X-ray place calls. And I will try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Avril. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And remember, listen to your body.
