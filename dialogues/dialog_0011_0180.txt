DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, doc, I don't have all day. It's this tiredness. Just...always tired. And I've been...eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I crave it. It's embarrassing, okay? It just…happens. And it's getting worse. Is that enough for you?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cantoran. Thank you for sharing that with me, and please don’t feel embarrassed. We are here to help, and understanding all aspects of your concerns is important. So, you're experiencing persistent fatigue and you've noticed a craving and consumption of dirt – what we call geophagy – that is increasing in frequency. Could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Frequency? What even is frequency? Look, I just feel weak. Like my batteries are always low. It’s been going on for…a while. Months, I guess. Hard to say, honestly. Everything kinda blends together these days. I used to be able to keep up with things, but now…forget it. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. Does that make sense? And the dirt...it's like, a feeling I need it. It doesn't even taste good!
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Cantoran. “Frequency” simply refers to how often something occurs. So, how often are you experiencing this fatigue – daily, several times a week, or less often?
PATIENT: Ugh, every day, okay? Every day. And the dirt...most days too. Not huge amounts, but…enough. I find myself…wandering around the yard, looking for it. It's stupid, I know. My husband...he would have... Never mind. Just…every day. Both of them. Is there a point to all these questions? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran, and I apologize if the questions feel tedious. They are necessary to build a complete picture of your health. Now, let’s delve a bit deeper into this fatigue. Does anything seem to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Better or worse... Honestly, not really. It's just…always there. Maybe a little less bad if I sleep, but even then I wake up feeling tired. And I don't even sleep well. Restless, you know? Tossing and turning. And the dirt…I don’t think anything makes that better or worse. It just...happens when I feel this…empty feeling. It's hard to explain. Look, I'm a CNC programmer, not a doctor. I deal with metal and numbers, not feelings.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. It sounds incredibly frustrating to experience fatigue that doesn't seem to respond to rest. And it’s perfectly alright if it’s difficult to articulate these feelings. Now, let’s move on to some other areas. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and the craving for dirt?
PATIENT: Symptoms... Let me think. My stomach's been a little off, I guess. Not like, sick, just... unsettled. And I've been a bit…forgetful. Worse than usual, anyway. I used to be really good with details, but now I misplace things all the time. Even simple stuff. And my hands…they've been shaky. Not constantly, but sometimes. Does that count? Honestly, I just feel…old. And run down. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Those are all very important things to mention, Ms. Cantoran. Unsettled stomach, increased forgetfulness, and shakiness – those could certainly be related. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, history... Everything's a blur. My husband handled all that stuff. He took me to all the doctors. I… I think I had high blood pressure, once. They gave me pills. I don't even remember what they were called. And… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. That's about all I can recall. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly since… well, since he passed. It's just been easier to ignore things. I figured it was just getting old.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall specific details. It’s common for patients to have gaps in their medical history, especially after a loss. Now, regarding medications – are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Not right now. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills…a long time ago. My husband...he used to remind me. Now, nothing. Just…trying to get through the day. I don't really bother with pills and stuff. What's the point, honestly? They never seemed to do much good anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life. Not that I know of, anyway. I eat pretty much everything. Used to love spicy food, but even that doesn't taste good anymore. Everything just...tastes bland. Look, are we almost done? I really need to get back to the shop. Got a deadline looming. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s discuss your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history? That's a mess. My mother had…something with her heart, I think. She died young. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. Always complaining about his sugar. But honestly, I wasn't close to either of them. I barely knew them. So I don't really know much about what they had. I'm not sure it matters anyway. I got enough problems of my own. Can we just skip this part? I’m really not good with remembering stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cantoran. We can skip that part if you prefer. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, lifestyle? Please. I work. I sleep. I eat dirt. That's my lifestyle. I used to drink a little wine with dinner, but not anymore. Doesn't taste good, like everything else. And I definitely don't smoke or do drugs. I'm a CNC programmer, not a…well, you get the idea. I don't have time for any of that nonsense. Can we please be done now? I’m starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. One last area - Do you have any pets?
PATIENT: Pets? No! Absolutely not. Filthy creatures. I can barely handle my own mess, let alone some animal's. My husband…he liked cats. I tolerated them. But since he passed, no. No pets. Just…me. And the dirt, I guess. Now can we finally wrap this up? I need to get home. I'm exhausted just talking about all this. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. Thank you for your patience and honesty. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a neurological exam to assess your memory and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, another thing? Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The sooner I'm out of here, the better. I got things to do, you know? I'm a busy woman, even if I am tired all the time. Just…be quick about it, okay? And try not to poke me too much. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cantoran. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out. Your heart rate is slightly elevated at 88 beats per minute, and your rhythm is regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but I do detect some mild diminished breath sounds at the bases. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, which is mildly elevated. I’m going to check your pulse in both of your wrists. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Now, I'll perform a simple neurological exam. Can you tell me your name and today’s date?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? Can’t you just tell me what’s wrong? I don’t need all these tests. My name is Hedy Cantoran. And today is… August 2nd. 2025, I think. Is that good enough? I got more important things to worry about than remembering dates. This is a waste of my time, you know? Just tell me what’s going on and give me something to fix it. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary physical exam findings, there are several possibilities we need to investigate. The fatigue, geophagy, forgetfulness, hand tremors, and elevated blood pressure are all concerning. The geophagy is particularly noteworthy. It can be associated with iron deficiency anemia, pica related to nutritional deficiencies, or, less commonly, underlying psychological conditions. The fatigue and forgetfulness could be related to a number of factors, including iron deficiency, thyroid problems, or even early signs of cognitive decline. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count to check for anemia, iron studies to assess your iron levels, a thyroid panel to evaluate your thyroid function, a basic metabolic panel to assess kidney function and electrolytes, and a Vitamin D level. We may also consider other tests depending on the results of these initial tests. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Seriously? Look, I don't do tests. I do metal. Numbers. I don't have time for needles and waiting and… all that. Can't you just give me a pill? Something to make it stop? I don’t understand all this “iron” and “thyroid” stuff. I just want to feel better. I got a deadline, okay? This is cutting into my work time. And I don’t have insurance, so who’s gonna pay for all this, anyway? Honestly, this is a disaster. Can’t you just tell me what’s wrong and give me something? I’m starting to get a headache. A really bad one. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran, and I apologize for the inconvenience. I recognize you are concerned about cost and time constraints. Given your reluctance to pursue extensive testing at this time, and acknowledging your financial constraints, I will not order a full panel. However, I am concerned about the potential for iron deficiency anemia, given your fatigue and geophagy. We can start with a basic iron level check. It's a relatively inexpensive test, and it can provide valuable information. In the meantime, I recommend incorporating more iron-rich foods into your diet, such as lean meats, dark leafy greens, and fortified cereals. I also recommend staying well-hydrated and ensuring you are getting adequate rest, although I understand that may be difficult. I will also provide a referral to a social worker who can assist you in navigating resources for low-cost medical care and potentially access to financial assistance programs. Would you be willing to proceed with the basic iron level check and accept the referral to the social worker?
