DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I am Dr. EADDY. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly? I just…well, my daughter thought I should come. She worries too much, that one. Said I ought to get a check-up. I feel fine, mostly. Just…old, I suppose. Is that something you fix?
DOCTOR: “Fix” isn't quite the right word, Ms. Calvery. We aim to optimize your health and address any concerns you do have, even if you feel generally well. It's admirable of your daughter to be proactive. "Old" is a natural process, of course, but we can certainly work to ensure you remain as healthy and comfortable as possible. Perhaps we can start by discussing what "mostly fine" entails?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my knees ache when it rains, which, you know, is a lot these days. And I get tired easily. Not like…can’t get out of bed tired, just…prefer to sit. And I forget things. Not important things, usually. Where I put my glasses, that sort of thing. My daughter says it’s more than “that sort of thing,” but she always exaggerates. Is that what you're supposed to ask about? Old people problems?
DOCTOR: It’s quite common for these types of symptoms to arise with age, Ms. Calvery. However, it's important to rule out any underlying causes. Your daughter’s concern is understandable. Let's delve a bit deeper. Regarding your knees, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just…achy. Dull, mostly. Worse when it's damp, like I said. Not sharp, thankfully. It’s been going on for…years, I suppose. Honestly, I’ve just gotten used to it. I try not to walk too much. What’s the point of complaining if there’s nothing to do about it? Is this going to take long? I have my stories on…what is it, Peacock? I need to catch up.
DOCTOR: We’ll try to be efficient, Ms. Calvery. I understand your time is valuable. The pain being dull and long-standing is helpful to know. Now, you mentioned fatigue. Can you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Oh, Lord. A typical day… Well, I wake up, usually around seven, sometimes later if I can manage it. I have coffee, watch a little television. Read the paper, if I can find my glasses. Sometimes I’ll do a little gardening, but not too much these days. Lunch…usually something simple. And then more television. I used to volunteer at the hospital, but I haven't been going lately. Too much trouble, really. It’s boring, mostly. A lot of sitting, just like you asked.
DOCTOR: So, mostly a sedentary lifestyle, with some light activity. And you mentioned stopping your volunteer work recently. Was there a specific reason for that, Ms. Calvery, or did it simply become less appealing?
PATIENT: Oh, it wasn’t…it wasn’t appealing, exactly. It was just…a lot. A lot of young people running around, telling me how to do things. I’ve been a surgical tech for a long time, you know. I know how things are done. And they…well, they didn't always listen. It was exhausting. And then my arthritis started acting up more, so…it just seemed easier to stay home.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds as though it became a rather stressful situation. And the increased arthritis certainly would have contributed to that. Now, let’s move on to the forgetfulness you mentioned. You said not important things…can you give me a specific example of something you've recently forgotten?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Just yesterday, I made a cup of tea and…I don't know where I put it! I found it later, cold, on the windowsill. Silly, isn't it? And sometimes I forget names. People I've known for years. Not always, but…enough to be annoying. My daughter keeps saying it’s a sign of something serious, but I think she worries too much. It’s just getting old, Doctor. Everyone forgets things.
DOCTOR: It is common to experience some memory lapses as we age, Ms. Calvery. However, it’s important to establish a baseline and monitor any changes. Now, do you have any significant medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… My blood pressure was a little high, years ago. They put me on a pill for it, but I stopped taking it. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I didn't like the side effects. Other than that…not really. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago, but that was no big deal. My husband, bless his soul, he had everything. Heart trouble, diabetes…you name it. I seem to have gotten off lucky, I suppose. Though, honestly, I'm not sure "lucky" is the right word.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll make a note of the past gallbladder removal. And the history of hypertension, even if you discontinued the medication. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. And I’ve taken all sorts of pills over the years, for this and that. Never had a reaction. My husband was allergic to bee stings, poor thing. Had to carry an EpiPen everywhere. I always thought that was a bit much. I'm pretty sturdy, myself. Don't bother with allergies, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little ibuprofen sometimes, for my knees. When they really bother me. And I take a vitamin D supplement, my daughter insists on it. Says I don’t get enough sunshine. She’s probably right, I suppose. I don’t spend much time outdoors anymore. That’s about it, really. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a baseline and check a few things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Well, I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And nothing…invasive, if you know what I mean. I’m not really dressed for…well, never mind. Just…keep it quick, Doctor. I have my stories.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. Nothing invasive at all. Just a basic check of your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your knees. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me…and again… Good. Sounds clear, no murmurs or wheezing. Now, regarding your knees… could you please point to where you experience the most pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Here, right on the inside. And sometimes right here, too. It's not constant, you know. It just…aches when it's damp, or if I walk too much. It feels…stiff, mostly. Like they're going to lock up on me. And they sometimes crackle when I bend them. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: I feel some tenderness on both sides, as you pointed out, and I do hear some crepitus – that's the crackling sound you mentioned. It’s not uncommon with osteoarthritis, Ms. Calvery. I also notice a slight limitation in your range of motion. Reflexes are normal, and your gait is stable, but slightly cautious. Now, I'd like to order some blood work, just to get a better overall picture of your health and rule out any underlying inflammation. We’ll check your complete blood count, metabolic panel, vitamin D levels, and thyroid function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, more tests. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like a pin cushion already. But…I suppose if you think it’s necessary. My daughter will be happy, she always wants me to get tested for everything. Vitamin D, you say? She’s probably right about that, I haven't been outside much lately. Just…try to keep it quick, please. And tell me what it all means when you get the results. I don’t understand all that medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I’ll certainly explain everything in plain language. The blood work will give us a baseline and help us assess any potential inflammation or nutritional deficiencies. It should only take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with the ibuprofen as needed for pain, but try not to exceed the recommended dosage. Also, gentle exercises, like walking or swimming, can help maintain your knee mobility. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam, my working impression is osteoarthritis with possible mild vitamin D deficiency. However, we need the blood work results to confirm this and rule out any other underlying conditions. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Osteo-what-now? Sounds…serious. Is it going to get worse? Will I be needing a cane? My daughter always talks about her friend who needed a knee replacement… I don't really understand all these big words. And what does vitamin D have to do with my knees? It's a vitamin, isn't it? You get it from sunshine… I'm just confused. And frankly, a little scared.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Calvery. Let me explain. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, essentially wear and tear on the joints. It causes pain and stiffness, as you've experienced. It's not necessarily serious, and many people manage it effectively without needing a cane or surgery. As for the knee replacement, that’s a last resort, reserved for severe cases. We're not even close to that point with you. Now, regarding vitamin D, it plays a role in bone health and can help reduce inflammation. A deficiency can worsen joint pain. That’s why your daughter is right to be concerned about it, and why we’re ordering the blood test. We'll start with the basics: blood work, gentle exercise, and pain management. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more tailored treatment plan. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Well…I suppose not. It's just…a lot to take in. All these tests, and vitamins, and…wear and tear. It makes me feel old. And honestly, I just want to get back to my stories. They're a new mystery series, and I’m right in the middle of it. When will I get the results, Doctor? And can I just…keep doing what I’m doing until then? Taking ibuprofen, and watching television? Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. It's perfectly alright to continue doing what you're doing for now – taking ibuprofen as needed and enjoying your stories. That's a very sensible approach. The blood work results should be back within three to five business days. My nurse will call you with the results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly, even the scary parts. And thank you for not making me feel too old. I appreciate that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really should get home and see what happens in that mystery series.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Calvery. Enjoy your stories, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
