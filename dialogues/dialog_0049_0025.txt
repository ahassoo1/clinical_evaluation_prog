DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. I want to… find out more about where my family come from. My daughter, she buy me one of those… DNA tests. I want to know what it say, and maybe… you can help me understand? It’s a lot of words in there, and old man like me, hard to read sometimes.
DOCTOR: A DNA test, alright. While I appreciate you coming to me, Mr. Scobie, I’m a medical doctor. I specialize in internal medicine, not genealogy. I can’t really… interpret those tests for you. They're not within my scope of practice. However… if the results are causing you medical anxiety, or if there’s something concerning flagged in terms of genetic predispositions to illness, then we can discuss that. But simply… tracing ancestry?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. I didn’t know… thought any doctor could look at this. My daughter, she say maybe you can help. It just… a lot of names and places. I want to know if it true, you know? If my grandma really come from… where it say. It important to me, to know my story. It not make me sick, but… confuse me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, that’s a question for a historian, or perhaps a genetic counselor. I deal with the body, not family trees. It sounds like you need someone who specializes in interpreting genetic data, not managing internal organs. I can certainly document your concerns in your chart, but I won't be able to provide a meaningful interpretation of the results. It’s… frankly, a bit of a waste of my time, and your co-pay. Do you have any actual medical complaints today?
PATIENT: Oh. I… no. Not sick. Just… want to understand. My daughter spend a lot of money, and I want to know if it right. I just… old man, you know? Want to know where I from before I… before it too late. No need to be angry, Doctor. Just asking. I guess I go find someone else then. Maybe a… historian, like you say. Thank you… I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will document that you presented with concerns regarding the interpretation of a direct-to-consumer DNA test. No medical complaints reported. I strongly recommend consulting with a genetic counselor or a qualified genealogist for further assistance. Is there anything else medical I can address today, Mr. Scobie?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I… I’ll find someone else. .
DOCTOR: Good day, Mr. Scobie. .
