DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I'm hoping to talk about losing a little weight. It's… become a bit of a struggle, you see. I’m not as young as I used to be, and it's getting harder to keep it off.
DOCTOR: Alright. Losing weight can be a struggle, especially as we get older. It's good you're addressing it. Now, when you say "a little weight," roughly how much weight have you gained, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... it hasn't been sudden, you understand. More like… creeping on over the last, oh, five years, maybe? I used to be around 160 pounds, and now… well, the scale says 190, give or take. It fluctuates. And it's not just the number, Doctor, it's how I feel. Getting tired easier, and my knees… they aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Fluctuating weight over five years… and you’re noticing fatigue and knee pain. Right. Have you made any changes to your diet or exercise habits during that time?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. To be honest, my wife, she did most of the cooking. And she… passed away two years ago. Since then, I’ve been… well, eating what’s easy. A lot of rice, some fish when I can get it, and not nearly enough vegetables, I reckon. As for exercise… I used to walk with her every morning, but now… I mostly just sit and work with my wood. It’s a lonely habit, these days.
DOCTOR: I see. A change in routine after your wife’s passing... that certainly can affect things. And a diet heavy in rice, without much vegetable intake… alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, I have Medicare, if that tells you anything. Let me think… the doctor always said my cholesterol was a little high, but he never put me on any pills for it. Just told me to watch my diet, which, as I said, hasn’t been the easiest thing. And my knees, the doctor said it was just arthritis. Nothing too serious, he said. Just getting old. I try to stay on top of things, but it’s… hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Medicare, slightly elevated cholesterol, arthritis in the knees… and no medications currently. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been much for those. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. But that’s it. Nothing else. I prefer to avoid the hospital if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Well, I have two daughters, both living on the mainland. They call, they visit when they can, but… they have their own lives, you understand. My father, he had… well, he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. And my mother, she was always thin as a rail, but she had diabetes later in life. Is that… is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be. Family history gives us some clues. Heart trouble in your father, diabetes in your mother... alright. Now, let's talk about you. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she didn’t like it. And I didn’t want to upset her. I quit before we even got married. A good habit to start, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No smoking. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner, maybe three or four times a week. Nothing heavy, Doctor. Just a little something to relax. My wife and I used to share a bottle. Now it’s just me, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. A few glasses of wine a week. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. I can eat just about anything. Well, there was that one time I had a bad reaction to a shellfish, years ago, but that was just a stomach ache. Not an allergy, I don’t think. Just… didn’t agree with me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss some potential options. Could you step up on the scale for me again, just to confirm the weight?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. I hope it hasn’t gotten any worse since this morning. It feels like it.
DOCTOR: 192. Alright, a slight increase. Let's check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please, have a seat. Blood pressure is 148 over 88. Heart sounds are regular, but a little… distant. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing. Knees show some swelling and tenderness on palpation. Alright. It seems we have a bit of weight gain, elevated blood pressure, and some signs of arthritis in your knees. We’ll need to run some blood work to get a better understanding of your cholesterol levels and check for any underlying issues.
PATIENT: That… that doesn’t sound too good, does it, Doctor? Is it serious? Should I be worried? I just want to be able to walk without pain again, and maybe fit back into some of my old clothes. Is that too much to ask? And… about the weight loss medication, you mentioned? Is that something you think would help?
DOCTOR: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's not necessarily serious, Mr. Osumi, but it does require attention. Your blood pressure is elevated, which, if left unchecked, can lead to problems. And your weight contributes to that, as well as the stress on your knees. The blood work will give us a clearer picture. As for medication… weight loss medication is an option, but it's not a magic bullet. It has side effects, and it works best in conjunction with diet and exercise. Frankly, given your recent loss, I'm not convinced you're in the right headspace for a significant lifestyle change right now. We'll start with the blood work, and then we can discuss a plan. It will require effort on your part, I must say. It's not something I can fix for you.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. I… I suppose you’re right. It’s just been hard, adjusting. So, the blood work… what exactly does that involve? And how long will it take to get the results? I… I just want to know what I’m dealing with, and what I can do about it. And… thank you, Doctor. For being honest with me. It’s… appreciated. .
DOCTOR: The blood work is standard – a simple draw, it will take about ten minutes. We’ll check your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, kidney function, and a few other things. The results usually take about three to five business days. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them once they're available. In the meantime, I suggest you try to focus on small changes – perhaps a short walk each day, and try to incorporate some more vegetables into your diet. I understand it’s been difficult, but even a little effort can make a difference. The nurse will explain the prep instructions for the blood work. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
