DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a telehealth visit, yes? My back… it is not so good. It hurts when I bend, and sometimes when I stand for too long at work. I am a mechanic, you see. Lots of bending.
DOCTOR: A mechanic. Yes, that would involve bending. Telehealth, you are correct, though you are here in the office. It allows for a more thorough examination. Now, let's get some specifics about this back pain. When did it start?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, sorry. I forget things sometimes. It started… maybe three months ago? Slowly, at first. Just a little ache after work. Now it is more. It does not go away even with rest. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Three months… and worsening despite rest. It could be several things, Ms. Benites. We'll need to determine the cause. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to explain? It is not… sharp. More like a dull ache. It feels… deep inside. And sometimes… like a pulling. Especially on the left side. Does that make sense? I do not know the words for this.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, deep, with a pulling sensation on the left side. Not sharp. Alright. And does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Yes. Bending, of course. And lifting… even not very heavy things. Also, when I am cold. The cold weather makes it much, much worse. It stiffens up. Like… old metal, maybe? I work with metal all day, so I know.
DOCTOR: Bending, lifting, and cold weather. Those are all important clues. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… right now? It is… not so bad. Maybe a four? Sometimes it goes up to seven or eight when I am working. But sitting… sitting is okay. It is the moving that hurts.
DOCTOR: Four currently, up to seven or eight with activity. Alright. And have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, no pain in the legs. Only in my back. Sometimes, a little… a little numb feeling, but not often. And it goes away quickly. It is… hard to explain. Like when your foot falls asleep? But in my back.
DOCTOR: A transient numbness, like a foot falling asleep… interesting. Have you experienced any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no weakness. I can walk fine. I can stand all day, though it hurts, as I said. I can lift things, though I try not to too much. I still need to work, you see. But sometimes… I drop things. But maybe that is just my hands? I am not so young anymore.
DOCTOR: No leg weakness, occasional dropping of objects. We’ll need to rule out nerve involvement, Ms. Benites. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical problems – things like arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. And… high blood pressure, yes. The doctor put me on medicine for that. I take it every day. And… my husband, he passed away last year. It was… a difficult time. Do you need to know about that? I am not sure it is… medical.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Benites. The gallbladder removal and hypertension are relevant. We can address other concerns later, if necessary. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it here. Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, ten milligrams, once a day. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for the pain, but not every day. Only when it is really bad. The red pills, they are.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril ten milligrams daily, ibuprofen as needed. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I have never had a bad reaction to any medicine. My husband, he was allergic to penicillin, but not me. I remember that from when we were younger. He had a very bad rash.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family had problems with their back – things like arthritis, scoliosis, or disc issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had arthritis in her hands. Very bad, she could not knit anymore. And… my grandfather, I think he had something with his back. But I was very young, I do not remember much. He was a farmer, very strong. He bent a lot. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Maternal arthritis and a possible family history of back issues. It’s helpful to know. Now, let's proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on your back on the examination table. We'll start by assessing your range of motion and checking for tenderness.
PATIENT: Okay. This is… a little cold. And it is hard for me to get up, you know. Old bones.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites. I’m going to press gently here, and please tell me if you feel any pain. And can you point to the exact spot where the pain is the worst?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right… right there. When you press… it is a little sharp now. Not so much the dull ache, but… sharp. And… a little down here too. It is hard to say exactly. It moves around, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Muscle spasm present on the left side, with localized tenderness. Now, I'm going to ask you to bend forward, and then bend backward. Only go as far as you comfortably can. I'll be observing your range of motion and looking for any pain with movement.
PATIENT: Oof! That… is not so good. It stops here. It hurts too much to go any further. And… bending backward is even worse. No, I cannot do that. It feels like something will break.
DOCTOR: Significantly limited range of motion with both flexion and extension. Pain with both movements. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Please keep your legs relaxed.
PATIENT: Okay. I always worry about my knees. They crack a lot. Is that… bad too?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are present and equal bilaterally. Now, I'm going to lightly touch your legs with this, and tell me if you feel it. Can you feel this on your left leg?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel it. A little tingly, maybe, but I feel it. And on the right leg… yes, I feel that too. Everything feels… a little numb, but I can feel it when you touch me. It is hard to explain. Not completely numb, just… not as much feeling as before.
DOCTOR: Sensation is diminished bilaterally, but not significantly. Based on this preliminary examination, Ms. Benites, it appears you have a lumbar strain with possible nerve involvement. However, to rule out other potential causes, I recommend an X-ray of your lumbar spine and possibly an MRI, depending on the X-ray results. This will help us determine the extent of the injury and guide your treatment plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: X-ray and… MRI? Is that… expensive? I have Medicare, but… sometimes they do not pay for everything. I do not understand all this. Is it… serious? Will I need surgery? I just want the pain to go away.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover the necessary imaging, Ms. Benites, but we'll have to submit a pre-authorization. Our billing department will assist you with that. As for the seriousness… it's not likely to be serious. Most lumbar strains can be treated conservatively with physical therapy and pain management. Surgery is rarely needed. The imaging will simply help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out any structural abnormalities. I am ordering the X-ray first. We will discuss the MRI if needed. I'm also going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help with the spasms and an NSAID for the pain. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the X-ray results and discuss a physical therapy plan. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay. A muscle relaxant and… something for the pain. That sounds good. And physical therapy… I do not know. I am not very flexible, you see. But… one week. Yes, that is okay. Will the medicine make me sleepy? I need to drive home. And… what if the X-ray shows something bad? I worry too much, I know.
DOCTOR: The muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, so I’m prescribing a low dose. Please do not operate heavy machinery or drive if you feel sleepy. As for the X-ray… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. It is more likely to show a strain or minor inflammation. Worrying will not change the results, Ms. Benites. Here is your prescription. The nurse will provide you with instructions on how to schedule the X-ray. I am also going to order a referral for physical therapy, so you have it ready when you need it. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it helps. And… thank you for explaining everything. I will try not to worry too much. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will escort you. .
