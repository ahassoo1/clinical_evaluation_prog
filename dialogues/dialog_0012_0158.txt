DOCTOR: Hi Deloris, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, lovely to meet you too. It’s… about a letter. A pet letter, I think? My daughter… she said I needed something from a doctor. For the landlord, you see. Something about owning a dog. Honestly, I can't quite remember the details. It’s all a bit of a fuss, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a letter for the landlord regarding dog ownership. That sounds like it might be a documentation request for an emotional support animal, or possibly a service animal. Do you have any idea which it might be?
PATIENT: Emotional… support? Service? Goodness, I don't know all those fancy terms. It's just… Barnaby. He's a good boy, a lovely little terrier mix. My daughter, she’s the one who said something about needing paperwork. She’s always been very organized. I just… want to be able to keep him. The landlord is being difficult, apparently. Though why he’d have a problem with such a sweet dog is beyond me. Honestly, all this paperwork feels a bit silly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can feel a bit silly, especially when it's about a beloved pet! Okay, so Barnaby is an emotional support animal, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Well, he supports my emotions, certainly! He’s a good listener, doesn’t judge. And he’s very comforting when I'm feeling… well, when I'm feeling anything, really. But I don't know about “official” or anything. My daughter just kept saying I needed a letter from a doctor. Is that what you do? Write letters? It feels… strange being here for a letter. I usually only come to the doctor when I’m sick.
DOCTOR: It is a little different than a usual visit, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! I mean, Barnaby is perfectly healthy, I just got him checked at the regular vet. So, I don't understand why I'm here with you. Is this some kind of new rule? They didn't tell me anything at the front desk… It’s all very confusing. Honestly, I just want to get this letter and be done with it. Then maybe this landlord will leave us alone.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's try to clarify. A letter for an emotional support animal isn’t about Barnaby’s physical health – your regular vet is perfect for that! It’s about your health, specifically if you have a mental health condition that Barnaby helps to alleviate. To write the letter, I need to assess if you meet certain criteria. Would you be comfortable talking a little bit about how Barnaby helps you?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. It's about me then. Not Barnaby. Right. Well… I suppose. It's just… I don't really talk about things like that. Never have. But… Barnaby does help. When I get… anxious, he sort of… grounds me. I can feel my heart racing, you know? And then I pet him, and it slows down. He's very calming. And I don't feel so… alone. But ‘criteria’? That sounds very official. Are you going to ask me lots of complicated questions? I’m not good with questions.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright if you’re not comfortable, and we can absolutely take things at your pace. The questions aren’t complicated, just trying to understand how Barnaby helps you manage things. It's okay to just share what you feel comfortable with. Perhaps we can start with… have you been experiencing anxiety for a long time?
PATIENT: Oh, well… a long time. Yes. Always been a bit of a worrier, my mother used to say. But it’s gotten worse… since the divorce, I think. And… after my daughter moved away. It’s just… quiet, you know? Too quiet sometimes. That's when it gets bad. I just… feel a bit lost. And Barnaby… he just fills a little bit of that emptiness. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining things. Everything feels a bit muddled in my head.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Deloris. It sounds like Barnaby provides a very important source of comfort and support for you, especially during times when you’re feeling lonely or anxious. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit about what happens when you feel anxious?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking about the feeling of it. It’s… well, my heart races, like I said. And my palms get sweaty. And I just… can’t seem to catch my breath. It’s like there’s a tightness in my chest. And I start thinking about all sorts of terrible things. All the things that could go wrong. I get very restless. I can't sit still. And I just… feel overwhelmed. It's very unpleasant. Truly. And that’s when Barnaby… he just sort of leans against me, and it helps. It’s hard to explain. It’s like… he anchors me. He stops me from… spiralling. Though maybe that sounds silly.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Deloris. It sounds like Barnaby provides a very real and helpful calming effect. Those are all very common symptoms of anxiety, and it's wonderful that you’ve found a way to manage it with his support. Have you ever sought any other professional help for your anxiety?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never. I don't really… do doctors. Unless something is broken, you see? Or a fever. Things like that. Talking about feelings… that's just not me. My mother always said to just… pull yourself together. And I tried, truly. But it gets harder. And Barnaby… well, he doesn't judge. He just… is. It’s much easier. I suppose that’s why I’m here now, isn’t it? To get a letter so I can keep him. Is that what this all comes down to? A letter? It all seems a bit… roundabout.
DOCTOR: It does feel roundabout, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. I just… want to be able to keep Barnaby. He’s good company. And I don’t want to have to… explain all this to the landlord every month. He's a very… stern man. Doesn't strike me as someone who'd understand a dog being… calming. So, if this letter will solve it, then… yes. I suppose. I just don’t understand all the questions. Are you going to need more details? Because I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed again. My palms are getting a bit sweaty. See? Even talking about it makes it worse.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Deloris. We’ve covered a lot already, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. You’ve shared a lot about how Barnaby helps you, and that’s very valuable. I don’t need to ask a lot more questions right now. Based on what you’ve told me—experiencing anxiety with symptoms like racing heart, sweating, and difficulty breathing, and Barnaby providing a calming presence that helps you feel grounded—I believe you meet the criteria for an emotional support animal. I’m happy to write a letter to your landlord outlining this. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Really? You mean… that’s it? I just… told you things? And now you’ll write a letter? That sounds… wonderful. Truly. That would be… a huge relief. Yes, please. That would be absolutely wonderful. Oh, thank goodness. It seems… too easy, almost. But if you think so… yes, please write the letter. And thank you. You’ve been very patient with me. I’m not usually this… flustered. It’s just… the landlord is a very intimidating man. And I just want to be able to keep Barnaby. He's a good boy. A very good boy.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Deloris. It was my pleasure. And yes, it is often that simple. You’ve clearly described a very important bond with Barnaby, and it’s wonderful you’ve found something that helps you manage things. I’ll go ahead and draft the letter now. It will outline your anxiety symptoms, how Barnaby helps, and confirm he is an emotional support animal. It may take a few minutes. While I’m doing that, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just the letter, please. And thank you again. Honestly, I was dreading this visit. You’ve made it… much easier than I expected. I just… want to get this sorted and be done with it. Then I can stop worrying about the landlord and just… enjoy Barnaby’s company. He’s waiting in the car, you know. He gets anxious when I’m gone too long. A very sensitive little dog.
DOCTOR: Here you are. This letter confirms Barnaby as your emotional support animal. It’s on official letterhead, and hopefully, this will resolve things with your landlord. Please keep a copy for your records. Is there anything else at all I can assist you with before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, that's perfect. Thank you so much. Yes, this looks… very official. He won’t be able to argue with this, will he? I hope not. No, I think that's everything. You’ve been very kind. And very patient. I truly appreciate it. I should probably go and get Barnaby. He'll be wondering where I am. Thank you again, Dr. Yoshino. You’ve really helped me out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. And give Barnaby a good pat for me! Have a wonderful day. .
