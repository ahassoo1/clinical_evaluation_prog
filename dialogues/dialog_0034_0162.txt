DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Look, doc, no offense, but I don’t really have time for chit-chat. Just…bloating, okay? Been happening for a while now. Feels like I’m gonna pop. That’s it. Is that enough? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. No need to rush if you’d prefer to get straight to the point. Bloating can certainly be uncomfortable, and I want to help you figure out what’s going on. When you say “for a while now,” could you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been occurring?
PATIENT: Ugh, how long… honestly? Months, maybe? I don’t really keep track of that stuff. It comes and goes. Some weeks it’s bad, some weeks it’s…less bad. I just know it’s annoying. And it’s gotten worse lately, I guess. Is that helpful? Look, I eat normal stuff. I don't go changing my diet every other day.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. "Worse lately" is good to know. And it’s perfectly fine that you don’t keep track of every detail – we’ll work through it together. Could you describe what the bloating feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Feels like…like I swallowed a basketball. Seriously. And it’s not painful, exactly, just…full. Really, really full. And gassy. A lot of gas. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. I try not to… well, you get the picture. It’s just…uncomfortable. Is that specific enough for you? I don't do descriptions.
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a good idea, thank you. “Like swallowing a basketball” and the increased gas are both helpful details. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the bloating and gas?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don’t know… I feel tired, but who doesn’t these days? And my stomach… sometimes it just…makes noises. Loud noises. My wife used to complain about it. But that was… a while ago. Other than that, not really. I just want this feeling to go away, doc. It's annoying, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. It sounds like the tiredness and stomach noises could be related. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a bit more detail. Regarding the tiredness, has it been a recent change, or is this something you’ve experienced for a long time?
PATIENT: Long time. Always been a bit tired. Pile driving ain’t exactly a desk job, you know? It's hard work. I figured it was just…the job. It’s probably just me getting older, too. I’m not a spring chicken anymore. Is that what you want to hear? Because I'm telling you, I'm not gonna spend all day listing off every little ache and pain.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and completely understandable. You’re right, pile driving is physically demanding work. I appreciate you being upfront with me. Let’s talk about your diet a little more, if you don't mind. You mentioned you eat “normal stuff.” Could you describe a typical day of meals for me?
PATIENT: Look, I already said I eat normal. Like, eggs for breakfast sometimes. Sandwich for lunch. Dinner… whatever my daughter brings over. She tries to get me to eat healthy, but I’m a grown man. I eat what I want. I don't track calories or anything. It's not like I'm stuffing myself, but I don't exactly live on rabbit food either. Is that good enough? Honestly, I don’t see how what I eat has anything to do with feeling like a balloon. It just happens.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. You’re right, it shouldn’t always be about restricting what you eat. I’m just trying to get a complete picture. Now, have you noticed if the bloating is worse after eating any particular foods?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Now we're playing detective with my dinner? Fine. I guess…dairy maybe? I don’t drink a ton of milk, but if I have ice cream or something, I feel it. And beans. Definitely beans. But I don’t eat beans that often. Look, it’s not consistent, okay? Sometimes it's fine, sometimes it's not. It's just…random. I really think it's something else. This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know—dairy and beans seem to be potential triggers. It’s good you've noticed that connection. And I understand your frustration. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like irritable bowel syndrome or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I've been busy working. I haven't exactly spent a lot of time in doctor's offices. I had…something with my back a few years ago, but that was a work injury. I don't remember what it was called. And my wife…she handled all the medical stuff. After she…well, I haven't really been to a doctor unless something was broken or bleeding. I don't do…conditions. That sounds complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. It's perfectly alright if you haven't had a lot of experience with medical diagnoses. And I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. Okay, let's try this: have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never had surgery. I'm a pretty healthy guy, all things considered. I work hard, I eat…normal stuff. I don't sit around getting cut open. Can we just get this over with? I got things to do, you know? I don't want to spend all day here listing off my life story. This bloating thing is probably just stress, honestly. I got a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to get this over with, Mr. Kristofik. Let’s try to keep this as efficient as possible. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
