DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my foot’s been swelling up something fierce. It started a few days ago, and it just keeps getting bigger. It's mostly this one foot, the left one. It hurts a bit, especially when I try to walk on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Swelling in your left foot, starting a few days ago, and pain with walking. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's not a sharp pain, not really. More of a dull ache, you know? Like a bruise, but deeper. And it feels worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet. I work, you see – I’m a loan clerk down at the bank. Lots of sitting, but still gotta walk around a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache that worsens with activity, specifically at the end of the day. And you work as a loan clerk, involving some walking. Has anything specific caused the swelling, as far as you know?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven't… well, I don't think so. I didn't twist it, or drop anything on it. Just woke up one morning and it was a little puffy. Then it just kept getting bigger each day. I was hoping it would go down on its own, but it hasn’t. I did walk a bit farther than usual last weekend, visiting my cousin, but that was days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known injury. Gradual onset of swelling with no initial trauma. You mentioned walking a bit farther than usual last weekend. Did you notice any swelling immediately after that walk, or did it start later, as you said?
PATIENT: No, no swelling right after. Everything was fine that night. It was maybe two days later I noticed it was a little puffy when I put my shoes on. I thought maybe my shoes were tied too tight at first, honestly. But it kept getting worse even when I loosen them up. It's just… strange, you know? I don't usually have problems like this.
DOCTOR: Right, a delayed onset. That's helpful information. Now, besides the swelling and pain, have you noticed any other changes in your foot?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It feels a little warm, if I’m being honest. Not feverish warm, but… warmer than my other foot, yeah. And the skin looks… I don’t know, a little red around the ankle. Not bright red, just… a bit flushed. Oh, and sometimes it feels a little… tingly. Not numb, but like pins and needles, for a few seconds here and there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Warmth, some redness around the ankle, and intermittent tingling. Have you noticed any changes in the color or texture of your toenails?
PATIENT: No, not really. My toenails… well, they're my toenails. A little thick, maybe, but that's just how they are. I haven't seen any discoloration or anything weird like that. I keep them trimmed, you know? I wouldn't let them get too long. I cut them myself, regular like.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in toenail appearance. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I get a little high blood pressure sometimes, but the doctor just tells me to watch my salt. Nothing I need to take pills for, just try to eat healthy. Other than that… no, nothing major. I haven't been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. It's just… expensive, you know? And usually, things just work themselves out. I haven't had any surgeries or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, you have some occasional high blood pressure that you manage with diet, and no other significant medical history or surgeries. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t taken many pills in my life, to be honest. A little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything. My wife… well, she had some allergies, but that was a long time ago. I don’t have those.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family had problems with swelling in their legs or feet, or any conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had some trouble with her legs when she got older. Swelling, I think. But she was very old, and she had a lot of problems. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had diabetes. But other than that… not really. My father was healthy as a horse, and my siblings are all doing okay. I’m not sure, honestly. We don’t talk about health stuff much in my family. It’s… bad luck to talk about those things, my mother used to say.
DOCTOR: Alright. Some history of leg swelling in your mother, diabetes in an uncle, but otherwise limited family health information. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking for me. Never liked it. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, when I was younger, but I don't really anymore. Not for years. And definitely no drugs. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Just work, family, and trying to stay out of trouble. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your foot and ankle. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. Just be gentle, okay? It’s a little tender.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be as gentle as possible. I’m going to feel around your ankle and foot. Please let me know if anything is particularly painful. Okay. There's some tenderness to palpation around your medial malleolus—that's this bony bump on the inside of your ankle. And some warmth, as you mentioned. Okay, I’m checking your range of motion. There’s some limited range of motion, and it's slightly painful with dorsiflexion – that’s when I bend your foot upwards. Alright. I'm checking your pulses. Your dorsalis pedis pulse feels a bit diminished, but your posterior tibial pulse is present. I see some mild redness around your ankle, and some swelling, as you described. No open wounds or signs of infection at this time. Based on my exam, there is tenderness, limited range of motion, warmth and diminished pulse on your left foot, which is concerning. I’m going to order a D-dimer test and a vascular ultrasound to evaluate for a possible blood clot or vascular obstruction. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A D-what and a… vascular… wow, that sounds serious. A blood clot? Is it bad? I just thought it was a sprain or something. I don’t… I don’t know, Doctor. What does all that mean? And what if it is a blood clot? Will I need surgery? I’m getting a little worried now. Just tell me, straight, what you think is going on. And what’s going to happen next?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Parascandola, I understand your concern, and I apologize if I’ve caused you any alarm. Let me explain. A D-dimer is a blood test that helps us determine if there’s a blood clot forming in your body. The vascular ultrasound is an imaging test that allows us to visualize the blood vessels in your leg and foot to see if there are any clots or blockages. Based on your symptoms—the swelling, pain, warmth, redness, and the diminished pulse I found during the exam—there is a possibility of a blood clot, specifically a Deep Vein Thrombosis, or DVT, in your leg. It’s not a definite diagnosis yet, which is why we need the tests. A DVT can be serious, as the clot could potentially travel to your lungs, which is called a Pulmonary Embolism, and that is a medical emergency. However, we are being proactive by ordering these tests to rule that out, or catch it early if it is present. If a clot is found, treatment typically involves blood thinners—medication to prevent the clot from growing and to prevent new clots from forming. Surgery is usually only necessary in severe cases. I'm going to order these tests right away. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your foot as much as possible and avoiding strenuous activity. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Elevate it… right. Okay. Blood thinners… like pills? For how long? And will they make me bleed easily? My cousin, he was on those once, and he said… well, it wasn't pretty. And what if it is serious? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don't want to go to the hospital. What's the… the chance it's not a clot? Is there anything else it could be? Just a bad sprain, maybe? Please, just give me some hope. And… how long until I get these test results?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Parascandola, let's address all of those concerns. Yes, blood thinners are typically given in pill form, although there are also injectable options. The length of treatment depends on the severity of the clot and your individual risk factors, but it’s usually for several months, at a minimum. Your cousin’s experience is concerning, and yes, blood thinners can increase your risk of bleeding, which is why we closely monitor patients on these medications. However, modern blood thinners are much safer and have fewer side effects than older options. We would discuss all potential risks and benefits with you thoroughly before starting any medication. Regarding the possibility of it not being a clot, yes, there are other possibilities. It could be a severe sprain, a muscle strain, or a cellulitis—a skin infection. However, the diminished pulse I found is concerning for a clot, which is why we need to rule that out first. Regarding the hospital, if a large clot is found, hospitalization might be necessary for more intensive treatment and monitoring. However, we will know more once we get the test results. If it’s a smaller clot, or not a clot at all, you might be able to be treated as an outpatient. The lab should be able to get the D-dimer results back within a few hours. The vascular ultrasound will take a bit longer, maybe 24 to 48 hours, as it needs to be reviewed by a radiologist. I will call you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please elevate your foot, avoid strenuous activity, and if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions I can answer right now?
PATIENT: Chest pain… oh dear. Okay, okay. 24 to 48 hours… that sounds like a long time to wait, honestly. But I guess you gotta do what you gotta do. I don't think I have any other questions right now, Doctor. Just… please call me as soon as you know something. I’m a little scared, to be honest. And… thanks for explaining everything. I appreciate it. I'll try to keep my foot up. And I’ll watch out for that chest pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascandola. I completely understand your anxiety, and I will call you as soon as I have the results, I promise. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you experience any concerning symptoms before then. Take care, and try to relax as much as possible.
