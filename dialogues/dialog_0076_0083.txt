DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer, so… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. Well, Doctor… I just… I was hoping you could, you know, write me one of those cards. A “Get Well” card. Or, encouragement. Something nice. My daughter, she thinks I need… a little boost. It’s nothing serious, you understand. Just… a card. From a doctor. It carries more weight, see?
DOCTOR: A card?
PATIENT: Yes. A card. It's… a little hard to explain. My daughter, bless her heart, she thinks I'm feeling down. And she says a card from you would… cheer me up. You know, official. Like it means something more coming from a real doctor. It's not about being sick, exactly. Just… a little low. It’s important to her, and… well, I don’t want to disappoint her.
DOCTOR: Sir, I'm a physician. I diagnose and treat illnesses. I don’t… write motivational notes. Perhaps a visit with a counselor would be more appropriate?
PATIENT: A counselor? Now see, Doctor, that’s just… unnecessary. I’m perfectly fine. A little tired, maybe. Old age, you know? But I don’t need talking to. I just want a card. It’s a small thing! A few nice words… from a doctor. It’s not like I’m asking for a miracle, Doctor. Just a card. It's… well, it’s a matter of principle, almost. It shows my daughter I take things seriously.
DOCTOR: With all due respect, Mr. Kammer, your daughter's concerns are… unconventional. I have patients waiting who require actual medical attention. I can document a brief note stating you presented today and reported feeling generally well, but I’m not fabricating a “get well” card. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fabricating? Now you're being rude, Doctor. I didn't say anything about fabricating. Just… acknowledging that I came to see you. And maybe a little encouragement wouldn't hurt. A doctor is supposed to care, isn’t he? A little note saying something like, “Wishing you good health and spirits” – is that too much to ask? Honestly, I’ve never heard of a doctor being so… inflexible. A note is all I'm asking for. Not a whole essay, just… something.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll dictate a brief statement for your record. “Patient reports subjective feelings of low energy. Denies any specific complaints or illness. Advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle.” Is that… sufficient for your daughter?
PATIENT: Hmm. “Low energy”? That sounds… weak. Makes me sound like I’m falling apart. Couldn’t you say something… stronger? Like, “Patient is proactively seeking to maintain good health and well-being.” That sounds… respectable. And leave out the “low energy” part completely. It's… a matter of presentation, Doctor. For my daughter, you see? She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Fine. “Patient proactively seeking to maintain good health and well-being.” Is that… absolutely satisfactory?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… acceptable. Thank you, Doctor. That will do nicely. Perhaps you could just… add your signature? It means a lot to her, you see. A doctor’s signature. Official. That’s all. Really. And… thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: Here. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I trust this… addresses your concerns. And please, sir, if you do begin to experience any actual symptoms, don’t hesitate to schedule a proper appointment.
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. Very kind. It’s perfect. She’ll be very pleased. You’ve been… helpful. Very helpful indeed. Good day to you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good day.
PATIENT: .
