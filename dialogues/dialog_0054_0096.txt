DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Dashevsky. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it's hard to explain exactly. Basically, the sun’s been bothering me a lot lately. More than usual, anyway. It feels like my skin is extra sensitive. It’s been going on for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of increased sun sensitivity. That's good to know. Can you describe what happens when you’re exposed to the sun?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it doesn’t burn right away, you know? It’s more like… a prickly feeling at first. And then my skin gets really red, especially on my face and arms. It feels hot, and sometimes it itches a little. It's not like a bad sunburn, not at the beginning, but it feels like it’s heading that way if I stay out too long. It's just… uncomfortable, and it worries me. I used to be able to be in the sun much longer without any trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it starts with a prickly sensation, then redness and some heat, potentially with itching, and it’s happening more easily than it used to. And it's on your face and arms primarily?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Face and arms are the worst, but I think it's happened a little on my chest too, when I was gardening last week. It’s just… it feels different than normal. And it’s been happening even when I think I'm being careful with sunscreen. I'm using a factor 30, I think… the usual kind. It's just not seeming to work as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, factor 30 sunscreen, and it doesn’t seem to be providing the usual protection. That's good information. To get a better picture of what might be going on, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Not much to tell, really. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I had the usual childhood stuff, measles and things, but nothing serious. No major illnesses, no surgeries. I do have… well, my wife passed away a few years ago, but that wasn’t from anything like this. And I have Medicare now, of course. Otherwise, just the normal check-ups with the doctor. I don't take any regular medications, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Arbin. I'm sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been very difficult. And thank you for letting me know about your medical history – or rather, the lack of significant history – and that you aren't currently taking any medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. No food allergies, no problems with any medicines the doctor’s given me before. I've had antibiotics a couple of times for infections, and that was fine. No rashes, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. I used to help my wife with her gardening, and she used a lot of different things, but I never had any issues.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had similar skin issues, or any autoimmune conditions, or a history of skin cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had… well, she had some skin problems when she got older. Sort of flaky skin, mostly on her arms and legs. The doctor said it was just a normal thing that happens with age, nothing serious. My father was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in his life. And I don’t have any siblings or children, unfortunately. My wife’s family… I don’t know them very well, so I wouldn’t have any idea about their health problems. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Arbin. You’ve given me a good amount of information already. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Not really my thing, honestly. I prefer a nice cup of tea. I try to eat healthy, lots of vegetables and fruit. I enjoy gardening, as I mentioned, and I try to get some exercise when I can, mostly walking around. Nothing too strenuous, though. I’m not very fast!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Arbin. A healthy lifestyle is always a plus. Okay, to get a better look at what’s going on with your skin, would you mind if I conducted a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start by looking at the affected areas. I'll gently examine your face and arms. Please let me know if anything is tender or uncomfortable. Okay, I'm seeing some mild redness on your cheeks and the backs of your arms. The skin feels slightly warm to the touch, and there's a very subtle texture change, almost like it’s a little rougher than normal. There are no visible blisters or open sores at this time. It doesn’t appear to be a classic sunburn rash. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, it could be a few things. It's possible this is a form of contact dermatitis – a reaction to something you’ve come into contact with – or it could be something called polymorphous light eruption, which is a sensitivity to sunlight. Less likely, but we need to rule it out, is a drug eruption, though you aren't taking any medications currently. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Tests are good. I want to figure out what’s going on, and what I need to do to protect my skin. Whatever tests you think are best, Doctor, go ahead. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Arbin. I appreciate your trust. I'm going to order a complete blood count just to get a baseline, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your overall organ function. I'm also going to order a skin biopsy of a small area on your arm. This will help us definitively rule out other skin conditions. Finally, I'll order a photosensitivity test to see how your skin reacts to different wavelengths of light. These tests will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. They’ll be sent to the lab, and the results should be back in about a week. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding direct sunlight as much as possible. Wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses when you are outside. Continue using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, and reapply it every two hours, or more often if you’re swimming or sweating. Do you have any questions about the tests or these recommendations?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… a lot, but I understand it’s to get to the bottom of things. So, avoiding the sun, wearing hats and sunscreen… that makes sense. A biopsy… that sounds a bit scary, but if it helps, then okay. And the light test… I guess it’s to see which kind of light bothers me? Just… how painful is the biopsy? And will the light test be uncomfortable? I’m a bit worried about that, to be honest. I don't handle pain very well.
DOCTOR: Those are very fair questions, Arbin, and it's good you're asking. The biopsy is typically a very quick procedure. We'll numb the area with a local anesthetic, so you shouldn't feel any significant pain, just a slight pinch. Afterwards, you might feel a little bit of soreness or tenderness, but it's usually manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. We'll provide you with instructions on how to care for the biopsy site to prevent infection. The photosensitivity test involves exposing small areas of your skin to different wavelengths of light. It can cause some mild redness or itching, similar to a mild sunburn, but it shouldn't be severely painful. We'll monitor you closely during the test, and we can stop it at any time if you're feeling uncomfortable. We'll also apply a cool compress if needed. We'll do everything we can to make you as comfortable as possible during both procedures. If you're particularly anxious, we can discuss options for managing your anxiety, such as a mild sedative. Does that help alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help, thank you. Knowing it'll be numbed for the biopsy is good. And knowing they can stop the light test if it gets too bad… that’s reassuring. I think… I think I can handle that. I'll just try to relax and take deep breaths. So, after the tests, I'll come back in a week? And you'll explain the results?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You’ll come back in one week, and we’ll discuss the results in detail. We'll go over what the tests showed, what it means, and what the best course of treatment is for you. I’ll also give you a written summary of the results and our plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, blisters, or severe pain – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've answered everything I was worried about. Thank you, Dr. Dashevsky. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And thank you for being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the lab order and schedule your follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next visit. Have a good day, and try to stay out of the sun!
