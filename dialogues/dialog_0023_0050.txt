DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Hmm… well, it’s this cough. Been… a long time now. Just a dry tickle, mostly. Not much to it, really, but it’s… persistent. I don't even remember when it started, to be honest. Seems like ages.
DOCTOR: A long-standing cough, you say. And you describe it as dry… not productive, meaning no mucus?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Dry. No… nothing coming up. Just… scratchy. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. More… annoying, I suppose. Especially at night. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. I mostly just… try to ignore it, but it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: I see. And you said it’s been going on for… a long time. Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. Years, I think. Maybe… five? Ten? It’s all a bit of a blur these days. My wife… she used to bring me tea for it. But… that was a while ago now. She knew what to do, always. I just… kept coughing.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a chronic cough, potentially five to ten years duration. And it’s been worsening, or staying consistent, over that time?
PATIENT: Consistent, I think. Not… really gotten worse, but it hasn’t gone away either. Just… always there. Like a little… irritation. Sometimes it flares up when the weather changes, maybe? Or if I’m… walking a lot. Hard to say, really. I don't pay much attention to it until it bothers me, and then… well, here I am.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get a little… winded sometimes, when I’m doing things. But I'm an old man, Doctor. That comes with the territory, I reckon. No… I don't think so. No fever, no chills… nothing like that. Just… the cough. And being a bit tired, maybe, but who isn’t?
DOCTOR: No fever, chills, or other associated symptoms. Some mild shortness of breath with exertion, which you attribute to age. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh dear. That's another thing I’m not so good at remembering. I had something with my… heart, a long time back. They gave me pills, but I stopped taking them, I think. And my wife… she always took care of all the doctor’s appointments and such. I really couldn't tell you much, I'm afraid. Nothing major right now, though. I feel… okay, mostly. Just this cough.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of a cardiac issue, details unknown, medication history also unclear. We’ll need to investigate that further. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Pavlovic?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I think I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long, long time ago. That’s about it, I believe. No… nothing else comes to mind. My wife… she would remember if I had anything else. She had a good memory, always.
DOCTOR: Okay. Appendectomy in childhood. Now, family history is important. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a tough one, Doctor. My family… we didn't talk much about those things. Lots of farmers, mostly. Hard work, that’s what they did. My mother… she passed when I was young. Something with her lungs, I think. But I don't really know the details. My father… he lived a long life. Strong man. Didn’t get sick much. That's about all I remember, I'm afraid. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I see. Limited family history available. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I stopped taking those pills for my heart… a long time ago. And I don't really believe in all those fancy remedies. Just… try to get by, you know? Maybe a little bit of tea sometimes when the cough is bad, but that's about it. My wife… she had all sorts of things in the cabinet. But I don’t really use them now.
DOCTOR: No current medications. Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had any trouble with anything. My wife… she always made sure I didn't eat anything I was allergic to. But I don’t recall ever being allergic to anything. No, I think I'm alright. Just a bit tired sometimes, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to need to conduct a physical exam to get a better understanding of your condition. I’ll need to listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and take your temperature. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. My wife… she always said listening was important. So, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. I hope I'm not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: No trouble at all, Mr. Pavlovic. Please, if you could just sit here. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm… and some diminished breath sounds, especially in the lower lobes. There’s a mild wheeze present bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Your oxygen saturation is 94% on room air, which is acceptable, but not optimal. We need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated, Doctor. Is it… bad? My wife… she always knew what everything meant. I'm just an old man, you know? Just want to be able to sleep at night. What does… "investigate" mean? Will I have to… lie down for a long time?
DOCTOR: "Investigate" means we need to run some tests to determine the cause of your cough and the diminished breath sounds. We'll need to get a chest X-ray to see if there’s anything visible in your lungs, and I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to check your overall health. We also need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues, given your history. As for lying down for a long time, no, not necessarily. These are relatively simple tests that shouldn’t take much time at all. However, depending on the results, we may need to consider further evaluation. Given your age and the length of your symptoms, it’s important to be thorough. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Chest… X-ray? Blood tests? Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. My wife… she always handled all this. I just want to stop coughing. Will it… hurt? Will they have to take a lot of blood? And what if they find something… bad? I don't want to cause trouble. It’s just a cough, Doctor. Maybe it will just go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pavlovic, I understand your apprehension. The tests themselves are not particularly painful. The blood draw will be a small amount, and the X-ray is simply a picture of your lungs, it doesn’t involve any injections or discomfort. As for finding something “bad”, that’s why we're doing the tests—to identify the cause of your cough and ensure you receive appropriate treatment. Delaying diagnosis could lead to complications, and I want to rule those out. It’s important to be proactive about your health, especially given your age. I will explain the results thoroughly once they are available, and we can discuss the best course of action. I’ll write you a referral for the X-ray and lab work. The lab is just across the street. Do you think you can manage to get there on your own, or would you prefer I arrange for transportation?
PATIENT: I… I don’t know if I can manage. It’s… been a long time since I went anywhere on my own. My wife… she always drove me. And I… I don't remember how to get there, even if it's across the street. Could you… could you arrange for someone to take me? I don’t want to be a bother. I just… I just want this cough to go away, and I don’t want to get lost. I'm a bit confused, Doctor. A bit very confused.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Pavlovic. I will arrange for a medical transport to take you to the lab and back. It will be a paid service, given your lack of insurance, so I'll have the receptionist discuss the cost with you. They should be there within the hour. While you wait, I’ll have the receptionist provide you with a detailed list of instructions for the lab work, including which tests to request and any preparation required. I expect you to follow those instructions carefully. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Thank you… thank you very much. A medical transport… that’s… that’s good. I appreciate it. I'll follow the instructions… carefully. My wife… she would have known what to do. I just hope… I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: We'll do our best to determine the cause of your cough, Mr. Pavlovic. The receptionist will be with you shortly to discuss the transport and instructions. Please, try to relax and focus on following the directions you are given. I'll review the results as soon as they are available. .
