DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doctor, I haven’t got all day. It's this tiredness, see? Just dragging all the time. And… well, it’s embarrassing to even say, but I’ve been… craving dirt. Like, actual earth. Don’t look at me like that. It's awful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tiredness and… cravings for dirt. Right. Let's start with the tiredness. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's been... well, a good few months now. Maybe six? It comes and goes, but lately it’s been constant. It's not like I can just nap it off, you know? It's a deep, bone-aching weariness. And it's interfering with my work. I'm a physical therapist aide – supposed to be helping people move, and I’m exhausted just standing up. Frankly, it's humiliating.
DOCTOR: Six months of constant fatigue, interfering with work… and you mentioned it's a deep weariness, not just feeling sleepy. Do you feel weak, or is it more like you just have no energy?
PATIENT: No, not weak, exactly. It’s… like everything is heavy. Even lifting a teacup feels like a chore. My muscles aren’t sore, they just… don’t want to. And I can’t concentrate. I keep forgetting things, though I usually have a very good memory, you know? It’s frustrating. Is this something serious, Doctor? Don't tell me it's just getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay. It doesn’t sound like typical age-related fatigue. We’ll need to explore some possibilities. Now, regarding this memory issue – can you give me a specific example of something you’ve been forgetting?
PATIENT: Oh, plenty of things! Just yesterday I went to the market for tomatoes and completely forgot why I went. Stood there staring at the produce for a good five minutes! And names… people's names are just slipping away from me. I used to be excellent at remembering faces and names. It’s unsettling, I tell you. And frankly, it makes me worried about being capable at work.
DOCTOR: Alright. We're going to do a quick physical exam, and then I'm going to order some bloodwork. Just to rule things out. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, joy. Fine. But don’t expect miracles. As I said, I'm tired. And please, make it quick. I have things to do, you know. There. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little low, 108 over 70. Pulse is regular at 72. Lungs sound clear. I notice your gait is a bit slow, and your movements appear… deliberate. No tremors that I can see. Any dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand up?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness. Just… heavy. Everything feels heavy, like I’m wading through mud. And no, I haven't been feeling faint or anything like that. Look, Doctor, is this going to take much longer? I really don’t have time for a lot of poking and prodding. I just want to know what’s wrong and what to do about it. Frankly, I’m a bit offended you’re making me wait this long when I’m telling you I feel terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your symptoms – fatigue, memory issues, and cravings for dirt – and your slightly low blood pressure, I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, iron studies, and a thyroid panel. We'll also need to check your vitamin D levels. The dirt craving… that’s unusual and could be a sign of iron deficiency, although we need the bloodwork to confirm.
PATIENT: Oh, great. More tests. Wonderful. Look, Doctor, can’t you just give me some iron pills? My mother used to say… well, never mind. It doesn’t matter. But if it is iron, can’t we just start treating it? I don’t want to wait a week for results when I’m already feeling dreadful. What exactly am I supposed to do until the results come back? Just sit here and suffer?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. However, I can’t prescribe medication without knowing the underlying cause. We need to rule out other possibilities, such as thyroid issues or other deficiencies. Starting iron supplements without a confirmed diagnosis could actually be harmful. For now, I want you to focus on getting as much rest as possible, and try to maintain a healthy diet. Avoid strenuous activity. If your fatigue gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms, please contact the office immediately. I’ll have the lab requisition ready for you. You can go to the lab at Suburban General Hospital. They should be able to get the results back to us within three to five business days. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Rest and a healthy diet. As if that’s helpful. What a waste of my time. Three to five days? It feels like an eternity. Well, alright. Let’s just get this over with. I suppose I have no choice. Suburban General, you say? I’m going now. And if those results aren’t back promptly, I’ll be calling. .
