DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, actually. I’ve been… having trouble with my speech, I think. It feels a bit slurred, sometimes. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it hasn’t been consistent, you see? I don’t quite recall when it started, precisely.
DOCTOR: Okay, slurred speech… and it comes and goes. I understand it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when it began. That's alright, we’ll try to figure it out together. Can you describe what you mean by “slurred”?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s like… when I try to say something, the words don’t come out clearly. It’s not a complete mumble, not like I’m unable to speak, but… they sound a little jumbled, perhaps? Like I’m not fully forming them. My husband, bless him, he notices it more than I do, sometimes. He says I sound a little… thick, is the way he puts it. I don’t know if that helps.
DOCTOR: “Thick,” alright. That gives me a little more to work with. And he’s noticed it happening periodically?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Not all the time, thankfully. It seems to come and go. There doesn’t seem to be a pattern, though. It’s not after certain activities, or at a specific time of day… I’ve tried to pay attention, but I can't recall anything that consistently triggers it. I do remember…feeling a bit tired recently, generally. But I suppose many people feel tired, don’t they? Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could be relevant. Fatigue can certainly contribute to a lot of things. And it's good you're trying to notice patterns. Now, besides the speech and the fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that you mention it… I have been a little clumsy lately. Dropped a few things, bumped into furniture… nothing major, mind you, but more than usual, definitely. And… oh! There was that one instance… I felt a little dizzy, but only for a moment. It passed quickly, and I didn't think much of it at the time. Does that sound… important?
DOCTOR: Okay, clumsiness and a brief episode of dizziness. That's helpful. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, weakness, or numbness anywhere?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really, no. Maybe a little tension sometimes, but nothing severe. Vision changes, no, I don’t think so. Weakness… no, I haven’t noticed anything like that. And… numbness? No, I can feel everything as usual. No, I don't believe so. It's just the speech, the tiredness, and the little… mishaps, I suppose. I feel rather foolish listing such small things.
DOCTOR: You’re not foolish at all. It's important to share everything, even things that seem small. Alright. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a bit difficult, actually. I don’t recall a great deal, I’m afraid. I have Medicare, as you can see, so I’ve seen doctors before, naturally. I think I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. Nothing serious. I've been married for a few years now, and my husband is generally very healthy. I haven't had any major surgeries or hospitalizations, to my recollection. I do work in construction management, which is fairly physical, but I’m quite fit, I believe. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: It's alright; it's common for details to be fuzzy. We can work with what you remember. Just trying to get a general picture. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… I don’t think so, no. I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. I eat most things without issue, and I’ve taken common over-the-counter medications like paracetamol for headaches when needed, without any problems. My husband always double-checks when I try new foods, just to be safe, but I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction. I don't recall any severe reactions to medications either. Is that helpful? It feels like I'm grasping at straws here, trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: It is helpful. Just ruling things out. And no, you’re not grasping at straws. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at the moment. I don't take any regular medications, vitamins, or supplements. I try to eat a balanced diet, and get enough rest when I can. I used to take a multivitamin a while back, but I stopped after a few months. It didn't seem to make much difference, so I didn’t bother continuing. No, nothing regular at all. I am fairly healthy, generally. I suppose. It's just this speech… and the little things. It worries me, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your neurological function, reflexes, and general health. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary to figure out what’s going on. I just want to know what’s causing this… uncertainty, you see. Please, don't hesitate to let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, I'm going to tap these areas with this little hammer. Just relax your arms and legs. Let me know if that feels painful. Taps reflexes. Your reflexes seem normal on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Can you stand up for me, and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There we are. It feels a little… precarious, if I'm honest. I don’t usually feel this wobbly. Is this normal? I don’t want to fall! Perhaps it’s just my imagination. It's been a long day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. Your gait is slightly unsteady, and you do have a bit of a wobble. Not severe, but noticeable. And you're right to point it out. Now, I’m going to check your eye movements. Just follow my finger with your eyes, and don’t move your head. Moves finger in an 'H' pattern. Your eye movements are smooth, no nystagmus. Finally, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Listens with stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Alright, everything seems within normal limits, but the unsteady gait and the reported clumsiness are concerning. It's difficult to say what's causing it without further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very reassuring, does it? So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I work on construction sites, you see, and I need to be steady on my feet. This is rather worrying. Should I… stop working until we know more? I am a little frightened now, to be honest. What sort of investigation are you thinking of?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Adyn, and it's right to be cautious, especially given your profession. It doesn’t necessarily mean something serious, but it does warrant further investigation. We need to rule out a few things. Given your symptoms – the slurred speech, the fatigue, the clumsiness, and the unsteady gait – I’d like to order a few tests. An MRI of the brain would be helpful to rule out any structural issues. Also, a vitamin B12 level and a complete blood count to check for deficiencies or infections. I also want to check your thyroid function, just to be thorough. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid any strenuous activity that requires a lot of balance or coordination. It’s better to err on the side of caution. I can give you a note for your employer explaining this. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds rather… involved. And blood tests, yes, alright. I suppose that’s necessary. I do feel a little overwhelmed, to be honest. I haven't had an MRI before. Is it… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I do appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. And yes, a note for my employer would be very helpful. I wouldn’t want to risk an accident. I'm just… anxious, you see. This uncertainty is very unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety completely. An MRI is not painful, Adyn. You’ll lie on a table inside a large magnet. It’s a bit loud, so we’ll provide you with earplugs. You need to remain very still for about 30-45 minutes. The results typically take 2-3 business days, sometimes a little longer depending on the radiology department’s workload. I will contact you as soon as I have them. I’m going to write a referral for the MRI, and I’ll also give you a list of labs where you can get the blood tests done. And here’s a note for your employer. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if your speech becomes significantly more slurred, or you experience any weakness, dizziness, or vision changes – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Two to three business days… alright. And I will definitely remember to go to the emergency room if things worsen. I think… I think that’s everything for now. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. And thank you for being so patient with me. It’s… it’s comforting to know that you’re taking this seriously. I will schedule the MRI as soon as possible. I truly appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. It’s my job. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I’ll see you after your tests.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Beinborn. I appreciate your kindness. I will be in touch.
