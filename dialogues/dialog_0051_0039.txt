DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Seems a bit strange bein' here, truth be told. My regular doctor… passed away a few years back, and I haven’t really gotten around to findin’ a new one. But then I got this letter from here, sayin’ my cholesterol was a little high, so… here I am! I suppose that’s what brings me in. High cholesterol, they called it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. We sent out some information based on recent lab results. It’s perfectly alright that you haven't been to a doctor in a while; many people find themselves in that situation. It’s good you’re addressing it now. So, this letter mentioned elevated cholesterol. Have you experienced any symptoms that made you notice anything was off, or was this a complete surprise?
PATIENT: A complete surprise, Doctor, a complete surprise. I feel… well, I feel like me. Eighty-eight years old, maybe a little creaky in the mornings, but that’s just age, I reckon. No chest pains, no shortness of breath, nothin’ like that. Just got this letter sayin’ my numbers weren’t where they should be. Honestly, I don't even know what "numbers" they're talkin' about! Never paid much attention to those things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Bohnett. Many people don't routinely follow those numbers. We can certainly go over them together. It sounds like you haven’t had any symptoms, which is good. Just to get a clearer picture, have you had any other health concerns recently, or anything in your past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let's see... past medical history… I had the flu pretty bad back in '57, but everyone did back then. And I broke my wrist fallin' off a ladder when I was tryin' to fix the roof, maybe twenty years ago. Aside from that… not much, really. I've always been a pretty healthy fella, always out workin' in the garden, keepin' busy. My wife, bless her soul, always said I was too stubborn to sit still long enough to get sick. She passed away… oh, it’ll be ten years this November. Heart trouble, she had. And that’s about it, I think. Anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bohnett. That's helpful. And I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. Losing a loved one is never easy. I see here in your record that you’ve had some previous blood work done, confirming the elevated cholesterol. It shows your total cholesterol is 245, your LDL is 160, your HDL is 35, and your triglycerides are 180. Do those numbers mean anything to you?
PATIENT: Numbers, numbers… not a lick, Doctor, not a lick. I told you, I don't pay attention to those things! They might as well be Martian for all I know. High is bad, I suppose? That’s all I can figure. LDL, HDL… sounds like somethin' you fix cars with. Honestly, I'm just hopin' it’s not somethin’ too serious. I’m too old to be messin’ with complicated treatments. Just tell me straight, Doctor. Is it somethin’ I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Bohnett. You’re right to want a straight answer. Those numbers do indicate elevated cholesterol, and it is something we should address. High LDL cholesterol – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – can build up in your arteries and increase your risk of heart attack and stroke. The HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is a bit low, and that’s not ideal either. Now, it doesn’t necessarily mean you need “complicated treatments” right away. We can start with lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – and see if that makes a difference. Before we go that route, though, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out any other potential issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… diet and exercise, huh? Well, I suppose I can try. I always enjoyed a good roast dinner, but I reckon I can cut back a bit. And I still do a bit of work in the garden, though it's not as much as I used to. A physical exam sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? These old bones aren't what they used to be. Where do we start? Blood pressure, I imagine?
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll start with blood pressure, and then listen to your heart and lungs. We’ll also take a look at your reflexes and do a brief neurological exam. I will be as gentle as possible, Mr. Bohnett. Alright, let's get started. Relax your arm for me… Good. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. And your heart sounds… regular, but there’s a slight murmur. It’s not a strong murmur, and it may be something you’ve had for a long time, but we should keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: A murmur, you say? That doesn't sound good. I don’t think I’ve ever been told I had a murmur before. Is that somethin’ serious, Doctor? I'm startin’ to get a little worried now, to be honest. I always figured I’d just… fade away peacefully in my sleep, not have all these things wrong with me. And I just started enjoyin’ my retirement! Could it be… from the gardenin’? All that bendin’ and liftin’?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, it’s understandable that you’re worried. A murmur simply means there’s an extra sound when your heart beats. It can be caused by a variety of things, and many murmurs are harmless – they don’t require any treatment. However, it’s important to investigate it further to rule out anything serious. It’s unlikely the gardening is directly causing the murmur, but it could be contributing to other issues, like high blood pressure, if it's putting a strain on your heart. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order an echocardiogram – that’s an ultrasound of your heart. It will give us a detailed picture of your heart structure and function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An echocardiogram… that sounds complicated. And expensive, I imagine? I’m on a fixed income, you know. My wife and I, we always managed, but… things are tighter now, without her. I suppose I don’t really have a choice, if you think it’s important. I just… don’t want to be a burden. Is it somethin’ I need to do right away? Can’t we just… try the diet and exercise first? See if that helps? I always figured a good walk and a healthy meal fixed most things. Maybe I’m just bein’ an old fool. But honestly, Doctor, all these tests and procedures… they scare me a little.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Bohnett. It's perfectly reasonable to be worried about costs and procedures. We can certainly discuss financial assistance options with the clinic staff – there may be programs available to help. And you’re not being an old fool at all. A healthy diet and exercise are always a good starting point, and we will absolutely incorporate those into your plan. However, given the murmur and your elevated cholesterol, I do think it’s important to get a baseline understanding of your heart health with the echocardiogram. It will allow us to make more informed decisions about your treatment. We’re not rushing into anything, and we’ll proceed at your pace. It’s a relatively non-invasive procedure – it doesn’t involve any needles or incisions. If you’d like, I can have a nurse explain the procedure in more detail, and answer any questions you have. And we can schedule it for a time that’s convenient for you. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright, alright… a nurse, you say? That might be helpful. Explainin’ all these fancy words… it goes right over my head. And schedulin’ it… yes, that’s fine. I’m usually free on Tuesdays and Thursdays. But… not too early, alright? My bones ache in the mornin’. And… thank you, Doctor. For bein’ patient with an old man. I appreciate it. It’s just… gettin’ old ain’t for the faint of heart, you know? And losin’ my wife… well, it threw everything off. But… I suppose I’ll face it, one step at a time. Just… no rushin’.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bohnett. We will proceed at your pace. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to explain the echocardiogram and schedule it for a Tuesday or Thursday, whichever works best for you. And please, don’t hesitate to ask any questions, no matter how small. We’re here to help you every step of the way. It’s understandable to be apprehensive, and we will take things slowly and carefully. Now, let’s talk a bit about those lifestyle changes… we can start with some simple dietary adjustments and a manageable exercise routine. We'll make a plan together. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Diet and exercise… alright. That I can manage, I think. Always liked a good garden, always felt better after a bit of workin’ in the soil. Maybe a bit less roast beef, a bit more… vegetables. My wife, she always said I needed to eat more greens. She was a good woman. Yes, let's make a plan. Start simple, you said? That's good. I'm not lookin' to run a marathon or nothin'. Just… feel a bit better, you know? And maybe, just maybe, quiet these worries a bit. Where do we start? What kind of vegetables are good? And how much exercise is too much for an old fella like me?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfect attitude, Mr. Bohnett. Small steps are key. We're not aiming for a marathon, just a healthier you. As for vegetables, variety is best. Leafy greens like spinach and kale are excellent, but broccoli, carrots, bell peppers – all good choices. Aim for at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. And for exercise, we'll start with something gentle. A 30-minute walk most days of the week is a great starting point. Gardening counts! Just listen to your body and don't push yourself too hard. If you feel pain, stop and rest. I have some handouts with more detailed information on healthy eating and exercise. We can go through them together, and I can tailor a plan specifically for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Handouts… that’s good. I like writin’ things down, helps me remember. And tailorin’ a plan… yes, that’s smart. Everyone’s different, I suppose. And listenin’ to my body… my wife always said I was too stubborn for my own good. Always tryin’ to do too much. Yes, let's look at those handouts. And maybe… maybe you can write down a list of questions I should ask the nurse about the echocardiogram? My mind ain’t what it used to be, and I don't want to forget anything important. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. Still worried, mind you, but… a little less. Now, where are those papers?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bohnett. Here you are. These provide a good overview of healthy eating and exercise. And I'll jot down a few questions for you to ask the nurse – that’s a great idea. Here we go. "What is involved in the echocardiogram procedure?
PATIENT: “What is involved in the echocardiogram procedure?"… Yes, that’s a good start. And... "Are there any risks associated with the procedure?"... Oh, and "How long will it take?"… and… "Will I be able to drive myself home afterwards?" I always worry about drivin’ after… well, after anything, really. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man. I appreciate it more than you know. Now, let's have a look at these papers… and maybe we can figure out a plan to get me walkin' a little more and eatin’ a little less roast beef. It's a start, isn't it? A small step at a time.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bohnett, it is a start. And that’s all that matters. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll work together to help you feel your best. I'll leave you to review the handouts, and I’ll check back in shortly. The nurse will be with you soon to discuss the echocardiogram. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to ask. And Mr. Bohnett?
