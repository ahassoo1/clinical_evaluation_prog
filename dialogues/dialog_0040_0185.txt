DOCTOR: Right. Zelina, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so if we could just get this over with… it’s my breath, right? It smells. Bad. Like, obviously. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: “Obviously” isn’t a medical term, dear. And frankly, I have other patients waiting. Just tell me when you noticed it started smelling, and what it smells like. Be specific. And try not to waste my time.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. When… honestly, probably a few weeks ago? It's just… a smell. A bad smell. Like, morning breath, but all the time. Not like garlic or anything. Just… unpleasant. Look, I work outside, okay? It could be anything. I deal with… things. It's not like I spend all day smelling roses. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: "Things," you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, like… dirt, and… you know, highway stuff. Asphalt gets hot. People leave trash. It’s not exactly a perfume factory out there. Look, I don't need to explain my job to you. I just need to know if you can fix the smell. Honestly, it’s probably nothing, but my ex-husband is…particular. And he's been making snide comments. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Your ex-husband’s social life isn’t relevant to your medical care. But, alright. So, this smell… has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean? I’ve been working the same route for months. No, nothing’s changed. Except maybe… I started using a new hand soap? It was on sale at the gas station. Smelled like lemons. Probably makes things worse, now that you mention it. Does it interact with… highway stuff? Look, I don’t know, I’m not a scientist.
DOCTOR: It's unlikely your hand soap is the sole cause, dear. But, alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I don’t have a fever or anything. My mouth doesn’t hurt. I just… don’t want to smell bad. Is being annoyed a symptom? I’m a little tired, maybe. But that’s from work, obviously. Look, I'm not sick. Just… smelly. Is there a spray I can buy or something? Can we skip the whole "describe your feelings" part?
DOCTOR: A spray will only mask the problem, dear. I need to understand why you smell. Any nasal congestion?
PATIENT: Nasal… what? Like a stuffy nose? Sometimes, yeah. When the dust is bad. It’s a highway, okay? Dust happens. I just blow it out. It doesn’t bother me much. Look, I'm pretty tough. I work outside. Do I need to list every little thing that happens to me on a daily basis? Are you going to ask me about splinters next? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just have a quick look in your mouth, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… try not to poke around too much. I have things to do. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your gums are slightly inflamed, and there's a bit of tartar buildup. Nothing dramatic, but certainly contributing. And your tonsils... appear slightly enlarged. Okay, so it looks like gingivitis and potentially some mild tonsillitis. That can cause bad breath. Likely exacerbated by your… work environment.
PATIENT: Gingivitis? Tonsill… whatever. Look, I don’t even know what those words mean. Does that mean I’m… sick? And will it make the ex-husband stop complaining? Just tell me what I need to do. Do I need pills? A shot? Something fast. I really don't have time for a long treatment plan.
DOCTOR: It’s not life-threatening, dear. It’s poor oral hygiene and exposure to… unfavorable conditions. Pills are unlikely necessary. Here’s what you need to do: Brush twice daily, floss every day. Use an antibacterial mouthwash. And, frankly, if you’re concerned, consider seeing a dentist. I can give you a referral, but I’m not a dentist. This should resolve it within a few weeks. If it doesn’t, or if you develop a fever or sore throat, then you see a doctor. Now, do you have any other complaints?
PATIENT: Floss. Right. Just great. More things to do. Look, I barely have time to sleep, let alone floss. Fine. I'll... try. I guess. Is that it? Can I go now? Honestly, I thought you'd give me some magic spray or something. This is incredibly unhelpful. And no, that's it. I’m done. Just give me the referral. And hurry, please. I’m losing daylight.
DOCTOR: Here. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. And dear, please consider improving your hygiene. It's not just about the smell. NEXT! .
PATIENT: .
