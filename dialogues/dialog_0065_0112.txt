DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been going to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, certainly. I can’t seem to quite get comfortable, and I find myself needing to go all the time. I apologize for being so vague; it’s just… hard to explain, and honestly, I’m a little unsure of when it started, precisely.
DOCTOR: "Quite a lot" is subjective, Ms. MacVittie. Could you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Quantify… right. Let me think. Normally, I’d say… perhaps three or four times a day. Now? It feels like every couple of hours, even if I haven’t had much to drink. Sometimes more. It’s… disruptive, to say the least. I’m sorry I can't be more precise; it's not something I actively count, you understand.
DOCTOR: And is this accompanied by any urgency?
PATIENT: Urgency? Yes, I believe so. It’s not a… a sharp pain, exactly, but a strong need to go, and very quickly. If I delay… well, it’s unpleasant. It’s not debilitating, but it certainly makes leaving the house a bit… stressful. Especially if I'm not certain where a restroom will be. I hope that clarifies things somewhat.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the urine? Oh, goodness. I… I don’t recall specifically. I haven’t been paying that close attention, I’m afraid. Is there something I should be looking for? I honestly haven't examined it closely, if you don't mind my saying so. I feel terribly unobservant.
DOCTOR: It's not something most people meticulously observe, Ms. MacVittie. However, has it been clear, cloudy, any unusual color, or have you noticed any blood?
PATIENT: Oh! Blood… no, I haven’t noticed any blood. That would be… quite alarming. The color… it seemed normal, I think. Perhaps a little lighter than usual, but honestly, the lighting in my bathroom isn’t the best. And I suppose I haven’t really compared it to… a standard color. Cloudy… I can’t say I’ve noticed it being cloudy, no. Perhaps a little foamy sometimes, but I attributed that to… the soap, I think. It’s a new brand. I apologize for being so unhelpful. I truly am trying to recall anything relevant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to other symptoms. Any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or back pain accompanying this increased urinary frequency?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully none of those. No fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. And my back… well, it aches a bit sometimes, as I get older, but nothing more than usual. It’s more of a general stiffness, I think, from… sitting at my desk for long periods. It’s not sharp, and it doesn’t seem related to the bathroom issue. I’m relieved it’s not accompanied by anything more serious.
DOCTOR: Do you have any history of urinary tract infections, kidney stones, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… I believe I had a urinary tract infection once, many years ago, when I was younger. Perhaps… ten or fifteen years ago? It was treated with antibiotics, and I don’t recall having one since. Kidney stones… no, I don’t think so. And diabetes… no, I’ve never been diagnosed with diabetes. I try to eat fairly healthily, though I do enjoy a sweet treat now and then. I hope that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… yes, Doctor. I am. Though… not currently involved with anyone long-term. It’s…casual, if that makes sense. I apologize for being so vague. It feels… personal to discuss.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I will also need a urine sample. We need to rule out infection. Please follow me.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A urine sample, of course. Lead the way, please. I'll follow you. I apologize if this is taking up too much of your time. I do appreciate you taking the time to examine me.
DOCTOR: Please sit here. I’ll leave a cup for the sample. While you're collecting that, I'll listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. This is… a bit embarrassing, isn’t it? But I understand it’s necessary. Just let me know if there’s anything specific I should do. I wouldn't want to do it incorrectly.
DOCTOR: Just a midstream clean catch. Void a small amount into the toilet, then collect the sample in the cup without touching the sides. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Bowel sounds are normal. Now, if you could please provide me with the urine sample when you are ready.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A midstream clean catch, you said? Right. I believe I can manage that. Here you are. I do hope I’ve done it correctly. It felt a little awkward, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you. We'll send this to the lab for a urinalysis and culture. While we wait for the results, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any instances of kidney disease or bladder problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a good question. To be honest, I don’t know a great deal about my family’s medical history. My mother passed away when I was quite young, and I wasn’t very close to my father’s side of the family. I believe my grandmother… on my mother’s side… had some sort of urinary problem, perhaps a bladder infection, but I’m not certain. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very involved in those conversations. I apologize for my lack of information.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms and lack of significant family history, and pending the lab results, it could be a simple urinary tract infection or, less likely, interstitial cystitis. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I am going to order a complete blood count as well. We will also check your kidney function.
PATIENT: Oh. More tests… I understand. That sounds… thorough. Is that standard procedure, Doctor? I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. I do appreciate you being so careful. It's just a little unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Ms. MacVittie. It's best to be comprehensive. While we wait for the results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and urinating immediately after intercourse. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in one week. If your symptoms worsen significantly—fever, chills, back pain, blood in your urine—please seek immediate medical attention.
PATIENT: Oh, that… that sounds manageable. More fluids, avoid caffeine… I can certainly do that. And the other… advice, of course. I appreciate the clear instructions, Doctor. One week… alright. I'll mark it in my calendar. And thank you again for being so patient with me. It’s been… a little embarrassing, but I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to address it. I suppose that's all for today, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, for today. The lab results should be available in approximately 48-72 hours, and my office will contact you to schedule the follow-up appointment. Here is a summary of today's visit and instructions. Please review it carefully. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very helpful. No, I don’t believe so. You’ve answered all my questions, and I feel… reassured, honestly. I appreciate your time and attention. I'll follow the instructions carefully and contact the office if anything changes. Thank you again, Doctor Duplichan. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. Have a good day, Ms. MacVittie.
