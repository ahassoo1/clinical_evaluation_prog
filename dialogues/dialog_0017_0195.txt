DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. Dr. Blim. Now, let's not waste any time. You’re sixty years of age, as I see here. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Sixty-two, actually. And it’s not…a problem, exactly. Just…well, my daughter says I should get a little note from the doctor. A “get well” card, she calls it. For…encouragement. Honestly, I think she worries too much. But she handles the bills, so…here I am.
DOCTOR: A note for “encouragement.” Right. Well, Ms. Micucci, while I appreciate family concern, a physician's time is valuable. Is there anything medically you'd like me to address?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t you start with me about valuable time. I didn’t ask for this, my daughter did. And no, nothing’s broken. I don’t need you poking and prodding. Just…write the card. Say something nice. “Wishing you strength,” or whatever. It’s for her peace of mind, really. Honestly, young people today…always fussing.
DOCTOR: Very well. But I must at least document a reason for this visit, for my records. Are you experiencing any fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue? What kind of question is that? I work! Every day. In the factory. Assembling…things. It’s work! Of course I'm tired at the end of the day. That's what people are when they work. Is that what you want to write on the card? “Ms. Micucci is tired because she works?” It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I assure you, I am not attempting to be facetious. “Fatigue” can be indicative of numerous underlying conditions. Are you experiencing excessive fatigue?
PATIENT: Excessive? Look, I get up, I go to work, I come home, I make dinner, I sleep. Maybe I sit down for an extra ten minutes sometimes. Is that excessive? You are making a mountain out of a molehill. My daughter said I seemed a little…down, after my cousin passed. That’s it. A little sad. Not “excessive fatigue.” Honestly, you’re asking silly questions. Just write the card, Doctor. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on then. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, my feet hurt sometimes. From standing all day. And my back. But that’s…old age. And work. What factory worker doesn’t have a sore back? It's not like it’s a surprise. Do you need a detailed list of every ache and creak? I’m sixty-two, not twenty! Write that down, if it makes you feel better. "Patient reports typical aches for age and occupation." There. Done. Can we please be finished now? I didn’t come here to be interrogated.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I am attempting to gather a basic medical history. Have you experienced any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. I breathe. All the time. Like everyone else. What is wrong with you today, Doctor? Are you feeling alright? You’re asking the strangest questions. My daughter said I was a little quiet. A little…melancholy. Not gasping for air! Honestly, I’m starting to feel a little insulted. Is this some kind of test? Are you trying to make me look…foolish? Just write the card and I’ll be on my way. “Patient denies undue shortness of breath.” Happy now?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s try this. Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake! Now you’re asking about my digestion? This is preposterous! I eat normal food. Sometimes I eat too much. Sometimes I don’t. Sometimes things…move, and sometimes they don’t. Is this what doctors do all day? Pry into people's private business? I’m a perfectly healthy woman! Well, relatively. For my age. And my job. Just write the card! I swear, my daughter is going to hear about this. The way you're going on… it’s simply unbelievable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Last question, and I mean it. Any dizziness or fainting spells?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. I haven’t fallen over. Not once. I haven’t even felt like falling over. Look, I'm a strong woman. I work hard. I take care of my family. I’m not…fragile. This is ridiculous. Write the card. A simple “Get Well Soon” card. Is that too much to ask? My daughter will be furious if you keep quizzing me like this. Honestly, you're wasting both of our time. Just. Write. The. Card.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I have documented a visit for “patient concern as expressed by daughter regarding decreased energy levels and emotional state.” I will draft a note stating “Wishing you strength and good health.” Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Finally! Yes. That’s…acceptable. Just make sure it’s a nice card. Not one of those…generic ones. Something with flowers, maybe? And please, don't mention the interrogation. My daughter doesn’t need to know you thought I was…falling apart. Now, if you'll excuse me… I have things to do. A very important dinner to make. And a very long story to tell my daughter about this…visit.
DOCTOR: Here. And please, do not hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if any actual medical concerns arise. Good day, Ms. Micucci. Some people…
