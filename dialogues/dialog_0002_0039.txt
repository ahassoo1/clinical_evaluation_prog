DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Bohnett, welcome! I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. My regular doctor, Doctor Svenson, he retired, you see. And the new place sent me over here. Said I had some… high cholesterol, I think they called it? Something about my numbers being a bit off during a checkup. I’m not real good with all that medical talk, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can be a lot to keep track of. Don't worry, we'll take it slow. So, you had a checkup recently where they mentioned your cholesterol was a little high?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. About a month ago, I reckon. They just gave me a piece of paper with a bunch of numbers and told me to see someone about it. I mostly just eat normal food, you know? Meat and potatoes, a bit of fish sometimes. Not much fast food, though. My wife, bless her soul, she always cooked good, healthy meals. It’s been a bit lonely cooking for just myself since she passed.
DOCTOR: I’m so sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Bohnett. That must be very difficult. It's wonderful that she cooked healthy meals for you both. Okay, so you eat a pretty standard diet, mostly home-cooked. And about a month ago, a checkup showed some elevated cholesterol. Do you remember what specific numbers they gave you on that paper?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… I still have the paper here somewhere… Ah, here we go. It says… total cholesterol is 245, HDL is 40, and LDL is 160. And triglycerides… 180, I think? Is that right? Numbers always swim around in my head a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for finding that. Those numbers are helpful. Yes, those are all important numbers to look at when we talk about cholesterol. So, a total cholesterol of 245 is considered elevated. Your HDL, which is the “good” cholesterol, is a little on the lower side, and your LDL, the “bad” cholesterol, is definitely elevated. Your triglycerides are also a bit high. Before we talk about what this means and potential next steps, could you tell me a little about your overall health history?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve always been pretty healthy, all my life. Never smoked, barely drink. Worked as a supervisor for protective services, mostly desk work, thankfully. Lots of paperwork. Had a bit of high blood pressure when I was younger, maybe 50s, but they gave me a little pill for that and it kept it under control. Still take that pill, actually. Other than that… had my appendix out when I was a boy, and a bad knee a few years back, but that’s about it. Nothing major, thankfully. Oh! And I had the flu pretty bad last winter. But everyone gets the flu, don't they?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, no major health issues other than some high blood pressure managed with medication, an appendectomy as a child, a bad knee, and the flu last winter. And you’re currently taking medication for high blood pressure – do you know what the name of that medication is?
PATIENT: Let me see… I keep all my pills in a special box. Here it is… Lisinopril, that’s it. Ten milligrams, once a day. Been taking it for… oh, must be fifteen years now, at least. Keeps me ticking, that little pill. Doctor Svenson always said it was a good one.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily for your blood pressure. That's good information. And you said you had the flu last winter - did you need to go to the hospital or see a doctor for that, or did you manage it at home?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I didn’t need to go to the hospital. I just stayed home, drank lots of fluids, and rested. My neighbor, Mrs. Olsen, she brought me soup and checked on me a few times. A really nice lady. I just rode it out, you know? A bad week, but nothing a little rest and chicken soup couldn’t fix. Doctor Svenson called in something for the fever, but that was about it. Still feeling a bit weak sometimes, if I'm honest. But I reckon that's just old age creeping up on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you managed the flu at home with rest and fluids, and a medication called in by Doctor Svenson for the fever. And you’ve been feeling a bit weak since then. Now, just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… Let me think. My mother, bless her heart, she had a bit of heart trouble when she got older. She needed some… a pacemaker, I think they called it. And my father, he had high blood pressure too, just like me. He didn’t take care of himself as well as I do, though. Smoked a lot, drank a bit too much. And my sister, she had… well, she had diabetes. That was a bad one. She didn't live to be very old, unfortunately. Not much heart trouble on my wife's side, though. She was always very healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heart trouble in your mother with a pacemaker, high blood pressure in your father, and diabetes in your sister. That’s good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you exercise at all?
PATIENT: Well, I used to, when I was younger. Walked a lot, used to go fishing up north with my buddies. But my knee’s been acting up for a while now, so I don’t get around as much anymore. Mostly just putter around the house, do a bit of gardening when the weather’s nice. Not much strenuous activity, I’m afraid. Mostly just trying to stay comfortable these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited exercise due to your knee. And, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, or any other allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to any pills before, thankfully. And no food allergies, no bee stings, nothing like that. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. Always been a pretty sturdy Swede, you see. Though, sometimes I sneeze a bit in the spring with all the pollen, but that’s just normal, isn't it? Nothing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just some seasonal sneezing. That's good. Alright, Mr. Bohnett, let’s recap. You're an 88-year-old Swedish male, previously healthy but with a recent cholesterol check showing elevated total cholesterol , LDL , and triglycerides with a low HDL . You take Lisinopril for high blood pressure, have a history of high blood pressure and heart trouble in your family, and a sister with diabetes. You have some limited activity due to a bad knee, and no known allergies. Given these factors, and your age, we need to address this high cholesterol to reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. It sounds like lifestyle changes will be important, but medication may also be necessary. Before we talk about specific options, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just want to get this sorted out, you know? Don't want to be a burden to anyone. Go ahead, do what you need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles noted. Now, I'm going to check your pulse in both of your wrists. Pulses are present and regular in both radial arteries, 2+ strength. And finally, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 138/72. Okay, everything sounds good so far. Your heart and lungs sound clear, your pulses are good, and your blood pressure is well-controlled on your Lisinopril. We will order some blood work to confirm these initial findings and get a more detailed look at your cholesterol levels. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you taking such good care of me. Blood work sounds fine. Whatever you need, just let me know. I'm just glad to be getting this checked out. Hopefully it's not too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m going to order a lipid panel, which will give us a detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels, and a complete metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. We’ll also check your blood sugar. I’ll also order a TSH to check your thyroid function. The lab is just down the hall. You can go anytime after I print out the requisition form for you. It doesn't require any fasting, so you can eat normally today. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to manage your cholesterol. It might include lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, and potentially medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I can do that. No fasting, that’s good! I was worried I’d have to skip my breakfast. Just let me know when I can get these papers, and I’ll head down to the lab. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. You've put my mind at ease. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This form has all the instructions. The lab technician will take care of everything. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once you’ve had the blood work done, just give the clinic a call and let them know, and we’ll get you scheduled for a follow-up appointment as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you head down to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything very well. Chest pain… yes, I’ll remember that. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kindness. Thank you again for everything. I’ll go down to the lab now and get this done. I’m sure everything will be fine. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Bohnett. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care.
