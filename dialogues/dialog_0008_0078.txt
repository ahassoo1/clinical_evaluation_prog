DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a…reset, I suppose. A jumpstart to feeling like myself again. I’m not sure exactly where to begin, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, "feeling stuck"… I understand. That's a pretty common feeling, actually. Let's try to unpack that a bit. When did you start feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It hasn’t been sudden, not at all. Perhaps…six months ago? It started gradually, I think. Just a general lack of energy, and…not enjoying things the way I used to. It’s hard to pinpoint an exact moment, really. It just…crept up on me.
DOCTOR: Six months… gradual onset. Okay. And can you tell me a little more about this lack of energy?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not that I’m exhausted all the time, Doctor. It's more like…everything feels like a bigger effort than it used to. Even things I normally enjoy. I used to love working in my studio, shaping the clay, casting pieces…but now? It feels…heavy. I find myself putting it off, making excuses. And then I feel guilty about that, which makes it even worse. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not necessarily fatigue, but a sense of effort and diminished pleasure in activities you used to enjoy. That's helpful. And has this been impacting other areas of your life – work, relationships, things like that?
PATIENT: Yes, it has, actually. My husband, Ricardo, has been very understanding, thankfully. But I know it’s been…noticeable. I haven’t been as social, I’ve been less…present. And work…well, I’m a bit behind on some commissions. It’s not that I can’t do the work, it's just…difficult to motivate myself. I worry about it, truthfully. I pride myself on my work. It's embarrassing to admit.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Ms. Pitzel. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things. It sounds like this is causing you some stress, which is understandable. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully. A few minor things over the years—the usual colds and flu—but nothing serious. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and I have slightly high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Otherwise, I’m quite robust, generally. My mother always said I had strong bones!
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed as a teenager, controlled hypertension. Good. And are you currently taking any medications for that blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, for the blood pressure. And…sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but that’s infrequent. Really, that’s it. Nothing else regularly. Oh! And a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg daily, occasional ibuprofen, multivitamin. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years—I love Colombian cuisine, and it can be quite…varied! No known allergies, thankfully. I’m quite lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother lived to be 88, and she was quite healthy for most of her life, though she did develop arthritis in her later years. My father passed away when I was young, from a heart condition, I believe. And my brother…he has diabetes, type 2, but he manages it well. That’s about it, really. No major illnesses on either side of the family, as far as I know. Though, my father did work a very stressful job. I sometimes wonder if that contributed to his heart problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother healthy until 88 with arthritis, father with heart condition, brother with type 2 diabetes. And finally, before we move on to a quick physical exam, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, I live with my husband, Ricardo, in the suburbs. We have a small garden, which I enjoy tending to. I used to be more active, but…lately, not so much. I work from home, in my studio, mostly. I eat a fairly healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables, though I do enjoy a good arepa now and then! I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol—a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, perhaps. I used to take regular walks, but…it’s been difficult to motivate myself lately, as I mentioned. I feel like I'm describing a very different person than I used to be.
DOCTOR: You're not describing a different person, Ms. Pitzel, just a person going through a change. Okay, that's helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Reflexes are normal. And finally, I'll just check your ears and throat. Ears are clear, throat looks healthy. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears normal. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of depression or perhaps adjustment disorder. However, to rule out any underlying medical causes, I’d like to order some basic blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That…makes sense, actually. I hadn’t really considered…that. It’s just been…a feeling of being weighed down, and less interested in things. And yes, blood work sounds sensible. I want to be sure, you know? Rule everything out. It would put my mind at ease. Please, proceed with whatever tests you deem necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. What kind of blood work are we talking about, if you don’t mind me asking?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your organ function, thyroid stimulating hormone to check your thyroid, and vitamin D levels. These tests will help rule out any physical causes for your symptoms. We’ll also check your B12 levels, as deficiency can sometimes cause similar feelings. It’s a pretty standard panel. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I would like to discuss some options for how we can move forward. Are you open to considering a referral to a therapist or counselor?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…thorough, Doctor. Thank you. And yes, I am open to considering a therapist or counselor. I’ve…thought about it, actually, but I wasn’t sure where to begin. If you have a recommendation, I would be very grateful. I think…talking to someone might be helpful. It's just been difficult to admit, you know? That I'm not…coping as well as I should be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. I have a list of excellent therapists in the area who specialize in adjustment disorders and depression. I'll print out a list with their contact information and specialties. We can also discuss some self-care strategies you can implement in the meantime. Things like regular exercise, healthy eating, and getting enough sleep. It sounds simple, but it can make a big difference. We will also reassess after the blood work comes back, to make sure there are no underlying medical issues. I’m going to write up some instructions for the blood work, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…very good, Doctor. Thank you for being so understanding and thorough. I appreciate it very much. A list of therapists would be wonderful, and any self-care strategies you can suggest would be greatly appreciated. It's a relief to finally be talking about it, honestly. A follow-up appointment sounds perfect as well. Whenever is convenient for you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here are the instructions for the blood work. The lab is located just down the street at 123 Main Street. And here's a list of therapists in the area. As for self-care, even small things can help. Try to engage in activities you enjoy, even if you don't feel like it. Spend time with loved ones. Practice mindfulness or meditation. And prioritize sleep. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the results. How does August 16th at 10:00 AM sound?
PATIENT: August 16th at 10:00 AM sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I feel…a little more hopeful, honestly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and offering these suggestions. I will schedule the blood work right away. Thank you. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I'm glad I could help. Remember, you're not alone in this, and there are resources available. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before our follow-up appointment. You have a good day as well.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I will.
