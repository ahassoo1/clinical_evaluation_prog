DOCTOR: Hello, Jacquille. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Look, I just... well, my wife thought it would be a good idea. She worries too much, honestly. It's about getting checked for... you know... the HIV thing. Just to be sure, she says. I don’t think I need it, but… here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's always good to be proactive about your health, and it's wonderful your wife encourages that. Even if you don’t think you need testing, a check-up is never a bad idea. It sounds like you're interested in an HIV test today, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. An HIV test. Look, I’m a fairly careful person, if you get my meaning. I haven't... well, I haven't been foolish. But she gets it in her head sometimes, and it's easier to just get it done than argue, you know? It's probably nothing, honestly. Just humouring her.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s very common for people to get tested for peace of mind, even without specific concerns. And you're right, it's often easier to just get it done. It’s good that you're willing to do that for your wife, and for yourself. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your recent sexual history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Really? Do we have to go there? Look, it’s… private. And frankly, a bit boring. It’s just my wife, for the last eight years. And before that… honestly, nothing important. A few dates, nothing serious. Why does it even matter? I told you, I’m careful. It’s all perfectly safe. It feels a bit… intrusive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, and I apologize if it feels intrusive. It’s not about judging, truly. It’s just standard medical practice – we need to assess risk factors to ensure accurate testing and appropriate care. Even a long-term, monogamous relationship requires us to ask these questions, as things can change. It helps us understand if testing is needed for other sexually transmitted infections as well. But if you're really not comfortable discussing details, that's okay. We can proceed with just the HIV test. But knowing a bit more allows me to provide the best possible care. Is there anything you are comfortable sharing?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Eight years, like I said. No… incidents. No other partners. Absolutely none. We’ve both been… faithful. She'd kill me if I wasn’t. And frankly, I wouldn’t risk it. She’s a good woman. Is that enough? Honestly, I don't understand why this is so important. It's just a test. Do it and let's be done with it. It's just wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Jacquille. That’s helpful. And I understand your frustration – it should be a quick process. It’s good to hear about your relationship, and it is reassuring. Just to be thorough, have you ever shared needles with anyone, or received any blood transfusions before 1985?
PATIENT: Needles? What are you even asking now? Blood transfusions… maybe when I was a kid? A long, long time ago. I don’t remember. Why would that even matter? Are you accusing me of something? This is ridiculous. I’m a respectable man. I’ve never… I mean, really. This is getting absurd. Just do the test. Please.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel accusatory, Jacquille. That’s absolutely not my intention. I’m just following standard medical protocols, asking about potential risk factors. The time frame for blood transfusions is important because testing wasn't as accurate then. It's good you don't have any history of needle sharing. And it’s perfectly fine if you don't remember details about something from your childhood. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. A physical exam. Honestly. This is all so unnecessary. But if it will finally let me leave, do what you have to do. Just… try to be quick, alright? I have things to do. I don't spend my afternoons getting poked and prodded for something that isn't even a problem.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. We’ll just check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. It won't take long. Could you please remove your shirt and shoes?
PATIENT: Really? Now? Must you make this even more uncomfortable? Fine. But I’m not happy about this. Just… hurry up. And try not to stare, alright? This is incredibly awkward. I mean, it’s not like I’m… you know. Just get it done.
DOCTOR: Of course. I apologize for any discomfort, Jacquille. This is a routine part of a physical exam, and it's simply to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. I will be as professional as possible. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Just… do it. And try not to poke me with whatever that thing is. Honestly. This is a complete waste of my time. Are you almost finished yet? I have a very busy afternoon. I can feel you prodding, you know. It's not comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 128 over 78, which is within a normal range. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Everything sounds clear. Your lymph nodes feel normal as well. Alright, everything appears to be normal from this quick physical assessment. Now, for the HIV test itself, we’ll just need a small blood sample. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, just get it over with. A blood sample. The whole point of coming here. Honestly, this has been an ordeal. Just… poke me and let me leave. Is it going to hurt? I really hate needles. Just hurry up, alright? I have better things to do than sit here getting poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: It will be a quick prick, and it shouldn’t hurt much. It's a very small needle, and it's over quickly. I’ll let you know when I’m about to insert it. Okay, all done. Just a little pressure here for a moment. There you go. It's best to keep that bandage on for about fifteen minutes. The results will be available in about 20 minutes. While we wait, I'll document everything in your chart. Do you have any questions while we wait?
PATIENT: Twenty minutes? Seriously? I have a very busy schedule. And no, I don’t have any questions. Just tell me when it’s done, alright? I’d like to get out of here as quickly as possible. This whole experience has been… unpleasant. Honestly. Just wake me when it's over.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your frustration, Jacquille. I’ll let you know as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, feel free to relax. I'll check on you in a few minutes to ensure you are doing alright.
