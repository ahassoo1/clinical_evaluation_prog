DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My back… it’s been quite painful. I want to get this sorted quickly, if possible. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Right. "Quite painful," is… helpful. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… yes. It’s a sharp ache, mostly lower back. Feels like… like someone is pressing down, hard. It started about a week ago, after I was working on the south fence line. Lifting posts, mostly. It hasn't gotten better with rest, and bending over is… difficult. Very difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay. A week ago, after work on the fence line…lifting posts. And it’s a sharp ache, lower back, worse with bending. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant, yes. But bending makes it… much, much worse. Like a knife. And lifting…forget lifting. That’s out of the question for now. I need to be able to lift again, soon. I have a job to finish.
DOCTOR: “A job to finish.” Of course. Is the pain radiating anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiating… does that mean spreading? It sometimes goes down my… right leg. Not all the way to my foot, thankfully. Just sort of down the side of my thigh. It's not constant, just… when it's particularly bad.
DOCTOR: Down the right thigh, when it's bad… Alright. And would you describe it as a shooting pain, a dull ache, or something else?
PATIENT: It’s…sharp, mostly. Like a…a strong cramp, but it doesn't really feel like a cramp. More like…a tight, squeezing pressure, if that makes sense. Then the sharp ache. It's hard to explain. Is this helping you? I don't mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: It’s…adequate. You’re not being difficult, Ms. Reihner, though clarity is, of course, useful. Okay. Sharp, squeezing pressure radiating down the right thigh. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Just the pain. And some stiffness, especially in the mornings. It takes a while to… loosen up, you know? But no tingling, definitely not. Just… pain. And it makes it hard to stand for long.
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the mornings… Right. Do you have any trouble with your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: Trouble…? I… I don't understand the question. Are you asking if I have difficulty… using the restroom? It’s a personal question, Doctor. Is that relevant to my back pain?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Reihner. Some nerve issues can affect those functions. Just a standard question, nothing to be embarrassed about. No change in bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: No. No change at all. Everything is… normal, there. I apologize if that is too much information, Doctor. It just seems an odd thing to ask about my back.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. Let's move on. Have you injured your back before?
PATIENT: Yes. Years ago, when I was younger. Helping my husband with some timber, I fell. Not a bad fall, but I pulled something. I recovered quickly, with rest. This…this is different. Much more persistent. It's not getting better on its own, which is concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Previous injury… recovered with rest. This is…different. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? My mother had… arthritis, in her hands, mostly. And my father…he had problems with his knees, from working the land. Nothing with backs, if that's what you're asking. It wasn’t discussed much. We didn't have much time for discussing ailments.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I might have a small glass of wine with supper on a holiday, but that’s it. And drugs… that's not for me. I need a clear head for my work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just Medicare, Doctor. For routine checkups. No regular medication. I take ibuprofen sometimes, when the pain is especially bad. But it barely touches it, honestly. It helps with the inflammation, a little, but that's it. It’s not a solution. I need to get back to work. Is there anything you can do?
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen… I see. Now, I'm going to need to examine your back. Can you lie down on your stomach on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. The table, you said? . Just… tell me when you are ready. I'll be careful. This back… it’s very sensitive.
DOCTOR: When you're comfortable. I need to palpate your spine, check your range of motion, and do a neurological assessment. I need to feel for any areas of tenderness or muscle spasm. Please let me know if anything causes significant pain.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. . Be gentle, please. And let me know what you find. I hope it's not too serious. I have work to finish.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner. I’m going to start here, just feeling for any tenderness. Any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Ooh…yes. Right there. That's…uncomfortable. Quite uncomfortable. Not sharp, exactly, just…a deep ache. And… and it makes it harder to breathe, a little. Please be careful.
DOCTOR: Lower lumbar tenderness… deep ache, associated with some difficulty breathing. And here?
PATIENT: There! Yes! That’s it. That's the spot. It's like a…a knot. A tight knot of pain. I try to ignore it, but…it’s difficult. It radiates down my leg again, just a little. Please… how bad is this? Is it serious? I don't understand all this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Muscle spasm is present, moderate. Range of motion is…limited, particularly with flexion. Now, Ms. Reihner, I want you to lift your right leg, keeping it straight. Just as high as you comfortably can.
PATIENT: This is… difficult. And it hurts. Not a shooting pain, but…a deep stretch. It feels like something is pulling. I can't lift it much higher. It feels…wrong. Please stop. It's making it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Stop there. Limited range of motion, positive straight leg raise on the right…indicative of possible nerve root irritation. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax.
PATIENT: Relax… yes. It's difficult to relax when everything is aching. The tapping… it tickles. Is it normal to feel a bit numb? I think my toes feel… a little strange. Not completely numb, but… not as sensitive as they usually are. Mostly on the top of my foot. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Decreased sensation on the dorsum of the right foot… that is relevant. Alright, Ms. Reihner, you can sit up now. Take your time. Okay. Based on my examination and your history, it appears you have a lumbar strain with possible nerve root impingement. It's likely the lifting you were doing on the fence line triggered this. We'll need some imaging to confirm, however.
PATIENT: Imaging…? What kind of imaging? An X-ray? A scan? And what does "nerve root impingement" mean? Is that… serious? Will I be able to work again? This is very concerning, Doctor. I need to know what this means for my job. I have deadlines. I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. Let's not panic. Imaging. An MRI is what I’m thinking. It gives us a much clearer picture of the soft tissues, the nerves, the discs. "Nerve root impingement" means the nerve is being compressed, irritated. It can cause pain, weakness, numbness, as you've described. Whether you’ll be able to work again… depends on the severity of the impingement. The MRI will tell us that. For now, I’m going to order the MRI and prescribe you a course of muscle relaxants and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory. We'll also want to consider physical therapy. I’ll also give you a referral to a specialist, a neurosurgeon, Dr. Evans, just in case further intervention is needed. We need to rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A neurosurgeon… That sounds…very serious. So you think it might be something very bad? Muscle relaxants…will those make me drowsy? I need to be alert. And physical therapy… how long will that take? Weeks? Months? And what about my work? I have a deadline next week. I need to know what my options are. I can’t just… sit around. Do you think there's any chance I could do some light work while I recover? Is that even possible?
DOCTOR: Ms. Reihner, I understand your concerns, but jumping to conclusions won’t help. A referral to a neurosurgeon is standard practice in cases like this—it doesn't necessarily mean you need surgery. It allows us to get a comprehensive evaluation. The muscle relaxants can cause some drowsiness, yes, but it’s usually mild. We can adjust the dosage if needed. As for your work… frankly, at this stage, I cannot advise you to do any lifting or strenuous activity. Given your symptoms, and pending the MRI results, any attempt to push through this could cause further damage. I know that’s not what you want to hear, but it's my professional opinion. Let’s focus on getting you an MRI scheduled as quickly as possible. I’ll have my assistant schedule it for you, and we’ll go from there. The neurosurgeon will be able to give you a more accurate prognosis and treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable…? No, it's not acceptable. It's frustrating. But I suppose… I have no choice. An MRI… and I’ll see the neurosurgeon. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please, as soon as possible. I need to know what I’m dealing with. And is there anything—anything—I can do in the meantime to manage the pain? Even just something over-the-counter? Something to help me sleep? And what about a follow up? When can I expect to hear about the MRI results? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll have the assistant schedule the MRI for tomorrow morning. And I’ll write you a prescription for a low dose muscle relaxant and a non-narcotic pain reliever. You can take them as directed for the pain. For sleep, I recommend an over-the-counter antihistamine, like diphenhydramine, but be aware it can cause drowsiness. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week, once the MRI results are available. You'll receive a call from the assistant to coordinate. It will likely be approximately 7-10 days. In the meantime, avoid any lifting, bending, or strenuous activity. Apply ice packs to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. And if the pain worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness or loss of bowel or bladder control, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No…I think that’s all. Ice packs…avoid strenuous activity… the neurosurgeon… it’s a lot to process. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it's not too serious. I'll… I’ll see the assistant. .
DOCTOR: Good day, Ms. Reihner. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes.
