DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice! It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I don't quite recall everything. Something about a social visit? My husband insisted, you see. We just moved here, and he's very particular about these things. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant. Let's just get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is good to know, thank you. And don't worry about recalling everything, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like this is a bit of a check-up, then, prompted by your move. A fresh start often includes making sure everything’s in order, health-wise. Hmm… a social visit, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a… a “social healthcare visit”, as they called it. Honestly, all these forms and appointments. It’s rather a bother. I feel perfectly fine, as far as I can tell. I haven’t been ill in years. Are you going to poke and prod me? Because I really don’t have time for that.
DOCTOR: No poking and prodding unless it’s necessary, Candice, I promise. We'll start with a little chat, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. It helps me to see the bigger picture. So, you mentioned feeling perfectly fine for years… that’s wonderful! Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose it has been quite a while. I've always been… robust, you could say. Very active, even now. Though my knees aren't what they used to be. And I do get tired more easily, but that's just… age, isn't it? I used to work as a dispatcher, you know. Very stressful job, always on the phone. I've been retired for some time now. Honestly, I don't see what good all these questions are doing. Are you a specialist of something?
DOCTOR: Robust is good! That’s excellent to hear. And yes, fatigue can definitely be a sign of age, or it could be something else. We’ll figure it out. I am a Family Medicine doctor, Candice, so I look at everything – a bit of everything, really. The dispatcher job sounds demanding; stress can certainly take its toll. Just to get a more complete picture, do you mind if I ask a few questions about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, history. Honestly, it’s all a blur. I've had the usual things, I suppose. A cold here and there. The flu, once or twice. Nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was ages ago. My husband keeps all the records, you'd really need to ask him. He's terribly organized, bless his heart. It’s all so… unnecessary. Are we almost done? I have a luncheon to attend later.
DOCTOR: Alright, no serious illnesses, tonsils out as a child… that’s good to know. And it’s perfectly alright that your husband keeps the records; we can certainly reach out to him if needed. We don’t have to go through everything in detail right now. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take something for my knees, a little white pill. I can't recall the name, honestly. My husband orders it for me. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take a little something, but it doesn’t always work. That’s about it, I believe. No vitamins or anything fancy. I prefer a good cup of tea, if I'm feeling unwell. Really, I don’t understand why we're going through all of this. I feel perfectly capable of judging my own health. Are you sure you're a doctor?
DOCTOR: A little white pill for your knees, something for sleep… that's helpful. It’s quite common to forget names, Candice, don’t worry about it. And yes, I assure you, I am a doctor. We ask these questions just to be thorough and make sure we don’t miss anything. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Heavens, no. I’ve never had an allergy in my life. I eat anything and everything. My husband is the fussy one, always reading labels and avoiding gluten and… whatever else is fashionable these days. I’ve always had a strong constitution, you see. Honestly, this is all rather insulting. Are we quite finished? I really must be going. My hair… it needs attention, and the luncheon… it’s with important people. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. No allergies, strong constitution… that’s good to know. I understand your frustration, and I apologize if any of this feels unnecessary. Since you feel so well, and are eager to get to your luncheon, let’s keep things brief. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It will only take a few moments. Would that be alright?
