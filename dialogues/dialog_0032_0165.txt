DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. It’s this fever… keeps comin’ back. It ain’t nothin’ major, usually, just feels like the flu, but it bothers me. Been happenin’ for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. “Fever, recurring.” And how long exactly has this been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… gosh, maybe six, seven months ago? Comes and goes, like the tide. Usually a couple days, then I’m fine for a few weeks, then bam, it's back. It’s hard to keep track, honestly.
DOCTOR: Six to seven months, intermittent. That is quite a while for something simply resembling the flu. And when you say "feels like the flu," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Well, you know… achy all over. Mostly my back and legs, which, Doc, you know as a chiropractor, is always somethin’ with me. Headache too, not a killer, just… there. And tired. Real tired. No cough, no sniffles, no nothin’ like a normal cold. Just… weak and hot.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no respiratory symptoms. Primarily myalgia – muscle aches – headache, and fatigue, accompanied by fever. Do you take your temperature when you feel these fevers coming on?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. My wife, Elena, usually does it. She worries. It usually gets up to around 101, 102. Doesn’t go much higher. And it usually comes down on its own after a day or two, like I said.
DOCTOR: 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit, self-resolving. And has anything changed before these episodes begin?
PATIENT: Hmm… changed? Let me think… Not really. We usually eat the same stuff. No new travel. Elena's been workin' in the garden a lot more, which is nice. I haven’t been liftin’ anything too heavy at the shop. Now that I think about it… there was that batch of new mulch she got for the roses. Smelled kinda funny. But I doubt it's that.
DOCTOR: New mulch… potentially an environmental exposure. We’ll need to consider that. I’m going to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and feel for any swollen lymph nodes. Just routine, Mr. Brege.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doc. Whatever you need to do. I always figure a good lookin' at is best. I ain’t afraid of a little listenin’ and feelin’. Just let me know if it’s gonna be cold. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Quite right. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale. Now, I'm listening to your back. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Nope, not there. A little stiff, usually, but no pain. You know how it is, Doc. Sixty-five years of wear and tear. Ooh, maybe there a little bit. But that’s just my usual bad spot. Been there for years.
DOCTOR: That location is consistent with chronic musculoskeletal discomfort. Now, I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart rate is regular at 72. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Everything appears normal… clinically, at least. Now, I'd like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a sedimentation rate. The sedimentation rate will help us look for signs of inflammation.
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Alright, Doc. If you think it's necessary. I don't love needles, but I trust your judgment. Where do I go to get that done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’ll take a small blood sample. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back – usually within 24 to 48 hours – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your fever spikes above 103, or you experience any new symptoms such as rash, shortness of breath, or severe headache, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doc. Elena keeps track of that stuff. I’m good. Just a little nervous about needles. But I’ll get it done. Thanks for lookin' me over. Hopefully, this blood work tells us somethin’. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Quite right, Mr. Brege. We'll get to the bottom of this. And while we await the results, I advise you to stay hydrated and rest. If your symptoms worsen before your follow-up appointment, do not hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Nah, Doc. I think that covers it. Just gotta go poke a hole in myself now. Thanks again for everything. I appreciate you takin’ the time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let the receptionist know you've completed your consultation. And I look forward to reviewing the results with you. Have a good day, Mr. Brege. .
PATIENT: .
