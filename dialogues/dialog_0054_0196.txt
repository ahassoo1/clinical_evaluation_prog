DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly. It's just been a while, you know? It makes everything hard.
DOCTOR: I understand. Tiredness can certainly make everything more difficult. It’s helpful you’re bringing this to our attention. When you say “always tired,” can you describe what that feels like, specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific… It’s not like… sleepy tired. It’s more… like dragging weights. Even after sleeping, I still feel… heavy. And… weak, I guess. Like I have no energy for anything. Does that make sense? It's just… draining. I don’t remember ever feeling not like this, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense. "Dragging weights" is a very good way to describe it. And it sounds like it's been going on for quite a while. Okay. Just to clarify, when you sleep – how many hours would you typically get each night?
PATIENT: Oh… hours. I… I don’t really keep track. Usually until I wake up? My husband, he… he used to make sure I got enough. But… that was a while ago. Maybe six? Seven? I really couldn't say for sure. It doesn't feel like enough, though. Even if I sleep a long time, I still feel… ugh, you know. Tired.
DOCTOR: I see. It's common to lose track when you're feeling unwell. Okay, six to seven hours is… potentially a bit on the lower end for some people, but we can explore that later. Let's talk about other things going on. Besides the tiredness and weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Oh dear. Let me think. I… sometimes my muscles ache. Not like a bad pain, just… sore. And I get headaches, a lot. Dull ones, mostly. I also… I forget things. All the time. Though… that’s probably just getting old, isn’t it? I forget why I walked into a room sometimes. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: It's good you're bringing all of this up. Muscle aches, headaches, and memory issues – those are all things we should investigate. And no, memory issues aren’t just from getting older, although they do become more common with age. Let's try to be thorough. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight… Not really. I… I’ve always been small. I don’t eat a lot. Maybe I've lost a little, but… I don’t weigh myself often. It's just… not something I think about, I guess. My clothes still fit, so… I haven’t noticed anything drastic.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? No, not really. I just… don't feel hungry much. Never really have. I eat when I remember to, or when someone… used to remind me. But it’s not like I crave anything. Food just doesn’t seem appealing, you know? I’ll just pick at things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… No, no fever. I don't think so. And no chills either. Night sweats… hmm… sometimes I wake up a little warm, but I always figured that was just the blankets. No, I haven't been sick with a fever or anything like that. Definitely not. I just… feel tired, all the time. That's the main thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're asking things I really don’t remember. Let me think… I had something with my… gallbladder, a long time ago. They… took it out. And… arthritis, I think? In my hands. But that was ages ago. It wasn’t bad. Oh! And I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take pills for that, yes. A little white one. But other than that… I honestly can't remember. It was a long time ago. My husband always handled the doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Gallbladder removal, arthritis, and high blood pressure. And you’re taking medication for the high blood pressure – just the one little white pill, you said. Do you know the name of that medication, or the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh dear… No, I don't. I just take it every morning. The doctor… prescribed it. I don't remember the name, or the number. I'm sorry. I really wish I could remember these things. I used to be so good with… everything. But it all feels so… fuzzy now.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. We can look that up in our system. Okay, it looks like you're currently taking Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension. Now, have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril. That's it! Yes, that's the one. And… surgeries… I don't think so. Just the gallbladder, I’m pretty sure. Maybe something with my… wrist, years ago, but it was very small, just a little thing. Nothing major. I really don’t remember. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. This is just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: No, you are doing just fine. It's alright, these things happen. Let's move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a hard one. My mother… she had heart problems, I think. She died when I was young. And my father… he had something with his lungs. But I don't really know what. We didn't talk about these things much, you know? And I have a sister… but we don't see each other. I haven't spoken to her in years. I'm really not sure. Sorry. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's alright, it's common not to have all the details. Now, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no! No, nothing like that. Never! I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, and definitely no drugs! My husband… he used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I never touched the stuff. No, I’m very careful with my health. I always have been. Except… for this tiredness. That’s just… wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes if I eat shellfish, but that's just a little thing. Nothing serious. I really can’t think of anything major. Is that… everything? I'm starting to feel a little overwhelmed. Can we… stop now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Licano, we can definitely stop for now. That was a lot of information, and you've been very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me - the prolonged fatigue, muscle aches, headaches, memory issues, and lack of appetite - I think we need to do some further investigation. I'd like to order some blood tests to check for things like anemia, thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, and inflammation. We’ll also check your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. If it will help find out what's wrong. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel… normal again. Can I just… go home now? I’m very tired. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll get those blood tests ordered right away. The nurse will come in shortly to draw them. It should only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Licano. For now, try to get some rest. If you feel any worsening symptoms – like a fever, severe weakness, or chest pain – please go to the emergency room immediately. Here's a printed sheet with instructions for the blood tests and the contact information for the clinic. Please let me know if you have any questions.
