DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well… it's about the cancer. I… I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Chellsea. That must be quite unsettling to hear. To ensure I have a complete understanding, could you tell me a bit more about what you were told?
PATIENT: It… it was a few weeks ago. The other doctor, he said… he said it's in my lung. He said I needed to see someone who… who could help me figure things out. I don't… I don't really understand all of it. It was a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Receiving news like that can be very overwhelming, and it's perfectly natural to feel confused and unsure. We will take things slowly and methodically. To start, do you recall the specific type of lung cancer the doctor mentioned, if any?
PATIENT: Um… he said something about… small cell? Or maybe it was… non-small cell? I honestly can't remember exactly. Everything felt… blurry. He talked about stages, too, but I didn't catch which stage. I'm sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize at all. It’s perfectly alright. These details can be difficult to process in a stressful situation. Small cell and non-small cell are the two main types, and staging is important for determining the best course of action. Do you happen to have any reports or paperwork from the previous doctor that you could share with me?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here it is. Everything he gave me is in there, I think. It has some… some pictures, too. From a scan, I believe.
DOCTOR: Thank you, this is very helpful. Let me take a few moments to go through these reports. Alright, it appears we have a CT scan report from July 28th, 2025, along with the pathology report from the biopsy. The pathology confirms the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer. The scan report indicates a lesion in the upper lobe of your right lung, measuring approximately 3 centimeters. It also notes some enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… I've been… very tired. More tired than usual. And I have a cough. It doesn’t really go away, even when I’m resting. Sometimes… sometimes it hurts to breathe, especially when I try to take a deep breath. Oh, and I’ve lost some weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Chellsea. That’s important information. Fatigue, persistent cough, shortness of breath, and unintentional weight loss are all symptoms we’ll want to address. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you had any other significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I… I had pneumonia when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. And… and my husband, he… he passed away last year. He had heart problems. Other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. Losing someone close is incredibly difficult. And thank you for sharing your medical history. It’s good to know you don’t smoke and rarely drink alcohol, as those are both risk factors for lung cancer. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had cancer. I don't remember what kind, but… it was a long time ago. No one else that I know of. Mostly healthy people, as far as I know. We don’t… we didn’t talk about health much.
DOCTOR: Thank you. It's helpful to have that information. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I can take most medications without any problems. I've always been pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I usually just… rest and drink plenty of water when I’m not feeling well. Except for vitamins. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Thank you. To complete the picture, would you mind if I perform a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: No, that’s… that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Chellsea. I appreciate your trust. We'll start with listening to your lungs and heart. Then, I’ll check your lymph nodes and overall condition. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. Now, again… I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds on the right side, which is consistent with the findings on the scan. Your heart sounds are regular, but I will note a slight murmur. I do feel some enlargement of the lymph nodes on the right side of your neck, which correlates with the scan results. They are firm, but not particularly painful to the touch. Overall, your examination findings are consistent with the preliminary diagnosis of lung cancer. The diminished breath sounds, enlarged lymph nodes, and slight murmur are all concerning findings.
PATIENT: So… so it is cancer? It’s not… not a mistake? What… what happens next, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to want clarity, and I want to assure you that we're going to work through this together. Based on the reports and the examination, it is highly likely that you have lung cancer, specifically non-small cell lung cancer. However, we need to determine the stage of the cancer to develop the most effective treatment plan. To do that, we'll need to perform some additional tests. This will likely include a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to look for any spread of the cancer. We may also need a PET scan to identify areas of increased metabolic activity, which can indicate the presence of cancer cells. A biopsy of the enlarged lymph nodes will also be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific type of cancer cells. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: A PET scan… and more biopsies? What… what if it’s spread? What if it’s… everywhere? And… how long will all of this take? I just… I want to know what I’m facing. Is it… is it treatable?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid and important questions, Chellsea, and it’s natural to feel anxious and overwhelmed right now. Let’s address them one by one. The purpose of the additional tests – the PET scan and lymph node biopsy – is to determine the exact stage of the cancer. Staging helps us understand how far the cancer has spread, which is crucial for deciding on the best course of treatment. It doesn’t mean it has spread, but rather, it helps us understand the extent of the disease. Regarding treatment, non-small cell lung cancer is often treatable, especially when diagnosed at an early stage. Treatment options can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The best option for you will depend on the stage of the cancer, your overall health, and your preferences. As for how long this will take, the tests can typically be completed within a week or two. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them in detail and develop a personalized treatment plan. I want you to know that you’re not alone in this. I will be with you every step of the way, and we’ll work together to make the best decisions for your health. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: What… what are the chances? If it has spread… what’s the life expectancy then? I… I need to be realistic. I have to plan things… if… if it’s bad.
DOCTOR: That is a very difficult question, Chellsea, and one that I understand you need to ask. It’s important to be realistic, but also to avoid focusing solely on statistics. Every patient is different, and the prognosis depends on many factors, including the stage of the cancer, the specific type of cancer cells, your overall health, and your response to treatment. To give you some general information, the five-year survival rate for non-small cell lung cancer varies greatly depending on the stage. For stage I, the five-year survival rate is around 80-90%. For stage II, it’s around 50-70%. For stage III, it’s around 20-40%. And for stage IV, it’s around 10-20%. However, these are just statistics, and they don’t tell the whole story. What’s more important is to focus on getting the best possible treatment and maintaining a positive attitude. We will do everything we can to fight this disease and improve your quality of life. I understand you need to plan things, and I respect that. We can discuss advanced care planning if you wish, and I can connect you with resources to help you with financial planning and emotional support. But let's focus on getting the tests done first, and then we can make informed decisions based on the results. Right now, let’s concentrate on taking things one step at a time. Do you want me to schedule the CT scan and PET scan for you?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Let’s get it done. The sooner we know… the sooner we can… deal with it. Thank you, Doctor. For everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Alright, I’ve scheduled a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis for August 5th at 10:00 AM at the imaging center across the street. And I’ve scheduled a PET scan for August 7th at 1:00 PM at the same facility. You’ll need to fast for several hours before both scans, and I’ll give you written instructions outlining the preparation. Do you have any questions about the scheduling or preparation?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Fasting… and the imaging center across the street. I can manage that. Is there… is there anything I need to do besides fasting? Any special clothes or… anything? I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That's a great question. No, there’s nothing special you need to do besides fasting. Wear comfortable clothing to both scans. For the PET scan, you’ll be asked to lie still for a period of time, so loose-fitting clothes are ideal. You can also bring a book or music to help you relax during the scan. Please, let the imaging center know if you have any allergies or if there’s a possibility you might be pregnant. And if you feel anxious before the scan, don’t hesitate to let them know. They can offer you medication to help you relax. Here's a handout with detailed instructions for both scans, including contact information for the imaging center. Please, don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We’ll review the results of the scans together when they’re available, and then we’ll discuss the next steps. For now, please focus on taking care of yourself and managing your stress. Would you like me to provide you with information on support groups or counseling services?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… that’s very helpful. A support group… maybe. I’m not sure yet. I think… I think I need to process everything first. Just… knowing you’re here… that helps. Is it okay if I… if I ask you questions later? When I’ve had time to… think about everything? I’m sure I’ll have a lot of them.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. Please, don't hesitate to call or email me anytime you have questions or concerns. That's what I'm here for. There is no such thing as a silly question, and I want you to feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. I’ll write down my contact information here for you, and I’ll also provide you with the number for the clinic's patient portal. You can use the portal to send me secure messages, schedule appointments, and access your medical records. We’ve covered a lot today. For now, I’m going to let you rest and process everything. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. If you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to reach out. I wish you all the best, and I’ll see you after your scans. .
PATIENT: .
