DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s a delicate matter, really. An… unpleasantness. A discharge, you see. From… down there. It's rather bothersome, and my wife insisted I come. I haven’t the faintest idea why it’s happening, mind you. Things just… leak sometimes, at my age. It’s probably nothing, but she worries.
DOCTOR: A discharge, you say. “Leaks,” as you put it. And this is a new development?
PATIENT: New? Hmm… difficult to say, Doctor. My memory isn't what it once was, you understand. It’s been… a while since I’ve paid particular attention to such things, frankly. Perhaps a week? A fortnight? It all blurs together, really. It wasn’t sudden, if that makes any difference. More of a… gradual awareness. Though, I assure you, I keep myself quite clean. It’s not a matter of hygiene.
DOCTOR: Very well. And can you describe this discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Oh, dear. Well… it’s… liquid. Obviously. Not exactly water, though. A bit thicker. And… yellowish, I suppose. Though, colours aren’t my forte, you see. Not bright yellow, thankfully. More of a… faded ochre, perhaps? Honestly, Doctor, it's most unseemly to discuss such things. Is there not a test you can simply do?
DOCTOR: Tests are useful, Mr. Krok, but I need information to determine which tests are appropriate. Is there any odor associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Odor? Now that you mention it… yes, a slight one. Not foul, mind you. More… musty. Like an old shed, perhaps? Or a damp basement. My wife hasn't commented on it, but she has a rather delicate constitution, you see. Doesn't tolerate strong smells. It’s faint, I assure you. Barely perceptible, really.
DOCTOR: And do you experience any pain, burning, or itching in the area?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no, not exactly pain. A bit of… discomfort, perhaps? A slight ache, after… activity. But nothing debilitating, I assure you. And itching? No, not really. Though, my skin does get a bit sensitive sometimes. But that's just age, you see. Everything gets sensitive when one reaches a certain… vintage. It's not unpleasant, just… noticeable. Are we nearly done, Doctor? This is all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to perform a quick physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I will need you to lower your trousers and undergarments. I will provide a sheet for modesty, of course. But I need clear access to assess the area.
PATIENT: Examination? Lie down? Good heavens, Doctor. Is that absolutely necessary? Surely, a simple urine sample would suffice? My wife would be most displeased to learn I've… exposed myself to a stranger. And frankly, the thought is rather unsettling. I’ve never… Well, it’s simply not done. Perhaps we could reconsider? A second opinion, perhaps? I’m quite sure it’s nothing serious. Just… age, as I said. A little leakage. It's hardly worth such… thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, I am a medical professional. I am attempting to determine the cause of your discomfort. A urine sample will not provide the necessary information. I assure you, I have seen far worse in my career. This examination is standard procedure. If you refuse, I cannot provide a proper diagnosis. Now, are you willing to cooperate, or shall we simply waste each other’s time?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. You win. But I must insist on complete discretion. And a very thorough explanation afterward. I haven’t… undressed for a stranger in… decades. It's a most unpleasant prospect. And please, be quick about it. My dignity, you understand. It’s all I have left. Though I still maintain it's probably just age. A little… seepage. That's all.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your back with your knees bent. I will perform a visual inspection and palpate the area. I need you to relax. The skin is intact, but there is mild erythema and edema of the glans. Palpation reveals no obvious masses or tenderness. There is a small amount of yellowish discharge present. I also note some mild phimosis. Based on my initial examination, it appears you have a case of balanitis, likely secondary to phimosis. However, to rule out other potential causes, such as a sexually transmitted infection, I will need to collect a urine sample and a swab of the discharge for laboratory analysis. Would you be able to provide those samples, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Balanitis? Phimosis? Good heavens. It sounds… dreadful. And a swab? Laboratory analysis? Is it… contagious? My wife! Oh dear. Contagious, you say? Must we inform her? Perhaps a strong antibiotic will suffice? I really do wish you hadn't used such… clinical terms. It's quite alarming. Very well, Doctor. A sample. But please, be discreet. And tell me… is it serious? Will I… will I be alright? And what about my wife? Must she be tested as well? I’m quite beside myself. This is all most upsetting.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, please try to remain calm. Balanitis, in itself, is not typically serious, especially when caught early. However, it can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, and that's what we need to determine. The laboratory tests will help us identify the cause and determine the appropriate course of treatment. As for your wife, it's unlikely she is at risk. Balanitis is not typically transmitted through casual contact. However, I recommend she consult her physician simply as a precaution. The restroom is just down the hall. I will provide you with a sterile container for the urine sample and a swab. Please collect a midstream urine sample and gently swab the affected area. Once you have collected the samples, return them to me, and I will send them to the lab. And please, try to relax. This is a routine procedure, and we will get to the bottom of this. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I’ll be in the examination room if you need assistance.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A routine procedure, you say? It all seems rather… invasive. And unsettling. I suppose I must. For my wife's peace of mind, if nothing else. A routine procedure… Balanitis… Honestly, the indignity of it all.
