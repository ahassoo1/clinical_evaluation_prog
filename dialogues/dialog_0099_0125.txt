DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor Overgaard. I requested the HIV test, like the form said. Honestly, it’s just… being careful, you know? My wife and I… we just want to be sure. It’s probably nothing, but better safe than sorry, right? Some people you meet these days… you just can’t trust everyone.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Prudence is… admirable. Though I find people tend to dwell on hypotheticals more than necessities. Very well. You're requesting an HIV test as a preventative measure, understanding the risks involved with… unprotected encounters. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Unprotected encounters? That’s… putting it bluntly. Look, I didn’t say anything about encounters. My wife and I… we have a very stable marriage. It’s just… you read things, you hear things. And honestly, with everything going on in the world, you can’t be too cautious. It’s about knowing, isn’t it? Peace of mind. And frankly, I expect a clear result. No room for error.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Clarity is paramount, especially with matters of health. And I assure you, our lab adheres to the strictest standards. However, before proceeding with the test, I need to gather some information. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Belan, to assess your risk factors more accurately. Have you ever had any previous HIV testing?
PATIENT: Risk factors? Honestly, Doctor, I find that question a bit… intrusive. But fine. No, I haven't had a previous HIV test. Never needed one, until now. I maintain a… respectable lifestyle. And my wife, of course, is equally careful. I don't appreciate being made to feel like I need to justify myself. Is the test going to happen or are we going to spend all day dissecting my personal life?
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, please don’t misunderstand. It’s not about judgment, it’s about providing accurate and informed care. The test itself is straightforward, but understanding when you might have been exposed allows me to interpret the results correctly. A negative result, for example, has different implications depending on recent risk. Have you ever shared needles, or received any blood transfusions before August 2nd, 2025?
PATIENT: Needles? Blood transfusions? Are you implying something, Doctor? Honestly, the questions are just… unnecessary. I’ve lived a clean life. I’m married! My wife and I don't engage in… risky behavior. And I certainly haven’t been sharing needles with anyone. It’s insulting, frankly. Are you questioning my character? Just get on with the test, please. I have things to do. It’s 2025, you should be able to trust people.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. We can proceed without a detailed history. However, I must document a refusal to provide further information. Understand that the accuracy of the test results is not compromised, but the interpretation may be less nuanced. Now, for the test itself, it's a simple blood draw. We’ll take a sample from your arm. Are you prone to fainting?
PATIENT: Fainting? Really? Is that a joke? I’m a perfectly healthy man. I do physical labour, I walk everywhere. I am not prone to fainting. Just… get it over with. And please, be quick about it. I don’t have all day to sit here answering ridiculous questions and having my arm poked at. Honestly, the whole experience is… rather demeaning. I expected better.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please extend your arm. I'll need you to relax your arm. A little prick, that’s all. Try to breathe normally. Alright, that's done. The sample will be sent to the lab, and the results should be available within five to seven business days. We'll contact you directly. Do you have any questions before I finish documenting this encounter?
PATIENT: Five to seven business days? Honestly, Doctor, it’s 2025. Can’t you get faster results than that? No, I don’t have any questions. Just… get me out of here. And make sure the results are accurate. I expect a clear, definitive answer. And don’t bother calling with anything less. I’ve wasted enough time on this already. Honestly, the whole thing is just… a bother. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. The results will be communicated as soon as they are available. And I assure you, our lab performs each test with the utmost precision. Have a good day.
