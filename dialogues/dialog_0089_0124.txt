DOCTOR: Good morning, Nykisha. I'm Dr. Roseburrogh. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, for the past few months, my skin has been getting darker. Not like a tan, more… all over, you know? And with that, I've just been feeling really tired a lot. Just worn out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Darkening of the skin and fatigue. Hmm. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the skin changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started maybe around February? It was gradual, so I didn't really pay attention at first. I just thought I wasn’t getting enough sun, but it's kept getting darker even with sunscreen. And the tiredness… that came on a little after, maybe March or April. It's hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, February for the skin changes, then fatigue a month or two later. And you’ve been using sunscreen regularly since noticing it?
PATIENT: Yes, I try to. I'm pretty good about it when I'm gardening, which is a lot. But, you know, sometimes I forget on just regular days running errands or something. Nothing too crazy though, I don’t spend all day in the sun.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I've noticed. Maybe I'm a little thirstier than usual, but I thought that was just the summer heat. No stomach problems, no weight loss, nothing like that. Oh! Sometimes my hands feel a little weak, but that could just be from all the gardening, too. I do a lot of weeding.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst and occasional hand weakness. No other changes in appetite, bowel habits, or unintentional weight loss. Have you noticed any changes in your urination, Nykisha?
PATIENT: Urination? Not that I've noticed. Everything seems normal there. Same as usual, if that makes sense. I haven't been getting up more often at night or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything like that. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but the doctor said it was just stress and it went back down when things calmed down. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well, and like I said, I’m always in the garden.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long, long time ago, but that's it. And I’ve never been hospitalized, thankfully. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mom had some problems with her heart when she was older, but she lived to be 85, so… I guess it wasn’t too bad. My dad was pretty healthy all his life, but he passed away suddenly from a stroke. My sister, she has some arthritis, but other than that, we're a pretty healthy bunch. No one I know of has had anything with their skin, or… you know, anything like what’s happening to me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, especially after a long day in the garden. But that's it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. Then we'll see if we need to run any tests. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 140 over 90. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your skin. I do notice the diffuse hyperpigmentation you mentioned, across your face, hands, and neck. No obvious rashes or lesions. Lymph nodes feel normal. Okay. Everything else seems within normal limits with the quick exam. I'd like to order some blood tests just to get a better picture of what's going on. We'll check your blood sugar, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and do a complete blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is necessary. I just want to figure out what's going on. Blood tests sound fine. Will I need to fast for any of them?
DOCTOR: Yes, for the most accurate results, we will need a 12-hour fast before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. Water is okay. I'll also give you a lab slip with instructions. The lab is right across the hall, and they're open until 5 pm tomorrow. Once the results are back – usually takes a couple of days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms, like unintentional weight loss, excessive thirst, or changes in urination, please give us a call right away. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds good. No food after midnight, water is okay. And call if anything changes. I understand. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nykisha. I'm glad we could get some tests scheduled. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Here's the lab slip, and the nurse will come in shortly to go over some instructions with you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time, Doctor. I really appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Take care, Nykisha. We'll be in touch. .
