DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, can we just get this over with? I got things to do, you know. It's this… shaking. My hand. Been happening for a while now, and it’s just getting worse. Honestly, it’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Baide. We'll get right to it. The shaking… you mentioned it’s in your hand and has been worsening. Can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: When it started? Honestly, I don't remember exactly. A while ago, that's all I know. Maybe… a year? Two? It's hard to keep track when you get to be my age. It just sort of… crept up on me. It's not like it was sudden, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: It does make a difference, yes. So, it developed gradually over the past year or two. And is it just in one hand, or both?
PATIENT: Just this one. This one. The right. Always the right. It’s… annoying, really. Makes it hard to eat, hard to hold a glass… hard to do anything, frankly. And it's getting worse, like I said. Don't tell me I need some fancy test, though. I hate those things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It sounds very frustrating. We'll try to keep things as simple as possible. Just to get a clearer picture, does the shaking happen all the time, or are there certain times when it's worse?
PATIENT: Certain times… hmm. When I’m… nervous, I guess. Or if I try to do something precise. Like… buttoning my coat. Or writing. Though I haven't written anything in years, thankfully. It’s worse when I'm trying to not shake, you know? The more I focus on it, the worse it gets. It’s ridiculous. Honestly, it's probably just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re able to describe that, Mr. Baide. So, it seems to be exacerbated by attempts at precision and possibly by nervousness. And you haven't noticed it happening at rest, like when you're sitting quietly?
PATIENT: Sitting quietly… I suppose it's… less noticeable then. I mostly notice it when I'm doing something. You know, trying to use my hands. When I'm just… sitting, watching TV, I don’t really pay attention. It’s probably still there, just… not as bothersome. Look, are we getting somewhere with this, or are we just going to sit here and talk about my shaking all day?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Mr. Baide. It’s helpful to understand when it happens, and when it doesn’t. Now, let's do a quick exam, if you don't mind. Just a quick look at your hands, and I'll check your reflexes. It won’t take long. Can you extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But hurry it up, alright? I told you, I hate these things. It always makes me feel like a guinea pig. Just get it over with. And don't poke me too hard. I bruise easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I'm seeing a tremor in your right hand, as you've described. It seems to be a resting tremor, but it does increase with movement. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. I don't see any other obvious abnormalities. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: Diagnosed with…? At my age, what haven’t I been diagnosed with? Probably everything. Let me think… High blood pressure, definitely. And arthritis, of course. Knees, mostly. Back too. Oh, and the doctor said something about cholesterol a while back. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. My wife used to handle all that. It's been… a while since she's been around to do that. .
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, arthritis in your knees and back, and high cholesterol. Are you currently taking any medications for those conditions?
