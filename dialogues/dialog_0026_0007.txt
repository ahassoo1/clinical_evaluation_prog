DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Lakiya. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is… painful. That is why I am here. I wish to be quick, if that is alright. I have things that need doing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lakiya. We'll get right to it. "Painful" is a little broad, though. Can you tell me a bit more about where it's located, and what it feels like?
PATIENT: It is in my back. Lower back, on my left side. It feels… like something is stuck. A dull ache mostly, but when I bend… or lift anything… it is a sharp pain. Like a fire. I have felt it for… maybe three weeks now, getting worse each day. I do not know what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain on the left side for about three weeks, worsening with bending and lifting, described as a dull ache with sharp, "fire-like" pain when you move. I understand. And does anything help the pain, Lakiya?
PATIENT: Yes. When I sit very still, it is better. But I have to sit still. I cannot work like this. And… warm water. A hot bath, that helps a little. But not for long. It always comes back.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, sitting still and warm water offer some temporary relief. Do you recall anything specific that you were doing when the pain first started?
PATIENT: Hmm… I was building a fence. A new section for Mr. Henderson’s cattle. It was a heavy post… I lifted it… and there was a twist. I felt something pull. I thought it was just a muscle, you know? But it did not get better. It only got worse. I continued to work, foolishly, until I could not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like it started with lifting a heavy post while building a fence. That gives me a bit more to work with. Now, have you had any pain like this before, Lakiya?
PATIENT: No. Never. I have had aches from hard work before, of course. But nothing like this. This… this feels different. And it is worrying me. It is hard to do anything. I need to work, Doctor. I have bills to pay.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and needing to work is important. We’ll try to figure this out. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table, if you are able. We’ll check your range of motion and see if we can pinpoint where the pain is coming from. Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, I can lie down. If you would, please be gentle. It hurts when touched, I think. But I will tell you if it is too much. I do not wish to waste your time, Doctor. Let us get this done.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lakiya. We’ll go as slowly as you need. I will be very gentle. First, let's lie on your back. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes. On my back. It… is not pleasant. But I am here. Proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles on either side. Just tell me if you feel any specific spots that are particularly tender. Okay?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes. There. That one spot. It feels… like a burning. And… if you push… harder… there. Please be careful, Doctor. That is very tender. Like a hot coal.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lakiya, I understand. That is definitely tender. It seems to be localized to a specific spot on your left side. I’m also noting some muscle guarding—your muscles are tightening up when I touch it, which is common with pain. Now, can you gently bend forward towards your knees?
PATIENT: Ow! No… I cannot go much further. It is too much pain. It feels like something is being torn. Please, do not make me bend further. It hurts very bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lakiya, that's perfectly fine. No need to push through the pain. You’ve told me everything I need to know for now. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have a muscle strain or possibly a disc issue. Given the localized tenderness and the pain with bending, we should get some imaging done to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would you be able to come back tomorrow morning to get that done?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, I think so. But I have work… Is it possible to do it later in the day? I have things to finish. But if tomorrow morning is the only time… then I will make it work. Just tell me what you need. And will this X-ray… tell us what is wrong?
DOCTOR: Let me see what the availability looks like… Yes, we can schedule you for late afternoon tomorrow. That shouldn’t interfere with your work too much. The X-ray will help us rule out any fractures or significant bone abnormalities. It won't show everything, like a muscle tear or a disc issue, but it's a good first step. If the X-ray doesn't give us a clear answer, we might need to consider an MRI, which gives a more detailed picture, but that would require a referral. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, and gentle stretching – nothing that causes pain, of course. And try to avoid heavy lifting. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can take those pills, ibuprofen, yes. And no lifting… I understand. It is difficult, but I will try. So, this X-ray tomorrow… and then we see what it shows? Is there anything else I need to do? I do not want to keep coming back and back. I have things… important things… to do.
DOCTOR: That's right. X-ray tomorrow, and then we’ll review the results together. We'll discuss what the next steps are based on what we see. And I completely understand wanting to minimize trips to the clinic. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this efficiently. For now, focus on taking the pain relievers as directed, avoiding heavy lifting, and gentle stretching. If the pain becomes unbearable, or you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, please go to the emergency room immediately. I'm going to print out a prescription for the ibuprofen and a referral order for the X-ray. Here’s a work note for you, excusing you from heavy lifting for a few days. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: A work note… that is good. Thank you, Doctor. No… I do not think so. Just… get this X-ray done. Find out what is wrong. And I will try to rest. Thank you for your time. I wish to be going now.
