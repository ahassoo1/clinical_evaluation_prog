DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Asthore. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're with Medicare, and we're located in the suburban clinic today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, Dorman Asthore is the name. A pleasure to meet you as well. I am here… well, it’s hard to explain. I’m just getting… weaker, you see. Little by little. It’s been happening for a while now. The wife, she thought I should come and talk to someone. She says it’s the… the MS. Multiple… something. I forget the full name.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Asthore. It's good of you to come in, and it’s thoughtful of your wife to encourage you to do so. "MS" could refer to several things, but I understand you’re referring to Multiple Sclerosis, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Multiple Sclerosis. That’s what the other doctors said a long time ago. It’s been a while since I’ve seen a doctor, to be honest. Everything was… manageable, for a long time. But lately… it’s harder to get up from the chair, you know? And my hands… they aren't as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: I see. So, progressive weakness, both in your legs making it harder to stand and in your hands, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's very correct. It's not sudden, not like I woke up one day and couldn't walk. It's just… slower and slower. Everything takes more effort. Even holding a cup of tea is becoming difficult. It worries my wife, and… to be honest, it worries me a little too.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Asthore. It's completely reasonable to be worried when you notice changes like that. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about how long you've been noticing this increased weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. It started… maybe six months ago? At first, I thought I was just getting old! You know, a little creaky, a little stiff. But it’s been getting worse each month, I think. Maybe three months ago I really noticed it when I was helping my grandson build a fence. Couldn't hold the hammer as long.
DOCTOR: Okay, so approximately six months of progressive weakness, with a noticeable increase in the last three months, particularly with tasks requiring grip strength. That’s helpful. Aside from the weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… other symptoms… well, sometimes my vision gets blurry, but I have those spots in my eyes sometimes anyway. I thought it was just my age, again. And sometimes I feel… tired. Very tired. More tired than usual. But I figured that was just from not getting around as much, you know? It's hard to tell what’s from the MS and what’s just… life.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Asthore. It can certainly be challenging to differentiate. So, blurry vision and increased fatigue are also present. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, sometimes. In my feet, mostly. Like they're… asleep. It comes and goes. It’s not constant. And sometimes my hands feel a little prickly, like pins and needles. But it doesn't happen all the time. It’s… intermittent, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent numbness and tingling in your feet and hands. Thank you for sharing that. Now, in terms of your past medical history, besides the Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis, have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see... I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor said it was under control with some pills. I took them for a long time, but he took me off them a few years ago. Oh, and I had a bad knee when I was playing football, many years ago. But that was fixed with surgery. Nothing else, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled hypertension in the past, and a history of knee surgery. Do you recall what year you had the knee surgery, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, that was… a long time ago. Let me think… I was still working at the warehouse then. Maybe… thirty years ago? Or maybe a little more. It was before my grandson was born, that much I remember. He's twenty-five now, so… yeah, around thirty years ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, approximately thirty years ago for the knee surgery. And you mentioned being on medication for high blood pressure. Are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not anymore. Like I said, the doctor took me off the blood pressure pills a long time ago. I haven’t been on any medication for… well, for years. Just vitamins, if that counts. My wife makes sure I take those.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications aside from vitamins. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my whole life! My wife always tells me I’ll eat anything. Never had a reaction to anything. I think I'd remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You certainly would. That's good to know. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That's a tough one. My mother, she had arthritis. Bad arthritis in her hands. And my father, he had heart trouble, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details very well. We didn't talk about health much when I was growing up. My wife would know more. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Asthore. It’s common for those details to be difficult to recall. So, a family history of arthritis in your mother and heart trouble in your father. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean, Doctor? I just… live a quiet life.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. "Social history" just means things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or what your typical activity level is. And it also includes who you live with and what your occupation was.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. I used to work at the warehouse, loading and unloading boxes. That was hard work, very physical. But I retired about fifteen years ago. Now I mostly stay home with my wife. We watch television, I do a little gardening when I can, and we see our grandson whenever we can. He keeps us young!
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely. So, no smoking, occasional alcohol, retired warehouse worker, and you live at home with your wife. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Asthore. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead, do what you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please extend your left arm for me. Your blood pressure is 145/90, pulse is 72 and regular, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength. Could you please sit on the edge of the table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Alright. Here you go, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if it hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your leg. Good. And now I’m going to ask you to resist as I push down on your leg. And again on this side. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, that's done. And… There you go. It’s not as strong as it used to be, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Asthore. It’s good that you’re honest with me. And finally, I'm going to check your sensation in your feet. Can you close your eyes for me?
PATIENT: Alright, eyes closed. Just let me know what you want me to do. I hope it doesn't hurt.
DOCTOR: Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes… I feel it. But… it’s not very strong. It feels… faint. Like someone barely touching me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Asthore. You can open your eyes now. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it does sound like your symptoms are consistent with a possible progression of your Multiple Sclerosis. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some blood tests, and I think an MRI of your brain and spinal cord would be helpful. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… blood tests, and an MRI… That sounds… serious. But if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. I want to know what’s going on. I’d rather know than worry about it. An MRI… will that be painful?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good attitude, Mr. Asthore. It is best to have a clear understanding of what we’re dealing with. The MRI is not painful at all. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it makes some loud noises, but it's a non-invasive procedure. We'll provide you with headphones so you can listen to music if you like. The blood tests are quite routine. I’ll write the orders for both right now. It may take a few days to schedule the MRI, and the blood test results usually come back within a week. Once we have those results, we can discuss the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A week… that feels like a long time to wait. But I understand. You need to do what you need to do. Loud noises… I hope it’s not too bad. My hearing isn’t what it used to be. I’ll try to stay positive. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Asthore. That’s the order for the blood tests, and the receptionist will help you schedule the MRI. It is a little bit of a wait, I agree, but it’s important to get a comprehensive picture. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like weakness in your arms, difficulty breathing, or vision changes, please don't hesitate to call the office immediately. And to clarify, the MRI and blood tests are to help confirm whether your MS is progressing and to rule out other conditions. I also want to note in your chart that you are experiencing progressive weakness, diminished reflexes, and decreased sensation in your extremities. Do you have any questions for me at this point, or would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment for after the test results are in?
PATIENT: New or worsening symptoms… yes, I’ll remember that. Thank you. And… a follow-up appointment… yes, that would be good. After the results come back. Let’s do that. I suppose… I don’t think I have any other questions right now, Doctor. I’m still trying to process everything. I think I’ll just wait for the results. Thank you again for your time and patience. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Asthore. I’m glad I could help. I've scheduled a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, on August 16th, at 10:00 AM. That will give us time to review the test results together. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Two weeks… August 16th… I’ll remember that. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate everything you’ve done. I think I’ll just go and see the receptionist now to schedule the MRI. Thank you again, and… have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Asthore. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you on August 16th. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions before then.
