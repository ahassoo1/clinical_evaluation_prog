DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I'm Dr. Chora. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. I… I have been having some trouble breathing. A wheezing sound, you see? It makes me a little worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble breathing and a wheezing sound. That is something we should look into. Can you tell me a little more about this wheezing?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It… it happens when I walk, mostly. Not when I am sitting still. And sometimes, when I laugh. It is a whistling sound, like a small kettle, maybe? Not very loud, but I can feel it in my chest. It started, oh, maybe a month ago? I don't remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's brought on by exertion – walking, laughing – and you feel it in your chest. A month ago, approximately. Has it been getting worse steadily, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… hmm. I think it is a little worse now than it was at first. Not much, but yes. It comes and goes, but it’s happening more often. Before, only when I walked up a hill. Now… sometimes just walking to the mailbox. It worries me, Doctor. I used to be very strong, you see. I am an athletic trainer. Or was, before I retired.
DOCTOR: An athletic trainer, that’s good to know. And understandably concerning if this is a change for you. Have you had any cough associated with this wheezing?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. A little cough. Not a bad cough, mostly just a tickle in my throat. It doesn't bring anything up, you understand? Just a dry little cough. It happens more when I lie down, I think. Or when the air is… cold. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Dry cough, worse when lying down or in cold air. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. I check them sometimes, because my mother had trouble with swelling. But my ankles feel normal, I think. No more than usual. They sometimes feel a little tired at the end of the day, but that is all. I hope that helps?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. And no history of significant swelling. Now, let's talk about other things. Any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not at all. And no chills, either. I sleep very well, usually. No night sweats. I feel warm sometimes, when I am walking, but that is just from the exercise, I think. I always wear a jacket when it is cold, you see? I take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you been experiencing any chest pain with this breathing trouble?
PATIENT: No, not pain. Not exactly. It is… tight, sometimes. A little squeezing feeling, maybe? But not pain, no. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. And it doesn’t happen often. It’s hard to explain. Not like a hurt feeling, but… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, “uncomfortable” tightness, not pain. That’s good to know. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had high blood pressure, a long time ago. But the doctor gave me some pills, and it’s been fine for many years now. I see my regular doctor every year for check-ups. And… oh! My hip. I had surgery on my hip, about five years ago. But it healed very well. I don’t have much trouble with it now.
DOCTOR: Alright, hypertension managed with medication, and a hip surgery five years ago. Do you know what medications you are currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… I have it here. It is… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. And… twenty milligrams, every day. I take it with my breakfast. I always remember. My daughter helps me to keep track, just in case. She is very good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My daughter always asks me, and I tell her, “Nothing.” I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I am very lucky, I think. Though I don’t eat too much sugar, Doctor. It’s not good for you, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we do a quick listen to your lungs, can you tell me about any family history of lung problems, like asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. My father… he smoked, a long time ago. He had a cough, sometimes, but I don’t know what it was. And my sister… she had bronchitis, once. But that was many years ago. She got better. I don't think anyone had asthma, though. Not that I remember. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is good to know. Okay. Let’s listen to your lungs and heart, and then we can discuss some possibilities. Could you please sit up and take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can do that. Is this good? Should I breathe in through my mouth?
DOCTOR: Alright. I hear some wheezing in your lungs, as you described. It’s fairly mild right now, but it’s definitely there. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. . Blood pressure is a little elevated today. Now, I want to check your oxygen saturation. . Oxygen is a little low, but not dangerously so. It sounds like you may be experiencing some mild asthma or COPD exacerbation. The history of hypertension and elevated blood pressure today, as well as the wheezing, warrants further investigation. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. Asthma… or COPD. I have heard of those. My father… he had trouble breathing sometimes. It sounds… serious? What does "exacerbation" mean, Doctor? And what will we do? I am a little worried now.
DOCTOR: "Exacerbation" just means a worsening of symptoms. It doesn't necessarily mean it's severe. We need to figure out why your breathing is troubled, and then we can get it under control. It could be asthma that's newly presenting, or it could be COPD, which is more common in people who've smoked. The good news is, both are manageable. We're going to start with a chest X-ray, just to rule out any other possible causes. Then, I'd like to order a spirometry test - that's a breathing test that measures how much air you can blow in and out of your lungs. That will help us determine if it’s asthma or COPD. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An X-ray and a breathing test. I can do that. I don’t mind. My daughter always says I should get things checked out. She worries about me. Is the X-ray… painful? And how long will the breathing test take? I have an appointment with my hairdresser this afternoon, you see. I don’t want to be too late.
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray isn't painful at all. You'll just stand or sit in front of the machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture. As for the spirometry test, it usually takes about 15-20 minutes. We'll have a technician do that right here in the clinic. I’ll get the orders sent over to the radiology department and the pulmonary function lab, and they'll schedule you. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler. It'll help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It's a rescue inhaler, so you can use it as needed. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, a rescue inhaler sounds good. If it helps me breathe easier, that would be wonderful. I am always a little short of breath when I walk, you see. Will the inhaler… make me feel strange? Or dizzy? I don’t want to fall. And how often can I use it? Just when I am really having trouble breathing?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. The inhaler can sometimes cause a little bit of jitteriness, but it's usually mild. If you do feel dizzy, stop using it and let me know. We can adjust the dose if necessary. You should only use it when you’re having trouble breathing – as a rescue medication, not a regular one. The instructions on the inhaler will tell you exactly how often you can use it, but generally, no more than four puffs every four to six hours. We'll also discuss a longer-term management plan once we have the results of the X-ray and spirometry. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Only when I’m having trouble, no more than four puffs. I will remember that. So, the X-ray and the breathing test, and the inhaler. And then we talk again. That is… good. I feel a little better now, knowing what we are doing. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. I’m glad I could ease your mind. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule those tests for you, and to go over the inhaler instructions. If you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to ask. Here’s a written summary of everything we discussed today, and the prescription for your inhaler. Take care, and please call if anything changes. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is everything. Thank you so much for your time. And for explaining everything so clearly. You have a very calming manner, you know? I appreciate it very much. I will call if anything changes. Goodbye, Doctor Chora.
DOCTOR: You're very kind to say so, Mrs. Kilton. It’s my pleasure. Get those tests done as soon as you can, and we'll get you breathing easier in no time. Take care of yourself. Goodbye.
