DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Dr. Soodeen, is it? Lovely name. Well, now… what did bring me in? Hmm… It’s me ears, I think. They just don’t… hear like they used to. Everything’s a bit muffled, you see? Not terrible, but it’s gettin’ worse, I reckon. It’s hard to follow a conversation sometimes, especially if there’s noise.
DOCTOR: I understand. Muffled hearing that's progressively worsening, and difficulty with conversations, particularly in noisy environments. That’s a common concern, Mr. Schneer. To get a better understanding, could you tell me when you first noticed this change in your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice…? That’s a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe… a couple of years? It’s hard to say, really. Things just sort of… faded, bit by bit. I don’t remember a specific moment, if that makes any sense. I used to be able to hear the birds sing so clearly, but now… not so much. My sister used to say I had ears like a hawk!
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Mr. Schneer. A gradual decline is very common. And it’s good you’ve noticed it – that’s the first step. Have you noticed it being worse in one ear compared to the other?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… I think it might be worse in me left ear. It’s hard to be sure, though. I just tend to strain to hear with that one more, I suppose. It’s like… the sounds are a bit quieter over there. Not a lot quieter, mind you, but… noticeable. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Schneer. You’re explaining it very well. So, we have gradual hearing loss, potentially worse in the left ear. Have you experienced any ringing in your ears, or any dizziness or balance problems recently?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm… sometimes, yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine. It doesn’t happen all the time, just now and then. Usually when it’s quiet, I think. And dizziness… not really. I get a bit unsteady on me feet sometimes, but I figured that’s just old age! I haven't fallen or anything, just a bit wobbly. Is that… is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: The tinnitus – that ringing in your ears – is good to know. And it's good you haven’t had any falls. Occasional unsteadiness can be related to a number of things. I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears, and perhaps a brief balance test, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I haven’t had much luck with doctors lately, if I’m honest. Not that they were bad doctors, just… rushed, you know? But you seem very nice and patient. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. I appreciate that. I always try to take my time and listen to my patients. We'll take things slowly. First, let’s take a look inside your ears. I’m just going to gently insert this instrument to get a visual. It shouldn't be painful, but let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort. Alright. I see some cerumen – earwax – in both ears, slightly more on the left. The tympanic membranes themselves appear intact, but I do note a slight dullness on the left side, which could be related to fluid. Now, I’m going to do a quick tuning fork test to assess your hearing. I’ll place this vibrating fork on your forehead and then behind your ear. Just tell me when you can no longer hear the sound. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Earwax, you say? I always thought it was a sign of being clean! Fluid… that doesn’t sound too good, does it? But I trust you. Yes, go ahead with the… tuning fork. I used to have one as a child, but it wasn’t for me ears, it was for me grandfather’s watch! He was a watchmaker, a very skilled one. Just… do be gentle, please. My ears are a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I'll be as gentle as possible. Alright. The results of the tuning fork test are consistent with some hearing loss, particularly in the left ear. It seems to be conductive hearing loss, meaning there's a blockage or impedance in the outer or middle ear. The wax is likely contributing, and the fluid could be as well. Now, I’m just going to quickly listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your balance. Just stand up slowly when I ask you to.
PATIENT: Conductive… that sounds complicated. Is it… serious? Wax and fluid… I suppose that makes sense. I do feel a bit… stuffed up sometimes. A bit like when you have a cold, but not as bad. Alright, check my heart and lungs, and then me balance. Just… don’t ask me to stand on one leg, dear. I’d fall right over!
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear in your heart and lungs, Mr. Schneer. That's good. Now, just stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and look straight ahead. I'll just watch you for a moment. First with your eyes open… good. Now, gently close your eyes. Okay. You're a little unsteady with your eyes closed, which is not unexpected given your age and the occasional balance issues you mentioned. Alright, Mr. Schneer. Based on what we've discussed and the examination, it appears you have conductive hearing loss, likely due to cerumen impaction and possible fluid in the middle ear. It's not immediately serious, but it's impacting your hearing, and we should address it. I recommend we start with cerumen removal. We can do that in the office. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Cerumen removal… in the office? Will it… hurt? I’ve always been a bit squeamish about things going in me ears. But I suppose if it’ll help me hear again… alright. Yes, go ahead. Just be… gentle, please. And tell me what you’re doing every step of the way. I like to know what’s happening, you see. Is it a long procedure? I have… bingo later this afternoon. Can't miss bingo!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I understand your concerns, and I will explain everything every step of the way. It won’t be painful, I promise. We’ll use a gentle irrigation system – basically, warm water to flush out the wax. It might feel a little strange, a bit like a gentle pressure, but it shouldn’t hurt. The procedure itself is quite quick, usually about 10-15 minutes per ear. We'll start with the ear that's bothering you more, which you said is the left one. I'll use a specialized instrument to gently direct the water into your ear canal, and then use suction to remove the wax. I’m documenting this in your chart now. We’ll start with the cerumen removal today. After that, if your hearing doesn’t improve significantly, we may consider further evaluation with an audiologist to rule out other causes. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An audiologist… another doctor? Oh dear. Well, I suppose if it’s necessary. I just don't like going to doctors, you see. But I trust you. Yes, alright. Cerumen removal first, and then… the audiologist, if needed. Is it going to be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see. Medicare covers a lot, but… And can I still go to bingo this afternoon? If it doesn’t hurt, that is. It’s a really good prize tonight, a new TV!
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Schneer, and a valid concern. Let me check your Medicare coverage for cerumen removal and an audiology referral. Good news. Cerumen removal is typically covered by Medicare, with a small co-pay, which I believe is about \$20. An audiology referral is also covered, though you may have some out-of-pocket expenses depending on the services provided. I’ll have our billing department confirm the exact costs for you before scheduling anything. As for bingo, yes, you should be perfectly fine to go this afternoon, assuming the cerumen removal goes smoothly and doesn’t cause any discomfort. We’ll take it slow, and if at any point you feel pain or dizziness, we’ll stop immediately. A new TV is worth protecting! Are you ready to proceed with the cerumen removal now?
PATIENT: A new TV is worth protecting! Alright then. Yes, let’s get this over with. The sooner I get the wax out, the sooner I can go to bingo. Just… be gentle, dear. And tell me everything you’re doing, you promise? I’m a bit of a worrier, you see. But thank you, for explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a lot better. Let’s get to that wax!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I'm happy to explain everything. And I promise to be as gentle as possible. Alright. First, I’m going to gently warm the water to body temperature. We want to avoid any discomfort. Now, I'm going to position this small instrument in your ear canal – not too far, just enough to direct the water safely. You might feel a little pressure, a slight fullness. I’m going to gently flush the ear with warm water. How does that feel, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a bit… strange. A bit like being underwater, you know? And a little bit cold, actually. Not painful, just… unusual. It feels a bit full, like there's something blocking my ear. Is that normal? And… is it working? Can you see anything coming out? Oh dear, I hope I'm not making a mess!
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly normal, Mr. Schneer. The fullness is from the water, and it’s good that you’re feeling something – that means we're irrigating properly. And yes, I do see some wax coming out. It’s a bit dark and crumbly. That’s good progress. It's also okay if you are making a mess, that is why we have a soft towel to collect it. I’m going to continue irrigating for another minute or so, and then I’ll take another look. How are you feeling now, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: It's a bit better now, I think. The fullness is… less intense. And I can feel a bit of a… whooshing sound in my ear. Is that good? It feels a little strange, like my ear is trying to clear itself. Oh dear, I hope I'm not getting a cold! I think… yes, I think it’s working. Keep going, dear. As long as it doesn’t hurt, keep going. I really want to hear the bingo numbers tonight!
DOCTOR: That whooshing sound is a very good sign, Mr. Schneer! It means the water is starting to break up the wax and clear the ear canal. Your body is doing its job! Alright, let me take a look now… …And there we go! The ear canal looks significantly clearer now. I can see the tympanic membrane – your eardrum – and it looks nice and healthy. I’ve removed most of the wax. We’re done! How does that ear feel compared to the other one?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh my goodness, that's… better! It's not perfect, but it definitely feels… less muffled. Like there's a blanket lifted off my ear, you know? The sounds are… clearer. I can hear you much better now. It’s amazing! You're a miracle worker, dear! Thank you so much! Can I… can I go to bingo now? I really need to know if I can go to bingo!
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Schneer! I'm glad to hear that your hearing has improved. And yes, absolutely, you can go to bingo! I recommend you avoid getting water in your ear for a few days, just to be safe. If you notice any pain, redness, or drainage, please give us a call immediately. I'll also document this procedure and my findings in your chart. Now, just to be thorough, I'd like to do a quick hearing test to see how much improvement we've achieved. It's a very simple test – just raise your hand when you hear a sound. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A hearing test? Alright, alright. As long as it's quick. I don’t want to miss the early bingo games! They have the best prizes, you see. Yes, go ahead. Just tell me what to do. I'm ready! As long as I can hear the numbers, I'm happy. Bring on the bingo!
DOCTOR: Excellent! It will only take a few minutes. I'm going to put headphones on you, and I’ll play a series of tones at different pitches and volumes. When you hear a tone, please raise your hand. Don't worry if you don't hear some of them – that's perfectly normal. We're just trying to get a baseline measurement. Okay, let’s begin. Just relax and let me know when you hear a sound…
PATIENT: Alright, I’m ready. Just let me know when to raise my hand. I'm concentrating! Hopefully, I can still hear the bingo numbers after this. They call them out pretty fast, you know? A little bit of background noise, too. But I'm a champion bingo player, I tell you! Let's do it!
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now a slightly higher pitch… and a little louder… very good… and now a lower pitch… excellent… okay, almost finished… one more series of tones… Okay, all done! The hearing test results show mild to moderate hearing loss, primarily in the higher frequencies. However, the cerumen removal has definitely improved your hearing! It's not a complete fix, but it's a significant improvement. I recommend you consider a hearing aid evaluation with an audiologist. They can assess your hearing loss in more detail and recommend the best course of treatment. Would you like me to give you a referral?
PATIENT: A hearing aid? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And expensive! I suppose if it'll help me hear the bingo numbers, I should consider it. But I'm not sure I want to wear one of those things. Do they… show? Will people notice? And… will it whistle? I've heard stories about hearing aids whistling! But… yes, alright. Give me the referral. I suppose it's worth a try, as long as I can still enjoy my bingo. But no promises! Tell them I don't want anything too… noticeable. And definitely no whistling!
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Mr. Schneer. Modern hearing aids are much smaller and more discreet than they used to be. Many of them are nearly invisible! And the technology has improved dramatically, so whistling is rare with properly fitted aids. Here’s the referral to a reputable audiologist in the area. They'll discuss all your options and help you choose an aid that fits your needs and lifestyle. They understand these concerns, and they will work with you to find a comfortable and discreet solution. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, dear. Thank you so much for your patience and kindness. And for letting me go to bingo! I really appreciate it. I’m a bit worried about the hearing aid, but… well, we’ll see. I suppose it’s worth a try, as long as I can still hear the numbers. Thank you again, Dr. Soodeen. You’ve been a real lifesaver. Now, I'm off to bingo! Wish me luck!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I'm glad I could help. Good luck at bingo! I hope you win the big prize!
