DOCTOR: Right. Zelina Ambris, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Look, can we just get this over with? I’ve got things to do. It’s… it’s my breath. It smells bad, okay?
DOCTOR: "Bad breath." Right. Well, these things usually have a cause, you know. It’s not simply… a fact of life. Now, tell me, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, I don’t know. A while. Since… the divorce, probably? Honestly, I haven’t been keeping track of everything, you know? Life gets… complicated. It’s just been getting worse lately, which is why I bothered coming here.
DOCTOR: Divorce… Interesting. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: What do you mean? Like… my job? Yeah, I'm working highway maintenance now. It’s not glamorous, but it pays the bills. Is that what you’re getting at? Look, I eat normal food, I brush my teeth… sometimes. What more do you want from me?
DOCTOR: "Normal food?
PATIENT: Well, you know. Sandwiches, pasta, sometimes I get takeout. Not like I'm eating garbage all day. What kind of question is that? It’s not like it matters what I had for lunch, is it? I just want something to make it stop smelling.
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, Miss Ambris. Diet can be a significant factor. But alright. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Never have been. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. Honestly, I think doctors just try to give you more problems. Look, is there a spray or something you can just… give me? I really don't have time for a whole investigation into my "diet."
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… enthusiasm for efficiency, Miss Ambris, a simple spray won't address the underlying cause. It could be something as straightforward as poor oral hygiene, yes, but it could also indicate something… more complex. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Ugh, I don’t know. Dust, maybe? I sneeze sometimes. Is that what you mean? Honestly, I haven't paid much attention. Look, are you going to actually help me or just grill me about my life? I'm wasting a perfectly good Saturday here.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's have a quick look then. Open wide. I need to examine your mouth and throat. It's a standard procedure, Miss Ambris, and will help me determine the source of the odor.
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry up. This is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your gums are slightly inflamed, and there’s some visible plaque buildup. Your tonsils appear normal, no obvious signs of infection. And your breath… yes, it’s quite noticeable. Have you noticed any pain when you swallow?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little scratchy sometimes, but that's probably just from the dust at work. Honestly, it's not like it hurts. I just want it to stop smelling. Is it… is it bad? Like, really bad?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, Miss Ambris. The inflammation suggests gingivitis, which can certainly contribute to halitosis. The plaque buildup isn't helping either. However, that doesn't fully explain the strength of the odor. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No! Are you serious? Do I look like a smoker? I barely have time to brush my teeth, let alone smoke. I'm a highway worker, not a chimney. What are you implying?
DOCTOR: I'm simply trying to gather information, Miss Ambris. No implications intended. Now, tell me about your fluid intake. How much water do you drink each day?
PATIENT: Ugh, not much. Coffee, mostly. And maybe a soda if it’s hot. Water’s… boring. Look, are you going to tell me I have some horrible disease now? Because if you are, I’m leaving. I don’t have time for this. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: No, I’m not suggesting a horrible disease. But chronic dehydration can certainly contribute to bad breath, as it reduces saliva production. Saliva helps cleanse the mouth. Miss Ambris, I suspect the issue is a combination of poor oral hygiene, a diet lacking in hydration, and possibly some gingivitis. It's not life-threatening, but it's also not something to ignore. I recommend a strict oral hygiene routine – twice-daily brushing, flossing, and an antiseptic mouthwash. Increase your water intake significantly. I'm going to prescribe a stronger mouthwash to help address the inflammation.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just give me the prescription. And look, no lectures, okay? I get it, I need to drink more water and brush my teeth more. Can I just go now?
DOCTOR: Very well. Here you are. Follow the instructions carefully. If the problem persists after two weeks of diligent care, you may want to consult a dentist. Good day, Miss Ambris. And perhaps consider a different beverage choice. .
PATIENT: .
