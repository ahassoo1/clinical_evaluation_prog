DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need a check-up. Trying out for a team, you know? Gotta make sure I'm still… usable. Don't want to pull a muscle before I even get on the field.
DOCTOR: “Usable,” is that so. Well, a general check-up is… adequate, I suppose. But “usable” doesn’t really give me much to work with. Let’s be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I just... they said I need a physical. To see if I'm healthy enough to play. It’s a…a basketball team. Local thing. I’m getting too old for this, honestly. Just want to get it over with quickly if we can.
DOCTOR: Right. A basketball team. I see. Well, we need to establish a baseline, regardless. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been seen by a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Not really. I mostly just… deal with it. You know, aches and pains. Old age. I haven’t been to a doctor in… honestly, probably ten years. Maybe more. Is that bad? I don't have insurance, so... I avoid it when I can.
DOCTOR: “Deal with it” is…not a medical strategy, Mr. Kingan. Ten years is…significant. Alright. Any serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses? Hmm. Nothing I can think of, no. I had the flu a couple times, maybe. Broken a bone or two playing sports when I was younger, but nothing that needed…a lot of fixing. Just a sprain here and there. Nothing major. I'm pretty tough, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Pretty tough” doesn’t preclude underlying issues, Mr. Kingan. And "a bone or two" requires specifics. Do you recall which bones, and approximately when these injuries occurred?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Let me think. When I was…maybe twenty? I broke my wrist playing volleyball. Bad fall. And…oh, yeah. A couple of cracked ribs when I was in high school, playing football. That was…probably thirty years ago now. It healed okay. Didn't need surgery or anything. Just a lot of pain.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had any. I try to avoid hospitals if at all possible. Look, is this all necessary? I just need a quick check-up to see if I can play basketball. I'm not trying to get a full medical workup here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, a “quick check-up” requires information. It's about establishing a safety baseline. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mom had…high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he had some heart trouble when he got older. Nothing specific, just…old age problems, you know? No one really talked about it much. We weren’t really a… medical family.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. I can eat anything, pretty much. Although I don’t really like shellfish. But that’s a preference, not an allergy. Can we get this over with soon? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: “Things to do” do not supersede a necessary medical evaluation, Mr. Kingan. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… ibuprofen sometimes, when my knees bother me. But that’s it. Over-the-counter stuff. Not a regular thing. Honestly, I try to avoid pills as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, for a physical examination. Please step onto the scale. I need to get your current weight and height.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I told you, I'm 62. I’m probably not in the best shape anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt.
PATIENT: Oh. Seriously? Right now? Can’t you just… ask me some questions? This feels a little…much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, a proper assessment requires a physical examination. It is standard procedure. Unless you prefer I simply sign off on a cursory evaluation and potentially allow you to injure yourself on the basketball court, I suggest you cooperate. Please remove your shirt. I assure you, this is entirely professional.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don’t expect a six-pack. This is ridiculous…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan, when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m ready. Just…try to be quick, alright? And don’t judge.
DOCTOR: Alright, now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths. “Heart sounds regular, rate approximately 72. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted.”
PATIENT: Is everything okay? Does it sound…bad? I haven't had a doctor listen to my chest in, well, a long time. I hope I haven’t got something…serious.
DOCTOR: “Your heart and lungs sound… adequate, for your age. Although, I detect some slight…decreased breath sounds at the bases. Probably just age-related changes.” “Reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Strength 5/5 in all extremities.” “Now, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse.”
PATIENT: So… what does all that mean? Are you finding anything wrong? I just want to know if I can play basketball, that’s all. Don’t tell me I’m too old for it.
DOCTOR: “Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Overall, your vitals are…not optimal. But not immediately alarming.” “Now, I’m going to briefly examine your throat and ears.” “Open your mouth and say ‘ah’.” “Ears clear. Throat slightly erythematous. No significant findings.” “Do you experience any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, no difficulty swallowing. Just… sometimes a little heartburn. Especially after spicy food. My wife used to tell me to eat less chili. But what’s life without chili? Is this all taking much longer? I’m getting fidgety.
DOCTOR: “Occasional heartburn. Noted.” “Based on this preliminary examination, and given your lack of regular medical care, I recommend several blood tests to assess your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and complete blood count. I also suggest an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm and rule out any underlying cardiac issues. And a chest X-ray would be prudent to further investigate the decreased breath sounds.” “These tests are necessary to provide a more comprehensive assessment of your health and determine your suitability for strenuous activity.”
PATIENT: Blood tests? An EKG? A chest X-ray? That sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. Look, Doctor, I just need to know if I can play basketball. Can't you just tell me that? Is my heart okay enough to run up and down a court? I don't have insurance, remember? This is… a lot. Maybe it’s just not worth it.
DOCTOR: “Mr. Kingan, I understand your concerns regarding cost and time. However, I cannot ethically provide a medical clearance for strenuous activity without a proper evaluation. To simply ‘tell you’ whether your heart is ‘okay enough’ would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. Given your age, lack of medical history, and slightly elevated blood pressure, proceeding without these tests could have serious consequences.” “I strongly advise you to schedule these tests. I can provide you with a list of low-cost clinics in the area. In the meantime, I recommend against participating in any rigorous physical activity until we have the results. Frankly, given your current condition, attempting to play basketball without a proper assessment would be… unwise. I will not sign off on a clearance until I have a full understanding of your health status.” “Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Okay. Low-cost clinics… alright. I guess I don’t have much choice. Give me the list. But if it’s too expensive, I’m not sure what I’m going to do. This is a mess. Basketball was supposed to be fun.
DOCTOR: “Here you go. I’ve highlighted the clinics that offer a sliding fee scale. Contact them directly to inquire about costs and appointment availability.” “Please schedule the tests as soon as possible. And refrain from any strenuous activity until we have the results. I will expect a follow-up appointment once you have received them.”
