DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Bacy. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, it is… a little embarrassing, to be honest. I have been… passing gas. A lot of gas. More than usual, you understand? It started maybe a week ago, and it… well, it just keeps happening. I hope it is not something too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Goodstein, no need to be embarrassed at all. It's quite common, and we can definitely figure out what's going on. A week of increased gas… alright. To help me understand, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Um… it happens after I eat, mostly. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Sometimes it's right away, sometimes a few hours later. And it’s… quite loud, if you understand. I try to be polite, but… it is difficult. Also, it doesn’t hurt, exactly. More… uncomfortable, and a little bit… smelly, I suppose. I eat pretty normal, mostly sandwiches and soups from the diner. Nothing too fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s happening after meals, regardless of what you eat, and it’s been about a week. Not painful, just uncomfortable and… noticeable. And you mentioned sandwiches and soups from the diner – that gives me a good starting point. Do you notice any bloating or abdominal pain alongside the gas?
PATIENT: Bloating… yes, sometimes. Not always, but when the gas is bad, my stomach feels very full and… stretched, I suppose is the right word. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… pressure. It goes away after… well, after I pass the gas, usually. And no, it doesn’t happen before the gas, if you understand. It’s always after I feel it building up. Is that helpful? I worry I’m being too detailed.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Goodstein. Details are very helpful! It sounds like it’s related to digestion, as you suspected. Bloating after meals, gas afterwards… Okay. Now, let’s go through some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Changes in… bowel habits? Let me think. No, not really. Everything is… normal, in that regard. I go to the bathroom every day, like clockwork, you understand? It’s not… looser, or harder, or anything like that. Just… regular. I haven’t been feeling sick, either. No fever, no stomach aches beyond the pressure I mentioned. Just… the gas. It’s becoming a bit of a… social problem, if I am being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, regular bowel habits, no other symptoms like fever or stomach aches. And you're right to mention the social aspect – that's important. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly. Mostly for… getting older things, you understand? My blood pressure is a little high sometimes, but I take a pill for that. And I had my appendix out when I was young, a long time ago. Other than that… not much. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. And I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little bit of tea with my dinner. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you manage your blood pressure with medication, and you had your appendix removed in the past. No known allergies, and you don’t smoke. That’s all very helpful. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think carefully… Well, sometimes I take a little bit of antacid, for heartburn. Not every day, only when I eat something spicy. And my neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she gave me some vitamins, a multi-vitamin, she said it would be good for me. I’ve been taking those for a few weeks, maybe a month. Small, orange pills. Other than that… no. I don't really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Do you think those vitamins could be causing this?
DOCTOR: It's certainly possible, Mr. Goodstein. Some vitamins can contribute to gas and bloating, especially if they contain certain sugars or fibers. Let's talk about your family history – are there any digestive issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Digestive issues… hmm. My mother, she had a very sensitive stomach. Always complaining about… well, everything, really. But I don’t think it was serious. Just… fussy. And my father, he had a very strong constitution. Could eat anything. No problems at all. My sister, she’s fine, as far as I know. We don't talk very often, you understand. So I am not really sure. Does that help? It is hard to remember family things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Goodstein. It's common to not have a complete picture of family medical history. Okay, so sensitive stomach in your mother, but generally healthy on your father’s side. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. I trust your judgment. I would like to find out what is causing this, if possible. It is… embarrassing, but also… uncomfortable. Please, go ahead. I will try to relax. Should I lie down?
DOCTOR: No need to lie down just yet. Just have a seat on the table, and I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It won't take long. Okay… I’m listening now. I hear normal bowel sounds, no signs of blockage. And gentle pressure doesn’t seem to cause any significant pain, do you feel any discomfort as I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn’t hurt. Just… pressure, like I said before. Not sharp, not terrible. It’s… a familiar feeling, I suppose. It’s not worse than usual. I am trying to be helpful, if I am not explaining things properly. I am not very good with medical terms, you understand. Just… uncomfortable pressure. Is that useful? It feels… a little bit better when you press, actually. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Goodstein. It's good to know the pressure actually feels a little better when I press. That suggests it's not something actively inflamed. Based on everything you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like we’re dealing with a functional issue – something related to how your digestive system is working, rather than a structural problem. Given the timing of the onset, and the fact that you've been taking a multi-vitamin, my suspicion is that the vitamin might be contributing. Some people are more sensitive to certain ingredients, and it can cause increased gas production. I’d like to recommend a trial of eliminating the multi-vitamin for a week or two and see if your symptoms improve. We can also discuss some dietary modifications to help reduce gas. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. I am happy to stop taking the vitamins, if that might help. I don’t want to cause any problems. And dietary modifications… yes, I can try that. What sort of things should I avoid? I eat pretty simple food, mostly, but I am willing to make changes. I just want to feel… normal again. This is becoming… a bit of a nuisance, if I am honest.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Goodstein. It’s good you’re willing to make some changes. While it's hard to pinpoint exactly what triggers gas for everyone, some common culprits include beans, broccoli, cabbage, onions, carbonated drinks, and foods high in fructose or sorbitol. Try reducing your intake of these and see if it makes a difference. Eating smaller, more frequent meals can also help. Also, it might be helpful to keep a food diary for a few days, just to see if you can identify any specific foods that worsen your symptoms. For now, I don’t think any further testing is necessary. But if your symptoms don’t improve after a week or two of eliminating the vitamin and making dietary changes, we can discuss further options, such as a referral to a gastroenterologist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds very sensible, Doctor. I can definitely stop taking the vitamins and keep a food diary. Smaller meals… yes, I can try that too. I don’t want to bother you unnecessarily, so I will see how it goes before asking for more tests. I appreciate your patience with me. This is a little embarrassing to talk about, you understand. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or anything I should watch out for? I want to make sure I don’t miss anything important.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, Mr. Goodstein. It’s important to address these concerns, and you’re doing the right thing by seeking help. For now, just monitor your symptoms. If you experience any of the following, please contact me immediately: severe abdominal pain, blood in your stool, unexplained weight loss, persistent nausea or vomiting, or a change in your bowel habits that lasts for more than a few days. Otherwise, just focus on eliminating the vitamin and making dietary changes, and keep me updated on your progress. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a couple of weeks to see how you’re doing. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You have explained everything very clearly, and I feel much better knowing what to do. Thank you for your kindness and patience. I will stop taking the vitamins and keep a food diary. I appreciate your time. I will schedule a follow-up appointment as you suggested. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. You have a good day as well. .
