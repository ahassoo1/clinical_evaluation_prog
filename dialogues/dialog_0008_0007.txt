DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. I am here because of pain. It is... quite painful, actually. I would like to get it taken care of if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain can be very disruptive. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It is in my back. Lower back, mostly. It started… about three weeks ago, I believe. It was just a little ache at first, but it has gotten much worse. Now it hurts to… to bend over, or even stand for very long.
DOCTOR: Alright, lower back pain for about three weeks, gradually worsening. And it's interfering with bending and standing. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It is… a dull ache, most of the time. But if I move wrong, or try to lift something… then it’s a sharp pain. Like a… a knife, almost. Then it goes back to the dull ache. It does not go away completely, though. Not even when I am resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant dull ache with sharp exacerbations with movement, especially lifting. Does anything help the pain, even a little?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not much, truthfully. Sometimes… sometimes if I sit very still, and put a warm cloth on it, it feels a bit better. But it does not last long. And it is hard to sit still for very long, Doctor. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Warm compresses provide some temporary relief. And it's impacting your ability to work. Do you recall any specific injury or event that might have started this?
PATIENT: No, I do not. I was just… working. Erecting fence, as usual. Nothing different. Just… woke up one morning with the ache. It was not sudden, just… there. I did not fall, did not lift anything too heavy, nothing. I cannot recall a reason for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific inciting event. It came on gradually while doing your usual work. Let's talk about your work a little more. What does erecting fence typically involve?
PATIENT: It is… physical work, Doctor. Digging post holes, carrying posts, stretching wire. Lots of bending, lifting, and… being on my feet all day. It is hard work, but I am used to it. I have been doing it for many years.
DOCTOR: Okay, so repetitive bending, lifting, and prolonged standing. Now, are you experiencing any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. The pain stays in my back. It does not go down my legs. I do not feel any tingling or… weakness in my legs either. Just the pain in my back. A constant ache, mostly. It is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know the pain is localized to your back and not radiating. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I sleep alright, though it takes a bit to get comfortable. And… I eat regular. No fever, no… trouble with my water. Just the pain. It is the main problem. I have not noticed anything else different.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms like fever, changes in bowel or bladder habits, or sleep disturbances. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: I had… pneumonia, many years ago. When I was a young woman. But I recovered fully. And… arthritis, a little bit in my hands. But it is not bad. Nothing that interferes with my work, usually. Other than that… no. I am generally healthy. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of pneumonia as a young woman and some mild arthritis in your hands. Any surgeries or hospitalizations besides the pneumonia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. No other hospitalizations. The pneumonia was the only time I was ever in a hospital. I prefer to stay out of them, if possible. I do not like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or other hospitalizations. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. I have not needed any, until now, perhaps. Just… some cream for my hands sometimes, when they are dry. But that is all. Nothing for pain, or anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. I have eaten… all sorts of things, and never had a reaction. And… I have never had a reaction to any medicine either. I am not allergic to anything, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother… she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her knees. And… my father had heart trouble, when he was older. Other than that… not much. My siblings are all healthy, as far as I know. Nothing… serious. Mostly just… aches and pains, like everyone else gets.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of arthritis and heart trouble. And finally, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. I do not drink alcohol either. And… I do not use any drugs. Never have. I keep a clean life. I need to be strong for my work. That is important.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information, Ms. Reihner. Let's do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what's going on. Could you please lie down on your stomach on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. I hope this will not take too long. I have fences to build.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll be as quick as possible. I'm going to gently palpate your lower back to check for tenderness and muscle spasm. I'll also check your range of motion. Okay, a little tenderness right here. And here. And with bending forward, I notice some limited range of motion and discomfort. Also, straight leg raise is negative – no pain radiating down your legs. Neurological exam is normal – reflexes, sensation, and strength are all intact. Based on the exam, it appears we are dealing with a musculoskeletal issue, likely a lower back strain or sprain. It doesn’t seem to be anything immediately alarming like a nerve compression. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds reasonable. I do not understand all of the words you say, but if it is not serious, that is good. A strain or sprain… I can work with that. As long as it does not keep me from working. What do we do about the pain?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll focus on managing the pain and promoting healing. I recommend a combination of things. First, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce inflammation and pain. I'll order a prescription for a muscle relaxant; it can help with muscle spasm, but be careful driving while taking it. I'm also going to recommend physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles and improve your posture. I want you to avoid heavy lifting and bending for a week or two, and then gradually increase your activity level as tolerated. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A few. First… I do not have a computer. How will I get the prescription? And… I do not have insurance other than Medicare. Will that cover the physical therapy? And… I need to build fences. A week or two is a long time. Are you sure I cannot work at all? Just… lighter work?
DOCTOR: Those are all good questions, Ms. Reihner. First, I'll send the prescription electronically to your usual pharmacy. Do you know which pharmacy you use?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… Miller’s Pharmacy. On Main Street. The small one, near the grocery store. They are… very helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Miller’s Pharmacy. I’ll send it there now. As for Medicare coverage for physical therapy, it generally covers it, but you’ll need to get a referral from me, and they may require pre-authorization. My staff will help you with that process. As for work, I understand your concern. Complete rest isn’t necessary, but you absolutely need to avoid heavy lifting and bending. You can do lighter work that doesn't strain your back, like planning, measuring, or some of the simpler fence repairs, but if it causes pain, stop immediately. We don't want to make this worse. I'm also going to order an X-ray just to rule out any other underlying causes. It’s a precaution. Would you like to schedule that for today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. The X-ray, and the physical therapy. And I appreciate you understanding about the work. I need to earn a living. Can the X-ray be done quickly? I do not want to spend the whole day here. And… thank you. You have been… very helpful. I think.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can get the X-ray done right away, it shouldn't take more than a few minutes. My staff will escort you to the radiology department. Once the X-ray is done, the results will be sent to me and I’ll review them. I will also have my staff give you information about local physical therapy providers. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. Thank you again. And… if you could just tell me where to go for the X-ray, that would be helpful. I do not want to get lost. I suppose this is all for now? I wish you a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. The radiology department is just down the hall to your left, room 205. My staff will guide you if you have any trouble. And I wish you a good day as well, and I hope you feel better soon. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. That is all for now. We'll see how the X-rays look and go from there. .
