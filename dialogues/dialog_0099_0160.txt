DOCTOR: Right. Well, Candis Hardenburgh, 79 years old. Good. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about this… tiredness. It’s just getting worse, and it’s embarrassing to even admit, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you. Just… little bits. And I don’t know why I’m doing it, but it’s not normal, is it? I feel silly even saying it.
DOCTOR: Eating… dirt?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt! Clay, mostly. Like, from the flower pots, or sometimes just… the garden. Don’t look at me like that, Doctor. I know it’s strange. It’s like… a craving. A really weird craving. And it doesn’t even taste good, it just… feels right, somehow. Is that even possible?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, this is… unusual. And, frankly, concerning. We need to figure out what’s driving this “craving”, as you put it. It’s called pica, consuming non-nutritive substances. It can indicate a nutritional deficiency, although it can also be associated with other things. First, let’s get a detailed history. Have you always experienced this, or is this a recent development?
PATIENT: Recent. Definitely recent. Maybe… the last few months? I haven't gone digging around in the yard for years. Before that, never. And it’s not like I'm enjoying it, if that makes any sense. It's more like… a need. A nagging feeling until I get a little bit. And it doesn't help that I feel so tired all the time. Like I haven't slept in days, even when I have.
DOCTOR: A few months, you say. And accompanied by fatigue. Alright. Have you noticed any other changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat… when I feel like it. I don’t have a big appetite, never have. Mostly just… toast, or a little soup. Nothing fancy. And honestly, I don’t really want much, but I feel weak, you know? Like I’m running on fumes. It’s hard to explain. I don’t think it’s the food, though. It’s this dirt business.
DOCTOR: Right. We'll explore both. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Nothing major. Just… the arthritis, in my hands. It’s a bit of a nuisance, makes it hard to grip things sometimes. And I had a bit of a scare with my heart years ago, but they said it was nothing serious. Just palpitations. Nothing they did anything about, really. Other than tell me to slow down, which is a bit rich, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Arthritis and palpitations. Alright. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. I’ve always been lucky, I guess. Or maybe just stubborn enough to avoid needing it. I don’t like doctors much, to be honest. Always poking and prodding. And this… this whole dirt thing is just mortifying. I’m probably wasting your time.
DOCTOR: We need to rule things out, Candis. It's my job. Now, family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had diabetes, I think. And her sister… she had something with her memory, in her old age. Dementia, maybe? It was a long time ago. And my father… he was just a strong, silent type. Never sick a day in his life, as far as I know. Not much help, is it? A lot of stoics in my family.
DOCTOR: Diabetes and dementia. Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, none. I try to avoid them if I can. Always worried about the side effects. Give me a cup of tea and a lie-down any day over a pill.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. And allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I've never really had a reaction to anything. Unless you count being allergic to nosy doctors, which I might be developing. Honestly, I'm starting to feel rather faint.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I need to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'd like to check your iron levels. It’s a common cause of pica, and it’s a simple blood test. Also, I'll check your thyroid. Your pulse is a little fast, actually. Let's get a better look. Can you roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A blood test? Honestly, Doctor, you're going to make me lie down if you keep talking about needles. Fine, fine. But don't expect much. I’m not a fan of being poked and prodded. And if I start craving dirt during the test, don’t judge me.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a little prick. Try to relax. There, all done. And yes, it's quite common to feel a little faint with blood draws. We'll get these results back to you within a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a thyroid panel. We’ll also rule out any other potential causes. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Honestly, I just want to go home and have a cup of tea. Will this blood test actually tell you what’s wrong? Because I’m starting to feel quite weak again. And… is the dirt craving a sign of something really serious? Don’t sugarcoat it, Doctor. I can handle the truth.
DOCTOR: It can indicate a nutritional deficiency, most commonly iron. However, it can also be related to other underlying conditions. That’s why we need to run these tests. We need to rule out anemia, thyroid issues, and other possibilities. Frankly, it’s a little unusual for someone your age to develop a craving like this without an underlying cause. I’m going to give you a referral to a hematologist, just to be on the safe side. They can do a more thorough evaluation. And I recommend you try to avoid consuming any more dirt until we get these results back. It could be exacerbating any underlying issues. I’ll have my nurse give you the referral information and a list of instructions. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Hematologist? Oh, goodness. More doctors. Fine. Fine. Avoid the dirt. I suppose I can try. Though it’s not as easy as you make it sound. It's like… an itch I can't scratch. And honestly, Doctor, I don’t understand half of what you’re saying. Anemia? What's that even mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Anemia means you have a low red blood cell count. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. A low count leads to fatigue, weakness, and… cravings, sometimes. It can be serious, but it’s also often treatable with iron supplements or, in more severe cases, a blood transfusion. It’s important to follow up with the hematologist, as they can determine the underlying cause and recommend the best course of treatment. I’ll have my nurse explain the referral process. Do you have any other questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. And please, tell your nurse to speak slowly. I don’t understand all this medical jargon. Honestly, I just want a cup of tea and a lie-down. It’s been a dreadful morning.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will assist you. Have a… good day.
