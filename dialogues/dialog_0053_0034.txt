DOCTOR: Right. Emileigh Bonck. Twenty-one years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi. Um… well, I just moved here. I have Medicare, and I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? It's a social thing, I think? My… someone told me I needed to come in. I don't really remember who, though.
DOCTOR: A social thing?
PATIENT: Yeah… that’s what I think it was for. I just… got married and moved to the city. It was kinda fast, you know? And someone said something about healthcare and needing to see someone. I don't really… keep track of things very well.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, congratulations on the marriage. It is good to establish care when you move, even if it wasn't specifically a requirement. It's just… sensible. So, let’s put aside the “social” aspect for a moment. Are you currently experiencing any health issues?
PATIENT: Um… not really? I mean, nothing big. I get tired sometimes, but everyone does, right? And my back aches a little if I’m on my feet all day, but I work with machines, so that makes sense. I don’t… I don’t feel sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Not feeling sick” is a good starting point. Tiredness and back pain… those are quite vague, though. Let’s try to be a little more specific. When you say “tired,” is it just feeling a bit run down at the end of the day, or is it more debilitating?
PATIENT: It’s… more than just at the end of the day. Like, sometimes I wake up tired. And it’s hard to… focus? Like, if I’m trying to fix something at work, I kinda… lose my train of thought. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s… annoying. And the back pain is mostly when I’m bending a lot, or lifting things. It doesn't hurt all the time either.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fatigue that isn’t relieved by rest, and back pain exacerbated by physical activity. Let's move on. Have you had any recent illnesses, even a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Um… I think so? Maybe last winter? Everything's kinda blurry. I had a really bad cough for a bit, and a fever, but I just… stayed home and rested. I don't really remember going to the doctor for it. My… husband probably gave it to me? He travels a lot for work. I definitely wasn't feeling good, though.
DOCTOR: Travel history… fascinating. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… I don't think so. I haven't ever really had a bad reaction to anything. I'm pretty sure. Oh! Wait… I think I got a rash once when I was little, from poison ivy? But that wasn’t an allergy, right? Just… a plant thing?
DOCTOR: Poison ivy is an irritant contact dermatitis, not a true allergy. Alright. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. I haven't really… been to the doctor much. I mean, just for check-ups when I was a kid, and… maybe a broken arm once? But nothing… serious? I don't remember anything being wrong with me.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Um… no. Nothing that I remember. I definitely haven’t had surgery. Maybe I was in the hospital when I was a baby… but I don’t remember that. My… husband says I was born healthy? Is this… important? I’m sorry I can’t remember things very well.
DOCTOR: It's…helpful to have an accurate history. Alright. Let’s move on to your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… um… my mom had… high blood pressure, I think? And my grandma… she had something with her heart. But I don’t really know what. It was a long time ago. And my dad… he was pretty healthy, I think? He worked outside a lot. My husband’s family… I don't really know much about them. They live far away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No… nothing. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen if my back really hurts, but that’s it. And I try to take a multivitamin, but I forget sometimes. I don’t really like taking pills. Does this mean you think something’s wrong?
DOCTOR: Well, given your… incomplete history, a thorough assessment is warranted. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick neurological assessment. Standard procedure.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds okay. As long as it’s not too… scary? What kind of neurological assessment? Is that like… a brain thing?
DOCTOR: It’s simply checking your reflexes and basic motor function. It’s not a “brain thing,” as you put it. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs while you sit here. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Okay… It's… kinda cold. Is everything okay so far?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/80. Heart sounds are regular, though a bit distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical in the upper extremities. Lower extremity assessment next. Please bend your knees.
PATIENT: Okay… Is that… normal? The distant heart sounds? Is something wrong with my heart?
DOCTOR: "Distant" is a subjective finding. It could simply be due to your body habitus. However, given your reported fatigue and the finding, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying anemia or thyroid issues. And an EKG would be prudent to assess your cardiac rhythm more thoroughly. We’ll also want a chest X-ray, just to be certain. It’s best to be thorough, especially with a new patient and an incomplete medical history.
PATIENT: Okay… Blood tests… and an EKG… and a chest X-ray? Is… is it serious? I just moved here… I don’t even have a regular doctor yet. Are you sure I need all these tests?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Bonck, I understand you're anxious, but I am the doctor. I am recommending these tests as a standard precaution, given the limited information I have. It’s far better to identify any potential issues early on. Anemia and thyroid problems can cause fatigue, and the EKG will simply confirm your heart rhythm. It’s not about being “serious” or not, it’s about responsible medical care. I'll write you a requisition form for the lab and the radiology center. Please schedule the tests as soon as possible, and we'll review the results at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions about scheduling?
PATIENT: Um… no, I guess not. I’ll… I’ll figure it out. Thank you… I think. This is a lot. .
DOCTOR: Right. You’ll find the instructions on the form. Schedule the tests and bring the results to your next appointment. Have a good day. .
