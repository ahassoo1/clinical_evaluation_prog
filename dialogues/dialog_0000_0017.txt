DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bartok. I'm Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. It’s… something about a check-up. For… the team. Yes, the team. I think I gotta get checked out to… try out. It’s a little hazy, to be honest. Been a while since I did anything like this.
DOCTOR: "The team," right. Well, we can certainly get you checked out. It's good you're being proactive. "Hazy," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, hazy. Like… fog. My ex-wife, she always said I was living in a fog. It's not important. Look, I just wanna make sure I'm… fit enough. You know, strong enough to… play. Whatever it is I'm trying out for. Honestly, it slipped my mind. It was… baseball, maybe? Or basketball? I used to be good at… something with a ball.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "fit enough" is a good place to start. We’ll figure it out. Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. When did you last have a physical exam, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: A physical… hmm. That’s… a good question. Honestly, Doctor, it’s been years. Many, many years. Before the… divorce, definitely. She always handled those things. I don’t… remember the details. It was… a long time ago. I’m not one for doctors, you see. Never needed ‘em much. Mostly just… aches and pains. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll treat this as a comprehensive check-up then. To get a better picture of your overall health, let's start with a review of your current symptoms. Are you experiencing any pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, or any other issues at the moment?
PATIENT: Pain… yes, a little. In the knees, mostly. Old baseball injury, probably. Or basketball. One of them. And… tired sometimes, I guess. But who isn’t? I work hard, you know? Construction work. It’s… tiring. Shortness of breath? Not… really. Unless I’m climbing stairs. Then I get a little… winded. But that’s just… being out of shape, I reckon. Nothing serious. I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee pain, fatigue, and some shortness of breath with exertion. Fair enough. To get a more complete picture, let's go through a brief medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… let me think. The doctor, her doctor, said my cholesterol was a little high once. That was… before everything, too. And, uh… I think I had the flu once. A bad one. But that doesn’t count, does it? No… no big problems. I’m a pretty healthy guy, really. Just… getting older, that’s all. And tired. Very tired. I should probably get more sleep.
DOCTOR: Right. Elevated cholesterol previously noted, and a history of the flu. Alright. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Now that's a good question. Let me think… I think I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. That was a long time ago. And… oh! I broke my wrist once, falling off my bike. But that wasn’t… serious, either. Just a cast for a few weeks. No hospital stays, though. Not that I remember, anyway. My ex-wife, she always handled all that paperwork. I just… showed up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy in childhood, broken wrist. Good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… uh… my mother, she… she had problems with her heart. Eventually. But she lived a long life. My father… he worked very hard. Not much for doctors, either. Strong man, though. Always strong. As for… other family? I don’t… I haven’t seen them in years. It’s complicated. Long story. Nothing relevant, I’m sure. Really, Doctor, I'm just a simple man.
DOCTOR: “Simple,” you say. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. I don’t think so. I eat pretty much everything. Never had a problem. Well… maybe pollen. I sneeze a little in the spring. But that doesn't count, does it? It's just… the flowers, blooming. Everyone sneezes in the spring. No… no serious allergies. I'm pretty lucky that way, actually. A tough constitution, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. No known drug allergies. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I take… something for the knee pain. An over-the-counter thing. Ibuprofen, I think? Or… something like that. And… sometimes, when I can't sleep, I take a little something. Just to help me… relax. But nothing regular. Just… when I need it. It's not a habit, you see. Doctor, are we almost done? This is… tiring, answering all these questions. I just wanna know if I can play… whatever it is I'm trying out for.
DOCTOR: "Almost done" requires a physical examination, Mr. Bartok. We need to assess your current condition. Now, please, if you could just lie down on the examination table. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. It's standard procedure. We’ll get to whether you can “play” after I have some information to work with.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Examination table, you say? Just… try to be quick, Doctor. My knees aren't what they used to be. And… honestly, I don't like doctors touching me. It feels… invasive. But… alright. Let’s get this over with. Just… be gentle, alright? And don't expect much. I'm an old man. A tired old man. Is there… a blanket, by any chance? It’s a little chilly in here.
DOCTOR: There is. After the examination. Now, please lie flat and take deep breaths. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, and I’m hearing some… diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes. And your reflexes are… sluggish. Can you tell me about your typical breathing pattern?
PATIENT: Elevated heart rate? Diminished breath sounds? Sluggish reflexes? That doesn’t sound good, does it? I… I don’t know about my typical breathing pattern. I just… breathe, Doctor. Like everyone else. I guess. I try not to think about it. I’ve always been a little… winded when I exert myself. Always. Construction work, you know? It’s hard labor. Heavy lifting. Dusty environment. Maybe it’s just… the dust? Or the stress? My ex-wife… she always said I worried too much. Maybe that’s it. Is something wrong, Doctor? Are you going to tell me I can’t play… whatever it is I’m trying out for?
DOCTOR: There's some tenderness in your abdomen, and slight swelling in your ankles. Your weight is also significantly lower than what it should be for your height. And your skin is… pale. We’ll need some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. You'll need to go to the lab downstairs. They’ll draw some blood and take the X-ray. I want to rule out any underlying infection or other medical issues. And I'm referring you to a pulmonologist for further evaluation of your breathing. It's best to be thorough, Mr. Bartok. Especially given your symptoms. And until we have the results, I strongly advise against any strenuous physical activity. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work… a pulmonologist… strenuous activity… That sounds… serious, Doctor. Really serious. And expensive, probably. My Medicare… will that cover all this? My ex-wife… she handled all the insurance stuff. I never paid much attention. So… I can’t play… whatever it is I was trying out for? Not even a little? After all this… all this waiting… and questions… and blood work… I just… wanted to feel useful again. To be part of a team. To… prove something. I don’t understand. What’s wrong with me, Doctor? What’s really wrong?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I can’t tell you what's wrong with you without the test results. I need concrete data, not vague feelings. Your symptoms are concerning, and that's why I'm ordering these tests. It could be anything from a simple infection to something more serious. Until we know for sure, speculating won’t help. As for the tests being covered by Medicare, I'm confident they will be, but you should contact the billing department to confirm. And while I understand your desire to be part of a team, your health is the priority. We need to rule out any potential risks before you engage in any physical activity. I'm referring you to Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected pulmonologist. They'll be able to assess your breathing and determine the best course of action. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the test results and the pulmonologist's recommendations. In the meantime, focus on rest and follow your normal diet. Do you have any questions for me right now, before you go to the lab?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramirez… rest… normal diet… It all sounds… overwhelming, Doctor. So many appointments… so many tests… I just wanted a simple check-up. To see if I could play… whatever it was I was trying out for. What if… what if it’s something bad? What if… I can’t… I can’t even think about it. I… I don’t know. I don’t have any questions right now. I just… I just want to go home. I need to sit down. And… and maybe take a nap. Thank you, Doctor. I… I think that’s all. I’ll… I’ll go to the lab. And… and schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bartok. The lab is downstairs. Take your time. And remember, rest is important. .
