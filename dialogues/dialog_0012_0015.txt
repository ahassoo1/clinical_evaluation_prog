DOCTOR: Hi Mikeisha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… my sinuses. They are… bothering me. A lot of pressure, mostly. I forget… when it started, exactly. Maybe a week? Or more? It is hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus pressure. That can be really uncomfortable. And it's totally understandable to have trouble pinpointing exactly when things started, especially if it's been a week or more. Just give me your best guess, that's fine. So, this pressure… where exactly do you feel it?
PATIENT: Um… here, mostly. And… sometimes in my nose. Not in my nose, exactly… more around it. It feels… full. Like when you have a cold, maybe? I do not know. I do not get sick often, so I forget what that feels like.
DOCTOR: Okay, forehead, cheeks, and around the nose – that sounds like it’s affecting a few different sinus areas. And comparing it to a cold feeling is helpful. Have you noticed anything else along with the pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think… maybe a little tired? Not very tired, just… more tired than usual. And… my head feels… heavy sometimes. Not a headache, exactly. Just… heavy. And… I think I have been smelling things… funny. Like, not bad, just… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little more fatigue, a heavy feeling in your head, and changes in your sense of smell. That's good information. When you say “funny” smells… can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Oh… it is hard to explain. Like… coffee. I love coffee. But sometimes it smells… weak. Or… like something else is mixed in. I do not know how to say it. It is not a strong smell, just… not right. And sometimes things have no smell at all. Like my husband's cooking. He makes good food, it should smell good! But… nothing.
DOCTOR: That's definitely something to pay attention to, changes in your sense of smell. It's good you noticed that. Now, let's back up a bit. Have you had any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose with this?
PATIENT: Fever… I do not think so. I did not check. Chills… no. Cough… maybe a little, sometimes. Very small cough. Not often. And… no runny nose. Just… blocked, mostly. Like something is inside. It is hard to breathe through my nose sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills, a small cough, blocked nasal passages, but no runny nose. That's helpful. Have you tried anything to relieve the pressure or blockage so far?
PATIENT: Um… I tried… hot water. Like, steam. I put my head over a bowl with hot water and a towel over my head. It helped a little, maybe. And… my husband gave me something. A pill. I forget what it is called. It did not do much. I do not like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, steam helped a little, and you tried a pill that didn’t seem to make much difference. That's good to know. Do you know anything about the pill your husband gave you – what it looked like, the color, the name on the bottle, anything at all?
PATIENT: Um… It was… small. White, I think. And… round. The bottle was… blue. And… I think it had some words. I cannot remember what they said. My husband always gets the medicine. I just take it. I do not know anything about pills. I am sorry. I do not remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all, it's perfectly fine. It’s common to not remember details about medications. We’ll figure it out. Let’s move on to a few other questions, just to get a better picture of things. Have you had any recent injuries to your face or head?
PATIENT: Injuries? No. Nothing. I have not fallen or… hit my head. I work with… machines. But I am very careful. My husband worries, but I am careful. I have been doing my job for a long time. No injuries.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s good to hear. Now, have you been around anyone who’s been sick recently – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… maybe. My coworker, Elena, she was coughing a lot last week. But she said it was just allergies. I do not know. We work very close together. It is hard to avoid things. But I try to… be careful. Wash my hands a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible exposure to a coworker with a cough. That's good to know. Now, just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history? I do not… go to the doctor often. I am usually healthy. I have… no big problems. My husband says I am strong. I have… high blood pressure, maybe? He tells me to take pills for that, but I forget sometimes. And… I had a baby a long time ago. That was… normal. I do not know what else. I do not have a list. I do not remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication sometimes, and a previous normal pregnancy. That’s helpful. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… no. I do not remember. It is a small white pill, I think. Like the other one. My husband gets it for me. He says I need it. I take it sometimes, when I remember. I do not like taking pills. I am sorry. I am not very good with names.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can try to figure things out. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… allergies? I do not think so. I eat everything. My husband says I eat too much, sometimes! I have never felt sick after eating something. And… I have never had a problem with medicine. I do not take it often enough to know. I do not think I have allergies. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your lungs, look in your ears and throat, and feel your sinuses to see if they're tender. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay. Your lungs sound good. Your ears look clear. But your sinuses are definitely tender to the touch, particularly here and here. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis – inflammation of your sinuses. The tenderness, pressure, and changes in your sense of smell all point to that. The lack of a fever is good, but the congestion and fatigue are common symptoms. Since you haven’t been feeling well for at least a week, we should consider some treatment options. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Sinusitis? Is that… bad? And what… treatment? Will I need… pills?
DOCTOR: It's not usually bad in the sense of being dangerous, but it can be very uncomfortable and affect your quality of life. It happens when the tissues lining your sinuses get inflamed, often from a virus or, sometimes, bacteria. As for treatment, we can start with some things to help relieve your symptoms. Often, it gets better on its own with time, rest, and hydration. But since it’s been over a week, we might consider a nasal saline rinse to help clear out the congestion, and I could prescribe a short course of a decongestant. And yes, sometimes a short course of antibiotics is needed if it doesn't improve or gets worse. Would you be open to trying the saline rinse and decongestant first?
PATIENT: Saline rinse? What is that? And decongestant… is that a pill? I do not like pills… But… I want to feel better. What does the saline rinse do? Is it… difficult?
DOCTOR: A saline rinse is just using saltwater to flush out your nasal passages. It helps to clear out the congestion and reduce inflammation. You can buy a saline rinse kit at most pharmacies – it looks a little like a teapot. It’s not difficult, but it does take a little getting used to. There are lots of videos online that can show you how to do it. The decongestant can be a pill, or it can be a nasal spray. Both help to open up your nasal passages to make it easier to breathe. We could start with the nasal spray to avoid pills if you'd prefer. Would you be comfortable trying the nasal spray and saline rinse first?
PATIENT: Okay… a nasal spray… that sounds… better than a pill. And the saline rinse… I will try it. I will watch the videos. If it does not work… will I have to take a pill then?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. If the nasal spray and saline rinse don’t provide enough relief after about a week, then we might consider a short course of antibiotics – usually in pill form – to help fight off any potential bacterial infection. But let's not worry about that right now. We'll start with the nasal spray and saline rinse, see how you feel, and we can reassess in a week. I’ll write you a prescription for a decongestant nasal spray. I'll also give you a handout with instructions for the saline rinse and some tips for managing your symptoms – like staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very well. I will try my best to follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if you develop a high fever, severe headache, vision changes, or swelling around your eyes, go to the emergency room right away. Those could be signs of a more serious infection. Otherwise, please follow the instructions, and schedule a follow-up appointment with me in a week to let me know how you’re doing. Here are the prescription and handout. Do you need a work note?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I do not need a work note. I can still do my job. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I will see you in a week.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. Get some rest, and I hope you feel better soon. If anything changes before our appointment, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day!
PATIENT:
