DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Good to meet you. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes, the doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. An… issue. A most unwelcome issue, down there. I don’t quite know what it is, mind you. It’s… leaking. A bit. Not a flood, thankfully. Just… a discharge. And it’s… unpleasant. Though, at my age, one expects a bit of… decline, doesn’t one? I suppose.
DOCTOR: Leaking, you say. And unpleasant. Alright. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention, even if it is embarrassing. Things changing “down there” aren’t always just a normal part of aging, and we want to make sure we rule anything serious out. Now, can you tell me a bit more about this discharge?
PATIENT: More about it… good heavens. Where to begin? It’s… well, it’s not blood, if that’s what you’re thinking. More… yellowish, I’d say. And… sticky. It's been going on for… oh, I couldn’t possibly say. A week? Perhaps two? Time does rather blur, you see. My wife, bless her, noticed it first. She has a very keen sense of smell, you understand. A rather too keen sense, sometimes. I hadn't even felt anything, not really. Just a… dampness.
DOCTOR: Yellowish and sticky, for a week or two. Noted. And your wife noticed it first, due to the smell. Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, dear. Let me think… No, not really. No pain, thankfully. No burning sensation. No… swelling, I don’t believe. No fever, though I do sometimes feel a bit warm, but that’s just my constitution, you see. I get rather flushed easily. And… no, nothing else comes to mind. It's just… the discharge. Annoying, mostly. And unseemly. At my age, one expects dignity, not… this.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, burning, swelling, or fever. Just the discharge. You said you feel warm sometimes, but that's just your normal constitution. Okay. Now, have you had any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? Goodness. Changes… Well, now that you mention it, perhaps. It's a bit… hesitant, sometimes. Not a strong stream, you see. More of a dribble. I put it down to my prostate, naturally. Old age, you understand. Everything starts to… sag, eventually. And one doesn’t have the strength one used to. It takes a bit longer to… empty, if you catch my meaning. It's not painful, just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Hesitant stream, dribbling, takes longer to empty. Alright. And have you noticed any increase in how often you need to urinate, especially at night?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, quite. At night, particularly. My wife has been quite cross about it. Waking her up, you see. I used to sleep through the night like a log, but now… up and down, up and down. Two, three times, sometimes more. It’s… disruptive. I drink a glass of water before bed, you see. Always have. A bit of a habit, I suppose. But now… it seems a terrible mistake.
DOCTOR: Drinking a glass of water before bed… well, that certainly isn’t helping. Alright, Mr. Krok. It sounds like you’re likely experiencing some prostate issues, which is common at your age. But we still need to rule out anything else. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. It’s a standard procedure, and will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh. Well. I suppose not. Though I must confess, I’m not terribly fond of doctors poking and prodding. But if it’s necessary… I suppose. It’s just… rather undignified, isn’t it? At my age, one prefers to avoid such things. But if it will help… very well. Do tell me, will it be… painful? And how long will it take? I have a rather nice garden to tend to this afternoon, you see. The tomatoes are coming along beautifully.
DOCTOR: It won't be painful, Mr. Krok. A little uncomfortable perhaps, but brief. We’ll just need to examine the prostate and check for any abnormalities. It should only take a few minutes. Please lie down on the examination table, and we’ll get started. I’ll need you to relax as much as possible. Now, if you'll just loosen your trousers a bit… and we'll begin.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Loosen my trousers… very well. It's just… rather chilly in here, isn't it? And I do wish doctors still wore proper coats. The white ones… it was much more reassuring, somehow. Are you quite sure this won't be… unpleasant? I haven't had one of these exams in… well, decades.
DOCTOR: Just relax, Mr. Krok. I'm going to apply a little lubricant. This will help me with the exam. Alright. I can feel some enlargement, which is consistent with an enlarged prostate. There doesn’t appear to be anything acutely concerning, but it’s definitely contributing to your symptoms. The discharge is likely related as well. I'll need to send a urine sample to the lab to rule out any infection. Nurse will be in shortly to collect that for me.
PATIENT: An enlarged prostate… naturally. I suppose I should have expected as much. So, it's not… something dreadful? Not… cancer or anything of that nature? My brother, God rest his soul, he… well, never mind. It's best not to dwell on such things. A urine sample, you say? Very well. I suppose I can manage that. Though, at my age, things don't always… flow as easily as they once did.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily dreadful, Mr. Krok. Enlarged prostate is very common as you get older. We'll need the urine sample to rule out infection, which can cause similar symptoms. We’ll get the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a medication called Tamsulosin. It will help relax the muscles in your prostate and make it easier to urinate. It may take a few weeks to see the full effect. And try to limit your fluid intake before bed, as you mentioned. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me think… Not that I recall. I used to take a tonic, back in Iran, but that was… decades ago. A herbal remedy, mostly. A bit bitter, but quite effective for… everything, really. But I haven’t taken anything regularly in years. My wife handles all the medication, you see. She has a very good memory for these things. But I don’t think I have any allergies. No, none at all. Though, sometimes I get a bit of a rash if I eat shellfish. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Just… a slight irritation. And I haven’t eaten shellfish in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known medication allergies, other than a possible reaction to shellfish. Noted. I’ll write you a prescription for Tamsulosin, and the nurse will explain the dosage and potential side effects. If you experience any dizziness or lightheadedness, stop taking the medication and contact the office immediately. Now, I’m also going to order a PSA blood test. It’s a standard test to screen for prostate cancer. It’s important to keep an eye on it, even if everything seems normal right now. The nurse will schedule that for you as well. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: A PSA blood test… more tests. It seems I’m becoming a regular fixture in this clinic. Prostate cancer… oh dear. Is it… serious? My brother, again… he… never mind. I suppose it’s best not to dwell on such things. Dizziness, you say? I do get a bit lightheaded sometimes, but that’s just my age, surely. It happens. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… is this going to be a long process? I have a garden to tend to, you see. The tomatoes are particularly sensitive this year. They require a great deal of attention. And my wife… she relies on me for the roses. They’re her pride and joy.
DOCTOR: It's a standard procedure, Mr. Krok. The PSA test is just a precaution. We need to monitor it to ensure everything remains stable. As for the dizziness, just be careful when standing up, and let us know if it gets worse. As for the garden, I can’t guarantee how long the process will take. But hopefully, you’ll be able to continue tending to your tomatoes and roses. The nurse will be in shortly to go over everything with you. Any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, no, I think that will be all. Though… perhaps you could recommend a good brand of tomato feed? The ones I’ve been using haven’t been particularly effective this year. The leaves are a bit… pale, you see. And the fruit isn’t ripening as quickly as it should. My wife is quite particular about the tomatoes. She makes a wonderful sauce, you know. A family recipe. No, thank you. That will be all.
DOCTOR: I’m afraid I'm not a gardening expert, Mr. Krok. Perhaps you could ask at your local nursery. They would be better equipped to advise you on tomato feed. The nurse will see you now. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, doctor. Tomato feed… must remember to ask at the nursery. And tell my wife I saw the doctor. She'll want to know about the PSA test. Oh dear. .
