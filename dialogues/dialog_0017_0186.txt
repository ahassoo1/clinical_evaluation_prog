DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I am Dr. Blim. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need a check-up for… well, a sports team tryout. Gotta make sure I’m still good to go, you know? Getting a little older, gotta prove I can still hang.
DOCTOR: A tryout, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Local team. Nothing big, but I like to stay active. Keeps me young. Don't judge the weight too much, Doctor. I'm mostly muscle, honest.
DOCTOR: Muscle, naturally. Well, Mr. Kingan, a “check-up” requires a bit more than assurances. Let's start with a thorough history. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations – anything at all – during exercise recently, or even at rest?
PATIENT: Hmm. Palpitations… not really. Sometimes a little breathless going uphill, but I chalk that up to the altitude here. We're pretty high up, right? This clinic's… not exactly in the city. No chest pain though, thankfully. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Altitude is a factor, certainly. But we must be precise. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart conditions?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. No doctor's ever told me anything was wrong with my heart. Always been pretty healthy, actually. A few colds here and there, but that's it. I don't even take regular medication. Is this gonna take long, Doctor? I've got a practice scheduled for later.
DOCTOR: A “practice”, you say. Mr. Kingan, a proper medical evaluation requires a degree of… patience. Now, family history. Any instances of heart disease, stroke, or sudden death in your immediate family – parents, siblings?
PATIENT: Let me think… My dad, he… well, he had high blood pressure, I think. Kept to himself a lot, didn't really talk about his health. No stroke, not that I know of. And no sudden deaths, thankfully. He just… got old, you know? Lived a good life, but he wasn't an athlete or anything. Mostly just sat around.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s discuss your current activity level outside of this “practice”. What kind of exercise are you doing to prepare for this tryout?
PATIENT: Well, mostly running. Just a few miles a week, nothing crazy. Some push-ups, sit-ups. I used to lift weights, but my shoulder’s been acting up a bit, so I laid off that. It's not a serious injury or anything, just… a little sore. Keeps me up some nights.
DOCTOR: A “little sore” is a remarkably vague descriptor, Mr. Kingan. When did this shoulder discomfort begin?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh, probably a few months ago now. Started after helping a friend move some furniture. Stupid idea, looking back on it. It comes and goes, really. Sometimes it’s fine, sometimes it aches a bit when I lift my arm. Nothing I haven't been able to work through… usually. Is this gonna disqualify me from the tryout?
DOCTOR: Let's have a look. A proper physical exam is necessary, Mr. Kingan, to assess the severity of this “discomfort”. Please, if you would, lie down on the table. We'll start with your cardiovascular system, and then we’ll address your shoulder. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing at all. Okay, fine. Cardiovascular first… Just try not to poke around too much, alright? I’m not as young as I used to be, you know. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Breathe deeply, Mr. Kingan. Deeply. Rate and rhythm… regular, but slightly elevated. Murmurs… none detected, thankfully. Blood pressure: 148 over 92. Slightly elevated. Now, let's listen to your lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just breathing, breathing. Everything okay so far? Is my blood pressure bad bad? I don’t really understand all that doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: It is… suboptimal, Mr. Kingan. We will discuss that later. Now, let’s move on to your shoulder. Can you show me the range of motion?
PATIENT: Alright, suboptimal… great. There. See? Not terrible. It’s just… a little tight here. And that… feels a little pinched. It doesn’t hurt sharp, it's more of a dull ache, like a pulled muscle. You know?
DOCTOR: Tenderness is present over the rotator cuff insertion. Limited range of motion. Strength is… diminished. And there is crepitus upon palpation. It appears you have a possible rotator cuff strain, Mr. Kingan. This is not a pulled muscle. I recommend an MRI to confirm the extent of the injury. And given your elevated blood pressure, a cardiology consult is also advisable. I strongly advise against participating in this tryout until you have been fully evaluated.
PATIENT: MRI… cardiology… Whoa, hold on a second. That sounds… serious. I just wanted to make sure I was still in shape, not… get a whole bunch of tests! I don’t even have insurance! Can’t I just… ice it? Take some ibuprofen? I’ve done that before and it always gets better. This is getting way out of hand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your concerns regarding the cost, but ignoring these issues will only exacerbate the problem. Self-treating will not suffice. I can provide you with a list of free or low-cost clinics in the area, but I strongly recommend seeking further evaluation. I will write a referral for both an MRI and a cardiology consult. And frankly, participating in this “tryout” in your current condition would be… irresponsible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
