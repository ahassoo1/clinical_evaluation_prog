DOCTOR: Hi Jailenne, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Yoshino, nice to meet you too! Well, I've been getting chills lately, and it's a bit worrying me. It's not like a cold chill, more... random, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, “random chills” – I understand. That’s good you’re getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm, okay. Well, they just… happen. Like, I’ll be perfectly fine, sitting and watching TV, and then suddenly I feel cold, like a shiver going through me. It doesn’t last long, maybe a few minutes, and then it's gone. It’s been happening for about a week, I think. Not constantly, but maybe… three or four times a day? It’s just… weird. And I haven’t been sick or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, so about three or four times a day for the past week, these sudden chills that come on without any other symptoms like a fever or cough. And they resolve fairly quickly, within a few minutes?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. No fever, no cough, no sore throat… nothing else. Just the chills. It’s not keeping me up at night or anything, but it's definitely annoying, and I just wanted to make sure it wasn’t something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… honestly, no, not really. That's what's so strange! I've tried to think about it, like if it happens when I'm stressed, or after eating something specific, or if I’m in a draft… but it really seems totally random. I was hoping you'd have some idea!
DOCTOR: Okay, totally random chills with no clear trigger. I understand your frustration. Let's do a quick review of your medical history, just to get a better picture. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and I broke my wrist a few years ago, but that’s about it. No allergies, I don’t take any regular medication… oh! And I had the flu really badly one winter, but that was years ago. Nothing else I can think of that’s really important.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendix removed as a teenager, a broken wrist a few years ago, no known allergies, and no current medications. You had a bad case of the flu years ago. And no other significant medical history. What about family history?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Um… my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some heart problems when he was older. My grandma on my mom’s side had diabetes, but that’s about all I know, really. No one else really had anything major that I’m aware of. My family isn't really big on talking about health stuff, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure, heart problems, and diabetes. And you said no one else really discusses health issues. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle... Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I'll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once or twice a week, but that’s it. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I try to stay pretty healthy, to be honest. I eat a lot of vegetables, I walk whenever I can... just trying to take care of myself. It's just… these chills are weirding me out.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So no smoking, occasional alcohol, and a generally healthy lifestyle. That's all very helpful. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms at all accompanying these chills?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think really hard. No… I haven’t. No headaches, no muscle aches, no fatigue… nothing. That’s what’s so confusing! I feel perfectly normal except for these random chills. Sometimes I get a little anxious because of them, but I don’t think that causes them, you know? It’s like a cycle. I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms aside from the chills and occasional anxiety related to the chills. Alright. To get a better idea of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, let’s start with your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, pulse is 72 and regular, and blood pressure is 120/80 – all within the normal range. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs, and your lungs are clear. Your lymph nodes are not swollen. Finally, I'll just take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Everything looks normal there as well. No signs of infection.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That all sounds… reassuring, I guess? But it's still weird that I'm getting these chills with everything seeming normal. What do you think it could be?
DOCTOR: It is frustrating when things don't immediately add up. Everything I'm hearing and seeing right now doesn't point to anything obvious like an infection or another acute illness. There are a few possibilities we could consider. Sometimes chills can be related to mild hormonal fluctuations, especially in women, even without other menstrual changes. Also, anxiety can sometimes manifest physically, though it’s hard to say if that's the cause or a result of the chills. To rule out a few other things, I'd like to order some basic blood work, including a complete blood count and a thyroid panel. This will help us check for any underlying inflammation, anemia, or thyroid issues. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. If it can rule things out, definitely. Blood work is fine. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? So, yes, let’s do the blood work. How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll get the order entered for you now. The lab usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment, or I can call you with the results once they come in – whatever is easier for you. In the meantime, if the chills become more frequent or severe, or if you develop any other symptoms like fever, fatigue, or muscle aches, please call us right away. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. 24-48 hours sounds good. I’ll just try not to worry too much in the meantime. Thank you, Dr. Yoshino. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and try to figure things out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I understand your frustration, and we'll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon.
