DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really have time for a lot of chit-chat. I just… I want to get pregnant. And I want it to work this time. No problems, you know? Is that possible? I'm 43, and frankly, I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Carmaleta. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to get straight to the point, and I appreciate you being so direct. It's also very common to feel a sense of urgency when you're thinking about starting a family, especially as you get older. We’ll certainly do our best to figure things out and see what we can do to help. To start, could you tell me a little bit about how long you’ve been trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Trying? Honestly, not that long. A few months, maybe? It… didn't happen, so I figured I should get it checked. My husband… well, he passed away last year. It’s… complicated. And now I want a baby. It should be simple, shouldn’t it? I mean, I was always regular, never any issues before. It just… isn’t happening now. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Carmaleta. And I am so very sorry to hear about your husband. That is a tremendous loss, and I can only imagine how difficult this whole process must be for you, on so many levels. It’s wonderful that you're thinking about building a family, and you are right to be proactive about getting things checked out. Just a few months of trying can be enough to warrant some investigation, especially with your age. Let’s gather some more information. First, could you tell me about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh, cycles. Fine. They're… usually pretty regular. Every 28 days, give or take. I mean, I know my body. Always have. But honestly, I don’t keep a calendar or anything. I just… know. Is that good enough? Look, I'm not one for details. I just want to know if something's wrong. Is there something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: It is good to know your cycles are typically regular, and trusting your body is important. While a calendar isn't essential, knowing the approximate length and any changes you've noticed is helpful. To get a clearer picture, can you describe what your periods are typically like?
PATIENT: Like what? Blood. Normal amount, I guess. Not, like, flooding or anything. Not super light either. Just… normal. Look, I really don’t like talking about this. Is there a test you can just do to see what's going on? I don't need to go into graphic detail about my… womanly things. I have other things I need to be doing.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Carmaleta, and I apologize if I’m pushing too much. We can absolutely move towards testing. However, even a little more information can help us choose the right tests and understand the results better. Before we do that, would you mind if I ask about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sad? Look, I’m a widow! Of course, I’m having symptoms. What kind of symptoms are you talking about? I don’t have any medical symptoms, if that’s what you mean. No pain, no spotting, no… anything weird. Honestly, I feel pretty good, all things considered. I just want a baby. Can we please just skip to the tests? I'm starting to get impatient.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to be direct, and I apologize for belaboring the point. It sounds like you're feeling well overall, which is good. Okay, let's move forward with testing. We'll start with some blood work to check your hormone levels – things like FSH, estradiol, and thyroid hormones. These can give us a good initial picture of how your body is functioning. I’d also like to do a complete blood count just as a general health check. We can also do a urine test to confirm you're not pregnant. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Hormones, blood, urine. Whatever. Just get it over with. The quicker we find out what's wrong, the quicker I can get this sorted. Can I get a form or something? And where do I go for these tests? I have a meeting this afternoon, so I can't be here all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm printing out the lab requisition forms now. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They're expecting you. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes, depending on how busy they are. They will draw blood and collect a urine sample. While you’re waiting, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies. No. Not that I know of. I've never really had problems with anything. Look, I really need to go. This is taking too long. Just… take the blood and tell me if something's wrong. I don’t need a detailed explanation, just the bottom line. Is that possible? I have a very busy life.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. I understand. No allergies, good to know. I'll make a note of that. I will ensure the lab knows you're on a tight schedule. I will review the results as soon as they come in, and my assistant will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If anything critical comes up, we will call you immediately. Is there anything else I can address before you go?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just… get the tests done. And call if it's important. Honestly, I'm really not one for doctors or anything. This is just… something I need to get sorted. Thank you. .
