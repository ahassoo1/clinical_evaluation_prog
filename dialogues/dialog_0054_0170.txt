DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They sent me here for a check-up, I guess. Gotta get it done. Quick as possible would be good, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I understand you'd like to keep this as efficient as possible. We can definitely work with that. It sounds like this is a check-up required for a life insurance policy. To start, could you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Well… I’m okay, I think. I get tired easy, but I work long hours at the hotel. Just managing things, you know? I haven’t really been sick, sick, in a while. Little colds, nothing major. I mostly just… feel old, I guess. Is that a thing you ask about?
DOCTOR: It absolutely is a thing we ask about, Mr. Putney. Feeling tired and generally not yourself is important information. The tiredness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty constant, yeah. Worse at the end of the day, obviously, after being on my feet for ten, twelve hours. But even when I’m resting, I don’t feel… fully recharged, if that makes sense. Like I’m always a little behind.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s a helpful way to describe it. And you mentioned working at a hotel – what kind of work do you do there exactly?
PATIENT: I’m the lodging manager. Basically, I handle everything – the front desk, the housekeeping staff, making sure the rooms are booked, dealing with any complaints… all of it. It’s a small hotel, so one person does a lot. Keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds demanding. So, a lot of responsibility and long hours on your feet. Besides the tiredness, are there any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. My knees bother me sometimes, getting up and down all day. And I get a little short of breath if I try to do anything too strenuous, like… running after my grandkids. But that’s about it, I think. I really haven't been to a doctor in ages.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, tiredness, knee discomfort, and some shortness of breath with exertion. And you haven't been to the doctor recently. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I mean, the divorce was… stressful, but I don't think that's a medical condition! Seriously though, no. I’ve always been pretty healthy, just… tired. They did check my blood pressure at the last job, said it was okay. That was… five, maybe six years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, blood pressure checked a few years ago and was normal. And what about any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. I’m lucky, I guess. I try to avoid doctors when I can. Makes me nervous, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Putney. Many people feel that way. Alright, and what about your family – are there any medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had… I think it was high blood pressure, towards the end of her life. And my father, he had some trouble with his heart, but he smoked a lot, so… I don't know if that counts. He passed away a long time ago. Nothing else that I can think of, really. My side of the family isn't very big.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your mother and heart trouble in your father, who was a smoker. Let’s talk about some of your habits. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Always hated it. Smelled awful. My father tried to get me to when I was younger, but I wouldn't have it. I tell you what, I'm glad I didn't. It ruined his health.
DOCTOR: Good for you, Mr. Putney. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a beer sometimes with dinner. Maybe a couple. Nothing crazy. I don’t drink to excess, if that makes sense. It's mostly just to relax after a long day.
DOCTOR: That sounds reasonable. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I figure, if I can get by without it, that's best. Just coffee to get me through the day, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney, that gives me a good starting point. No known medical conditions, no surgeries, a family history of high blood pressure and heart trouble, no smoking, occasional alcohol, and no medications. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Let's get it over with. I got things to do, but… I guess this is what you gotta do. Hopefully it doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won't take long. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That's a little elevated. Your heart sounds a little bit fast, but regular. Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your pulses are normal. Your reflexes are normal. I'd also like to check your weight and height, if that's alright.
PATIENT: Yeah, go ahead. I haven't weighed myself in… a while. Probably shouldn't have had that second piece of pie last night…
DOCTOR: You're 97 kilograms and 174 centimeters tall. That puts your BMI at 31.8, which is in the obese range. Okay, Mr. Putney, everything I'm finding today points toward some possible underlying issues. The elevated blood pressure, the fast heart rate, and the higher BMI are things we need to investigate further. It's unlikely the life insurance company will approve your policy until we address these. Would you be open to getting some blood work and an EKG to get a better understanding of what's going on?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? Look, I just need this life insurance thing done. I don’t want to start digging up problems that aren't there. Is this necessary? Can’t you just… sign off on it? I’m a busy man, Doctor. I really don't have time for all this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Putney, and I wouldn’t recommend these tests if they weren’t important. The life insurance company is going to require a certain level of medical clearance, and these results will likely be needed. More importantly, these tests aren't just for the insurance company—they're for your health. Elevated blood pressure can lead to serious problems down the line, like heart attack and stroke, and we want to rule those out or get them under control as soon as possible. The EKG will help us assess your heart function. I can write a note explaining why these tests are recommended, and hopefully, the insurance company will be understanding. But skipping them could lead to a denial of coverage, or worse, missing an important health issue. Would you like me to order the blood work and EKG?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, order the tests. But can we make it quick? I don’t want to be here all day. And… where do I go to get them done? Is it nearby?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll order the blood work and EKG right away. Here you are. You can get these done at the lab just across the street – it's called Coastal Medical Labs. They’re open until 5 PM today. The blood work will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and other important indicators. The EKG will record the electrical activity of your heart. It shouldn’t take more than 30-45 minutes at the lab. Once the results are back – typically within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Coastal Medical Labs, got it. 30-45 minutes… hopefully. Look, Doctor, just… try to keep this process as simple as possible, okay? I really appreciate it. I got a hotel to run, and… well, this is just another thing on the list. Is there anything else you need from me right now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Putney. I understand you're busy, and I'll do my best to make this as smooth as possible. Nothing else right now. Just head over to Coastal Medical Labs when you have a chance. I’ll have my staff call you when your results are in to schedule the follow-up appointment. Thank you for your patience, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions in the meantime. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thanks, Doctor. I’ll get those tests done. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Putney. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
