DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. I get really red, you see. Mostly in my face, but sometimes my neck too. It just happens. Been going on a little while now. Not sure what causes it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: "Flushing," alright. And how long exactly is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe six, seven months now? It started… after my wife, actually. It wasn’t right away, but then it just… started. Not every day, you understand. Some days I’m fine. Others… well, like today, a little bit.
DOCTOR: And is there anything that specifically seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. No, not really. I’ve tried to think. Eating… doesn’t seem to matter. Being outside… no. Getting upset… maybe? But not always. It’s just… random. Very strange. I drink tea, sometimes. Black tea. Could that be it? I don’t know much about what things do to you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Black tea… alright. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Let's start with a more thorough history. Besides the flushing, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes I feel a little… warm, when it happens. Not a fever, just… flushed warm. And maybe a little bit shaky. Not bad, just… like my hands are a little… loose. And I get… thirsty. Very thirsty. That’s about it, I think. No headaches, no dizziness, nothing else.
DOCTOR: And how would you describe your overall health, generally?
PATIENT: Well… I used to be very active. Walked a lot. Now… not so much. Since my wife… it’s hard to get motivated, you understand? I eat okay, I think. Not much red meat. Mostly vegetables and fish. I sleep alright, usually. No trouble sleeping. I get a little lonely, of course. But that’s just… life now. I try to keep busy. Read the newspaper. Watch TV. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to some medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox. But nothing serious. I used to go to a doctor, regularly. But that was before… I haven’t been in a long time. I don’t really like going to doctors, to be honest. It just reminds me… well, never mind. I’ve always been pretty healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But that was it. Just a simple break. They put it in a cast, and it healed fine. No big deal. Everything else… just the usual colds and flu. Nothing serious enough for a hospital, or surgery. I'm a simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father… he had some trouble with his heart, later in life. High blood pressure, I think. He was a very stressed man, always working. My mother… she was healthy, mostly. She lived to be a good age, but she had arthritis, in her hands. That’s about all I can remember, really. No cancer, no diabetes… not that I know of. It wasn’t something we talked about much, back then.
DOCTOR: And do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. I used to take something for my stomach, years ago, but I stopped. I prefer just to… deal with things. A little discomfort is part of life, you understand? I drink tea, as I said, but that’s it. Nothing else. I don’t really trust all those chemicals they put in medications.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she used to smoke, a little. But I always hated it. Smelled terrible, and it wasn’t good for her, of course. I always told her to quit, and she eventually did.
DOCTOR: And how often do you consume alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, not much. Very little, actually. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, once or twice a week. Nothing more. It helps me relax, sometimes. But I don’t need it. I could go without it easily. It’s just… a little treat, now and then. Nothing to worry about, Doctor. I'm not a drinker.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Just to check your vital signs and have a look at you. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I’m a bit of a… scaredy-cat, when it comes to doctors.
DOCTOR: Very good. I’ll try to be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is a bit fast… 88. Lungs are clear, but I can hear a slight murmur. Now, I’m going to examine your throat. Say "Ah." Throat looks normal. No redness or swelling. And finally, I’ll just feel your pulse in your wrists. Pulses are a little weak. Alright, that's all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Okay. That wasn't so bad. A little… fast, maybe. But not terrible. What did you find, Doctor? Is something wrong? My blood pressure is high? And what's a murmur? Is that bad? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and I did detect a heart murmur. A murmur isn’t necessarily a cause for immediate alarm, but it does warrant further investigation. It could be benign, or it could indicate an underlying issue with your heart valve. Your pulse is also a little weak, which could be related. Given your symptoms of flushing, coupled with these findings, I suspect we need to rule out a few possibilities. It could be something as simple as anxiety, or it could be something more concerning. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your overall health, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. I also want to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart rhythm. Finally, I recommend a referral to a cardiologist for an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart, to get a closer look at the valves and chambers. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds like… a lot. Blood tests… EKG… echocardiogram… cardiologist… Is it… serious, Doctor? Is something really wrong with my heart? I haven’t felt sick, exactly. Just… the flushing, and a little tired sometimes. Anxiety… well, maybe. After my wife… it’s been hard. How much will all this cost? I… I don’t have insurance, you see. It’s just me now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Withycombe, it's understandable to be concerned, and I want to assure you we are taking a cautious approach. The tests are to gather information, not necessarily to confirm a serious problem. However, ignoring these symptoms isn't the best course of action. The cost is a valid concern, and I acknowledge that being uninsured makes things difficult. I can direct you to the hospital's financial assistance program, and we can discuss options for reducing the burden. The blood tests will likely be the most affordable, and we can prioritize those first. The EKG is relatively inexpensive as well. The echocardiogram, performed by a cardiologist, will be the most significant expense. We can discuss alternatives, like a less comprehensive cardiac evaluation, if necessary. For now, let's focus on getting the blood tests scheduled. I'll provide you with a lab requisition and instructions. Then, we can discuss the EKG and cardiologist referral. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds better. Blood tests first. Okay. That I can do. A lab requisition… I’ll need to write that down. And instructions… good. I'm not good with remembering things, you see. Financial assistance… that would be good. Very good. Thank you, Doctor. You’re being very… kind. What kind of things will the blood tests check for, exactly? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to worry unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will give us a broad overview of your health. We’ll check your complete blood count, which looks at your red and white blood cells, and can help rule out infection or anemia. The basic metabolic panel checks your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. Finally, we’ll check your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause flushing. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once I have them, I’ll review them with you and discuss the next steps. It's important to remember that these are just preliminary tests, and we may need to order additional ones depending on the results. For now, I'll write down the lab's address and phone number for you. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately.
PATIENT: Okay. 24 to 48 hours. I can wait. Chest pain, shortness of breath… I’ll remember that. Emergency room… good. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little less worried now, knowing what’s going on. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any foods I should avoid, or activities I should limit?
DOCTOR: In the meantime, I recommend avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol, as these can sometimes trigger flushing. Maintaining a healthy diet and getting regular, moderate exercise is always a good idea. Most importantly, try to manage your stress levels. I know that's easier said than done, especially given your circumstances, but even small steps like taking a walk or practicing deep breathing can make a difference. Otherwise, just continue with your normal routine. There's no need to restrict any specific foods or activities unless you notice a clear connection between them and your symptoms. Here's the lab requisition again, and the number for the hospital's financial assistance department. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all. You’ve answered everything. Thank you again. I appreciate your kindness and patience. It’s… hard, going through this alone. But you’ve made me feel a little better. I’ll get the blood tests done as soon as I can. And I’ll call the hospital about financial assistance. I guess… I’ll see you in a few days, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Withycombe. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for approximately five days from now, to review the results. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any changes in your condition. And please remember, you're not alone in this. We'll work through this together. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. .
PATIENT: .
