DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Sorry... my English not so good. I… cough a lot. Long time already. And tired also. Feel weak. And my nose… always block, then runny. Get sick a lot, like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tati, that's perfectly alright. We can take things slowly. It sounds like you've been dealing with a cough, fatigue, and a stuffy or runny nose for a while now, and you've been getting sick frequently. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. When did this cough start?
PATIENT: Um… a long time. Maybe… six months? Or more? I not sure exactly. Work always dusty, you know? Tire shop. Maybe start then? I change tire, lots of dust. I forget the date, sorry. It just… start. And never really go away. Sometimes better, sometimes worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or more with a cough that comes and goes, and it seems to be worse when you're at work due to the dust. That's helpful information. And you mentioned fatigue and a runny/stuffy nose. Do you have any other symptoms along with these – like fever, body aches, shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes. Not high fever. Just feel warm. Body ache… yeah, sometimes also. When very tired. Shortness of breath… no. Not really. Chest pain… no. Never have chest pain. Just…tired all the time. And cough. And nose… always problem. Sorry, I don't know much more.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Tati. You're doing fine. So, to recap: you've had a cough for at least six months, with occasional fever and body aches, along with persistent fatigue and a stuffy/runny nose. You haven't experienced any chest pain or shortness of breath. Now, could you tell me a little bit about the cough itself?
PATIENT: A little bit? What you mean? It just… cough. Dry cough sometimes. Sometimes got… stuff coming out. Yellowish stuff. Sorry… not nice to talk about. But when I very sick, got lots of stuff. Mostly dry though. And at night… very bad. Cannot sleep. Wife also cannot sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tati. It’s not always easy to talk about these things, but it’s important information for me to understand what's going on. So, it's a dry cough mostly, but you do cough up yellow mucus when you're particularly sick. It's worse at night and keeps your wife awake. Do you notice anything that specifically makes the cough worse, besides being at work?
PATIENT: Um… cold air, maybe? When very cold, cough more. And… sometimes when I lie down. Like now, when I talk, maybe. And… dust, of course. Work dust. Also… sometimes when I eat something cold. Like ice water. Sorry, I don’t know if that important.
DOCTOR: Okay, so cold air, lying down, dust at work, and cold foods seem to trigger the cough. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I never go to hospital much. Just small clinic for fever. Never asthma… no. Bronchitis… don’t know what that is. Pneumonia… I think my father had that, long time ago. But me… no. Small clinic, just give me medicine for fever and cough. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no previous diagnoses of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia. You've only been to the clinic for fever and cough in the past and were treated with medication for those symptoms. Do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. Maybe… sometimes itchy skin, but I think it’s just the heat. Never serious allergy. Food… I eat everything. Never feel sick from food. Medicine… maybe a little bit dizzy sometimes after take medicine, but I think it okay. Sorry, I don't know much about allergies.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Tati. So, no known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else. You’ve occasionally experienced dizziness after taking medication, but nothing serious. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or children – with lung problems, asthma, or allergies?
PATIENT: Um… my father… he smoked a lot when he young. He cough a lot when he old. But I don’t think it asthma. Just smoker’s cough. My mother… she healthy. My sister… no problem. I have two children, they healthy also. No asthma… no allergies. I think that’s all. My family… mostly healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had a smoker’s cough, but no other family members with lung problems, asthma, or allergies. Finally, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What you mean? I work, you know? Tire shop. Very hard work. Long hours. I go home, eat, sleep. Sometimes watch TV with wife. Not much exercise. Mostly just… work. I don’t smoke. Never smoke. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe one or two beer sometimes, with friends. Sorry, not very exciting life.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Tati. It sounds like you work very hard. No smoking or excessive alcohol consumption, and you work long hours. Okay, thank you for that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your throat and ears, if that's okay with you. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please take a deep breath for me… and out… good. And again… deeper… and out… Okay… and now I’m going to listen to your back again. Say "Ahhh" for me… Alright. Your lungs sound a little wheezy, which could be from some inflammation in your airways. Your throat is slightly red, but nothing concerning. Your ears look clear. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing chronic bronchitis, possibly aggravated by your work environment. However, to be sure and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray? What for? Is… is it bad? Chronic… what you say? Bron…chitis? Is that serious? Work… is work causing this? I need work… I have family… How much cost X-ray? I not have insurance…
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s understandable to be concerned. An X-ray will help us see if there’s any inflammation or infection in your lungs, and rule out things like pneumonia or other problems. It’s a very common test and doesn’t involve a lot of radiation. Chronic bronchitis means long-term inflammation of the airways in your lungs, which can cause a persistent cough and mucus production. It can be serious if left untreated, but it’s often manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. It’s quite possible that your work environment is contributing to your symptoms, especially with the dust exposure. Regarding the cost, let me check with our billing department for the price of a chest X-ray without insurance. It looks like the cost of a chest X-ray is $250. We may also be able to help you explore options for financial assistance programs, if needed. Would you like me to provide you with information about those programs?
PATIENT: $250… That’s a lot of money. I… I don’t know. Maybe I can just try medicine? Like I always do? I really need to go back to work… can’t afford to be sick. But I don’t want to get worse… Financial assistance… what is that? Is that loan? I not want loan…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tati. It's a difficult situation. While we could try medication again, it's possible that without knowing the underlying cause, it may only provide temporary relief. And I agree, it’s best to know what we’re dealing with before it potentially gets worse. Financial assistance is not a loan. It’s a program that may help cover the cost of the X-ray based on your income. We have some options available through local charities and hospital programs. It doesn’t require you to pay anything back. Let me see if I can get you the information for those programs right now. In the meantime, I can also write you a prescription for a bronchodilator inhaler and a cough suppressant to help with your symptoms while we explore the financial assistance options and consider the X-ray. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Bron…di…lator? Inhaler? That’s like…puff puff? Like for asthma? Puff puff help me breathe easier? Okay… okay. If it not cost much… and it help me breathe… yes. And if the financial thing… not loan… I try that too. But I really need to go back to work soon. Wife worried… Thank you, Doctor. You very kind.
DOCTOR: Excellent. A bronchodilator inhaler is a puff you breathe in, yes. It helps open up your airways, making it easier to breathe, and it’s often used for asthma, but it can also help with symptoms of bronchitis. Let me write you a prescription for Albuterol, a common bronchodilator. You’ll use it as needed when you feel short of breath or have a cough. I’ll also write a prescription for a cough suppressant to help with the nighttime cough. Here are the prescriptions. You can take these to any pharmacy. And here’s the information about the financial assistance programs. I'll also have my nurse give you a handout about proper inhaler technique. It’s important to use it correctly to get the most benefit. Finally, please call the clinic in a week or so to let me know if the inhaler is helping and if you’ve been able to get the X-ray scheduled. And don't hesitate to call sooner if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Very much. You help me a lot. I go now… and try this medicine. And call about the money thing. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tati. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
