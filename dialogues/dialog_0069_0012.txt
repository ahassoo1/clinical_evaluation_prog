DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Andraca. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month – the 15th of September, to be precise – and the cruise line needs some… information from a doctor. Just to say I’m fit enough to travel, you see. I lost my husband a few years back and he always took care of these things. I’m not really sure what they need, precisely, but they mentioned a form.
DOCTOR: I see. That's perfectly alright, Ms. Squiers. It’s very common for cruise lines to require a physician’s note to ensure passenger safety, especially with travel involving potential limitations in immediate medical access. We can certainly get that sorted for you. Just to be thorough, and to make sure I can fill out the form accurately, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m generally quite well, thank you. I don’t get sick often. I do have a touch of… well, the doctor back home called it hypertension, years ago now. He put me on a small tablet for it, once a day. Losartan, I believe it was called. I’ve been taking it faithfully ever since. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains for a woman of my age, I suppose. I try to stay active, walking the dog most days. And I eat a sensible diet – mostly. Do you need to know about any operations I’ve had?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re generally well and staying active. Thank you for mentioning the hypertension and the Losartan. It’s very helpful to have that information. And yes, please, if you could tell me about any operations you’ve had, that would be great. Even if you don’t think they’re relevant, it’s good to have a complete picture. Also, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or latex?
PATIENT: Right then. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a girl, maybe ten years old. It was quite a bad one, I recall. And… oh, yes. About twenty years ago now, I had a hysterectomy. That was… routine, the doctor said. Nothing major. As for allergies… no, I don’t believe so. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat shellfish, I’ve tried it many times. And I've never had any trouble with plasters or anything like that. I am a bit sensitive to the cold, if that counts, but I don't think that's an allergy, is it? Just a bit… chilly.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and a hysterectomy twenty years ago. Good to know. And no known allergies, other than being a bit sensitive to the cold – we won’t worry about that for the form. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother lived to be eighty-seven, a good age. She had a bit of trouble with her heart towards the end, but nothing dramatic. My father was a strong man, worked on the farm all his life. He died suddenly from a… a stroke, I think it was. Maybe ten years ago now. On my husband’s side… his mother had arthritis, quite badly. And his brother… well, he had diabetes. Type 2, I believe. Does that help? I’m not sure how much detail you need, Doctor. I wasn’t ever very good at remembering all those things.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Squiers. Knowing about your mother's heart trouble, your father's stroke, and your husband's family history of arthritis and diabetes gives me a good sense of potential risks. Don't worry about being precise; just tell me what you recall. Now, I’d like to ask about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a bit when he was younger, but he gave it up years ago. As for alcohol… I might have a small glass of sherry with Christmas dinner, but that’s it. Certainly not regularly. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a very sensible woman, Doctor. I believe in moderation in all things. And a good cup of tea!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Squiers. A sensible lifestyle is very important. Now, before we proceed, could you please tell me your current height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Well, I haven't been weighed in a while, but I'm about five foot seven, I think. That's one hundred and seventy-one centimetres, if you prefer. As for weight… I was last weighed at the chemist’s a few months ago, and it was about ten stone nine pounds. That’s sixty-eight kilograms, I believe. I do fluctuate a little, of course. I’m not as light as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Squiers. That's very helpful. Now, to get a clearer picture of your current health, would you mind answering a few questions about how you’ve been feeling recently?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m happy to answer whatever you need. I'm feeling quite well, generally, but I’m happy to tell you anything. Just ask.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your heart. Have you noticed any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those at all. My heart feels perfectly fine. I get a little breathless walking uphill sometimes, but that’s just because I’m not as young as I used to be. And no swelling in my ankles or feet. I’ve never had any trouble with that. I do try to put my feet up when I can.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And what about your lungs?
PATIENT: Well, I don't smoke, as we discussed. I haven't had a cough in years. No wheezing, no shortness of breath at rest, and no pain when I breathe. Sometimes, in winter, I get a bit of a tickle in my throat, but that’s just the cold air, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your digestive system?
PATIENT: Oh, that's usually quite well behaved. No trouble with indigestion, constipation, or diarrhoea. I eat a sensible diet, mostly. Sometimes I get a bit of heartburn if I eat something spicy, but that doesn't happen often. And I haven't noticed any blood in my stool, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about your urinary system?
PATIENT: No problems there either, Doctor. No pain when I go to the toilet, no trouble starting or stopping, and no blood in my urine. I drink plenty of fluids, which helps, I think. I wouldn’t say I’m constantly needing to go, but it’s all very normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, how about your nervous system?
PATIENT: My nervous system? Oh dear. What do you mean? I haven’t got anything wrong with my nerves, I don’t think. I’m not clumsy or anything. My memory is… well, I’m getting older, as we’ve established. I sometimes forget where I put my glasses, but that’s not a medical problem, is it? No headaches, no dizziness, no tingling or numbness. I sleep quite well, generally. Is there anything specific you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Ms. Squiers. I was just checking for any major issues. It sounds like your nervous system is functioning well. So, to summarise, you're generally in good health with a history of hypertension managed with Losartan. You've had an appendectomy and a hysterectomy, no known allergies, and a sensible lifestyle. Now, before I complete the form, would you mind if I just listened to your heart and lungs and checked your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I’ve always liked listening to my heartbeat, it's reassuring. And checking my blood pressure is a good idea, I suppose. I haven't had it checked properly in a while.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/88, but not alarmingly so, considering your history of hypertension. We may want to discuss adjusting your medication if it remains consistently high. Now, do you have any other concerns or anything else you’d like to discuss before I complete the form?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to hear about my heart and lungs. I am glad it's all clear. And 148/88… is that bad, Doctor? I do try to keep active, as we said. Perhaps a little less salt would help? No, I don’t think there’s anything else. I'm mostly just anxious to get the form sorted for the cruise. I’m very much looking forward to it. A bit of sunshine and relaxation would do me good. I just want to make sure I’m fit enough to enjoy it.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Ms. Squiers. 148/88 is a little on the higher side, but not an immediate cause for alarm. Increasing your activity and reducing your salt intake are excellent steps to take. We can recheck your blood pressure in a few weeks if it remains elevated. Alright, I'm going to complete the form now, stating that you are fit for travel with a history of well-controlled hypertension. I'll include a recommendation to continue your Losartan as prescribed and to monitor your blood pressure regularly. Here you go. This should be sufficient for the cruise line. Do you have any questions about the form itself?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much. It all looks quite official. Yes, it says ‘fit for travel’… that’s reassuring. No, I don't think I have any questions. It seems very thorough. Thank you again for your time and for putting my mind at ease. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I feel much better now, knowing everything is in order.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if you experience any new or concerning symptoms before your cruise, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a wonderful time on your cruise! Enjoy the sunshine and relaxation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s quite alright. I think that’s everything. I’m all set now. Thank you again for everything. Goodbye!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. It was a pleasure meeting you. Enjoy your cruise, and have a safe trip. Goodbye!
