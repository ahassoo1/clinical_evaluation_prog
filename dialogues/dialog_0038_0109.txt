DOCTOR: Alright, good morning, Mitchell. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Neeraj Auelua. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… the back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for, oh… maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Feels like… a tight band. It’s a bad hurt, but not the worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight band across the back of your head, coming and going for about three days. That gives us a starting point. Can you tell me a bit more about the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… more when I… when I’m working. I work the rail yard, you know? Moving the cars… pushing them around. Lots of… shaking. And looking up a lot. Maybe that's it? It feels worse after a long day. But even when I’m resting, sometimes it comes back. Not so bad then, just… there.
DOCTOR: Right, the rail yard. That’s good to know – physical work and looking up a lot. So it’s aggravated by work, but also present even at rest. Does anything relieve the pain at all?
PATIENT: Relieve… let me think. … Sometimes, when my wife… when Elena… she would rub my neck. Back of my neck. That helped a little. But… she’s gone now. And it doesn't always work. A cool cloth, maybe? I forget. Old age, you know. It’s hard to remember. I take a little rest, and that helps some too.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about Elena, Mitchell. It sounds like you've been through a lot. And it’s perfectly normal for memory to be affected with time. So, neck rubs and rest offer some relief. Now, to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? … Not really. No. No blurry vision. No feeling sick. No… dizziness. Just the head hurting. Sometimes my neck feels stiff, but maybe that’s from the work. I don’t know. It's hard to tell what’s what these days. I sleep okay. Eat okay. Everything else is… normal. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes in vision, no nausea or vomiting, no dizziness. Neck stiffness is possible but hard to separate from your work. And your sleep and appetite are good, which is good to hear. Now, have you had headaches like this before, or is this new?
PATIENT: New, Doctor. Never felt anything like this before. I get little aches and pains, you know? Old age. But never this… tight band feeling. Not like this. It's… different. Always been healthy, mostly. A few colds when I was younger. But nothing serious. Elena always took care of me.
DOCTOR: Alright, a new headache pattern is important to note. And it sounds like you’ve generally been healthy. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you know if you've ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: High blood… pressure? I don’t think so. Elena always took me to the doctor, but… I don’t remember them saying anything about that. Diabetes…? No. I like sweet things, but she always made sure I didn’t have too much. Mostly, just the usual check-ups. Nothing serious ever came up. I don't have any papers, you know? They didn’t give me many papers back then. It was different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known history of high blood pressure or diabetes. That's helpful. And you said you haven't had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed any. Just a few stitches when I was a boy, falling off a tree. But that was a long time ago. Elena bandaged me up. She was good at that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries, just a few childhood stitches. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? Hmm. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. Died when I was young. But that was a long time ago. Mother lived a long life, very healthy. But I don’t know about headaches or anything like that. We didn't talk much about sickness. Just… lived our lives. It wasn’t a big thing to talk about family sickness back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems in your father, but your mother was healthy. And you said you're not sure about any family history of headaches?
PATIENT: That’s right. Not sure about headaches. No one ever talked about them. We just… worked. And lived. Now… … Is this headache something bad, Doctor? I’m a little worried.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re bringing this to my attention, Mitchell, and it’s perfectly normal to be worried. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, just a few more questions before I do a quick examination. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. Never really needed any. Just a little something for my arthritis sometimes, when it flares up, but I don't take it often. Just a little cream I rub on. Nothing for my head. I try to keep moving, you know? That helps the arthritis more than any pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a topical cream for arthritis as needed. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any. Elena always said I was a strong man. Didn’t get sick much, you know? Just… a few colds when I was a boy. But nothing serious. I ate everything. Never worried about allergies. Not like these days. Everything is allergies these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, just to check things out. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your neck and head. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mitchell. First, I'm just going to check your blood pressure. It may feel a little tight on your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, which can sometimes cause headaches. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound okay, a little quieter than they used to be, which is common with age. Now, I'm going to gently feel around your neck and head. Just let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Okay, I notice some tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull. It feels a little tight there. That could be contributing to your headache. Do you feel pain in that spot specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's it! Right there. When you push… that’s where it hurts. Not all the time, but… when you press. It feels… like a knot. Like a hard knot. And it gets worse when I'm working, you know? When I'm pushing those cars around. That's when it really hurts. It feels like… something is pulling there. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. It sounds like you're describing muscle tension and possible trigger points in the muscles at the base of your skull. It's very common to develop those with physical work and stress. Based on what you've told me, and the examination, I suspect this is a tension headache, likely aggravated by your work at the rail yard and possibly some underlying muscle strain. However, because your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and because this is a new headache pattern, I want to be cautious. I'm going to recommend a few things. First, I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. We can get you a simple monitor, or you can check it at a local pharmacy. We want to see what your blood pressure is doing throughout the day. Second, I'm going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen or naproxen, following the instructions on the label. Third, I want you to try some gentle stretching exercises for your neck and shoulders. I can give you a handout with some examples. And finally, I’m going to suggest limiting strenuous activity for a few days and getting plenty of rest. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Checking my blood pressure… that makes sense. And the pain relief… I can try that. Stretching exercises… yes. I need to move more anyway. And rest… I like working. But I can try to rest a little more. Will the blood pressure medicine help the headache, Doctor? Is it bad? Really bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. It’s good that you’re willing to try those things. Now, regarding your blood pressure - it's not necessarily "bad" right now, but it is higher than we'd like. It's a bit early to say if medication is needed. We need to see what your blood pressure readings are like over the next few days. If it stays consistently high, we may need to consider medication. The headache isn’t necessarily due to the blood pressure right now, but we need to rule out any connection. It’s most likely the muscle tension in your neck, but because your blood pressure is elevated, we need to be careful. I'm going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with the tension in your neck. It should help relieve some of the pain. I'll also give you a handout with the stretching exercises and instructions on how to monitor your blood pressure. I want you to follow up with me in one week to discuss your blood pressure readings and how you're feeling. If your headache gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms like blurry vision, dizziness, or weakness, please call my office immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That makes sense. Muscle relaxant… good. Check the blood pressure… yes. And come back in one week. If it gets worse, call you. I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I feel a little better now, knowing what it might be.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mitchell. I'm glad I could help. Remember, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Here are your prescriptions and the handouts. I’ll have the nurse come in and go over them with you as well. Take care of yourself, and try to get some rest. .
