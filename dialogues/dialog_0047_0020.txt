DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Benites. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a telehealth visit, yes? My back… it has been bothering me. Not so good for many weeks now. I work with cars, you see. It is… hard work.
DOCTOR: Telehealth, yes, though you are here in person today. Right. You work with cars...and your back has been bothering you for weeks. Can you tell me a bit more about how it’s bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to explain. It is… a dull ache, mostly. When I bend… or lift things… it is much worse. Sometimes, the pain goes down my leg a little. Not always, but… yes. It makes it difficult to do my job. I try to be careful, but… cars are heavy.
DOCTOR: “Dull ache,” alright. And it worsens with bending and lifting. Pain radiating down the leg… which leg, exactly?
PATIENT: The… right leg, Doctor. It is not… sharp pain. More like… a tiredness. A heavy feeling. It sometimes goes away if I sit for a long time, but… when I move, it comes back.
DOCTOR: Right leg. And it improves with sitting. Alright. Have you had any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Hmm… tingling… no, I don’t think so. Sometimes my foot feels… cold. But that is… maybe the shoes? I wear work boots all day. They are very sturdy, but… not so warm in the winter. I do not know if that is… the same thing.
DOCTOR: Cold foot… possibly related to the boots, yes. Do you have any issues with your bladder or bowel function?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… a private question, yes? I… no. Everything is normal there. I apologize, Doctor. That is… not comfortable to talk about.
DOCTOR: Quite alright. It’s a standard question, Mrs. Benites. We need to rule things out. Have you had any injuries to your back in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. Many years ago, when I was younger, I… lifted a very heavy engine. It hurt my back then, but… it went away. I thought it did. Maybe that is… the problem now? It is a long time ago, though. I do not remember exactly when.
DOCTOR: “Many years ago…” Alright. And you’ve never had any other back problems since then?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… the usual aches and pains from working. I am a mechanic, you see. It is hard on the body. But this… this is different. This lasts longer, and… it worries me. I do not want to stop working.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Mrs. Benites. Let's do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… okay. Is there… a sheet I should use?
DOCTOR: Yes, there’s a paper sheet there. Go ahead and lie flat on your back, please. I'm going to start by checking your range of motion and palpating your spine. Please let me know if anything causes you pain.
PATIENT: Okay. I will tell you if it hurts, Doctor. It might… be some discomfort, even when I try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just feeling along your spine now… Any pain here?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Right around here. When you… press there. Not a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a bruise, maybe.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is some tenderness here. And when I ask you to bend forward, can you tell me where you feel pain?
PATIENT: Okay. Right here… still. In my lower back. And… down my leg a little. Not very far, but… yes. It is worse when I bend all the way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when I lift your leg straight up like this…?
PATIENT: Ooh… that is… not good. Yes, there is pain. Down the back of my leg. Not so sharp, but… a pulling feeling. It is… uncomfortable. Please stop if it is too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. That’s enough. That gives me some information. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Please just relax your leg. Reflexes are normal on both sides. There doesn’t seem to be any significant weakness. It sounds like you have a muscle strain, likely aggravated by your work. It’s a very common problem.
PATIENT: A muscle strain… Is it… serious, Doctor? Will I need to… stop working? I do not want to stop working. I have bills to pay.
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Benites, it doesn't sound like anything serious, but you do need to take it seriously. Continuing to lift heavy objects and strain your back will only make it worse. I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and suggest you take over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen. The most important thing is to rest. Avoid heavy lifting for at least two weeks. If it doesn't improve, or if it gets worse, you'll need to see a specialist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Two weeks… no lifting… That is… difficult, Doctor. But… I understand. Rest… and medicine. And if it does not get better… a specialist. Will the medicine… make me sleepy? I need to be alert at work. Even if I am not lifting, I need to… think.
DOCTOR: The muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, yes. I'm prescribing a low dose, and you can take it at night before bed. If it makes you too sleepy, stop taking it. Ibuprofen shouldn’t have that effect. Here's your prescription. I also want you to try some gentle stretching exercises – I’ll have the nurse print you a handout with some simple ones. If there's no improvement in two weeks, I'll refer you to a physical therapist. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that is… everything. Stretching… medicine… rest. Thank you, Doctor. I hope it gets better soon. It is… hard to work when you are in pain.
DOCTOR: Very well. Try to take it easy, Mrs. Benites. And follow the instructions. The nurse will be in shortly with the stretching handout. .
PATIENT: .
