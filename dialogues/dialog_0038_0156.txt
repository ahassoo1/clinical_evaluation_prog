DOCTOR: Alright, Jase, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not good. Like, a lot of diarrhea. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just… persistent. I remember the doctor mentioning something about… something being wrong with how I absorb things, years ago? But I don’t really… remember exactly what it was. I just know it feels bad, and it keeps happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent diarrhea. That sounds unpleasant. And you mentioned something about a previous issue with absorption… that's helpful. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on now. First, roughly how long has this current episode of diarrhea been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, man… that’s a good question. Everything feels a bit… blurry, honestly. I think… maybe a couple of weeks? It comes and goes, but it’s always there, you know? Like, a few good days, then it's back. It’s hard to say for sure. It definitely feels longer than just a week, though. Definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of weeks with some fluctuations – that's useful. And when it is happening, how many times a day would you say you're going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Ugh… that varies too. Some days it’s like… five or six times. Other days… honestly, I lose count. Like, eight or more. It’s… embarrassing to talk about, sorry. But yeah, it's a lot. More than normal, definitely. And it's not just… watery, if you know what I mean. It’s… messy. And sometimes there’s… blood. Just a little, but it’s there. I noticed it a few times now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jase. Thank you for being so open. That's important information, and it's good you told me about the blood, even if it’s just a little. We need to figure out what’s going on. Just to clarify – is the blood bright red, or darker, almost black?
PATIENT: Oh, um… good question. I think… brighter. Yeah, definitely brighter red. Not dark at all. It’s not a lot, like I said, but it’s noticeable. And… it sometimes happens after I eat? I think? I'm really bad at remembering what I ate when it happens, but I feel like it's more likely after a meal. I just... my memory isn't the greatest.
DOCTOR: Okay, brighter red blood, and potentially linked to meals… that’s helpful. And you’re right, it’s okay if you don’t remember perfectly – we’ll piece things together. Now, thinking about the rest of your body – any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, actually. Sometimes I feel really tired. Like, really tired, even after sleeping. And… yeah, I get stomach cramps. Not like, stabbing pain, but just… achy. And maybe a little nauseous sometimes, but I haven't actually thrown up. No fever, I don't think. I haven't checked, to be honest. Just tired and achy, mostly. Oh! And I’ve lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, abdominal cramps, nausea, and some weight loss. That's a lot of symptoms. And the weight loss is something we need to pay attention to. Let’s talk about what you’ve been eating and drinking lately. Has there been any change in your diet?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I eat pretty much the same things all the time. Mostly… Pakistani food, you know? Rice, curry, vegetables… I haven’t really changed anything. Maybe I’ve been drinking more water because of… everything? But that's about it. I haven't been traveling or eating anything unusual. My husband cooks most of the time, and he makes the same dishes. He hasn't changed anything either. I honestly don’t think it's the food.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent diet, no recent travel… that’s good to know. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… like I mentioned before, the doctor said something about my gut a few years ago. Something about not absorbing things properly? I think it was… celiac? Or Crohn’s? I honestly don't remember exactly what he said, and I never really followed up on it. It wasn't that bad back then, and I just… kind of ignored it. I'm on Medicare, if that's relevant. And I’m married, if you needed to know that. I'm not sure what else… honestly, I don't really get sick much. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible celiac or Crohn’s in the past, which is very relevant. And you're on Medicare. That's good information. Now, any family history of digestive problems, like inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Um… good question. My mum… she had stomach problems sometimes. Like, really bad cramps and… things. But she never really went to the doctor, you know? Just… took some medicine and waited it out. And my dad… he was always pretty healthy. No, I don’t think anyone else in the family had anything like this. It’s mostly just my mum, and she never really got it checked properly. It’s hard to say for sure, honestly. Everyone keeps things to themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of unspecified stomach problems on your mother’s side. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. Just… sometimes I take paracetamol for headaches. But that’s it. I don’t take anything regularly. I don't really like taking pills, if that makes sense. Nothing for my stomach, nothing for anything else. My husband sometimes gives me ginger tea when I'm feeling sick, but that’s not really a medication, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional paracetamol, no regular medications. Right. Thank you, Jase. That’s a lot of helpful information. It looks like you were investigated for possible celiac disease about five years ago, and the results were inconclusive. There were some slightly elevated antibody levels, but nothing definitive. I’d like to do a physical exam now, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your abdomen, and feel your stomach to check for tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, you know? Listening to my stomach sounds… okay. I’m a bit worried, to be honest. Is it something serious? I’m just… I keep having this feeling that something’s really wrong. But please, go ahead. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jase, I understand your worry, and it's good you're expressing it. We’ll try to figure out what’s going on. First, let’s listen to your abdomen. Could you lie down on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Is there anything specific I need to do? Like, breathe a certain way? I’m just… I always get a bit anxious at the doctor’s. I hope this doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just relax and breathe normally. I’m just listening for any unusual sounds. Okay, sounds are a bit… active, but nothing particularly concerning at this stage. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for tenderness. I'll start on your right side. Tell me if you feel any pain at all. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Um… a little bit. Not like, sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Just a dull ache, really. It’s… worse when you press a bit harder. It’s mostly on my… right side, yeah. And a bit lower down. Not really high up. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not awful, but it’s definitely not comfortable. Sorry, I'm probably not very helpful. I just… get anxious and everything feels weird.
DOCTOR: That's okay, Jase, you're being very helpful. It’s good you’re telling me what you’re feeling. A little tenderness in the right lower quadrant is noted. Now I’m going to check for rebound tenderness, which means I press down and then quickly release. Tell me if that causes any pain. Any pain when I quickly release the pressure?
PATIENT: Ooh… yeah! That did hurt a little bit. Not awful, but… definitely more painful when you let go. It’s… like a quick sharp pain, but it goes away pretty quickly. It wasn't like that when you were just pressing, it's only when you release it. That's… worrying, isn't it? I’m starting to get a bit scared now. Please tell me it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jase, I understand your concern. Rebound tenderness can be a sign of inflammation. It's not necessarily serious, but it does warrant further investigation. I'm not feeling any significant rigidity or guarding, which is good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs just to get a complete picture. Could you sit up for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Is everything okay? You seem a bit… serious now. What do you think it could be? I'm really worried. Should I be getting a scan or something? My husband’s going to be really worried too. He always gets really anxious when I'm sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jase, it’s good you’re asking questions. I'm being thorough, that’s all. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Based on what you've told me, and the tenderness in your right lower quadrant, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be a flare-up of something related to your previous investigation for celiac disease, but it could also be something else, like an infection. Given the rebound tenderness and your symptoms, I think we need to order some blood tests and a scan to get a clearer picture. The scan will likely be a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood tests will help us look for signs of inflammation and infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A scan? A CT scan… is that… is that safe? I’ve heard things about radiation. And what if it's something really bad? I don't want to know if it's something horrible. But I also want to feel better, and you said it would help, right? I… yes, okay. I guess I have to get the scan. But please… be gentle. And explain everything clearly. I get really anxious, and I don’t understand medical terms. And what about Medicare? Will it cover everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, Jase. It's perfectly reasonable to be anxious about a scan, and I'm happy to answer all your questions. A CT scan does use a small amount of radiation, but it’s a very low dose, and the benefits of finding out what’s going on outweigh the risks in this case. We’ll minimize the dose as much as possible. As for what we're looking for… we’re trying to see if there’s any inflammation in your bowel, or any other abnormalities that might be causing your symptoms. We're not assuming it's something horrible, we're just being thorough. And yes, Medicare should cover the scan and blood tests, but we'll double-check with them to be sure. I'll have my assistant arrange everything for you. I’m going to order the blood tests now. It will be a routine blood draw, and the lab is just down the hall. Once those are done, we’ll schedule the CT scan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah. Routine blood draw… that sounds… manageable. Just down the hall, right? Not too far? I don’t like needles, but… it’s okay. I’ll do it. Please… just be gentle with the needles. And explain everything clearly. And make sure Medicare will cover it. I don't want any surprise bills. Thank you… thank you for being patient. I'm just… really scared. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jase, you’re doing great. I understand you’re scared, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. My assistant, Sarah, is just outside. She'll take you down to the lab and explain everything to the phlebotomist. I’ll also make a note on your chart requesting a gentle approach. I’ve already started the paperwork for Medicare authorization, and we’ll double-check everything before proceeding with the scan. Let me just quickly summarize what we’ve discussed and create a care plan for you. Alright, here’s the plan: Blood tests to check for inflammation and infection, followed by a CT scan of the abdomen. We’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah. That sounds… alright. Blood tests, then the scan. Review the results… and then? What if it’s something bad? What if I need surgery? But… yes. That’s the plan. Thank you. Please… just take care of me. And please… be gentle. I’m really scared. Maybe I should call my husband… He’s probably worrying too.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jase, it's perfectly natural to worry about the worst-case scenario, but let’s focus on getting the tests done first. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, and I will be with you every step of the way. If it turns out you need surgery, we'll discuss all your options in detail and make sure you're comfortable with the plan. And yes, absolutely call your husband. He should be there to support you. Sarah can help you with that if you like. Right, Sarah! Could you come in here for a moment, please?
