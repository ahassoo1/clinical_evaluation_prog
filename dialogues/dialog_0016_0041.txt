DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, to be honest… I’ve been feeling weaker. It’s been happening slowly, you understand? Not all at once, but little by little. It’s… difficult to explain. The muscles, they just don’t seem to work like they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "Slowly, little by little" is a really helpful way to describe it. It’s good you’re noticing these changes and coming in to get it checked out. Can you tell me more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I try to pay attention. It’s mostly in my legs, I think. Walking feels… harder. Not painful, just… takes more effort. And sometimes, my hands feel clumsy. Like I can’t hold things as tight as I used to. My wife, Leilani, she’s noticed it too. She says my grip isn’t as strong when we garden.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, and it’s good Leilani has noticed too. Weakness in both your legs and hands… has this been happening at the same time, or did it start in one area and spread to the other?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think it started in my legs, maybe six months ago? Not too bad at first, just a little tired feeling after a long walk. But the hands… that started more recently, maybe three months ago? It's hard to be sure, Doctor. Time… it goes so quickly these days.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, time does fly. So, about six months for the legs, three months for the hands… And has this weakness been getting progressively worse since it started, or does it fluctuate—better some days, worse on others?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly worse on some days. Like when it’s very hot, or if I don’t get enough sleep. Then, walking is really hard. And my hands feel shaky. But other days, it’s not so bad. I can still do my gardening, just… slower. Leilani helps a lot. She says I try to push myself too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heat and lack of sleep seem to be triggers, and it's definitely worse on those days. And it sounds like it's impacting your daily activities, even with Leilani's help. Now, besides the weakness and shakiness, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, now that you mention it, sometimes my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, but when I’m really tired. And… oh! Sometimes I feel numb, like pins and needles, in my feet. It comes and goes. It’s… uncomfortable, but not painful, usually. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's definitely important to know. Blurry vision and numbness in your feet… those details can be very helpful. Can you describe the blurry vision a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like everything is a blur all the time. It's more… spots, sometimes. Like looking through wavy glass. And it usually happens when I’m looking at something far away. It goes away if I rest my eyes, usually. It’s… hard to explain. I haven’t been to the eye doctor in a long time, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, spots and waviness when looking at distance, and improves with rest. Thank you for describing it so clearly. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty healthy, actually. A little arthritis in my knees, but that’s just from working too hard when I was younger. I see my regular doctor, Dr. Kamana, for check-ups, but he hasn’t told me about anything serious. I have Medicare, so they usually catch things if there’s a problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never had any surgeries. Not even as a young man. And I haven’t been in the hospital, not really. Just a few times when I was a boy, with the flu, but nothing major. My wife, Leilani, she’s had her share, but I’ve always been lucky.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a hard one. My mother, she had some trouble with her memory when she got older. Not sure what it was, just… forgetting things. And my brother, he had something with his nerves, I think. He had to use a cane for a while. But other than that, not that I remember. My family, we're a strong people. We don't usually get sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, some memory issues with your mother and nerve problems with your brother. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I know of. I can take most medicines without any trouble. Sometimes, if I eat too much shellfish, my stomach gets upset, but that’s not a real allergy, just… sensitivity. I’ve never had a reaction to any of the medicines Dr. Kamana has given me.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of ibuprofen for my knees sometimes, when they're acting up. And a vitamin D supplement, Dr. Kamana told me to take it because I don't get out in the sun much anymore. Other than that, nothing. I prefer to keep things natural, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for your knees and vitamin D. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also test your reflexes, strength, and balance. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I haven't been feeling quite myself lately, so I'm happy to let you take a look.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit here for me, please. Okay, Mr. Astores, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing too concerning right now. Your reflexes are normal, but your strength in your feet is a little weak, and your balance is a bit unsteady. I'm also noting some decreased sensation in your feet. Do you notice that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have been noticing that. It's like… a tingling feeling, sometimes, and my feet feel numb. Like you said, decreased sensation. It's worse at night, usually. I thought it was just old age, but maybe it's more serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know you've been noticing that as well. Now, I want to order a few lab tests to help us figure out what's going on. We’ll check your blood sugar, kidney function, vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid function. We’ll also do a complete blood count to look for any signs of inflammation or infection. Finally, I'd like to order a nerve conduction study to assess the function of your nerves. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what's happening, and what we can do about it. Nerve… conduction study? Is that going to be uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be a little worried about the nerve conduction study. It involves placing small electrodes on your skin to measure the electrical activity of your nerves. You might feel a brief, mild sensation, like a tiny electric shock, but it shouldn't be painful. It takes about 30-60 minutes. We’ll also want to review any recent imaging, if you’ve had any. Do you happen to know if Dr. Kamana has ordered any X-rays or scans recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Dr. Kamana hasn't ordered any X-rays or scans recently. I saw him a few months ago for my annual check-up, and he said everything looked normal then. Just the usual… blood pressure check, cholesterol, that sort of thing. Nothing about my legs or hands.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, we'll proceed with the lab tests and the nerve conduction study. While we are waiting for those results, I would like to recommend some physical therapy to help with your weakness and balance. It can also help with the tingling sensation in your feet. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Physical therapy sounds good. I’ve always believed in staying active. If it can help my legs and hands, I’m willing to try it. I used to be quite the athlete, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear! I'll write you a referral for physical therapy today. In the meantime, please try to avoid any strenuous activities that might worsen your symptoms. Also, watch your step and be careful not to fall. Based on your symptoms and initial examination, I'm concerned about possible peripheral neuropathy. It’s a condition that affects the nerves outside of your brain and spinal cord, and it can cause weakness, numbness, and tingling in the extremities. The lab tests and nerve conduction study will help us confirm this diagnosis and determine the underlying cause. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes some sense. Peripheral… neuropathy. I’ve never heard of it, but if that’s what it is, I’m glad we’re trying to find out. So, the tests will help us figure out why it’s happening? And then we can do something about it?
DOCTOR: Exactly. The tests will help us pinpoint the cause. It could be due to a number of things - diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, even certain medications. Once we know the cause, we can start appropriate treatment. Treatment options vary depending on the cause, but may include medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. I'll have the lab orders and the physical therapy referral sent to your pharmacy and the PT clinic. The nurse will also go over some fall prevention tips with you before you leave. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure out what’s going on. I’ll get the tests done as soon as possible. Fall prevention tips sound good too. Leilani would be happy to hear about that.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. I'm glad I could help. I’ll review the results as soon as they become available and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you. If your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here’s a summary of our plan: 1. Complete blood work as ordered. 2. Undergo a nerve conduction study. 3. Start physical therapy. 4. Follow up with me once results are available. Do you have any other concerns before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds good. You’ve covered everything. I feel much better knowing there’s a plan. Thank you again for your kindness and patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astores. I’m happy to help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and please be careful.
