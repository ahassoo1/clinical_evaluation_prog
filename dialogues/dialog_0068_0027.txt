DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I’m Dr. Sham. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get this over with. It’s my stomach. Food just… comes back up, you know? Especially when I lie down. It’s quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. “Food comes back up,” especially when lying down. Okay. How long has this been going on, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Months, certainly. Maybe… six months? It comes and goes, but it’s been more frequent lately, which is why I bothered coming in. I don't usually complain about things. It's probably just something I ate.
DOCTOR: Six months, intermittent, worsening recently. And you think it’s related to what you eat?
PATIENT: Well, obviously. Everything is related to what you eat, isn't it? Though, I do try to eat sensible things. Not like these youngsters these days. Still, it happens with perfectly good food sometimes. Roast chicken, even. You'd think roast chicken would stay down.
DOCTOR: Roast chicken… alright. Is there any particular time of day it’s worse?
PATIENT: Definitely after dinner. If I eat a decent meal – and I do enjoy a good meal, mind you – and then try to relax… that's when it happens. Lying down, watching the news... it's awful. I have to sit bolt upright again. It’s terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: After dinner, when lying down. Any heartburn or indigestion with the… regurgitation?
PATIENT: Heartburn? Sometimes, I suppose. A bit of a burning feeling, yes. Not terrible, but noticeable. It's not the main problem, though. The food coming back up is far more unpleasant than a little bit of burning. Honestly, it's just… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heartburn sometimes, but the regurgitation is the primary concern. Any nausea or vomiting besides the regurgitation?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Just the… coming back up. It's not like I'm emptying my stomach, if that makes sense. Just a bit of food. And it tastes… well, it tastes like whatever I ate, naturally. It’s not pleasant, but it's not like I'm sick. Just… annoying. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. No true vomiting, just regurgitation. And no other symptoms alongside it, like weight loss or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Good heavens, no! I eat very well, as I said. And swallowing? Perfectly fine, thank you very much. I haven’t had any trouble with that. Really, doctor, I just want to know why my food keeps coming back up. Is it something serious? Because I haven’t got time for serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no weight loss, no difficulty swallowing. Let’s do a quick exam, Mr. Altine. Just listening to your stomach and feeling around. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. The sooner I know if it’s something serious, the better. Don't poke around too much, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Breathing deeply… good. No tenderness to the touch that's alarming. Bowel sounds are present. Seems relatively normal on initial exam. I’d like to check your weight, if you don’t mind. Just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Honestly? I told you, I eat well. But fine, get it over with. Just don't take too long. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: 51 kilograms… and your height is listed as 197 centimeters. That gives you a BMI of… 13.2. That is quite low, Mr. Altine. Are you intentionally losing weight?
PATIENT: What?! 51 kilograms? That’s… ridiculous. I haven’t weighed myself in ages. And no, I am not intentionally losing weight! I eat a perfectly reasonable amount. This is preposterous. Is your scale even working correctly?
DOCTOR: The scale appears to be calibrated correctly. And I see in your record here that you haven't had a full physical in quite some time. This weight is significantly lower than it should be for your height. It’s concerning, Mr. Altine, and it could be contributing to your symptoms. We need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: Investigate what? Look, I came here about food coming back up, not about my weight! I’m a perfectly healthy man. Well, apart from the food, obviously. But I’m not wasting my time with a full investigation. I’m telling you, this is unnecessary. I want something for the food. Something to make it stop. Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I understand your frustration. However, I am obligated to address any significant health concerns, and this weight loss is a significant concern. I can prescribe you a medication to help with the regurgitation, a proton pump inhibitor, but it’s just masking a potential underlying problem. I strongly recommend some blood work to rule out any other issues, and potentially a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. We can’t simply ignore this.
PATIENT: Look, I'm not ignoring anything! I’m ignoring you telling me I’m wasting away! I eat perfectly well. Just give me the pills. The pills will solve the problem, and then I can be on my way. I haven't got time for blood work and specialists. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Just write me a prescription. Now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. I will write you a prescription for omeprazole, 20mg daily, to be taken before breakfast. However, I must document that you declined further investigation despite my strong recommendation. And I strongly urge you to reconsider. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience any other issues - weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain – please see me immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get the prescription written. I understand. And I’ll… think about it. But don’t expect me to be back anytime soon. Now, where is this prescription? I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: Here you are. And again, please don’t hesitate to reach out if things don’t improve, or if anything else arises. Have a good day, Mr. Altine. .
