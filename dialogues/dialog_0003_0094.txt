DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm Dr. Yackey. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Morning. I... think it's something about learning stuff? My husband said I need to come. He worries too much. I don't really feel sick.
DOCTOR: Learning… I see. Your husband is concerned about a potential… cognitive issue?
PATIENT: Cogni… what now? Look, I work with metal all day. It's hot, it's loud. Sometimes I forget where I put my tools, okay? Doesn’t mean I need a doctor. Is this gonna cost a lot of money? I don’t have insurance.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, it's not simply about forgetting tools. Memory lapses can be indicative of underlying issues. And yes, the cost is a factor, which is why I need to determine if a thorough evaluation is actually necessary. Let's start with a simple question. Has this forgetfulness been…recent?
PATIENT: Recent...? Ugh. Everything feels recent. I mean, last week I… I think I made noodles? Or was that two weeks ago? My husband makes a good noodle. He always remembers. It's...hard to say. I don't really try to remember dates, you know? Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Fontanazza. Significant memory difficulties, especially if new or rapidly progressing, require investigation. And frankly, your husband bringing you in suggests a degree of concern that shouldn’t be dismissed. Now, beyond the noodles... can you recall any specific instances where your forgetfulness caused a problem?
PATIENT: Problem... hmm. Well, last month I... I almost used the wrong metal for a job. It was a big sheet. My boss was not happy. But I fixed it, okay? I always fix it. I just...grabbed the wrong one from the pile. It all looks the same sometimes, especially when it's hot. Is that what you mean? A problem?
DOCTOR: So, a mistake at work. And you corrected it. Alright. Let's move on. Have you noticed any difficulty with tasks you previously found easy?
PATIENT: Tasks? Like...cooking? No. I can cook. Like I said, my husband makes good noodles, but I can cook rice. And…and I can fold laundry. Everything takes a little longer, maybe. But who times laundry? Honestly. It's not like I'm doing brain surgery or something. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I understand your frustration, but it's important to gather a complete history. Now, let's explore other areas. Do you find yourself getting lost easily, even in familiar places?
PATIENT: Lost…? No. Not lost. Sometimes I take a… a different route home. You know, just to look at the shops. There's a new bubble tea place I wanted to see. But I always get home. Eventually. My husband sometimes complains I take too long, but he just likes to nag. It's a habit with him. This is… wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about simple conversations?
PATIENT: Conversations? What do you mean? I’m talking to you right now, aren't I? Sometimes I… I forget what I was going to say mid-sentence. But everyone does that. It’s…old age, probably. I’m thirty-three! Not exactly a baby anymore. Is this going to be a long appointment? I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, your responses are…unhelpful. However, given your age and the concerns expressed by your husband, a basic neurological assessment is warranted. I'll conduct a brief cognitive exam to assess your memory and other mental functions. It will take approximately fifteen minutes. And frankly, it would be irresponsible of me not to.
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. But if it's too hard, I'm leaving. I have important things to do. And don't expect me to remember any silly shapes or colors. I work with metal, not kindergarten toys. Hurry it up, then. I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit here. I'm going to ask you a series of questions. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Huh? Today’s… date? Is it…August? I think it’s August. The second? Or maybe the third? My husband handles the calendar. It’s always August when it’s hot. Can we just skip this? It’s stressful!
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Words? What words? Just get on with it. This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Apple. Table. Penny. Remember those. Now, I'm going to ask you a question unrelated to those words. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Ugh. Year? Look, I told you, I don’t keep track of dates! Is it…two thousand twenty-five? Is that right? My husband keeps saying it's the future. Is he right? Now can I go? I have a very long day tomorrow, and I need to be rested. Apple, table, penny… honestly. What is this, a test for children?
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I asked you to repeat the three words. Apple. Table. Penny. Can you do that for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine! Apple...table...and... um... Something shiny? Is that it? A penny! It was a penny! See? I remember! Now, are we done? This is so unnecessary! I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, given your performance on this brief assessment, and your husband’s concerns, I recommend a comprehensive neurological evaluation. I’m referring you to Dr. Chen, a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders. He’s located at City Hospital, and I’ll have my assistant schedule an appointment for you. I'll also order a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms. Here is the contact information and appointment request form. It is important that you follow up with Dr. Chen as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: A neurologist? What for?! This is ridiculous! I told you, I'm fine! I work with metal! I don’t need a fancy doctor poking around my brain! This is a waste of money, and now you're wasting my time. Fine. Whatever. I’ll tell my husband. But don't expect me to be happy about it. No. Nothing else. I’m leaving now. .
