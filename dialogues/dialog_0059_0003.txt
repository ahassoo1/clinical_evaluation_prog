DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, I haven’t got all day. It’s my hand. It shakes. Been shaking for… well, a while now. Doesn’t really bother me much, but my daughter insisted I get it checked. She worries too much, that one. Just want to know what’s causing it and if it’s gonna get worse, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I understand you’d like to get to the bottom of this hand tremor. It’s good of your daughter to encourage you to seek medical attention – it’s always best to investigate these things. “A while now” is a bit vague, though – could you give me a rough estimate of how long you've noticed the shaking?
PATIENT: Rough estimate? Honestly, I dunno. Months, maybe? Years? It comes and goes, see? Sometimes it's barely noticeable, other times… well, like now, a little bit. I mostly notice it when I’m trying to… hold something steady. Like a fork. Or a glass. Doesn’t happen all the time, though. Look, is this important? Can’t we just skip to figuring out what it is? I haven’t got time for a history lesson on my own hand.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I assure you I’m not trying to waste your time. However, to understand what is causing the shaking, a little bit of history is important. It helps me narrow down the possibilities. Knowing when it started, and how it’s changed over time, is very useful. Since “months, maybe years” is difficult to pinpoint, let’s try this. Has the shaking gotten progressively worse over that time, stayed about the same, or has it fluctuated without a clear trend?
PATIENT: Fluctuated, definitely fluctuated. Some days it's nothing, I barely feel a thing. Other days, like today, it's… annoying. It’s not painful, mind you. Just… shaky. And it seems worse when I’m tired, maybe? Or stressed. Though, who isn't stressed these days? Look, I used to have steady hands. I was a director, you know. Needed ‘em for framing shots, holding equipment… all that. This is… new. And unwelcome. Now, are we getting anywhere? Or are we just going in circles?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere, Mr. Baide. That’s very helpful information. The fluctuation and the association with tiredness and stress are important clues. It’s good to know you previously had steady hands as well – that provides a baseline for comparison. Now, has this shaking been limited to your hands, or have you noticed any tremors in other parts of your body – legs, head, or anything else?
PATIENT: Just my hands. Definitely just my hands. Never noticed it anywhere else. I'd know if it was somewhere else, wouldn't I? I pay attention to these things. I used to direct actors, you gotta be observant. No, just the hands. And sometimes, it feels… a little stiff, you know? Not painful stiff, just… not as fluid as they used to be. Like a little bit of resistance. Is that important? Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit silly talking about my hands. It's just a tremor. People get tremors.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all to discuss this, Mr. Baide. Your observations are very helpful, and the stiffness you describe is another piece of the puzzle. Okay, let’s move on to other medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yeah. The doctor told me years ago. Something about salt, I think. I try to watch it, but… well, Italian food, you know? Lots of flavor. Other than that… no, not really. Nothing major. I had a bad knee once, years ago, playing football, but that’s fixed now. And I take something for… cholesterol, maybe? Honestly, I get all these pills mixed up. My daughter handles most of that. She’s very organized. Now, is this gonna be a long list? I really need to get going. I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and possible cholesterol medication are good to know. We can sort out the specifics of your medications later. No need to worry about that right now. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than your knee?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, I don’t think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And… I was in the hospital for a few days once with a bad case of pneumonia. That was… oh, must have been twenty years ago. Other than that, no. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. I always ate good food, kept busy… still do, mostly. Though, this tremor is a bit of a nuisance. It’s starting to make me self-conscious. You know, when I used to direct, I had to project confidence. This doesn't exactly help with that.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and pneumonia long ago. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have similar tremors or any neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease?
PATIENT: Parkinson's… now there’s a name I recognize. My mother, God rest her soul, she developed something… similar, towards the end. Not a diagnosis, exactly, but she got… shaky. Real bad. Couldn’t hold a cup of tea without spilling it. That was… upsetting. My father, he was always strong as an ox, never had a problem. And my sister… she's always been healthy, thankfully. She lives in California, doesn't worry much about these things. Now, are we getting anywhere? I'm starting to feel a bit lightheaded. Is this room warm in here?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere, Mr. Baide, and I apologize if the room feels warm. I can adjust the temperature. The information about your mother is very important. A family history of tremor significantly narrows down the possibilities. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, let’s quickly go over your allergies and current medications. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I eat everything. Italian food, you know? Garlic, tomatoes, shellfish… everything. Never had a problem. As for medications… honestly, I told you, I get them mixed up. I take a pill for blood pressure, something for cholesterol, maybe something for… arthritis? My daughter keeps track of all that. She brings me the pills every morning, tells me what to take. I just swallow them. Now, can we please get this over with? I'm starting to feel really uncomfortable. This talking is… tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies and medication list managed by your daughter. We'll clarify those specifics later if needed. Now, Mr. Baide, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your reflexes, strength, coordination, and looking more closely at your hands. It will help me assess the nature of the tremor and rule out other possible causes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. Just… be quick about it, alright? I have a lunch appointment. And honestly, I don’t like being poked and prodded. It reminds me of when I was a kid and the doctor gave me shots. A terrible experience. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s just check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There. Happy? Now can we get this over with? It’s embarrassing, you know, having my hands examined like this. It feels… vulnerable. I used to be a director, in control of everything. Now I'm just… shaking. It’s ridiculous. Just… look at them and tell me what’s wrong, alright? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see a tremor present in both hands, more prominent at rest. There's also a slight degree of rigidity. Now, I’m going to ask you to perform a few simple tasks – touch your nose with your finger, then tap your thumb against each of your fingers. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Awful. It feels… clumsy. Like I’ve lost control of my own hands. I used to be able to do these things without even thinking. Now I’m fumbling around like an old man. It’s… frustrating. And embarrassing, as I said before. Look, can you just tell me what’s wrong? Is it serious? Am I going to… fall apart? This is really upsetting me, you know. I’m not used to feeling this… helpless. Just tell me, alright? No more tests.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Based on the examination, the tremor and rigidity, along with your family history and the response to the tests, it is most likely that you are experiencing essential tremor, possibly with some elements of Parkinsonism. Now, please understand that this is a preliminary assessment, and further investigation is needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes. However, essential tremor is a common condition, and while it can be bothersome, it is typically not life-threatening. The elements of Parkinsonism suggest that we should consider other causes of your symptoms. The symptoms of Parkinson’s disease often develop slowly over time. We need to determine whether your symptoms are consistent with early Parkinson’s disease, or another neurological condition. We'll need some further testing to be sure. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s… like that… boxer? The one who shook? God, no. No, that can’t be right. I feel… fine, mostly. Just a little shaky. Essential tremor… what does that even mean? Is it… serious? Am I going to… end up like my mother? Unable to hold a cup of tea? Further testing… what kind of testing? More poking and prodding? What if it is Parkinson’s? What if I… lose control of my body? This is awful. Absolutely awful. I should have just stayed home. I should have ignored my daughter’s nagging. Tell me… what does further testing involve? And… what are the options? Is there anything I can do about it? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, let’s take this one step at a time. Essential tremor is a neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, typically in the hands and arms. It can be genetic, meaning it can run in families, and it often worsens with age. It’s not life-threatening, but it can certainly be disruptive. To determine the extent of your tremor and rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a few tests. This will include a neurological examination, which is a more detailed assessment of your reflexes, strength, coordination, balance, and cognitive function. We'll also order blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Lastly, I think an MRI of the brain would be helpful to get a clearer picture of your brain structure. If it turns out to be Parkinson’s disease, we can explore several treatment options, including medication to manage the symptoms, physical therapy to improve your strength and coordination, and lifestyle modifications to help you cope with the condition. There are also new and promising treatments under development, so there is reason for optimism. Do you understand?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… serious. And medication… I don’t like taking medication. I always worry about side effects. And physical therapy… I’m not very good at exercise. Lifestyle modifications… what does that even mean? Stop drinking espresso? Stop eating pasta? My life is pasta! So… you don’t know for sure yet? It could be… anything? And… how long is all this going to take? I have a lunch appointment, you know. And a dinner party next week. I can’t very well show up to a dinner party shaking like a leaf! This is a disaster. Absolutely a disaster.
DOCTOR: You're right to feel overwhelmed, Mr. Baide, and I apologize for the anxiety this is causing. It's true, we don't have a definitive diagnosis yet, and that's why these tests are so important. The MRI and blood tests will help us rule out other conditions and get a clearer picture of what's going on. The good news is that even if it turns out to be Parkinson's disease, there are several effective treatments available to manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. Medication can significantly reduce the tremor and rigidity, and physical therapy can help you maintain your strength and coordination. Lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet, can also play an important role in managing the condition. As for your lunch appointment and dinner party, don't worry about that right now. Let's focus on getting the tests done and figuring out what's going on. We can discuss strategies to manage your symptoms in the meantime. To schedule the tests, I’ll have my assistant contact you. The MRI will likely take about 30-45 minutes, and the blood tests can be done quickly at the clinic. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion, just to be sure. We can review the results together next week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… a neurologist… that sounds… thorough. And 30-45 minutes… I can manage that, I suppose. As long as I don’t have to spend the whole day at the clinic. And the results… next week? That feels like a lifetime away. But… alright. Next week. Thank you, Doctor. For… explaining everything. And for… not dismissing me as just an old man shaking like a leaf. Please… let's just hope it's not Parkinson's. I don't think I could handle that right now. I think… I think I should go now. I need to… clear my head. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. We’ll do everything we can to get a clear diagnosis and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. And please, don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. .
