DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom thing. It’s just… frequent. More than it used to be, that’s for sure. Old age, I suppose. Everything starts to go, doesn’t it? Though my wife, bless her heart, says I drink too much tea. She worries about things.
DOCTOR: Right. Frequent urination. And you think it might be related to your tea intake?
PATIENT: Possibly. I don’t know, honestly. I’ve always liked a good cuppa. Several a day. Can’t rightly say how many, though. My mind isn’t what it used to be. It’s not like I'm running a tap, but it's enough to be annoying. And I have to get up at night sometimes… that's the worst part. Wakes my wife up, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so several cups of tea a day, and nighttime urination is particularly bothersome. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not really. A little discomfort sometimes, like… an urge, you know? A strong urge. But not pain. Just… gotta go when you gotta go. And it's not like it's a trickle, if that makes sense. It's… normal, I suppose. For an old man. Everything’s just… faster than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Faster, you say?
PATIENT: Well, yes! It just… comes out quicker. And more often. I didn't mean to sound…indecent. It’s just hard to explain. Like a leaky faucet, maybe? Though, again, not a bad leak. Just… frequent. Is that making any sense, Doctor? My wife says I ramble. She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Increased frequency and a sense of urgency. No pain, but a faster stream. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine? Hmm… let me think. It looks normal, I think. You know, yellow. Maybe a little darker sometimes, if I don’t drink enough water. But no blood, no… foam. Nothing like that. I wouldn’t know what to look for, really. Just yellow. Like it always is. Is it supposed to look different? My wife does all the worrying about those sorts of things. She’s very particular.
DOCTOR: Alright. No visible changes in color or consistency, other than potentially darker with dehydration. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, now. That’s a question. My doctor back in the city… Dr. Henderson, a good man… he always checked my blood pressure. Said it was a little high sometimes. And I had a touch of arthritis in my knees, but that's just old age, isn't it? No diabetes, though. My wife would never let me have too much sugar. She’s very careful about that. As for heart problems… I get a little breathless walking up hills, but who doesn’t at my age? I don’t recall anything serious. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a simple man. Not much goes wrong with me. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure and arthritis. No diabetes. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was… a long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a week once with a bad case of pneumonia. That was back in… oh, goodness, must have been the 70s. A very nasty bout. Other than that… nothing I can recall. Just the usual colds and flu. Nothing serious. I’ve always been a strong man, you see. Always worked hard on the farm. Kept me healthy. Well, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendix removal and pneumonia in the 70s. And you mentioned a farm… Do you still work on the farm, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Well, not like I used to. My son takes care of most of it now. I still potter about, you know? Check things, fix fences, that sort of thing. But the heavy lifting is left to the younger generation. It’s a good farm, though. Been in the family for… oh, goodness, generations. My wife keeps me busy with the garden too. Tomatoes, mostly. She makes a lovely sauce. Keeps me out of trouble, she says. Though, between the tea and the garden, I suppose I make enough trouble already.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, you see, and he didn’t live to a ripe old age. My wife, bless her heart, would have my hide if I even thought about it. She’s very strict about healthy living. Tea is allowed, though. She says it's good for the constitution. A little bit of everything in moderation, that's her motto. Though, sometimes I wonder if all this tea is doing me more harm than good.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, you see. A small white one. The doctor prescribed it. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take an over-the-counter pain reliever. Ibuprofen, I think it's called. And my wife makes me take a fish oil capsule every morning. She says it’s good for the brain. That’s about it, I think. Nothing fancy. Just a few little things to keep me ticking along. Are you sure that’s all you need to know, Doctor? My mind isn't what it used to be. I might be forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Segretto, I think that covers everything for now. It’s good that you’re taking medication for your blood pressure and fish oil for your brain. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Anything you need to do. Just let me know if it's going to be… uncomfortable. Old bones aren’t as pliable as they used to be, you know. And try not to poke too hard. My wife would have a fit if I came home with bruises. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. You seem like a very capable young woman.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. I appreciate that. Alright, if you could just lie back on the exam table, please. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Your heart sounds regular, a little bit of a murmur, but that's common with age. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Just relax. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. Not really. Feels… normal, I suppose. Though, it is a bit of a bumpy ride in there sometimes. Old man’s plumbing, you know. I’ve had a few things pass through over the years. No pain, though. Just… awareness. Is that making any sense, Doctor? It’s hard to explain. You young people don’t understand these things. My wife says I talk too much. She’s probably right.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Segretto. It’s good you can describe what you’re feeling. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your leg… good. And again… Okay, reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is also common with age. Finally, I’m going to do a quick prostate exam. This will help me rule out any issues there. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Let me know if you feel any significant discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh. A prostate exam, you say? Now that… that doesn’t sound particularly pleasant. I’ve… heard things. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, I’m an old man. Isn’t it just part of getting old, you know? All the… plumbing issues? My wife always said I worry too much about my health. Maybe I should just leave well enough alone. But… if you think it's important, Doctor, I suppose I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, please. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto. It's not the most comfortable exam, you’re right. However, it's an important part of evaluating the cause of your frequent urination, especially given your age. It helps us rule out benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is an enlargement of the prostate that's very common as men get older. It can cause many of the symptoms you're describing. I will be as gentle as possible, I promise. We’ll take it slow. If you feel any significant pain, let me know immediately and we can stop. Just take a deep breath and relax your muscles…
PATIENT: Alright. Just… get it over with, then. But really, Doctor… be gentle. I’m not as tough as I used to be. And don’t tell my wife about this, alright? She’d fuss something awful. Hurry up and get it over with. I don't like this one bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Segretto. Just breathing normally... I'm just feeling the size and texture of your prostate. Everything seems… slightly enlarged, as I suspected. Not overly concerning at this point, but it likely contributing to your symptoms. Okay, all done. I apologize for any discomfort. That wasn’t pleasant, I know. Alright. Based on your history, physical exam findings, and your description of your symptoms, I believe you're likely experiencing symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a common condition in men your age. However, to be certain, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. The urine analysis will rule out infection, and the PSA test will help us assess your prostate health more thoroughly. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: BPH… that’s what you call it? Sounds… complicated. And PSA… what does that stand for? My mind isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. All these letters and numbers… It just gets confusing. Infection… well, I haven't felt sick or anything. Just… going to the bathroom too much. So… what does this mean? Do I need… surgery? I don’t want surgery. My wife would fuss something awful if I had surgery. And I’m too old for all that anyway. Is there… medicine I can take? Something simple? That's all I want, Doctor. Something to make it stop. Or at least… slow it down a bit. And… will this show up on my Medicare? I worry about those bills.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Segretto. Let’s take them one at a time. PSA stands for Prostate-Specific Antigen. It's a blood test that measures the level of a protein produced by the prostate gland. It can help us assess the size and health of your prostate. Now, about surgery. Most men with BPH do not need surgery. Many can be effectively managed with medication and lifestyle changes. We'll start with the tests to get a clearer picture of your situation, then discuss the best course of action. There are several medications available that can help reduce the symptoms of BPH. They work by either relaxing the muscles in the prostate or reducing the size of the gland. We can discuss the options and choose one that's right for you. And yes, the urine analysis and PSA test should be covered by Medicare. We’ll make sure to submit the appropriate claims. I understand your concerns about the bills, and we'll work to make sure you understand all the costs involved. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. Then, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a plan to manage your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: No surgery… that’s a good thing. A very good thing. Medicine… I can handle medicine. As long as it doesn’t have too many side effects. My wife always worries about side effects. Tests… alright. Where do I go for those tests? And when will I get the results? I don’t want to have to wait too long. My mind isn’t what it used to be, you know. I might forget what we talked about. So… you think we can get this under control? You think I can stop going to the bathroom so much? That’s all I want, Doctor. Just a little bit of peace and quiet. And maybe… a good night’s sleep. And my wife would be very grateful, too. She worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Segretto, I do believe we can get this under control. Many men experience significant relief with medication and lifestyle changes. You can go to the lab right across the street. They’ll draw a blood sample for the PSA test and collect a urine sample. They’re very familiar with the process, and they'll take good care of you. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for when you have the results, and we can discuss them in detail. I’ll write you a lab requisition and a note with the instructions. And don’t worry about forgetting anything. I'll make sure we have plenty of time to review everything at the follow-up appointment. We can go over the results, discuss the medication options, and address any concerns you have. In the meantime, try to limit your fluid intake before bedtime and avoid caffeinated beverages. These can both worsen your symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Limit fluids… no caffeine… alright. I can manage that. Though, I do enjoy a good cup of tea… But I suppose I can cut back a bit. For my health, you know. And my wife. I think that’s all my questions, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience. My mind isn’t what it used to be, you know. I worry about forgetting things. Alright. I suppose I’ll go get those tests done, then. And I’ll schedule that follow-up appointment. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. A little bit, anyway. I hope this medicine works. I really do. I want to get a good night’s sleep. And maybe… enjoy a cup of tea without having to run to the bathroom every five minutes. That’s all I ask. Thank you, Doctor. You’re a very kind young woman.
