DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lawther, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. It’s… headaches, mostly. Really bad ones. They come and go, and when they do come… well, I get really sweaty, and my heart feels like it's jumpin’ around a bit. It’s hard to explain, honestly. I just… feel awful when it happens. I don’t really… remember exactly when they started, though. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Headaches, alright. And you said sweaty and heart racing with them… hmm. "A while" is tough, makes things tricky. Do they happen at a certain time of day, or after specific activities?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don’t think so. It's not like after exercise or anything. And not a specific time… just kinda… randomly. Sometimes it’ll be in the morning, sometimes afternoon, sometimes at night. Honestly, I wish I could pinpoint something, but I just… don’t. My memory’s not the best, you see. I'm sorry. Is that… is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Lawther. Don't apologize at all. It's very common to have trouble remembering specifics, especially with something that comes and goes. We’ll work with what we have. So, random headaches with sweating and heart racing… Are there any other symptoms that come with these headaches?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit… nauseous, like I might be sick to my stomach. Not always, though. And things seem… brighter, maybe? Like lights are too strong. Does that make sense? And… I get really tired afterwards. Like, wiped out for the rest of the day. I think that’s it, though. It's hard to be sure, honestly. Everything kinda blurs together.
DOCTOR: Alright, nausea, sensitivity to light, and fatigue afterwards… That's helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your vision – blurry vision, seeing spots, anything like that during these headaches?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. That’s a good question. I… think maybe a bit blurry sometimes? But I wear glasses already, so I just kinda figured it was them needing adjusting. It's hard to tell, honestly. I haven't really… paid attention, I guess. I usually just close my eyes and try to wait it out. Does that make a difference?
DOCTOR: Okay. You wear glasses, and the blurriness could be related to that. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, just to cover all bases, have you had any fever, neck stiffness, or any weakness or numbness with these headaches?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I remember. And neck stiffness… no, doesn’t feel stiff. Weakness or numbness… no, thankfully. Everything still works, as far as I can tell. It's just… the head pain and the other stuff. It’s really scary when it happens, honestly. Especially the heart thing. I just feel really… off. Does that sound… weird?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound weird at all, Mr. Lawther. It's good you're describing everything, even the feeling of just being “off.” Alright, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I mean, I had the flu a few years back, but that’s about it. Nothing… serious. I'm generally pretty healthy, I think. Except for these headaches, obviously. I got divorced a while ago, if that counts as… something? But that wasn’t a medical thing, obviously. I don’t really go to the doctor much. I just… try to tough things out. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad at all to try and be independent. But sometimes, toughing things out can make them harder to treat later. Divorce is certainly a stressful life event, and stress can contribute to headaches. Now, any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was just a cast and a sling. It healed fine. I don't really have much… medical history, honestly. It's kinda boring, I guess. I just wish I could figure out what's causing these headaches. It’s really starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospital stays. Good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mom had migraines when I was growing up. Really bad ones. She used to have to lie down in a dark room for hours. I don't know if these are the same thing… They feel different, somehow. My dad was… pretty healthy, I think. Never had much trouble with anything. He passed away a few years back. I don’t really… talk about it much. Sorry. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Mr. Lawther. Your mother's history of migraines is important information. It suggests there might be a genetic component to your headaches. And it's perfectly alright if you don’t want to talk about difficult things. Now, do you currently take any medications, over-the-counter or prescribed?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I just… deal with it. Sometimes I take ibuprofen if the pain gets really bad, but that doesn’t always help. Mostly it just makes my stomach upset. I don't really like taking pills, honestly. I just… hope it goes away. Is that… stupid?
DOCTOR: No, that's not stupid at all. It's perfectly reasonable to want to avoid medication if you can. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I mean, I get hay fever in the spring, but that’s just sneezing and a runny nose. Nothing serious. I’ve never had a really bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I ate some bad shellfish once, but that was just… stomach trouble. Nothing life-threatening. I think. It’s been a long time. Sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful. My memory’s just… bad.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Mr. Lawther. We’re getting there. Alright, and lastly, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never really been much of a smoker or drinker. I tried a cigarette once when I was younger, but didn’t like it. And no drugs, definitely not. I just… work a lot, mostly. Production work, you know? It's pretty tiring. Not much time for anything else. I just want to feel better, honestly. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very helpful. Okay, Mr. Lawther, based on what you've told me – headaches with sweating, heart racing, nausea, light sensitivity, fatigue, a family history of migraines, and no other significant medical history – it sounds like you might be experiencing migraine headaches. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your blood pressure, pulse, and neurological function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. If you think it’ll help. I mean, I trust your judgment. I just… I’m kinda worried, honestly. If it is migraines, is there anything I can do? Is it something serious? Sorry, I’m probably asking a lot of questions. I just… want to know what’s going on. I'm really starting to get scared these headaches will never go away.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Mr. Lawther. That's what I'm here for. And it’s good you’re bringing your concerns to me. We’ll take it one step at a time. First, let's do the exam. It's just a quick check to make sure everything looks normal. Alright, reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. Eye movements are also good, no signs of any weakness or double vision. Strength is also good in your arms and legs. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90, but that could be due to anxiety or pain. Pulse is a bit fast at 90, again could be pain or anxiety. Overall, the neurological exam is normal, which is reassuring. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… good. I’m kinda nervous, though. I get anxious at the doctor, always have. My heart always races, so maybe that’s why it's fast? I don't know. I just… hope it's nothing serious. I need to go back to work tomorrow, you see. I can’t afford to take time off. Is this going to take long? Sorry, I’m probably being a pain.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit fast as you said, probably related to anxiety. Alright, everything sounds normal so far. Based on the exam and your history, it still seems most likely to be migraines. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and pulse, and the fact that you've never been formally diagnosed, I’d like to order some basic blood work and a possible EKG just to rule out any other underlying causes. This will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. I also want to emphasize that we’re being cautious. Migraines are very common and usually not dangerous, but it’s important to rule out anything else, just to be safe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. If that’s what you think is best. Blood work and an EKG… okay. I just… what if it is something serious? What if it’s not migraines? Sorry, I’m getting worked up. I just… I don’t want to be sick. I need to go back to work. I have bills to pay. Is this going to cost a lot of money? I don't have much insurance, you see. This is really starting to scare me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, it’s perfectly normal to be scared when you’re not sure what’s going on. And I understand your concerns about cost, especially without insurance. We’ll do everything we can to keep costs down, and I can connect you with resources that may be able to help. Right now, let's focus on getting the tests done so we can have more information. The blood work will check your basic organ function and rule out any infections. The EKG will check your heart rhythm. I want to emphasize again that migraines are very common and usually not dangerous. But we need to rule out other possibilities just to be safe. I’m going to write you an order for the blood work and EKG. You can get those done at the lab down the street. It shouldn’t take long, and the results usually come back within a few days. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, and avoiding any known triggers for your headaches. If your headaches become severe or are accompanied by fever, stiff neck, weakness, or vision changes, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that sounds… alright. Staying hydrated, getting enough sleep… I can try. But it’s hard, you know? Work’s tiring. And I get anxious… it’s hard to sleep when you’re anxious. But I’ll try. The lab down the street… okay. And if the headaches get worse… I’ll go to the emergency room. Thank you… thank you for listening. I was really scared. Is there anything else I need to do? Or know? I just want to get this figured out. And I’m worried about the cost… can you really help with that? I don't want to get into debt over this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Lawther. I understand your concerns, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Yes, let me give you the order for the blood work and EKG, and I'll also write down the name and number of a financial counselor who can help you explore options for reducing costs. There are programs available that may be able to assist you. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a headache diary. Write down when you get headaches, how severe they are, what symptoms you experience, and any potential triggers you identify. This will be helpful for both of us when we discuss the results. I also want to emphasize that you’re not alone. Many people experience migraines, and there are effective treatments available. We’ll work together to find a solution that works for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: A headache diary… okay, I can try that. Write down everything… that sounds like a lot of work, but I guess it’s worth it if it helps. And a financial counselor… that would be great, thank you. I really appreciate that. No… I think that’s everything, for now. I’m just… worried, but I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something. Thank you, Dr. Galena. I really mean it. I guess I’ll go get the tests done. And I’ll try to write down everything about the headaches. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lawther. You take care. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
