DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… family. My sister, she… she’s got some bad sickness. Cancer, I think. And my mother, she… she had something, a long time ago. I just… I want to make sure I’m okay. You know? I don't want the same thing to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It’s very responsible of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of cancer. It's good you're thinking about this. To get a better understanding of your concerns, let's talk a little bit about your health. First, have you been experiencing any symptoms at all – anything new or unusual?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… Not really. I feel… okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work hard. Sales is… it keeps you moving. I eat… normal food, I guess. Not much junk. I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much anymore. Used to, but… not so much now. Is that what you mean by symptoms? Just… feeling old, maybe?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, thank you. When you say “feeling old,” can you describe that a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Well… aches. Just little aches and pains. In my back, mostly. And my knees. It rains a lot here, you know? Makes them stiff. And… I forget things sometimes. Not important things, just… where I put my keys, or a name. Like a customer’s name. It happens. It doesn’t worry me too much, but… now that you ask, yeah, I guess I feel a little… worn out.
DOCTOR: Okay, aches and pains, some stiffness, and occasional forgetfulness. I appreciate you sharing that. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. Regarding the aches and pains, are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Definitely come and go. Some days I wake up feeling pretty good. Other days… I gotta take it easy. It's worse when it's cold, like when the rain comes. And if I lift something heavy at work… that’s bad. Not heavy heavy, just… boxes. Sales stuff. It's not like I'm building houses.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to be activity-related and weather-sensitive. Now, about the forgetfulness – has it been getting worse lately?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I don't know. Maybe? It's hard to say. I’m getting older, right? I figure some forgetfulness comes with that. My daughter, she keeps telling me I repeat myself. But she also… she worries a lot. She’s a good girl, but… I don't know if it's really worse. Just… there.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to notice changes in yourself. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I broke my arm when I was a kid. Playing. Nothing serious. And… I had high blood pressure, a long time ago. The doctor gave me some pills. I took them for a while, but… I stopped. I felt better, and he didn’t push it too hard. Said I could watch my diet. I try to. And… that’s it, I think. No big sicknesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood broken arm and previously treated high blood pressure. Do you recall what medication you were taking for your blood pressure, and for how long?
PATIENT: Um… that was… a long time ago. I don’t remember the name of the pill. Little white one, I think. Maybe pink? And I took it… maybe a year? Two years? The doctor… he changed doctors, actually. That’s why I stopped. The new doctor just said to watch my salt and exercise. And I did, mostly. I walked a lot then, more than I do now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies. I eat everything. My wife… she was allergic to cats, but I don't. She’s gone now, though. It’s been… a while.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry for your loss, Mr. Schwer. Now, let's talk about your family history a bit more. You mentioned your sister having cancer and your mother having something in the past. Do you know what type of cancer your sister has, and what your mother had?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… a long time ago. My sister… she has… lung cancer, I think. The doctors said so. She smoked for a long time. It's bad. She's… getting treatment. And my mother… she had something with her stomach, I think. They took part of it out. A long time ago. She lived to be old, though. Really old. But… I worry about myself, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It's natural to be worried with a family history like that. Now, to get a better sense of your overall health, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Like… check my heart and stuff? Sure. That’s okay. I don’t mind. Whatever you think is best. Just… don’t poke too hard, okay? My back… it’s a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. We'll be gentle. Your blood pressure is a little high today. We'll keep that in mind. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the upper quadrants. Your reflexes are normal, and your range of motion is a bit limited in your lower back, with some discomfort on extension. And finally, I'll check your pulses in your extremities. Good pulses throughout. Everything else seems within normal limits for your age. I do think your elevated blood pressure and the tenderness in your abdomen warrant some further investigation. Would you be comfortable with a blood test and potentially an abdominal ultrasound?
PATIENT: Blood test and… a what? Ultrasound? Sounds… complicated. What would those tests show? I just want to make sure I'm not going to get sick like my sister, you know? Is that the only way to find out?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Schwer. Let me explain. The blood test will give us a broader picture of your overall health – things like your cholesterol, kidney function, and a complete blood count. It can also help us look for markers of inflammation. The ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the organs in your abdomen. It will help us evaluate your liver, gallbladder, kidneys, and other structures to see if there's anything unusual causing the tenderness. We're not assuming you have anything serious, but these tests will help us rule out potential causes for your symptoms and provide a clearer picture of your health. It’s a preventative measure, really. The tests are the best way to get objective information and allow us to make an informed plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… objective information… that sounds… good, I guess. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but… if it makes sure I’m okay… Okay, Doctor. Do the tests. But… will they be expensive? I’m on Medicare, you know. And… I don’t have much extra money.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Schwer. Let me assure you, we will do everything we can to work within your Medicare coverage. We'll submit the necessary paperwork to ensure you receive the appropriate reimbursement. We also have a financial counselor available who can help you understand your out-of-pocket costs and explore potential options if needed. Before we proceed, I'll have my nurse draw a requisition for the blood work and schedule the abdominal ultrasound. Would you prefer a morning or afternoon appointment for the ultrasound?
PATIENT: Morning is better. I like to get things over with. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for helping me with the money stuff. It worries me, you know. Getting old is expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about those things. Alright, let’s schedule that ultrasound for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. My nurse will come in shortly to provide you with the necessary paperwork and instructions. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just… get it over with, right? And… I hope everything is okay. You know, with the tests. Thank you again, Doctor Annesley. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. That’s what I’m here for. We’ll do our best to get you the answers you need. We’ll review the results together once they’re available. My nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to let us know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Have a good day, Mr. Schwer, and try not to worry too much.
