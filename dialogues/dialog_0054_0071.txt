DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. Well, to be honest, it’s a bit complicated. My daughter… she’s trying to get her husband to come to the United States. He's from… well, not here, and I believe there are some shots, some vaccinations, that he needs for the visa process. I'm hoping you can tell me what those are, and maybe help us get it all sorted out. I’m a bit lost on where to even begin.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Skarbek, I understand. You’re looking for guidance on the vaccinations your future son-in-law needs for a US visa. That's perfectly reasonable, and we can certainly help you navigate that. It can be a bit confusing. To start, do you know which visa he's applying for?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think… she told me something about a… a marriage visa? Is that what it’s called? She handles most of the paperwork, you see. I just try to help where I can. I don’t know all the official names. It's a K-1 visa, I think she mentioned that once. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, a K-1 visa, that's very helpful. That’s a fiancé visa. Okay, so the required vaccinations for a K-1 visa applicant are fairly specific, according to the CDC guidelines. Generally, they will need proof of vaccination against: Diphtheria Tetanus Pertussis Polio Measles Mumps Rubella Varicella Influenza Hepatitis A and B COVID-19 It's important to have documentation of these vaccinations, and they may need to be updated depending on when he last received them. Do you happen to know if he's had any of these vaccinations previously?
PATIENT: Oh my, that’s… a lot of shots! He’s from a smaller village, Doctor. Things are… different there. I don’t believe he’s had many, if any, of those. He didn't talk about getting any shots growing up. We haven’t discussed it, to be honest. I’m afraid he may need to get all of them? That sounds… expensive, and a bit frightening for him, I think. He’s a little nervous about doctors, even now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Skarbek. It is a lot, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be worried about the cost and his anxiety. It’s common for individuals from other countries to not have the same vaccination history as those in the US. We can definitely work with him to get him up-to-date. We’ll start by reviewing what vaccinations he has received, if possible. Even if he doesn’t have records, we can perform a blood test – a titer test – to see if he has immunity to certain diseases. That way, we won’t have to repeat vaccinations unnecessarily. As for the cost, we do accept private insurance, which may cover some or all of the vaccinations. We also have options for a payment plan if needed. Before we get into the specifics, can you tell me a bit about his medical history?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better, Doctor. A blood test seems a lot less frightening than just getting every shot immediately. And knowing insurance might cover some is a relief. His medical history… well, he’s generally healthy, thankfully. He's always been a strong, hard worker. He had a bout of… some kind of fever when he was a young boy, maybe around five or six. His mother treated him with herbal remedies, traditional medicine. Nothing serious, it didn’t last long. He's never been to a hospital, not that I know of. He hasn’t had any surgeries, or any ongoing illnesses. He's a bit prone to allergies, though. Mostly just pollen, during the spring. He gets a stuffy nose and sneezes a lot. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know, Mr. Skarbek. A history of good health is excellent. The herbal remedies are good to note as well. It's important to understand traditional practices. The pollen allergy is also important. We'll need to document all allergies. Just to be thorough, has he ever had a serious reaction to any medication or anything else, like a bee sting?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not that I recall, Doctor. He's always been careful around bees, naturally. He grew up around them, so he knows to steer clear. I don’t think he's ever taken much in the way of medicine, honestly. Maybe some pain reliever for a headache, but nothing strong. He’s always preferred to let things heal on their own, or use natural remedies when possible. He's a very cautious man, I suppose. He doesn’t like to take risks, if he can avoid it. Is there a form I can fill out with this information? It might be easier than me trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Skarbek. That's a great idea. We have a detailed medical history form that will cover everything. I'll have my assistant, Sarah, bring one over to you. It will ask about allergies, medications, past illnesses, and family history. While you're filling that out, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline and check his overall health. We'll check his vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, temperature - listen to his heart and lungs, and take a look at his throat and ears. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A physical exam is a good idea. He’s always been a bit worried about doctors, but I'll reassure him. A check-up is a good thing, I suppose. And Sarah bringing the form is very helpful. Thank you. Where would you like me to sit for the exam? And is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat on the table, Mr. Skarbek. You can just sit comfortably. You don't need to do anything special. Just relax. I’ll start by taking your vital signs. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your throat and ears. It shouldn’t take long. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time, you see. Hopefully, everything is still working properly. Go ahead, whenever you're ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not concerning at this point. We’ll keep an eye on it. Your pulse is 72, nice and regular. And your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Your heart sounds strong and regular. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Ears look clear as well. No signs of infection or fluid buildup. Everything sounds normal. Overall, you seem to be in good health, Mr. Skarbek. Now, let’s talk about these vaccinations…
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Doctor. I always worry about my health, I suppose. Being my age, things don’t always work the way they used to. Vaccinations, yes. I suppose that’s the main reason I came. I just want to make sure my daughter’s husband is safe, and that he can come to the United States without any problems. He's very excited to meet everyone, and to start a new life with her. Is there a specific list of shots he absolutely needs before he can apply for the visa? And will we need to get them all done here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Skarbek. It’s great he’s excited to join your family. And absolutely, ensuring a smooth visa process and his health are our priorities. According to the CDC requirements for a K-1 visa applicant, these are the vaccinations he absolutely needs: Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis : A booster is often required, even if he had it as a child. Polio: Proof of vaccination is mandatory. Measles, Mumps, and Rubella : Two doses are usually required. Varicella : Two doses or proof of immunity through a blood test. Influenza: A seasonal flu shot. Hepatitis A and B: A series of two shots for Hepatitis A, and a series of three for Hepatitis B. COVID-19: Proof of complete vaccination series. We can administer all of these vaccinations here at the clinic. We have everything readily available. We'll also need to document his vaccination history, so if you have any records, please bring those with you if possible. If not, we can perform a blood test to check his immunity levels, which will help determine which vaccinations he actually needs. Do you have any questions about this list?
PATIENT: Oh my… that’s a lot of shots, Doctor. I don’t believe he has records of anything, honestly. His village… they don’t keep such things. A blood test sounds like the best option, then. We don’t want to give him shots he doesn’t need. Are these shots… painful? And will he be able to travel after receiving them? He’s a strong man, but I don’t want him to be uncomfortable, or have any complications. And how long will it take to get all of them done? We’re hoping he can come to the United States as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Skarbek. It is a lot, and we’ll do everything we can to make the process as comfortable as possible. Regarding the pain, most vaccinations cause only mild discomfort – a brief stinging sensation. Some individuals may experience soreness at the injection site for a day or two, but it’s usually manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers like Tylenol or Ibuprofen. We can also apply a cold compress to reduce swelling and discomfort. As for traveling, generally, there are no restrictions on traveling after receiving vaccinations, unless he experiences a serious adverse reaction, which is very rare. We’ll monitor him closely after each vaccination to ensure he's doing well. The time it will take to complete all vaccinations depends on the results of the blood test and the availability of the vaccines. Some vaccines require multiple doses, spaced several weeks apart. A Hepatitis B series, for instance, takes six months. However, we can expedite the process as much as possible. Once we have the blood test results, we can create a personalized vaccination schedule for him. To start, I’ll order the blood test. Sarah will draw the sample for you. It usually takes 2-3 business days to get the results back. Once we have those, we can discuss the next steps and create a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good, Doctor. A personalized plan is exactly what we need. And I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. Blood test it is, then. I trust Sarah completely. She seems very capable. And if I have any questions, or if anything changes, I can call the clinic, right? I might need to ask a few more questions once we have the results, to be honest. I just want to make sure everything is done correctly. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been a great help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I’m glad I could help. And yes, absolutely. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic with any questions or concerns you may have, at any time. My number is 555-123-4567. We are here to support you and your future son-in-law every step of the way. Sarah will be in shortly to draw the blood sample. I’ll have her explain the process. In the meantime, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s all for now. I’ll wait for Sarah, then. Thank you again for your time and patience. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll let you get back to your other patients. You must be very busy.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Skarbek. Please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Have a good day.
