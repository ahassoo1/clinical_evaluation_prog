DOCTOR: Alright, Nani, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Havird, if I may… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I haven’t been… myself lately. Just feeling very low, you understand? It’s been going on for a few months now, and honestly, I’m tired of feeling this way. It’s… draining.
DOCTOR: "Draining," right. Lots of people say that. A few months, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a good few months now. Perhaps… six, seven? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. Time… it seems to slip away these days. It’s not like a sudden thing, you see. Just a gradual… fading. Everything feels… muted.
DOCTOR: Muted… alright. And has anything changed in those six or seven months?
PATIENT: Not… drastically, no. My routine is the same, mostly. Still working, still… keeping busy. My divorce was finalized about a year ago, which was… difficult, of course. But I thought I was handling that. It’s just… this feeling persists. Everything feels… heavier than it used to. Even things I used to enjoy.
DOCTOR: Right. The divorce. A year ago… and you say this feeling… persisted after that?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. It was awful at the time, truly. But I had friends, family… I kept myself occupied. I expected it to get better, to feel… lighter. And it did, for a little while. But then… this started. It’s not about the divorce anymore, if that makes sense. It’s just… a general feeling of… emptiness. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Emptiness… and is this interfering with your daily life?
PATIENT: Yes. Very much so. It's… difficult to concentrate at work, you see. I'm a lifeguard, and you need to be alert, focused. I find myself… distracted. And I've lost interest in things I used to enjoy – gardening, visiting my grandchildren. Even getting out of bed in the mornings is a struggle. It’s… exhausting pretending everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Lifeguard… right. And any changes in your sleep or appetite?
PATIENT: Well, my appetite… isn't what it used to be. I don’t feel hungry as often, and when I do eat, it doesn’t seem to… satisfy me. As for sleep… it’s fitful. I wake up several times during the night, unable to get back to sleep. It’s not a full-blown insomnia, but it’s… unsettling. I feel tired all the time, even after a full night – or what should be a full night – of sleep. It’s all very… draining, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you experienced any thoughts of harming yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Absolutely not! Never! Where would such a thought even come from? I’m a practical woman, Doctor. I’ve always been strong. I might be… low in spirits, but I would never… I mean, that's a dreadful question to ask. No, absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Right. Good. Have you been taking any medication for this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t believe in relying on pills for everything. I thought… I thought it would pass. And I didn't want to bother anyone with it. Besides, I have a bit of a… sensitivity to medication. I react to things easily. I prefer to manage things myself, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll do a brief physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Then, we can discuss some options. It’s always a good idea to get things checked out, even if you don't think it’s anything serious. Blood pressure first.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Blood pressure first, you say? Yes, let’s do that. I hope it’s not too high. All this… worrying can’t be good for it.
DOCTOR: 140/90 on the right, 138/88 on the left. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Heart rate is 72, regular. Let me listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Normal reflexes. Overall, physically you seem… fine. Which is good. But this pressure reading does suggest we monitor it, and address the underlying stress.
PATIENT: That’s… good to hear, Doctor. But honestly, feeling “fine” doesn’t seem to be the problem. It’s what’s going on in here that’s troubling. The pressure reading… is that from worry, do you think? It’s… difficult to manage everything on my own, you see. Perhaps… a bit of guidance would be helpful.
DOCTOR: It could be stress, yes. And you're right, it’s important to address the emotional component. Honestly, though, at your age, some of this is probably just… normal life adjustment. Divorce, retirement, changes in routine… these things take a toll. Look, I can prescribe something for the blood pressure. And I can give you a list of resources for… coping. But ultimately, you need to find a way to… accept things. It’s about resilience, really. And frankly, at 75, you’ve lived a good long life. Are you interested in the resources, or should I just write up the prescription?
PATIENT: With all due respect, Doctor, I don’t believe a list of “resources” is what I need. And frankly, telling me I’ve “lived a good long life” as if to excuse my feelings is… unhelpful. I’m not looking for excuses, I’m looking for help. I came here because I’m struggling, not because I need a lecture on resilience. Perhaps… perhaps I should seek a second opinion. This doesn’t feel… productive.
DOCTOR: Well, you’re certainly entitled to do that. I’ve spent 25 years in family medicine, and I’m telling you, this sounds like a typical adjustment reaction. But if you'd prefer another opinion, I can provide you with a referral list. Honestly, though, I’m not sure another doctor will tell you anything different. But suit yourself. Do you want me to write up the prescription for the blood pressure in the meantime?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I do not want a prescription. And I do not require a referral list. I believe I’ve wasted enough of both our time. Good day. .
