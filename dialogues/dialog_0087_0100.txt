DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Soodeen. It’s August 2nd, and I see you’re here for a consultation today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it's about a test, I think? Something about… checking for things. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. My husband, bless his soul, he took care of all these things when he was around. It's something the… the folks at work said I needed. Something about keeping my job, I believe.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this may be a requirement for your employment. That’s perfectly alright; we handle these types of requests frequently. To clarify, do you recall what kind of test it was, or perhaps where you were told to come for it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… not a clue, really. They just handed me a paper… a little slip of paper. It had a name on it, I think… a clinic name. And a date, which is why I’m here today! Everything’s a bit fuzzy. I drive a paver, you know. Big machine. Lots of dust and noise. Maybe that’s it? I mostly just remember being told it was important.
DOCTOR: Let me see if I can pull up your information with your name, Ms. Hughston. …Ah, yes. Here we are. It appears you're scheduled for a routine occupational health screening, as required by your employer, Paver Pro. It includes a physical exam, some blood work, and a urine sample. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Paver Pro… yes, that’s right! That rings a bell. And… a urine sample? Oh, goodness. Well, that explains why I’m here, I suppose. I… I don't mind the blood work too much, but… a urine sample? Is that… is that to check for… things? I really don’t know what they’re looking for.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston. The urine sample, along with the blood work, helps us assess your overall health and ensure you're physically able to safely perform your job duties. It screens for things like kidney function, hydration levels, and potential infections. It's a standard part of the occupational screening. We'll provide you with a private restroom and collection cup, and I’ll explain the procedure in detail. Before we get to that, though, let's quickly review your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes a bit more sense, thank you for explaining. Safety first, I always say. Hmm… allergies… let me think. Not that I know of, really. I used to get a bit of a rash from poison ivy when I was a girl, but that was ages ago. And I think I sneezed a lot when my neighbor had a cat, but I wouldn’t call that an allergy, would I? No, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything important. Unless… is dust an allergy? I work with a lot of dust.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies, and a possible sensitivity to dust. We can certainly note that. While we're talking about potential irritants, have you experienced any respiratory symptoms – coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath – related to the dust at work?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yes, actually. A little bit. I get a bit of a cough sometimes, especially at the end of the day. And my chest feels… tight now and then. Nothing terrible, just… a little uncomfortable. Old age, probably. I always thought it was just the job. Lots of lifting and… well, dust. It's a dirty job, but someone's gotta do it.
DOCTOR: Alright. A cough and chest tightness, potentially related to dust exposure at work. We'll definitely document that. Do you use any protective gear at work, like a mask?
PATIENT: A mask? Um… sometimes. When they remind me. It's a bit hot in that machine, you know, and the mask gets… stuffy. I try to open a window if I can, but it’s noisy, so it doesn't always help. The foreman, he keeps telling us we should wear them all the time, but… well, it's hard to breathe sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright. So, inconsistent mask use. Ms. Hughston, given your cough and chest tightness, and the dust exposure at work, I’d like to listen to your lungs to get a baseline. It’s a quick exam, and it will help us determine if further investigation is needed. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My lungs? Well, they've seen a lot of dust, I can tell you that much. I suppose it can’t hurt to have a listen. As long as it doesn’t take too long, I have to get back to work this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won't take long at all. If you could please have a seat here and take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Alright, deep breaths… I can do that. Though my chest does feel a little… tight today. Like a band around it, almost. There. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice deep breath… and exhale. Good. And again… deep breath in… and out. I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, Ms. Hughston. It’s not alarming, but it does correlate with your symptoms and dust exposure. Your heart sounds are normal, and I don’t detect any other concerning sounds. We should also check your oxygen saturation. It’s a quick non-invasive test using this clip on your finger.
PATIENT: Oh, wheezing? That doesn't sound good, does it? My father used to wheeze when he had a cold. Oxygen… well, I'm breathing, aren't I? Is it low? Should I be worried? I really don’t like the sound of “wheezing.”
DOCTOR: Your oxygen saturation is 92%, Ms. Hughston, which is a little on the lower end of normal. Ideally, we'd like to see it closer to 95 or above. Given your wheezing and slightly lower oxygen levels, I’m concerned about potential occupational asthma or chronic bronchitis related to your dust exposure. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. The X-ray will help rule out any other underlying lung conditions, and the pulmonary function test will assess how well your lungs are working. Would you be willing to schedule those tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Those sound… serious. Chest X-ray? Pulmonary… what was it? It's all a bit much, isn't it? I just came in for a simple job test! I don’t know… I don’t like going to the hospital. Is it really necessary? I mean, I’ve been working with dust for years. It's probably just… old age.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hughston. It is a lot to take in, and I apologize if this is more than you expected. However, these tests are important to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure your long-term lung health. Ignoring these issues could lead to more serious complications down the road. The chest X-ray is relatively quick and painless, and the pulmonary function test simply involves breathing into a device. We can schedule them both at the clinic, so you wouldn’t have to go to the hospital. It's best to be proactive, Ms. Hughston, and rule out anything serious. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Well… if I have to go to the clinic, that’s better than the hospital, I suppose. And you think it’s important… You’re the doctor, after all. What does breathing into a device mean exactly? Will it make me dizzy? I get a bit lightheaded sometimes. And… will it affect my job? I can’t afford to lose it.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Hughston. The pulmonary function test involves breathing normally, then taking a deep breath and exhaling forcefully into a mouthpiece connected to a machine. It measures how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can do it. It doesn’t usually cause dizziness, but if you feel lightheaded at any point, we’ll stop immediately. It takes about 15-20 minutes. As for your job, the tests themselves won’t affect your employment. However, depending on the results, we may need to discuss potential accommodations to help manage your symptoms and protect your lung health. We can work with your employer to ensure a smooth process. Let's schedule those tests first, and then we can discuss any necessary accommodations if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, let’s do it. Tests first. That sounds… sensible. And you’ll help me with my job if I need it? That’s good. Very good. When can I schedule them? I have to work tomorrow and the next day… and I’m not good with early mornings.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let me see what availability we have. We have an opening on Thursday afternoon at 2:00 PM for both the chest X-ray and pulmonary function test. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Thursday… hmm. That’s… that’s doable, I think. Two o’clock. Yes, that should work. As long as it doesn’t take all day. I really need to get back to work, you know? Are we finished now? I’m starting to feel a bit… tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, that’s everything for today. We’ve scheduled your chest X-ray and pulmonary function test for Thursday at 2:00 PM. The receptionist will contact you to confirm the appointment and provide any necessary instructions. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever – please contact us immediately. Here’s a summary of today’s discussion and some information on occupational asthma. I’ll also have the nurse come in to take your blood pressure before you leave. Thank you for coming in, Ms. Hughston. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: Oh. Thank you, Doctor. That’s… a lot of information. I think that’s all for now. Blood pressure, alright. Just… don’t tell me anything too scary, okay? I get worried easily. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Hughston. We’ll take things one step at a time. The nurse will just check your basic vitals. And remember, we’re here to help. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
