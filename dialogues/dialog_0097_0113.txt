DOCTOR: Good morning, Arlan! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Georgiou, was it? Yes, lovely meeting you as well. Well, it's this… this waterworks situation, I suppose. Been going to the bathroom… a lot. More than I used to, anyway. It's a nuisance, really. Not a big deal, probably, but my wife, bless her heart, she says I should get it checked. Women always worry so.
DOCTOR: Wives often do have a good instinct, Arlan. And it's always good to get things checked out, just to be sure. Okay, so more frequent urination. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… more frequent… well, it’s all day, really. Not just at night, though I do get up once or twice then, same as always. It's just… I drink a glass of water, and not long after, I’m having to go again. And it’s not like I’m drinking that much water. Not gallons, you know? Just… normal. I used to be able to sit through a whole movie without a problem, now… well, you get the picture. Old age, I suppose. Everything starts to go, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean it's just old age, Arlan. There are a number of things that can cause frequent urination, and we’ll figure out what's going on. You mentioned it's happening throughout the day, and isn't drastically worse at night. That's helpful to know. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not really. A little… discomfort sometimes, maybe, but not pain. It’s just… a bit of a rush, you know? Like it all wants to come out at once. And sometimes… sometimes it's just a little trickle, even when I think I’ve emptied everything. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things. My wife is the one with the medical books, always reading about something or other.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Arlan, don't worry about a thing. You’re explaining it just fine. A little discomfort and a sense of incomplete emptying... okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? Hmm… Now you're asking me something. I don’t really pay attention to the color, to be honest. It’s… yellow, usually. Or pale yellow, I suppose. I haven't seen any… blood or anything like that, if that's what you're getting at. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I don’t stare at it, you know? It goes in the bowl, and that’s that. I suppose if it was bright red, I’d notice, but… I don’t know.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Arlan. Most people don’t, and that’s why I ask. No noticeable changes in color. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or side?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. I feel fine, temperature-wise. Chills… no, haven't been cold. And back pain… well, I have a little ache in my lower back sometimes, but that’s just my age again. I used to work the farm, you know? Heavy lifting, all sorts of things. It flares up now and then, but it's not new. It’s just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, no chills, and a pre-existing lower back ache, not new or directly related to the urination issue. That’s good to know. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… that's a long story. Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me years ago, put me on a pill for it. Still taking it, I think. Small white one. And… diabetes? I don't think so. My wife keeps saying I eat too much sugar, but I haven’t been officially told I have it. She worries about everything. I had a bit of trouble with my heart a long time ago, but that was years and years ago, they fixed it with… well, some sort of operation. Honestly, it all gets a bit muddled after a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication. Possible family history of diabetes, and a previous heart condition that was surgically corrected. Do you happen to remember what kind of heart surgery you had, or approximately when it took place?
PATIENT: Hmm… what kind of surgery… that was… oh, goodness, let me think. It was a bypass, I believe. They took something from my leg… a vein, maybe? And put it somewhere near my heart. It was a long time ago… must be… thirty, forty years ago? Maybe even longer. It was before my wife and I moved here, I know that much. She’s the one with the dates, always remembering everything. I just remember being very sore afterward.
DOCTOR: Okay, a coronary artery bypass graft, or CABG, approximately 30-40 years ago. And you're currently taking medication for high blood pressure. Now, have you had any other surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reasons since your heart surgery?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not that I recall. Maybe for my appendix when I was a young man? But that was ages ago. And… a hernia once, but it wasn't a big deal. They patched it up and sent me home. Nothing major since the heart. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Mostly just aches and pains from working the farm all those years.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendix removal and a hernia repair in the past, but nothing significant recently. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. There’s a little blue pill for… well, I can't even pronounce it. Something for my… prostate, I think my wife says. Keeps me from getting up all night. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis when it’s really bad. A white one, I think. But that’s only when my joints are acting up. Otherwise, just the blue one and the one for my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for high blood pressure, a medication for your prostate, and an as-needed medication for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. My wife always says I shouldn’t, that I need to watch my cholesterol, but… I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle with some pollen sometimes, but that’s just seasonal. Nothing serious. I don’t believe in allergies, to be honest. People just make themselves sick worrying about them.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I’m retired now, so I don’t do much hard work. Mostly I putter around the house, watch some television, help my wife with the gardening. I used to be very active, working the farm and all, but those days are long gone. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And I don’t smoke. Never have. Always thought it was a foolish habit.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Arlan. So, retired, moderate activity, no smoking, and occasional wine. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I don't mind at all. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. Old bones, you know. Not as flexible as they used to be. Go ahead, please. I trust you know what you're doing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relaxing, Arlan. I'm checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses. Your heart sounds regular, a little bit of a murmur, which is common at your age, nothing to be concerned about at this point. Pulses are good and strong. Now, I'm just going to listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear. And finally, I'll just check your reflexes… . Those are a little bit diminished, which is also common with age. Everything seems to be within normal limits for someone your age, Arlan. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick physical exam, the frequent urination is likely related to one of a few things, and further testing will help us narrow it down. It could be related to your prostate, as you are taking medication for that. It could also be a sign of a urinary tract infection, though you don’t have any fever or other symptoms of that currently. And it’s important to rule out other possibilities, such as diabetes or kidney problems. I’d like to order a urine analysis and a blood test to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I suppose I should expect some tests. Urine and blood… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. Just don’t want to be poked and prodded too much, if you don’t mind. I don't like needles. But if it's necessary, I understand. My wife will probably be relieved you're getting to the bottom of it, anyway. She worries so.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Arlan. We’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. It’s just a small blood draw and a urine sample – nothing too invasive. Okay, I’m ordering those tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will give you instructions on how to collect the urine sample. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. It typically takes a couple of days for the results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend drinking a moderate amount of fluids – around 6-8 glasses of water a day – unless your doctor has told you otherwise. And try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate your bladder. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Six to eight glasses… that seems like a lot. But alright, I’ll try. Avoid caffeine… well, I don’t drink much coffee anyway. Alcohol… sometimes a glass of wine with dinner. I’ll cut back. Hmm… questions? Well, you said something about my prostate… is it getting worse? Is that why I’m going to the bathroom so much? Is the medicine not working anymore? That’s what I’m really worried about. I don't want to end up with… well, you know.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Arlan. It is possible that your prostate is contributing to the frequent urination, and the medication might not be as effective as it once was. That's why we’re doing the tests, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The tests will help us assess the size of your prostate and rule out other potential causes. It’s important to remember that frequent urination can have many causes, and it doesn’t necessarily mean there's something seriously wrong. But it's always best to investigate, and we’ll work together to find a solution. If the tests show that your prostate is enlarged, we can discuss different treatment options, such as adjusting your medication or considering other therapies. Do you have any other concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: Adjusting the medication… is that going to make me feel sick? I don’t like feeling sick. And what kind of “therapies” are we talking about? My wife keeps reading about all sorts of things online, and some of them sound… unpleasant. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to be able to sleep through the night without having to get up every hour. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: That’s absolutely not too much to ask, Arlan. That’s a very reasonable goal, and we’ll do everything we can to help you achieve it. As for adjusting the medication, there's always a small risk of side effects, but we would start with a very low dose and monitor you closely. Common side effects can include dizziness or lightheadedness, but these are usually mild and temporary. We can also adjust the timing of the medication to minimize any discomfort. The other therapies I was referring to could include lifestyle changes – such as pelvic floor exercises – or, in some cases, more advanced procedures to reduce the size of the prostate. However, we would only consider those options if absolutely necessary, and we would discuss all the risks and benefits with you in detail. Right now, let's focus on getting the test results back and then we'll go from there. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Tests themselves… No, I think I understand. Urine sample, blood draw… not pleasant, but I've survived worse. Just hoping it doesn’t take too long to get the results. My wife gets very anxious when she has to wait for test results. She's the worrier in the family, you see. I just try to take things as they come. But she… well, she reads all those things online, and then she thinks the worst is always happening.
DOCTOR: It sounds like your wife is very proactive about your health, even if it does cause her some anxiety. It's good that she cares so much, though. And I understand your concern about waiting for the results. I’ll make sure to prioritize them, and the nurse will let you know as soon as they’re available. It should be within a couple of days, as I mentioned. In the meantime, try to stay relaxed and avoid dwelling on worst-case scenarios. Remember that frequent urination is often caused by something relatively minor, and we’ll get to the bottom of it. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Arlan?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I suppose I should just try to drink some water and avoid caffeine, and then wait for the results. Thank you for seeing me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arlan. It was my pleasure. And remember, if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms – such as fever, chills, or pain – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a copy of the lab request form, and the nurse will give you instructions on how to schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results. Take care, and have a good day.
