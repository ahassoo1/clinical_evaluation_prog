DOCTOR: Hi Emileigh, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Chriselda. It's nice to meet you too. I... I just moved here, and I think I need to, like, get signed up for healthcare? I have Medicare, I think... My husband helped with that, but I don't really remember all the details. It’s all kinda new.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright! Getting settled in a new place and figuring out healthcare can be a lot. We can definitely sort that out for you. And yes, you mentioned Medicare, which is a great start. Just to confirm, is your name Emileigh Bonck, and your date of birth…?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Emileigh Bonck. Um... let me think. August 12th... 2003? I think. It was a long time ago!
DOCTOR: Okay, great. August 12th, 2003. Thanks. So, aside from getting everything officially set up with Medicare – which we will do – are you currently experiencing any health concerns, or is there anything specific you wanted to discuss with me today?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really? I mean, I feel okay. I work with machines all day, so my back gets a little sore sometimes, but that's... normal, right? Nothing I can't just... work through. I don’t know if that’s something I need to tell a doctor about.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear you're feeling generally okay. And it is common to have back soreness with work like that. However, it's always good to mention things, even if you think they're normal, just so we have a complete picture. Can you tell me a little more about the soreness?
PATIENT: Um... it's mostly in my lower back. Like, right at the bottom. It kinda aches all day, and gets worse if I'm bending over a lot, or lifting stuff. It doesn’t, like, stop me from doing things, but... it's just there, you know? It's been going on for a while... maybe a year? I can’t really remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a year of lower back aching that worsens with bending and lifting. That's definitely something worth looking into a little further. Would you mind if I just take a quick look at your back and check your range of motion?
PATIENT: Oh, um, no, that's okay. If you think it's important, yeah, sure. I don’t mind. Just, like, tell me what you’re doing, okay? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll explain everything as I go. Okay, just relax your shoulders. I'm just feeling for any areas of tenderness. Does this feel particularly sore?
PATIENT: Yeah, that spot... right there. A little bit. Not, like, bad bad, but... yeah, I feel it. It kinda shoots a little bit down my leg when you push there sometimes. Not all the time, just... sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Shooting pain down the leg is something we definitely need to pay attention to. I'm just checking your reflexes now. This is just a quick tap on your knee. Everything seems pretty normal there. It looks like you have a slight forward lean. Based on what you've told me and this quick exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some mild lower back strain, possibly with some nerve irritation. But we'll want to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Okay... nerve irritation sounds scary. What does that mean? And what do you need to do to rule things out? I hope it's not something bad. I need to be able to work.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking questions, and it's completely understandable to be worried. Nerve irritation doesn’t necessarily mean something bad, but it does mean a nerve is being compressed or inflamed, which can cause pain, numbness, or weakness. In your case, it sounds like it might be mild, but we want to be thorough. To rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a few simple tests. Specifically, an X-ray to look at the bones in your spine, and possibly an MRI if the X-ray doesn’t give us enough information, which gives us a better view of the nerves and soft tissues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Um... X-ray sounds okay. I've had one before, I think. MRI sounds... bigger. What will it show, exactly? And is it expensive? I don't want to get stuck with a huge bill. I have Medicare, but I've heard stories...
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, and it's smart to ask about costs upfront. Medicare should cover the majority of the cost for both, but there might be a copay or deductible depending on your specific plan. I can have our billing department look into the estimated costs for you before we proceed, so you know exactly what to expect. An MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the structures in your spine. It's a really good way to visualize the nerves, discs, and other soft tissues that an X-ray doesn’t show. It can help us identify if there’s any disc bulging, nerve compression, or other issues causing your pain. It’s also a painless test, although it does involve lying still for a bit. For now, let's start with the X-ray. If the X-ray doesn’t give us enough information, then we can discuss the MRI further. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. X-ray first sounds good. And please, can you have someone check the cost for me? That would make me feel a lot better. I just... I don't want any surprises. When can I get it done?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll put in the order for the X-ray right now, and I'll have our scheduling department contact you to set up an appointment. They can also check with billing to give you a cost estimate. They should call you within 24 hours. In the meantime, to help manage your pain, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the label. Also, try to avoid heavy lifting and bending for the next few days. And just remember, we're going to get this figured out. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Chriselda. You've been really helpful. I feel a little less worried now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. I'm glad I could help. Just remember to follow up with the scheduling department, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
