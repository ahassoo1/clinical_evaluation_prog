DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's... the chest. My chest is hurting. It started a few days ago, maybe four? Not all the time, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. Four days, on and off. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm... how to explain... It's not a sharp pain, you know? More like... a squeezing. Like someone is hugging my chest too tight. And it feels... heavy. It's on this side mostly. <points to the left side of her chest> It doesn't go away completely, even when I'm resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, squeezing, heavy… primarily on the left side. And it doesn't fully resolve with rest. That's good to know. Does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Yes! Walking. Definitely walking. Even just going up the stairs makes it worse. And… when I get excited, or worried, it feels tighter. Like right now, talking about it! It’s silly, but true. What does that mean? Is it my heart? I worry a lot about my heart. My papa, he had problems with his heart, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, exertion and emotional stress bring it on. And a family history of heart problems… That's important information, Ms. Chelberg. It’s not silly to be concerned, given your family history. We need to take this seriously. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to get an EKG done, just to get a baseline reading. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. An EKG? Is that the thing with the stickers? My neighbor, Señora Rodriguez, she had one of those. It didn’t hurt, right? And… will it tell you what's wrong with my chest? I'm a little scared, Doctor. I don't want it to be something bad.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s the one. Stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It doesn’t hurt at all, just feels a little cold. And yes, it will give us a good amount of information about your heart’s electrical activity. It won’t tell us everything, but it’s a very important first step. We'll go over the results together. Now, let's get you comfortable on the exam table. I'm going to need you to remove your shirt and bra for the EKG, if you don’t mind. And I'll be right back with the technician to get that started, then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Sound good?
PATIENT: Okay. Stickers… and taking my shirt off. Yes, that’s alright. I trust you, Doctor. It's just… everything feels a little fast, you know? All this worrying, and now this. But yes, I'm ready. Just… maybe tell me what you're doing as you go? That would make me feel better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand. We'll take things one step at a time, and I'll explain everything as we go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. It helps me hear any unusual sounds. I'll listen in a few different spots on your chest and back. It will be cold, so try to relax. Then the technician will come in and apply the stickers for the EKG. Do you have any pain right now as I prepare?
PATIENT: No, not right now, Doctor. Just a little… anxious, maybe? It’s like a weight in my chest, but not the squeezing pain. More like… nervousness. You can listen whenever you're ready. And please, tell me what you hear, okay? Even if it's just, "Everything sounds normal." That would be good to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take deep breaths for me, please. In through your nose… and out through your mouth. Good. Okay… and another deep breath… and out. Okay… and one more deep breath… Good. I hear some slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs, but nothing terribly concerning at this stage. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's not loud, but we’ll need to investigate that further with the EKG and possibly some additional testing. It could be benign, but it’s best to be thorough. I'm going to call the technician now to get the EKG done. It shouldn't take too long.
PATIENT: Murmur? What does “murmur” mean, Doctor? Is that bad? Is my heart… broken? My papa… he had a bad murmur, I think. Oh dear. Please tell me it's not serious. This is making me very worried. I don't want to end up like my papa.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, please try to stay calm. A murmur is simply an unusual sound the heart makes when blood flows through it. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. Many people have innocent murmurs that don’t require any treatment. However, because of your family history, and the fact that you're experiencing chest pain, it's important that we investigate it further. Your papa's murmur could have been a different type entirely. We don’t know the specifics, and we can’t assume the same is true for you. The EKG will help us determine if there's any sign of a heart problem, such as an arrhythmia or evidence of a heart attack. It’s a simple test, and it doesn’t mean anything is definitely wrong. Let’s get that done first, and then we can discuss the results and decide on the best course of action. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Arrhythmia… that sounds scary. And a heart attack… oh dear. Okay, okay. I understand. EKG first. And then you’ll tell me what it says? You promise you’ll tell me everything, even if it’s not good? I just… I need to know. My papa never told me much about his heart, and I always wished I had asked more questions. I don't want to make the same mistake. <She fidgets with her hands, looking increasingly distressed.> Is the technician here yet?
DOCTOR: Yes, I promise you I will tell you everything, Ms. Chelberg. Even if it’s not what we want to hear. That’s my job. And you are absolutely right to ask questions – it’s important to be informed about your health. I’m here to answer them as best I can. The technician, Maria, is just outside now. She’ll explain the EKG procedure to you in detail and will be able to answer any questions you have about it. I will be right here in the room with you throughout the process. Would you like me to close the door for some privacy?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Close the door. And… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. I’m just… a little scared. This is all very overwhelming. <She takes a deep breath, trying to compose herself.> Let’s just get it over with. The sooner I know, the sooner I can stop worrying.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's perfectly understandable to be scared, Ms. Chelberg. Take your time. And remember, we are taking this one step at a time. Here comes Maria now. She’ll get you set up. I’ll be right here.
