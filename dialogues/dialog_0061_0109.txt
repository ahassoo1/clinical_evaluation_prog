DOCTOR: Bula and good day! I'm Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you, Mr. Brum. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor Kimm. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now? Not all the time, but… comes and goes. Like a dull ache, you know? Not a bad, sharp pain. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache at the back of your head for about three days, coming and going. That gives us a starting point. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More? Hmm… Okay. It feels worse when I… when I’m thinking hard. Like when I try to remember things from the rail yard… the numbers on the cars, or… what that one engine needed fixing. It’s… hard to explain. And when I bend over, it feels… tighter. Not awful, just… feels something’s pulling.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it gets worse with concentration and bending over. That's helpful. Now, when you say it started three days ago, did anything specific happen around then?
PATIENT: Specific? Let me think… Three days… I was… I was helping my grandson, Mateo, with his… his little garden. He wanted to build a fence. I was bending a lot, holding the wood… maybe that’s it? It was a hot day, too. Very hot. I had plenty of water, but… still hot.
DOCTOR: Okay, helping Mateo with the garden fence three days ago, a lot of bending, and a hot day. That sounds like it could be related. Have you had headaches like this before, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No, not like this. I get… little headaches sometimes. When I’m tired, or haven’t eaten. But those go away with a little rest and some food. This… this feels different. It's… deeper. And it doesn't always go away with rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, different from your usual headaches. Deeper and doesn’t necessarily respond to rest. Let’s do a quick check of your neck and head, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just gently feel around and ask you to move your head in a few directions. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Gentle is good. My bones… they get old, you know? Not as strong as they used to be. But yes, you can check.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax as much as you can. I'm just feeling for any tenderness or stiffness. Can you look up towards the ceiling for me?
PATIENT: There… yes. That feels… a little tight. Not a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a pull.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a bit of tightness in the muscles at the base of your skull. And you're right, looking up does seem to aggravate it. Now, can you try turning your head to the left, slowly, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: There's a… a little click. I always get a click there. Old age, I think. It doesn’t hurt, but… I feel it. And the ache feels… a little stronger now. Just a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed some limited range of motion and a bit of tenderness. And you’re right, you do have a slight click when you turn your head. It sounds like you might be experiencing some muscle tension in your neck, possibly related to helping Mateo with the fence. It's likely a strain, though we want to rule out anything more serious. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… Let me think. No… no fever. Not dizzy. My eyes… they feel okay. I haven’t seen any… spots, or anything like that. No trouble sleeping… well, old men don’t sleep well anyway, but… no worse than usual. My hands… they tremble a little, but they always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no dizziness, no vision changes, and your sleep and hand tremors are consistent with your usual. That’s good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, the doctor back home… he said my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. But I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, a long time. Since my wife… since Elena passed. And my knees… they bother me when it rains. But that's just old age again, I think. No big illnesses, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. High blood pressure in the past, and some knee pain. Any surgeries or hospital stays that you remember?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. Not even for my teeth! Elena… my wife… she always said I was too stubborn to let anyone near me with a knife. No hospital stays either. I’ve always been… lucky, I guess. Just a few scrapes and bruises from the rail yard, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospital stays. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not any medications. I don’t like taking pills. Elena always said they make you feel worse than what you’re trying to fix. I just… try to rest when I need to. And drink plenty of water.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything Elena cooked, and she put everything in those dishes! No… no allergies. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. So, to summarize, you’re a 90-year-old male with a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, experiencing a dull ache at the back of your head for three days, worsened by concentration and bending, likely related to helping your grandson with a garden fence. You have some knee pain and hand tremors, but otherwise, you’re healthy and don’t take any medications or have any allergies. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing a muscle strain in your neck. However, given your age and the fact that this is a new symptom, I'd like to be cautious. I'm going to recommend an X-ray of your neck to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… hmm. I don’t like… all those machines. But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, then yes. If it will make sure nothing is… broken. Yes, do the X-ray.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly reasonable. We'll get that ordered right away. We'll also give you a muscle relaxant to help with the pain and stiffness. I'll write you a prescription for that as well. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity, use a warm compress on your neck for 20 minutes at a time a few times a day, and take it easy. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Warm compress… yes, I can do that. Elena always said warm cloths were good for everything. The muscle relaxant… will it make me sleepy? I like to… read, you know? Don't want to fall asleep in the middle of a good book. And… how long will it take for the X-ray results to come back?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. The muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness in some people, but it varies. We'll start you on a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it makes you too sleepy, you can always stop taking it. And we can explore other options if needed. The X-ray results should be available within a few hours. The technician will let me know as soon as they are ready, and I’ll review them and discuss them with you. We should have a good idea of what’s going on by the end of the day. Do you have any other concerns, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very well. I appreciate you taking the time… and not rushing me. Old men… we take a long time to say things.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Brum. Taking the time to understand what’s going on is the most important thing. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. The technician will be in to take you for the X-ray shortly. They’ll let me know as soon as the results are ready. In the meantime, if the pain gets significantly worse or you develop any new symptoms, like numbness or weakness, please don’t hesitate to let me or the nursing staff know. Here’s the prescription for the muscle relaxant. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. I'll check back in with you as soon as I have those X-ray results. Do you have any difficulty getting home today, or will you be driving yourself?
PATIENT: I have Mateo coming to pick me up. He’s a good boy. Always helping his old grandfather. I don’t drive anymore. My eyes… they aren’t what they used to be. Thank you, Doctor. For everything.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you have Mateo to help. And you’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It was my pleasure. Please, just relax and let us take care of everything here. I'll see you soon with those results. In the meantime, if you need anything at all, don't hesitate to ask. Have a pleasant day, and I'll see you shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Kimm. You too. .
