DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in my… body odor. It just doesn't smell like me anymore, if that makes sense. It's been going on for maybe a month or so now.
DOCTOR: A change in body odor. Right. And you say this has been occurring for approximately one month. Can you be more specific about the… alteration?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's…hard to describe. It’s not worse, exactly. Just…different. Sweeter, maybe? And a little…sour? It's not like I’ve changed anything - same soap, same deodorant, same everything. I usually smell pretty neutral, you know? Not flowery or anything, just…clean. This is just…not that. It's definitely noticeable when I'm working, which is a bit worrying. I lay flooring, so I’m pretty active all day.
DOCTOR: “Sweeter and sour,” you say. And this is occurring despite maintaining your usual hygiene regimen. Do you notice it all the time, or is it more pronounced after physical exertion, such as during your work?
PATIENT: Definitely more when I'm working. Like, if I’m just sitting around, I don’t really smell anything. But as soon as I start bending and lifting and stuff, that’s when it becomes…obvious. I always shower right after work, and it usually goes away then, but it comes back the next day when I start moving again. I don’t always notice it on my days off, but sometimes I get a whiff and think, "Oh, there it is again." It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. We must approach this systematically. Now, Ms. Purtee, I need a complete medical history. Have you experienced any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat pretty much the same things I always have. Lots of vegetables, some chicken or fish, rice, injera when I can get it… Nothing new or drastically different, no. I haven't been trying any new weight loss programs or anything like that either. Same coffee every morning! I'm a creature of habit, Doctor. That's probably why I noticed the smell change, to be honest. Everything else is the same.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had a little cold back in April, but that was it. Just a sniffle and a sore throat for a few days, nothing I needed to see a doctor for. Haven't been to the hospital or anything in years, thankfully. Just my usual aches and pains from working, you know? My back gets a little stiff sometimes, but that’s just part of the job.
DOCTOR: And any changes in your medications?
PATIENT: Oh, right. I’m on Medicare, so they cover my blood pressure medicine. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. I've been taking it for about five years now. The dosage hasn't changed, though. Same pills every month. And that's it, Doctor. Just the blood pressure medicine. Nothing else. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to family history. Are there any… unusual odors or medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a tricky one. My mother, she always smelled…strongly of spices, from all her cooking, but that wasn't unusual. She cooked all day! My father, he didn’t have any particular smell, as far as I remember. No one in my family has ever talked about any strange smells or anything like that, not medical conditions either. Lots of high blood pressure, like me, but that's about it. No diabetes, no heart disease… honestly, we mostly just age well, if you know what I mean. A little stiff, a little achy, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Purtee, I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. I’ll need you to change into a gown. We’ll start with a general assessment, and then I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your skin. I understand this may be…uncomfortable, but it is necessary to rule out any underlying medical causes.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. A physical exam… right. I didn’t expect that. Is it…is it because of the smell? I mean, is there something visible that’s causing it? I…I suppose that makes sense. Yes, okay. I’ll change. Where’s the changing room?
DOCTOR: Down the hall, first door on the left. I will return shortly to conduct the examination. Please be expeditious.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you.
DOCTOR: …Elevated cholesterol. As expected.
