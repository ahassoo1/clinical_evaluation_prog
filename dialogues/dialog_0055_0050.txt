DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I am Dr. Eaddy. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… this cough. Been hangin' on for a while now. A dry cough, mostly. Feels like… like somethin' ticklin' the back of my throat, but nothin' comes up. It’s just… there. I don’t rightly remember when it started, to be honest. A long time, I think. My wife… she always took care of these things.
DOCTOR: A cough for some time, you say. It’s understandable to be unsure of precise timing. We’ll try to piece things together. And I see here you are ninety years young. It's quite common for things to… blur, as we get older. A dry cough… and you mention it feels like something tickling the back of your throat. Has it been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, I suppose. More often than not, it's there… just a little tickle. But sometimes it gets worse, especially when… when it's cold, or dusty. I used to work on cars, you see. Automotive repair. Lots of dust and fumes back then. Not much of that anymore, though. I’m retired. A long time retired. Does that make sense? It's… hard to remember details sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's… helpful. Automotive repair, significant dust exposure. It’s important to consider all possibilities. And you mentioned it worsens with cold or dust. Do you experience any other symptoms with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Not really… no fever, I don’t think. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that could just be… old age. And… sometimes I get a little short of breath when I walk up the stairs. But I always have, to be honest. It’s just… gettin’ old, I figure. My wife… she used to say I needed to slow down. Now she's the one who's slowed down. I miss her. But… nothin' else, really. No chest pain, no… wheezing, I don’t think. Just the cough and a little tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, fatigue, some shortness of breath…which you've experienced for some time. It's good you’re able to differentiate what's new versus what’s been ongoing. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like heart problems, lung disease, diabetes?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… Oh dear. My wife always kept track of these things. I… I really don't know. I went to the doctor when she was alive, of course, but she did all the talkin’. She said somethin’ about my blood pressure bein’ a little high once, a long time ago. But I don't think I ever took any medicine for it. And… I don’t remember anything about lung disease. I smoked a few cigarettes when I was young, a long time ago, but I quit when I got married. She didn’t like it. No diabetes, I don't think. I always liked sweets, but she kept me in check. I’m sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Pavlovic. We will gather what information we can. High blood pressure, potential past smoking… We’ll note that. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me see… I broke my arm once, when I was a boy, fell out of a tree. That was a long time ago. And… I think my wife had to take me to the hospital when I had the flu, a really bad one, maybe twenty years ago? But that was just for a few days. Nothing serious. I don't think I've ever been in the hospital for anything… long term. Not that I remember, anyway. She did all the rememberin’. Honestly, Doctor, I'm just a simple man. Never caused much trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fractured arm in childhood, brief hospitalization for influenza. And no known significant surgical history. Now, let’s discuss medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a one. Haven’t taken anythin’ regularly in… well, a long time. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's about it. I don’t much believe in pills. My wife… she took a few things for her arthritis, but I never got into it. Just try to stay active, that’s what I always said. Though, gettin’ older makes that harder and harder. I don’t take nothin’. Just… air and water. And maybe a little sunshine when it’s out.
DOCTOR: Very well. No current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with pollen, or… or anything like that. I used to work with all sorts of chemicals at the garage, but I never had a reaction. My wife… she was allergic to cats, but I wasn’t. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Just… old age, maybe. That’s about all that bothers me these days. Though, dust does make me cough, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… irritates my throat.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. We'll proceed with a brief examination. It would be helpful to listen to your lungs and heart. Please take a deep breath for me. I’m hearing some mild wheezing in the lower lobes, and your breath sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular, but somewhat distant. I’m also noting some mild edema in your ankles. Is this swelling new, or has it been present for some time?
PATIENT: Edema… swelling? Oh, you mean my ankles. I hadn’t really noticed, to be honest. They’ve been a little puffy lately, maybe. But… I figured it was just from sittin’ around too much. I don’t get out as much as I used to. Has it been present for some time? Hmm… I don’t know, Doctor. Probably. I don’t really pay much attention to my feet. My wife… she always noticed these things. She’d rub them for me sometimes. It was nice. Probably been there a while, yeah. Just… old age, I suppose. Everything’s swellin’ up these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age, history of potential smoking, chronic cough, and findings on examination – mild wheezing, diminished breath sounds, and ankle edema – I suspect this could be related to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or COPD, possibly exacerbated by some degree of heart failure. However, a definitive diagnosis requires further investigation. I would like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to assess your lung function and heart health. We will also need to check your oxygen saturation level. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. COPD… heart failure… those sound… serious. I don’t rightly know what all that means, Doctor. X-ray… EKG… oxygen… Are those painful? I don’t like pain much. My wife… she always told me to avoid doctors if I could. But… if you think it’s necessary… I suppose I trust your judgment. I just… don’t want to be poked and prodded too much. Is it going to cost a lot of money? I don’t have much saved up.
DOCTOR: The chest X-ray is painless, Mr. Pavlovic. It simply involves standing in front of a machine for a few moments. The EKG involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to monitor your heart’s electrical activity – also painless. As for the oxygen saturation level, we'll simply use a small clip on your finger. Regarding the cost, I understand your concerns. Given your lack of insurance, I can discuss options with our billing department to see if we can arrange a payment plan or explore potential financial assistance programs. We will do everything we can to make this affordable for you. I believe these tests are necessary to determine the best course of action and ensure your well-being.
PATIENT: Well… if it’s not painful… and you can help with the cost… I suppose I can go along with it. I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded, but… I don’t want to just sit here and cough my life away. My wife… she always said I needed to take care of myself. So… yes. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… go easy on me, alright?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Pavlovic. We'll proceed with the tests as gently as possible. The nurse will come in shortly to take your vital signs and prepare you for the X-ray and EKG. I will review the results as soon as they are available and discuss them with you. .
