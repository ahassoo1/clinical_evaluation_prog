DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a…a popping or clicking sensation in my back. It’s not constant, but it’s certainly noticeable, and frankly, a little concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sensation in your back for a few weeks. I see. And is this associated with any pain, Mr. Mastrantonio?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, usually right after the pop. Other times, there’s no pain at all, just the sound. It seems to happen more when I’m…bending or twisting, you know, like when I’m working on something under the hood of a car. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, the ache follows the popping or clicking, and it’s triggered by bending and twisting movements, particularly when you're, ah…working on cars. Could you tell me a bit more about where exactly in your back you're feeling this?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s mostly in my lower back, Doctor, right around where my spine curves in. Sometimes it feels like it’s radiating a little bit to my left side, but mostly it's centered. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, you know how it is with back pain. But if I had to show you, I’d say right here… .
DOCTOR: Right, the small of your back, with some radiation to the left side. I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint. Has anything specific caused this to start?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Honestly, no, not that I can recall. I haven’t had any injuries, no falls, no lifting anything unusually heavy. It just…started gradually. I’ve been doing this work – electrical and electronics in transportation equipment, cars mostly – for twenty years now, so it's possible it's just wear and tear, but I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I usually keep pretty good form when I'm working, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset, no specific injury, twenty years of electrical work… I see. And has this been impacting your ability to do your work at all, Mr. Mastrantonio?
PATIENT: Yes, it has, a little. It’s not stopping me completely, but I find myself being more cautious, trying to avoid certain movements. It slows me down, definitely. And sometimes, after a long day, it's a little difficult to get comfortable. I don’t want it to become something serious, you know? I enjoy my work, and I need to be able to do it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s good that you’re paying attention to it and wanting to address it now. Let's get some more information. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No numbness, no tingling, and no weakness at all in my legs or feet. Everything feels normal there. I was a little concerned about that possibility, so I’ve been checking. .
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s reassuring. Now, thinking more broadly, have you noticed any other symptoms – things like fever, unexplained weight loss, or bowel or bladder problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. No fever, no weight loss, and my bowel and bladder function are completely normal. Really, it’s just the popping and occasional ache in my lower back. It's just… annoying and concerning. .
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking any medications regularly. Just over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally for a headache, that’s it. And I don't have any known allergies to medications. I did have a reaction to penicillin as a child, but that was many years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, only occasional over-the-counter pain relievers, and a childhood reaction to penicillin. Good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Okay. Please lie down on your back for me. We'll start with some basic range of motion tests. I’m going to gently have you bend forward, backward, and to each side. And I’ll also be feeling along your spine and the muscles in your lower back. Please let me know immediately if you feel any sharp pain. Okay…bending forward…any pain there?
PATIENT: Okay, bending forward… a little bit of tightness, but no sharp pain. It’s just a bit uncomfortable. Like a stretch, more than anything. And a little bit of that clicking sensation when I reach a certain point. It's not a sudden pain, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright, tightness and clicking with forward bending. Now, let's try bending backward…any discomfort there?
PATIENT: Okay, bending backward… actually, that feels a little better than bending forward. Still some tightness, but no clicking or sharp pain. It’s a mild stretch. I can feel a little bit of give in the muscles, but nothing alarming.
DOCTOR: Alright, less discomfort with backward bending. Okay, now let’s see how it feels bending to each side… please bend to the right…and now to the left. Let me know if anything feels different or causes pain.
PATIENT: Okay, bending to the right… that feels fairly normal. A little bit of stretching, but no pain. And now to the left… hmm. That feels a little tighter on the left side. Still no sharp pain, but I definitely feel more resistance, and that clicking sensation is more pronounced on that side when I bend over.
DOCTOR: Alright, more tightness and clicking on the left side with lateral bending. Okay, I'm going to do a quick straight leg raise test. Just let your leg extend straight up as I lift it. Let me know if you feel any pain shooting down your leg. We'll start with the right leg…
PATIENT: Okay, lifting the right leg… no pain, Doctor. Nothing shooting down my leg. It’s just a normal stretch, like when you exercise.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain with the right leg raise. Now, let’s try the left leg…
PATIENT: Okay, lifting the left leg… hmm. A little bit of tightness in my hamstring, but still no pain shooting down my leg. It feels…similar to the right side, maybe just a tad more tension. Nothing concerning, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, range of motion is somewhat limited with forward and lateral bending, particularly to the left. Palpation reveals some muscle tenderness in the lower back. Straight leg raise is negative bilaterally. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it seems likely you’re experiencing a muscle strain or mild facet joint irritation. It doesn’t appear to be anything more serious like a disc herniation or nerve compression. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: That’s…reassuring to hear, Doctor. A muscle strain or facet joint irritation sounds much better than something more serious. No, I don't have any questions about that so far. What kind of treatment would you recommend?
DOCTOR: Okay. Typically, for a muscle strain or mild facet joint irritation, we start with conservative management. That includes rest, ice for the first 24-48 hours, and then heat after that. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help with the pain and inflammation. Gentle stretching and low-impact exercise, like walking, can also be beneficial. I’m going to recommend a course of physical therapy – three times a week for a few weeks – to help strengthen your back muscles and improve your flexibility. I'll also prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the muscle spasms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds like a very reasonable plan, Doctor. Physical therapy and a muscle relaxant seem like a good approach. I'm happy to try that. And just out of curiosity, is there anything I can do at home, besides rest, ice, and heat, to help speed up the recovery?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. In addition to rest, ice, and heat, there are a few things you can do at home. Gentle stretching – things like knee-to-chest stretches or pelvic tilts – can help improve your flexibility and reduce muscle tension. Maintaining good posture is also important – avoid slouching and try to keep your back straight when you're sitting or standing. And be mindful of your movements. Avoid any activities that aggravate your pain, and lift with your legs, not your back. I'll provide you with a handout with specific stretches and exercises you can do at home. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That’s very helpful, thank you. I appreciate the handout – that will definitely be useful. No, I don't think I have any further questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. When should I expect to see improvement, and when should I follow up with you?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Most people experience some improvement within a week or two with conservative management. However, it can take several weeks for the pain to completely resolve. I’d like to see you back in two weeks to assess your progress. If your pain worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as numbness, tingling, or weakness – please call the office to schedule an appointment sooner. I'm going to write you a prescription for the muscle relaxant and a referral to physical therapy. The nurse will review the medication instructions and schedule your physical therapy appointment before you leave. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that works perfectly, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and thorough examination. I feel much better knowing what's going on and having a plan of action. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mastrantonio. I’m glad I could help. Remember to listen to your body, and don’t push yourself too hard. If you have any questions or concerns after you leave, please don't hesitate to call the office. The nurse will be in shortly to go over everything with you. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: .
