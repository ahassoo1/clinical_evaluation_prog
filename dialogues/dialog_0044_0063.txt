DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor Asami. Nice to meet you too. Um, my back. It’s been really bad. Worse than usual, even. It started, I think, maybe a week ago? It’s just… a lot of pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, back pain. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Sure. It's… hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain, all at once. It’s more… a heavy ache. Like someone is sitting on my back, you know? And it goes down my leg sometimes. Not all the way to my foot, but… to my knee. And it's worse when I stand for long, or when I try to bend over. Even just twisting to look behind me is bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, a heavy ache that radiates down your leg to the knee, worsened by standing, bending, and twisting. That gives me a good starting point. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant, yeah. But it gets worse. Like, all day it’s there, this ache. But if I’m doing something… like washing dishes, or walking to the store… it really flares up. Then I have to sit down. Sitting helps a little, but even that gets uncomfortable after a while. It's just… always something.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s a baseline ache that’s aggravated by activity. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: Um… not really, honestly. Maybe… when I’m laying down flat? That takes some of the pressure off. And… warm water feels good for a little bit. Like, a warm shower. But it doesn’t last long. It always comes back, though. It just… doesn't stay better.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat and warm water provide some temporary relief. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot along with the pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. Not all the time, but… in my foot, mostly. Like when it’s really bad, my toes feel kinda… prickly. And numb. Not totally numb, but like… asleep. It goes away when I sit down and rest, though. It doesn't happen all the time, but it's there sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness and tingling in your toes that comes and goes with the pain. That's helpful to know. Now, have you had any injuries to your back recently?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Nothing I can remember, anyway. I work at the factory, packing boxes. It's… a lot of bending and twisting, but nothing happened happened. Just… always this ache. It’s been going on for a while. I had tests a few years back, the doctor found… something. Cancer, he said.
DOCTOR: A few years back, you had tests and were told you had cancer?
PATIENT: Yeah. In my… bones, he said. It was… not good. They did treatments, for a while. They stopped a little while ago, though. Everything was… okay, he said, but I still have this pain. And now it's worse than ever. That’s why I’m here, I guess. I’m worried it's… something else happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Meigs, especially given your history. It’s good you came in. Let’s take a look at your records to see what those previous tests showed, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Please. Anything to figure out what's going on. I just… I don’t want it to get worse. And I don't want it to be… you know. Bad again.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Alright, it looks like you had imaging done in 2022 that showed… some metastatic disease to the lumbar spine. You underwent a course of radiation therapy, and the reports indicate stable disease at your last follow-up. However, it's been about a year since that last scan. Before we talk more about that, let's do a quick exam. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, that makes sense. A year is a long time. Okay, I’m laying down. Be careful, please. It hurts when I move.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, Ms. Meigs, I'm just gently feeling along your spine. Let me know if anything is particularly painful. Okay, can you gently try to bend forward for me, as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: Okay. Ooh… that’s… that hurts. Not a sharp pain, but just… a lot of pressure. I can’t go very far, though. It gets too bad. I can't really bend over much. It's just too much.
DOCTOR: I see. Okay, that’s helpful to know. Alright, now I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation. This just helps me see if there's any impact on the nerves in your legs. Can you point your toes up and down for me?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. I can do that. It’s a little hard, though. It feels… weak. Not completely weak, but… not as strong as it used to be. It gets harder the longer I do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, I notice some slight weakness with dorsiflexion. Now I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your feet and legs. Please tell me if you can feel that, and where you feel it. We’re just checking your sensation. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. I can feel it… mostly. But it feels… kinda numb in my toes. Not all the way, but… less feeling there. Everything else feels… okay, I think. But my toes… they're not as sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased sensation in your toes. Alright, Ms. Meigs, thank you for letting me examine you. Based on the exam, I’m noting some tenderness along your spine, limited range of motion, slight weakness in your dorsiflexion, and decreased sensation in your toes. Given your history of metastatic disease to the spine, these findings are concerning for potential disease progression. However, it’s also possible that these symptoms are related to something else, like a nerve compression or muscle strain. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some imaging—an MRI of your lumbar spine—to evaluate the extent of any disease and identify any potential sources of nerve compression. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I want to know what’s going on. MRI sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… I don’t want this to get worse. And I need to know what we’re dealing with. If that will help find out, then yes, please do it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your concerns, Ms. Meigs. An MRI will give us the information we need to make the best decisions for your care. I’ll get the order placed for that right away. It usually takes a few days to schedule, and the scan itself takes about 30-45 minutes. We'll call you as soon as we have an appointment time. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever to help manage your symptoms. It's important to take these as directed, and to avoid any activities that aggravate your pain. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Muscle relaxant and pain reliever… yeah, I could use that. Thank you. Um… will the MRI… will it show if the cancer has gotten bigger? That's what I'm worried about, mostly. And… is there anything I should do before the MRI? Anything I need to avoid?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ms. Meigs. Yes, the MRI will show us if there's been any progression of the disease. It's the best way to evaluate the current state of things. As for preparation, please let the radiology technician know about your history of cancer and any metal implants you may have. You'll be asked to fill out a safety questionnaire before the scan. Also, if you have any claustrophobia, please let us know so we can discuss options for making you more comfortable during the scan. I'm also going to give you a referral to an oncologist, just to have them review the imaging results and discuss long-term management options with you. Would you like me to recommend Dr. Anya Sharma?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Dr. Sharma sounds good. That sounds… right. It's good to have someone looking at the big picture, too. Not just the pain, but everything. Thank you. Um… is it bad if I'm worried? I mean, I am worried. It's been a while since I had treatment, and this pain is… bad.
DOCTOR: It is absolutely not bad to be worried, Ms. Meigs. In fact, it's perfectly natural to feel anxious given your history and current symptoms. It's a significant concern, and it's okay to acknowledge those feelings. I want you to feel comfortable expressing anything that's on your mind. We’re here to support you through this. I will get the MRI scheduled and send the referral to Dr. Sharma right away. In the meantime, if your pain becomes unbearable or you experience any new symptoms—like weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or fever—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor Asami. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you listening. I’ll wait to hear about the MRI. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the MRI scheduled. Here are the prescriptions and the referral information. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you. Goodbye.
