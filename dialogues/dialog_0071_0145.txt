DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bahta. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lonell Bahta. I am here… well, I believe it is regarding getting approval for some help at home. For my mother. She is… getting older, and needs assistance. I have the paperwork, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, assistance for your mother. Of course. Paperwork is always a good starting point. Though, to be thorough, I do like to get a bit of background information myself, if you don’t mind. It helps me understand the full picture. But please, feel free to show me the paperwork whenever you’re ready. Let’s start with… how old is your mother, and what kind of assistance is she currently needing?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. My mother is eighty-seven years of age. She… she finds it difficult to do much around the house now. Cooking, cleaning… things like that. And she… she has some trouble remembering things, sometimes. It is not… severe, but enough to make things difficult for her, and for me. I am trying to help as much as I can, but I also have my own work, you understand. I am a surgeon, myself. Pediatric, actually.
DOCTOR: Eighty-seven, alright. And a very demanding profession yourself, a pediatric surgeon! I can certainly appreciate a busy schedule. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. The memory concerns… has that been a recent development, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: It has been… gradual, Doctor. Over the last… perhaps six months, it has become more noticeable. At first, it was just forgetting where she put her glasses, or misplacing the television remote. But now… now she sometimes forgets what day it is, or what she had for breakfast. It worries me, of course. It is not like her at all. She was always very sharp.
DOCTOR: Six months, gradual onset… and a change from her usual sharp mind. Alright. Has she had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Fortunately, no falls, Doctor. She is… quite cautious, actually. She refuses to do anything she feels is even remotely unsafe. But that, of course, limits what she can do. She worries a great deal about falling, which is… understandable, I suppose. It is a bit of a Catch-22. She is careful, but that means she avoids things, and that makes things more difficult for her, overall.
DOCTOR: A valid concern, certainly. Avoiding things can lead to further decline. Has she seen a doctor about these memory issues specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She saw Doctor Dubois, her general practitioner, about three months ago. He… he ran some tests. Blood work, and… a small examination. He said it was likely just age-related memory loss. He suggested some exercises to keep her mind active, but… honestly, she has not been very diligent with them. She finds them… frustrating. And she is not one for puzzles, you see. She always preferred reading.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. Dubois… and some basic testing. I see. And has she been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She has… arthritis, in her hips and knees. It causes her some pain, which makes it difficult for her to get around, naturally. And she does have slightly high blood pressure, but it is generally well-controlled with medication. She takes a small pill each morning. Doctor Dubois monitors it regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis and controlled hypertension. And any allergies to medications that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: To the best of my knowledge, no allergies, Doctor. She has been taking medication for many years, and has never had a reaction to any of it. Doctor Dubois always asks, of course, and she always confirms. She is very careful about those things. She remembers everything concerning her health, it is… peculiar, really. The memory issues are only with recent events, not with things like her medications.
DOCTOR: Recent events, but not established health routines… that is interesting. And is she currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She takes something for her arthritis, as well. A small white pill, I believe. And occasionally, if the pain is particularly bad, she will take an over-the-counter pain reliever, like… ibuprofen, perhaps. But only when absolutely necessary. She prefers to manage the pain with gentle exercise, if possible. And warm baths. She is a firm believer in warm baths.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis medication, occasional ibuprofen… We're getting a good picture here. Now, before we move on, let’s talk a little about her social life. Does she have many visitors?
PATIENT: Not as many as she used to, Doctor. My father passed away five years ago, and she… she has struggled since then. She has a few friends, but they are all… elderly, and not very mobile themselves. I visit her every weekend, of course, and my sister tries to come when she can, but she lives quite far away. Mostly, she keeps to herself. She enjoys reading, as I mentioned, and watching television. But it is… quiet, for her.
DOCTOR: I see. Losing a spouse is… significant. And a quieter social life can certainly contribute. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a baseline. I’d like to check her blood pressure, listen to her heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment – just to see how things are functioning. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I understand it is all part of the process. She is… a little stubborn, sometimes, but I am sure she will cooperate. She always respects a doctor's opinion. Is there anything I should do to prepare her? Or any questions I should ask her beforehand?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just let her know I’m going to listen to her heart and lungs, and check her reflexes a bit. We'll keep it as brief as possible. Perhaps you could just mention it's standard procedure to get a complete picture of her health?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I will explain it to her as clearly as I can. She will appreciate knowing it is standard procedure. If you will excuse me for a moment, I will go and fetch her. She is in the sitting room. She may be a little… surprised to see us. She was not expecting visitors this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course. Take your time. I'll be here when you're ready.
