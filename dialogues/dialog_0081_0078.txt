DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, or a jumpstart, to get my health back on track. I’m not really sure where to begin, honestly. It’s just…everything feels a little off, you know?
DOCTOR: “Off” is rather broad, Ms. Pitzel. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s difficult to pinpoint, truly. My energy levels are…low, consistently. And my sleep isn’t what it used to be – I wake up several times during the night. I also seem to be…forgetful lately. Not major things, but little things. Where I put my keys, appointments…it’s frustrating. And frankly, I’ve put on a little weight despite trying to eat reasonably well. It all just feels…disconnected.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s try to untangle this. You mentioned low energy, disrupted sleep, some forgetfulness, and weight gain. Let’s start with the energy. When did you first start noticing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I believe it started…perhaps six months ago? It wasn’t sudden, more of a gradual decline. At first, I thought it was just stress from work, but it hasn’t improved even when things calmed down. I used to be able to do so much more…gardening, walking with my husband…now, everything feels like a bit of an effort.
DOCTOR: And how would you rate this fatigue on a scale of one to ten, with one being barely noticeable and ten being completely debilitating?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Debilitating is…certainly not it. Perhaps a…six? On a good day, it’s a five, but more often it’s a six or seven. It doesn’t stop me from doing everything, but it definitely slows me down and makes things less enjoyable. I find myself needing to rest more frequently throughout the day.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod, making another note. A six or seven is significant. Okay, let’s move on to the sleep disturbances. Can you describe what happens when you wake up during the night?
PATIENT: Well, it's not that I wake up feeling unwell, necessarily. It’s more…restless. I’ll wake up, and my mind is racing. I’ll think about work, or things I need to do, or just…random thoughts. Sometimes I’ll get up and read for a bit, then go back to bed. Other times, I just lie there for a long time before falling back asleep. It happens…at least three or four times a night, I would say.
DOCTOR: And does this disrupted sleep leave you feeling tired or groggy in the morning?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. I rarely feel truly rested when I wake up. I usually need a cup or two of coffee just to get going. And even then, it takes a while for me to feel…fully alert. My husband says I’m a bit grumpy in the mornings, which I suppose is fair. It doesn't ruin my day, but it certainly doesn't start it off well.
DOCTOR: <stage>I make a note of the coffee dependence and irritability. Classic signs. Alright, let's address the forgetfulness you mentioned. You said little things…can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just yesterday, I made a grocery list, and I left it…on the kitchen counter, of course. I went to the store and completely forgot it! I had to call my husband to remind me what we needed. And I’ve been missing appointments occasionally, even though I write them down. It’s small things like that. Nothing terribly serious, but…concerning. It’s not like I'm losing my mind, but it’s definitely not my usual self.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pitzel, I see from your chart you've been a Medicare patient since 2020. Any recent hospitalizations or significant illnesses that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Nothing significant. I had a bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but that’s it. I generally try to stay healthy. I see my primary care doctor for annual check-ups, and everything has always been…normal, really. That’s why this is so… puzzling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a low-dose aspirin, as recommended by my doctor for heart health. And occasionally, ibuprofen for headaches. That’s it, really. No regular prescriptions or anything like that. I prefer to avoid medication if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about your diet and exercise habits. You mentioned trying to eat reasonably well…can you elaborate on what that looks like for you on a typical day?
PATIENT: Well, I try to have a balanced diet. Lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein… I enjoy cooking, so I usually make meals from scratch. We have fish a couple of times a week. I do enjoy a sweet treat occasionally, I must admit – a small piece of chocolate after dinner, perhaps. And my husband and I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive, though.
DOCTOR: And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Oh, that's where things get…difficult. I used to be very active. I loved gardening, walking, even dancing. But lately, with the fatigue, it’s been harder to motivate myself. I try to take a walk a few times a week, but it’s usually a short one. And I do some light stretching. It's not nearly as much as I used to do, though. It feels…challenging, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how would you describe your stress levels?
PATIENT: Well, I'd say moderate. Work can be stressful at times, I'm a molder, shaper and caster, you know, so there's always deadlines and demands. But it's nothing I can't handle. My husband and I have a good relationship, and we enjoy spending time together. We have a few close friends. So, I wouldn't say I'm overly stressed. Although, I worry about my grandchildren, of course, like any grandmother.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any significant medical history in your family?
PATIENT: Let me think… My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes. And my aunt on my mother’s side had Alzheimer’s disease, unfortunately. But other than that, not really. No history of heart disease or cancer, as far as I know. It’s difficult to say for certain, of course, as my family is back in Colombia, and we don’t always have access to complete medical records.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better overall picture. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright.
DOCTOR: Your weight is 115 pounds, and your blood pressure is 130/80. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And finally, I’ll do a quick neurological assessment. Neurological exam is within normal limits. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. However, given your symptoms – the fatigue, sleep disturbances, forgetfulness, and family history – I want to run some blood tests.
PATIENT: That sounds…reasonable. What sort of blood tests are you thinking? And will they take long to get the results? I have a dinner engagement next week, and I wouldn’t want to cancel it if I don’t need to.
DOCTOR: We'll start with a complete blood count to rule out anemia or infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, a thyroid panel to assess your thyroid hormone levels, and a vitamin D level. And, given your family history, I'm going to add a vitamin B12 level and a test to screen for early signs of cognitive impairment. It's just a precaution, Ms. Pitzel. The results should be back within five to seven business days. You don’t need to cancel your dinner engagement. Once I have the results, I’ll give you a call to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I would encourage you to prioritize good sleep hygiene – try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, and create a relaxing bedtime routine. And stay hydrated.
PATIENT: That sounds very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. Good sleep hygiene… I’ll certainly try. And staying hydrated is always a good idea. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. It's easy to feel like I’m just…getting old, you know? Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any particular foods I should avoid?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel that way, Ms. Pitzel, but it’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes. And I assure you, your concerns are valid. In the meantime, try to avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol, especially in the evenings. A balanced diet is key—focus on lean protein, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. And try to manage stress through relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation. I also want you to keep a symptom diary. Note down when you feel particularly fatigued, when you have difficulty sleeping, and any instances of forgetfulness. This will help me get a better understanding of your patterns and identify potential triggers. If anything changes drastically or worsens, please don't hesitate to call my office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: That’s all very helpful, Doctor. A symptom diary… yes, I can certainly do that. I think I’m good for now. I just… wanted to feel like someone was listening, and you’ve definitely done that. Thank you again, Dr. Paulino. I look forward to hearing from you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I'm glad I could help. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before then. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and enjoy your dinner engagement next week. .
