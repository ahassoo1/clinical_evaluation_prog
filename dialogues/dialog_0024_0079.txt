DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's about my bruising. It's been...worse lately, and I'm on blood thinners, so it's a bit worrying. I bump into things normally, you know, like everyone does, but the bruises just don't seem to be going away like they used to.
DOCTOR: Blood thinners, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Warfarin, I think it is. Started taking it about six months ago after… well, after a little clot scare. Honestly, I don't remember all the details the doctor told me then, it was a lot. But yeah, blood thinners. That’s why I got worried when I started bruising so easily.
DOCTOR: Six months on warfarin and you don’t recall the specifics regarding your indication or target INR?
PATIENT: Target… what now? Look, I just know I take a pill every day and get my blood checked regularly. I try to keep up with it, but it's a lot to remember, okay? The bruising is the important part right now. It’s all over my arms and legs, even little bumps leave a mark that lasts ages. I haven’t changed anything about my routine, I swear.
DOCTOR: Let’s review your electronic health record then. Hmm. Last INR was… July 18th, at 2.1. That’s within therapeutic range, technically. But tell me, Ms. Hainley, have you had any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really. Same as always, pretty much. Lots of taro, some fish, you know, the usual. Maybe a few more mangoes this month 'cause they're in season, but that's it. I haven’t started taking any new vitamins or anything either. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to worry something else is going on.
DOCTOR: “Something else”?
PATIENT: Well, yeah. Like, could it be my blood, you know? Something wrong with my blood, even with the medicine? Or… I don’t know, something I'm not even thinking of. It just feels… different this time. The bruises are bigger and more painful than they used to be, even for small bumps.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hainley, with all due respect, self-diagnosis is rarely accurate. Now, let’s proceed systematically. Have you noticed any bleeding elsewhere?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Not really… well, my gums bleed a little when I brush sometimes, but I always figured that was just, you know, sensitive gums. And maybe a few more nosebleeds this month than usual, but nothing major. Just a little drip here and there. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: "A little drip here and there" is insufficient detail. How often?
PATIENT: Okay, okay! Um… maybe three nosebleeds in the last two weeks? Usually I don’t get them at all. They stop pretty quick, I just pinch my nose like the nurse showed me. And the gums, like I said, pretty much every time I brush, a little bit of blood. It’s never a lot, though. It’s just… more noticeable than it used to be, that’s all. Is this bad? I don’t want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hainley, you are exhibiting signs that warrant further investigation, despite your INR being within range. We will need to perform a complete blood count to assess your platelet levels and rule out other potential causes for your bruising and bleeding. Let me order that now. Please follow me to the phlebotomy chair.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. A test is probably a good idea. Platelets? What are platelets, exactly? Is that something serious? I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Platelets are essential for blood clotting, Ms. Hainley. We'll discuss the results when they're available. The phlebotomist is quite skilled; it will be over quickly. Please come this way. And try to remain calm. .
