DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It’s a pleasure to meet you, though I confess, my schedule is rather… packed today. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Venus. It is… good to meet you as well. I apologize for taking your time, truly. I have been noticing… difficulties with my memory lately. It is concerning, as I manage many properties and associations, and a good memory is… essential. Especially with my blood pressure being high, as the nurse explained.
DOCTOR: "Difficulties with memory," you say. Yes, the nurse did mention elevated blood pressure, which, while not directly causative, can certainly contribute to cognitive function. "Essential" is a strong word, Ms. Alvara. We all experience occasional lapses. However, given your profession and… concerns, let's delve a bit deeper. Could you elaborate on these difficulties?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes. It is not simply forgetting where I placed my keys, Doctor. Though that does happen, admittedly. It is… more like forgetting details about properties. Dates of meetings, specific agreements made with homeowners, even… the names of people I see regularly. It frightens me, to be honest. I pride myself on my organization, and this feels… unlike me. It is also… recent. Perhaps the last month or two. Before that, I was… sharp. Very sharp.
DOCTOR: A recent onset of memory difficulties… dates, agreements, names… that is concerning, I will grant you. It's good you've noticed this and are seeking attention. To clarify, are these memory lapses constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They… come and go, Doctor. It is not every moment. Some days, I feel perfectly fine. I attend meetings, recall everything, manage the accounts without issue. Then, other days… a fog descends. I struggle to find the correct words, or I realize mid-conversation I cannot remember what I was saying. It is unpredictable. It makes planning… difficult. I do not know which days will be… good. It is very frustrating.
DOCTOR: "Unpredictable" is a useful descriptor. And you say it’s been roughly the last month or two?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. Perhaps a little longer, now that I think… eight weeks, perhaps? It began gradually. First, just small things. Misplacing documents. Forgetting the color of a new awning I ordered. Then it progressed… to the more serious things we discussed. I do recall one instance… last month, at the Willow Creek association meeting. I completely forgot the terms of a new landscaping contract after the vote. It was… embarrassing. I had to ask Mr. Henderson to remind me. He was… kind, thankfully. But still. Very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Very well. And has anything else changed recently, Ms. Alvara?
PATIENT: Changed…? Let me think. My husband… passed away three years ago. That was a significant change, naturally. I… adjusted. I have a very good support network. Beyond that… no major life events. I maintain a regular schedule. I exercise when I can – mostly walking. My diet is… reasonable. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. No new medications, no recent illnesses, no head injuries. I believe that is… everything. It has just been… this memory issue. And the blood pressure, of course, which has been higher than usual lately.
DOCTOR: I see your blood pressure readings have indeed been elevated. And no significant medical history reported prior to this. Now, Ms. Alvara, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a brief cognitive assessment. Just a few simple questions and tasks. It will help me gauge the extent of these difficulties you’re experiencing. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly agreeable. I understand. It is better to know, I suppose. I only hope it is nothing… serious. Please, proceed. I will do my best. I want to be… helpful.
DOCTOR: Very good. Let’s start with something simple. Could you please tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… is August 2nd, 2025. Is that correct? I try to be… mindful of the date. It is important for scheduling. But thank you for asking. It is… good to confirm.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And could you tell me the names of the last three presidents of the United States?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… This is… not my area of expertise. I manage properties, not politics. But… I believe the most recent is Mr. Biden, yes. Before that… Mr. Trump. And… before him… Oh dear. It is on the tip of my tongue. Mr… Obama. Yes, Barack Obama. Was that correct? I apologize. It feels… foolish to struggle with this.
DOCTOR: Perfectly acceptable, Ms. Alvara. No need to apologize. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words after me. Please try to remember them, as I will ask you to recall them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. Please proceed. I will try… very hard to remember. I am… focusing now.
DOCTOR: The words are: Apple… Table… Penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. I believe that is correct. I have repeated them, as you requested. It is a little… strange, but I will try to retain them. It feels… important. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's excellent. Now, let’s move onto a simple calculation. If you have 15 apples, and you give 7 away, how many apples do you have left?
PATIENT: Fifteen apples… minus seven… Hmm. Let me see. That would be… eight. I have eight apples remaining. Is that correct? I am… usually very good with numbers, due to the accounts. But this feels… a little stressful.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, let's try one more simple task. Could you draw a clock face, and put the hands at ten minutes after eleven?
PATIENT: Here… this is my attempt. I apologize if it is… imperfect. I am not an artist. And I do find this… rather unsettling. Drawing has never been my forte. It feels… different than recalling facts. It is… difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That is quite sufficient. Now, given your reported memory difficulties, recent onset, and performance on this brief assessment… several possibilities exist. It could be related to stress, medication side effects , or early stages of cognitive impairment. Your elevated blood pressure could be a contributing factor, but we need to investigate further. I want to order some blood work, a complete metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. Also, a brain scan – an MRI, to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… a brain scan… yes, Doctor. If that is what you deem… necessary. Though… the thought of a brain scan is… frightening. But I understand. I want to know what is happening. I do not wish to… remain in this state of uncertainty. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed with whatever tests you believe are… appropriate. Though… could you explain the process of the MRI? I confess, I have never had one before, and it… unnerves me.
DOCTOR: Of course. The MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is a non-invasive imaging technique. You will lie on a table inside a large, cylindrical machine. It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. It is completely painless, but it can be somewhat noisy – we will provide earplugs, and you will be able to communicate with the technician throughout the procedure. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes. Before the MRI, you will need to remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, even some types of clothing. We will provide a questionnaire to ensure you do not have any contraindications, such as certain types of implants. It’s very safe, Ms. Alvara, and provides invaluable information. I will also provide a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in brain disorders – for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you like me to explain that as well?
PATIENT: Neurologist… yes, please. Explain everything, Doctor. I… I prefer to know what to expect. Metal… I do not have any implants, as far as I am aware. But I wear… a small silver pendant. And I may have metal clasps on my… shoes. I will remove everything, of course. And the neurologist… what will they do? More tests? Questions? Will they… be able to tell me what is wrong? This is… overwhelming, to be honest. I pride myself on my composure, but this… this is very frightening. I have managed entire properties, negotiated complex contracts… and now I struggle to remember three words. It is… humiliating.
DOCTOR: It is understandable to feel overwhelmed, Ms. Alvara. And it is not humiliating to experience memory lapses – it is a biological function, and many factors can contribute. You have been admirably composed thus far, and I commend you for seeking attention. The neurologist will conduct a more detailed neurological examination – assessing your reflexes, coordination, sensation, and mental status. They will likely ask you more detailed questions about your medical history, lifestyle, and specific memory complaints. They may order additional cognitive testing – more comprehensive than what I performed. In some cases, they may order an EEG – electroencephalogram – to assess your brainwave activity. The goal is to determine the underlying cause of your memory difficulties and develop a tailored treatment plan. It’s important to remember that many memory problems are treatable, or at least manageable. I will provide you with a referral form and the contact information for Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-respected neurologist in the area. We can schedule a follow-up appointment with me after you’ve seen her to discuss her findings and develop a long-term plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding excessive stress, maintaining a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise. And I will write a prescription for a mild cognitive enhancer, donepezil, to see if it offers any symptomatic relief. It is often used in early stages of memory impairment, though it is not a cure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Donepezil… yes. If you believe it may help, I will try it. I understand it is not a cure, but… anything is worth trying at this point. Avoiding stress… that is… difficult, given my profession. But I will endeavor to do so. Dr. Vance… I will schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so thoroughly. And for… being patient with me. It is not easy… to admit that I am struggling. I am usually so… independent. Is there anything else… I should be aware of? Any precautions I should take? Or… any warning signs I should watch out for? I do not want this to… progress unnoticed.
DOCTOR: That's a very astute question, Ms. Alvara. In addition to the potential side effects of the donepezil – nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite – which are typically mild, watch out for any sudden changes in your mood, personality, or behavior. If you experience any confusion, disorientation, or difficulty with coordination, contact me or Dr. Vance immediately. Also, if you notice any difficulty with speech, vision, or swallowing, seek medical attention without delay. For the prescription, I will also advise the pharmacist on any potential drug interactions, given your history, though it is minimal. In terms of precautions, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you feel dizzy or lightheaded. Continue to maintain a regular schedule, and engage in activities that stimulate your mind – reading, puzzles, social interaction. These can help preserve cognitive function. I will also provide you with some informational pamphlets on memory loss and cognitive health. I’d like to see you back in four weeks to assess your response to the medication and discuss Dr. Vance’s findings. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Four weeks… yes, that is agreeable. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. For your time, your patience, and your… compassion. I feel… a little less frightened now, knowing that there is a plan. I will contact Dr. Vance immediately. And I will be sure to read the pamphlets. If I… have any questions before the four weeks, may I contact your office?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Alvara. My office number is on the referral form, and our nursing staff is excellent at addressing any concerns you may have. Please do not hesitate to reach out. I wish you all the best. Take care of yourself, and remember, early detection is key. It was a pleasure meeting you, despite the circumstances. .
