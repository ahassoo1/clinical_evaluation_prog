DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. My name is Dr. Bradlee Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been bothering me. Specifically, when I lie flat. It feels… difficult. Like there's a weight on my chest. I don't want to take up too much of your time, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Vanderwiele, your concerns are important, and I don't mind at all. "Difficult breathing" is certainly something we need to address. When you say it feels difficult, could you describe that sensation a bit more precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely… well, it’s not a pain, exactly. More like… a squeezing. And I have to… work to get air in. It’s worse when I’m trying to sleep. I usually prop myself up with pillows. Several pillows. It helps, but it isn’t ideal, naturally. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Vanderwiele. The sensation of “squeezing” and the need to actively work to breathe are both important details. And the fact that it’s relieved by propping yourself up with pillows is quite telling. Now, has this been a sudden onset, or has this been developing gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually. Very gradually. I think… maybe six months now? At first, it was just needing one extra pillow. Then two. Now it’s… well, it’s quite a stack, really. I didn’t think much of it at first, honestly. Just figured I was getting older. But it’s… it’s starting to worry me a bit. I sleep alone now, you see. My husband… well, that’s a long story. But it’s harder to adjust the pillows myself, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Vanderwiele. And it's good you're bringing this to my attention now, rather than dismissing it. Six months of gradually worsening symptoms is significant. Now, outside of when you're lying flat, do you experience any shortness of breath during the day?
PATIENT: Not usually, Doctor. Not if I’m sitting up or walking around. A little winded after I climb the stairs, perhaps. But nothing… dramatic. I do a bit of gardening, and that doesn’t bother me too much. Though I do take breaks, naturally. I'm seventy-one years old, after all. It's only really when I try to lie down to sleep. And sometimes when I’m watching television, if I’ve eaten a big meal. Does that… clarify things?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Vanderwiele, that does. The positional nature of the breathing difficulty and the association with meals are particularly relevant. Let’s review some other pertinent details. Do you have any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No, not that I’m aware of. I had my share of tests when I was younger, after my father… well, he had a weak heart. But all my tests came back normal. I’ve always been reasonably healthy, all things considered. I try to eat well. Mostly. And I don’t smoke. Never have. Is that… helpful? I'd rather get this sorted out quickly, if you don't mind. It’s just… unsettling, this breathing.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Vanderwiele. And you are right to want to address this. No history of heart problems is reassuring. Now, let's delve a bit into your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, COPD, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I've always been a fairly robust person, until recently. I used to hike quite a bit, in the Zuni Mountains. Not anymore, of course. But I've never had any trouble with my lungs, that I know of. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, naturally. But nothing… serious. My Medicare covers everything, thankfully. But all these tests… it's a bit much, if you don't mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the tests, Ms. Vanderwiele. We aim to be thorough, and Medicare coverage is certainly a benefit. Now, let’s move on to your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure medicine. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a daily multivitamin. That's all. I used to take something for arthritis in my hands, but it didn’t seem to do much good, so I stopped. My doctor said it was alright. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if you don’t mind. It makes me feel… sluggish. Is that… sufficient? I really do appreciate you seeing me so quickly, Doctor. It’s… worrying, this breathing.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril and a multivitamin. Good. No recent arthritis medication. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. None. I eat everything, practically. Though I try to avoid sweets. My mother always said too much sugar was bad for you. It's more of a habit, really. And I don’t wear any fancy perfumes or anything. It's just… simple, my life. Is that… everything for now? I'm afraid I have a bridge game this afternoon. I wouldn't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Vanderwiele. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed to a physical examination, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, lung problems, or sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Well… my father, as I mentioned, had a weak heart. He passed when he was seventy-two. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her lungs, I think. Pneumonia, mostly. Repeatedly. But that was a long time ago, of course. I don't recall the details. We didn’t talk about such things much back then. It was… different. Is that… helpful? I’m starting to feel a bit tired, if you don't mind my saying so. All this remembering… it takes it out of a person.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Vanderwiele. It can be tiring to recall medical history. Heart disease in your father and recurrent pneumonia in your grandmother are both pertinent details. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you’re amenable. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and assess your overall respiratory effort. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you must. But please be quick. And gentle, if you don’t mind. My ribs get… achy sometimes. And I really do have that bridge game. I'm a rather good player, you see. So, the quicker the better. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please sit back and relax. I'm going to listen to your heart first. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s not particularly concerning at this point, but we'll keep it in mind. Now, I’ll listen to your lungs. Breath sounds are somewhat diminished at the bases of both lungs, with mild wheezing. There is a slight dullness to percussion on the lower lobes. I observe some increased effort of breathing and mild use of accessory muscles. Blood pressure is 140/90. Overall, your respiratory exam reveals some findings that require further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation… oh dear. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? I really didn't want to hear that. My bridge partners will be furious if I'm not there. I'm the best one, you see. What kind of investigation? Will it involve… needles? I detest needles.
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, please try not to be alarmed. "Further investigation" simply means we need to gather more information to determine the cause of your breathing difficulties. Based on the exam, I suspect either heart failure or chronic lung disease, possibly COPD. The diminished breath sounds, wheezing, and increased effort of breathing are suggestive of a pulmonary issue, while the murmur requires evaluation. Yes, it will likely involve some tests, including a chest X-ray and blood work. The blood work will assess your heart function and rule out other potential causes. A spirometry test, a breathing test, would also be very helpful to assess your lung capacity. I understand your aversion to needles, and we'll do our best to make the process as comfortable as possible. The blood draw will be quick and relatively painless. As for a definitive diagnosis without these tests, I would be irresponsible to offer one. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… Chest X-ray… Blood work… Oh dear. This is all… rather overwhelming. Spirometry… what exactly is that? And will it involve… anything unpleasant? And how long will all this take? I really do have my bridge game. And I promised to bring the cookies. Will I be able to play bridge at all this week? I need to know. And… is it contagious? I wouldn’t want to infect my partners.
DOCTOR: Ms. Vanderwiele, I understand your anxiety, and I’ll do my best to address your concerns. A spirometry test is a simple breathing test that measures how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can do it. It involves breathing into a mouthpiece connected to a machine. It’s non-invasive and typically takes about 15-20 minutes. It can cause some mild dizziness, but it’s usually well-tolerated. The chest X-ray and blood work will take a bit longer, likely an hour or two combined. The blood work will need to be sent to the lab for analysis, so we won’t have the results immediately. As for whether it’s contagious, based on my initial assessment, it is unlikely to be infectious. However, we cannot rule out an underlying infection until we have the lab results. Therefore, I would advise you to refrain from close contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable, until we have a clearer diagnosis. Whether you will be able to play bridge this week is difficult to say. It depends on the results of the tests and how you are feeling. If you are experiencing significant shortness of breath or fatigue, I would advise you to rest and avoid strenuous activities. I'm going to order these tests immediately. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and provide instructions for scheduling your chest X-ray and spirometry test. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room… Oh dear, oh dear. This is all so much. I’m starting to feel quite faint. I suppose I have no choice, then. Blood work… X-ray… spirometry… It’s just… unsettling. The cookies… my partners will be furious. And I’m the best one, you know. Very well, Doctor. Do what you must. But please, be quick. And gentle. And tell the nurse… I detest needles. And can you… can you write down all these instructions for me? My memory isn’t what it used to be. And… what if the tests are bad? What if it’s… serious?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Vanderwiele. I will write down detailed instructions for all the tests, including the location of the lab and radiology center, and the nurse will explain everything as well. As for what if the tests are “bad,” let's not jump to conclusions. Many conditions can cause shortness of breath, and not all of them are serious. If we do find something concerning, we will discuss your treatment options in detail. There are many effective treatments available for both heart and lung conditions, and we will work together to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Here are the instructions. I've included the contact information for the lab and radiology center, as well as my office number should you have any questions. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Ms. Vanderwiele, I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we are taking this very seriously. We will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and provide you with the best possible care. Try to remain calm, and please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. Now, I will leave you to rest while we wait for the nurse. Do you have any questions before I go?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… try to be quick. And tell the nurse… I really, really detest needles. Thank you, Doctor. Perhaps… perhaps my partners won’t mind if the cookies are a little late. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Vanderwiele. I'll be sure to let the nurse know. Take a deep breath. We’ll get through this. .
