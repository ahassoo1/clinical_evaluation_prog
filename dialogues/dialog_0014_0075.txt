DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s good to meet you too, Dr. Osterholm. It’s this…sleepiness. Even with the machine. I’ve been using a CPAP for, oh, goodness, almost ten years now, and lately I just feel…drowsy all the time. It's frustrating, you know? I get enough hours, I think, but I'm still tired during the day.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. Ten years on CPAP, that's good compliance, usually. But sleepiness despite that…it is frustrating. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. Just to clarify, when you say “enough hours,” about how many hours of sleep are you getting each night?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think…usually between seven and eight hours. Sometimes a little more if I don’t have anything pressing the next day. I go to bed around ten, maybe ten-thirty, and I wake up…well, around six, six-thirty. It’s not like I'm getting barely any sleep, you understand? I used to wake up feeling pretty good, refreshed even. Now…not so much. I find myself dozing in my chair after lunch, things like that. Nothing dangerous, but…annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, seven to eight hours…and you've noticed a change, a decline in how rested you feel despite the consistent CPAP use. Okay. Do you snore at all, even with the machine on?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm…yes, a little, actually. Not like I used to before the machine, of course. It’s…a softer sort of snore, if that makes any sense. My wife, God rest her soul, she always said it was more of a…a rumble, really. Now that I think about it, it's been getting a little louder lately too, maybe? I live alone now, so I mostly notice it when I get up to use the bathroom in the night. It's not keeping me awake, but…it's there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a persistent, though softer, snore despite CPAP, and you’ve noticed it increasing. Alright. And besides the sleepiness and the snoring, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me see…well, my memory isn’t what it used to be, naturally, at my age. But I don’t think it's worse than usual. I still remember things just fine, for the most part. Oh! Now that I think about it, I've been getting up to…urinate more often at night. Maybe two or three times, where I used to only go once. I figured it was just old age catching up with me, but maybe that's relevant? I drink plenty of water during the day, I always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant worsening of memory, but increased nighttime urination – nocturia, as we call it – despite consistent water intake. Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. I have. I've put on a few pounds, I think. Not a lot, but enough to notice in my clothes. I used to be around 88, maybe 90. Now I’m closer to 92, I reckon. I haven’t been as active lately, to be honest. It's been a bit too hot to do much gardening, which is my favorite thing, and…well, losing my wife took a lot out of me, if you understand. I just haven't had the energy for much, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Paske. It's perfectly normal to experience changes in appetite and energy levels after a significant loss. And weight gain can certainly contribute to sleep issues. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Could you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. No problem at all. Old bones aren't what they used to be. Here we go…
DOCTOR: 92 pounds, you said?
PATIENT: No, 92 kilograms. I apologize, I should have specified. 92 kilograms, which is…oh, goodness, about 202 pounds, I think. I’m not terribly good at conversions, to be honest. My wife always handled those sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Right, 202 pounds. My apologies, I should have clarified. Okay, and let's check your blood pressure, just to rule out any issues there.
PATIENT: No problem at all, Doctor. You have a lot on your mind, I’m sure. I used to work with numbers, you know. I was a professor of Ethnic and Cultural Studies, lots of data analysis. Funny how I forget simple conversions these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your age and recent changes. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let's just take a look at your throat, to make sure everything looks okay there.
PATIENT: Certainly. Go right ahead, Doctor. I haven't had much trouble with my throat, but I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay. Throat looks clear, no significant swelling or redness. Now, one last thing. Could you gently press on your abdomen here, and tell me if that causes any pain?
PATIENT: Certainly. Hmm…no, not exactly pain, but a little discomfort. It’s…a fullness, really. I get a bit bloated sometimes, especially in the evenings. I just thought it was the food I was eating, to be honest. It doesn’t keep me up at night, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, Mr. Paske, thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, a few things could be contributing to your sleepiness. The weight gain, the increased nighttime urination, the elevated blood pressure, and the bloating all suggest the possibility of…mild sleep apnea despite your CPAP, perhaps complicated by some degree of fluid retention and possible metabolic changes. It’s possible your CPAP isn’t fully optimized, or there’s another underlying issue at play. It’s difficult to say for sure without further testing. I’d like to order a sleep study, just to re-evaluate your apnea, and some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds…sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgement. A sleep study and blood work…yes, that seems like a good plan. I want to feel like myself again, you know? I miss having the energy to garden and just…enjoy life. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Good. I understand completely. We’ll get you scheduled for a sleep study as soon as possible. I’ll also give you a lab requisition for the blood work. It's a simple draw, nothing to worry about. In the meantime, I recommend you try to elevate your legs for 30 minutes before bed, to help reduce the fluid retention, and avoid drinking anything for a couple of hours before you go to sleep. We’ll go over the results once they’re back, and develop a plan from there. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Elevate my legs, no drinks before bed…I can certainly manage that. It’s good to have a direction, you know? Thank you, Doctor Osterholm. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kindness. It's comforting to know someone is listening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. It’s my job, and I’m glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse come in to give you the lab requisition and schedule the sleep study. If anything changes or worsens before then, please don’t hesitate to call. Here's a written summary of today’s visit, as well as the recommendations we discussed. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care, Mr. Paske. And don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. .
