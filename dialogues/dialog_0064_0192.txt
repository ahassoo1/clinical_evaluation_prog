DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I’m here for this… test. For the army. Gotta get this done. It’s… a requirement. Don't really see why they need me to jump through hoops, but rules are rules, right?
DOCTOR: Right, a requirement for the army. I understand. So, this is a general medical evaluation to satisfy their requirements?
PATIENT: Yep. That’s it. Just wanna make sure I’m… fit enough. Though I've been working with engines my whole life, so I'm pretty strong. Stronger than most, probably. I doubt they’ll find anything wrong. It’s a waste of time, honestly. But my wife said I gotta do it. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re taking care of it, and it’s always good to have someone looking out for you. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a bit more about what specifically this evaluation is for?
PATIENT: Thorough? Look, they just said I need a check-up. Height, weight, blood pressure… that sort of thing. Maybe listen to my lungs. I dunno. They sent a paper, said I gotta come here, and you gotta fill it out. That’s all I know. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to details like that. I fix things, I don't read about them. Is this gonna take long? I got stuff to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. No worries at all. We'll get through it quickly. It sounds like a standard physical, which is good. Let’s start with what we do know. You mentioned height and weight – do you know those offhand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I know 'em. I'm six foot two, give or take. And... about a hundred and seventy-five pounds. Maybe a bit less, I've been working hard lately, lost a few. I’m pretty lean, you know? Not like those… well, never mind. Point is, I'm in good shape. Not a lot of extra on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, six foot two and around 175 pounds. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any current medical problems at all?
PATIENT: Medical problems? No. None. I haven't been sick in… well, I can’t remember the last time. Maybe a cold, years ago. I work outside, fresh air, keeps me healthy. Don't sit around like some folks, getting all weak and… prone to things. I eat alright, mostly. My wife makes good food. Though she puts too much… spinach in everything. But that's not a problem.
DOCTOR: Good, good. No current problems is excellent. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Never. I mean, I’ve had a few bumps and bruises working on engines. A cut here and there. But nothing a little bandage couldn't fix. Nothing a doctor ever needed to look at. You're asking about serious things, right? Like… heart trouble or something? No. Nothing like that. I’ve always been strong as an ox.
DOCTOR: Right, nothing serious. That’s good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. Why would I need surgery? I’m careful. I fix things myself. I don't let people cut me open unless it's… well, unless it’s absolutely necessary, which it never is. I’ve seen what happens when people let doctors do things. Messes it all up. No, no surgeries. Never. Not even tonsils. I still got 'em.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… do you know of any medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Hmm. My father… he had bad knees when he got old. Worked on the farm all his life. Hard work, like I said. And my mother… she worried a lot. That's not a medical problem, though, is it? She just… got anxious. No heart trouble, no… cancer or anything like that. Just old age, mostly. They both lived pretty long lives, all things considered. Not very exciting, but long.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and anxiety. That's helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I eat everything. Well, not everything. I don’t like fish. But that’s not an allergy, that’s just… taste. And I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Never needed an EpiPen or anything fancy like that. I’m a pretty tough Swede. We don’t really get allergies. Maybe a little sniffle in the spring, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, and are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No. Not a single one. Why would I be? I told you, I'm fine. Never needed pills, never wanted 'em. I get my strength from hard work and fresh air. And maybe a bit of coffee, but that’s not a medication, is it? Just keeps me going. No, no pills. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. That’s excellent. Now, just to finish up the basic information, let's do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Get it over with. I got things to do, remember? Just… try to be quick about it. I don’t like wasting time. What’s first? Blood pressure? Just tell me when to breathe and all that.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. And while I’m doing that, could you tell me roughly how much you weigh?
PATIENT: I already told you, around 175 pounds. Maybe a bit less. Look, I told you, I'm a lean machine. Not some… well, never mind. Just take the reading, alright? I gotta get back to work soon. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s… within the normal range. Now, let’s listen to your lungs and heart. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy? I've been breathing all my life, you know. Pretty good at it. No wheezing, no coughing. Always been strong-lunged. Work with engines, gotta have good lungs. Just… get on with it, alright? This is… repetitive.
DOCTOR: Your lungs are clear, and your heart sounds regular. No murmurs or abnormal sounds that I can detect. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you sit on the examination table?
PATIENT: Reflexes? What for? I haven't tripped over anything in years. But alright, fine. Just… don't hit me too hard with that little hammer thing. I'm a delicate Swede, you know. Not really. But still. Be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, good reflexes there. Everything seems normal so far. Now, just one more thing. Could you stand up and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ugh. Getting old, I guess. It's the knees, you know? They aren't what they used to be. There. Happy? Not as flexible as I used to be, but still pretty good for my age. Can you see? Is it good enough for the… army thing?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's sufficient. Your range of motion is good, and it doesn't appear you have any significant limitations. Alright, Mr. Hartness, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears to be within normal limits. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it doesn't appear you have any medical conditions that would prevent you from fulfilling the requirements for the army. However, given your age, it might be prudent to get a basic blood test to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Just as a precaution. It could help identify any potential issues early on. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Blood test? Ugh. More poking and prodding? Look, I told you, I’m fine. I don’t need tests. My wife is the one who worries about that sort of thing. I haven’t got time for extra tests. Just tell me if I'm good to go, alright? I need this paperwork signed so I can get on with my life. What’s the verdict? Can I join the army or not? Stop wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Given that you’re feeling well and the physical exam was normal, I can sign the paperwork stating that you are medically fit for duty based on the information available today. However, I strongly recommend that you discuss this with your wife and consider a basic blood test for your own peace of mind. I’m simply suggesting it as a preventative measure. I’m signing the form now. Do you have any questions for me before I complete this?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… finish it. And thank you. Honestly. I knew I was fine. My wife… she just gets anxious. This is good. Finally. Can I have the paper now? So I can get out of here?
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Hartness. This form states that you are medically fit for duty. Please keep this with you. I’ve also documented our conversation and my recommendation for a basic blood test in your chart. I wish you all the best, and if you experience any changes in your health, please don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No concerns. Thank you. Honestly, you made it easier than I thought it would be. Maybe you're not so bad after all. Alright. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Hartness. Take care of yourself. And please, consider the blood test. .
