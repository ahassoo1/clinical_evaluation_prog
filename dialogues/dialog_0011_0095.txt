DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day. It's my ear. Or, was my ear. It just…stopped working. On one side. And my face feels a little droopy, if you must know. It started yesterday morning. Is that enough for you to start figuring things out?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is a very helpful starting point, Ms. Nissenbaum. Thank you for sharing that. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are concerning symptoms. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the hearing loss in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? What detail is there? It’s gone. Completely. Like someone flipped a switch. It happened while I was having my tea, actually. One minute I could hear the news, the next…nothing. And it’s only the left ear, if that matters. I suppose it's sudden, as you pointed out. Really, is there anything else you need to know? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Yes, the fact that it was sudden onset and only affecting the left ear is important. And noting it occurred while you were having tea is helpful as well. Just to be thorough, Ms. Nissenbaum, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hearing loss and facial drooping?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Goodness. Let me think. I had a bit of a headache yesterday afternoon, now that you mention it. Nothing terrible, just a dull ache. And… I felt a little dizzy when I stood up quickly this morning, but honestly, I often feel a little off balance. I'm not exactly a spring chicken anymore, you know. Is that important? Because I really don't see what all these questions are accomplishing.
DOCTOR: Everything you've shared is important, Ms. Nissenbaum. The headache and dizziness do provide additional context. Now, regarding the facial drooping—can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. My face just feels weak on that side. Like I'm trying to smile, but it doesn't quite… work. It's subtle, maybe. My daughter pointed it out. She's a bit dramatic, though. And it's mostly when I try to make expressions. It's not like I'm paralyzed or anything. Honestly, it's probably nothing. Just a pinched nerve, I suspect. I have a very high pain tolerance, you know. I’ve had children.
DOCTOR: I understand. Even subtle changes can be concerning, and it’s good your daughter noticed. Just to get a clearer picture, Ms. Nissenbaum, have you noticed any difficulty with things like closing your eye completely on that side, or with your taste on that side of your tongue?
PATIENT: Taste? Really? Are you suggesting I have a taste problem? No, I have not noticed anything different with my taste. And yes, I can close my eye, although it feels… tighter, perhaps. It’s a little effort. Look, I’m starting to feel quite foolish here. I came because my ear stopped working, not because my face is having a personality crisis. Can we just get to the bottom of this? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I apologize if my questions seem extensive. I assure you, I am trying to gather all the necessary information to determine the cause of your symptoms efficiently. Given your sudden hearing loss, facial weakness, and the other details you’ve provided, I would like to perform a brief neurological examination. This will help me assess the function of your facial nerves and rule out any serious underlying conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A neurological examination? Honestly. Is this really necessary? It sounds…invasive. And time-consuming. I suppose if you insist. But please, be quick about it. I truly don't have all day to spend in a doctor's office. And no poking, if you don’t mind. I have a low tolerance for unnecessary prodding. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. It will be a relatively quick and non-invasive examination. I will do my best to be as efficient as possible, and I assure you, I will avoid any unnecessary prodding. First, I’m going to ask you to look straight ahead. Can you tell me if you’re experiencing any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No, my vision is perfectly fine. As good as it can be for someone my age. I wear glasses, as you can see. But no blurry spots or anything dramatic. Are we done yet? This is all rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, could you please close your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright, closed. Hurry up, please. I have places to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Nissenbaum, could you please smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It’s not exactly my most dazzling smile, as you can see. It feels… strange. Weak, on one side. Honestly, you don't need to be a doctor to see something's wrong. Can we move on? This is starting to feel undignified.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, could you please raise both of your eyebrows as high as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… difficult. It feels tighter on this side. Really, Doctor, is this going to take all day? I have a luncheon with the ladies. We're discussing… well, it's not important. Just please be quick.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Nissenbaum. Now, if you could please puff out your cheeks, like you're blowing out a candle.
PATIENT: There. See? It's obvious! The air is escaping on this side. Honestly, it's quite embarrassing. You don’t need to poke and prod me any further. It's clear something is wrong with my face. Can we finally discuss what this is and what you’re going to do about it?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Nissenbaum. You are right to point that out. Based on the examination, and considering your sudden hearing loss, facial weakness, and the asymmetry we observed, I am concerned about the possibility of Bell’s palsy. Bell’s palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face. It’s thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes, such as a stroke or tumor. Therefore, I would like to order an MRI of your brain to confirm the diagnosis and ensure there are no other underlying issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? Goodness. More tests. Honestly, this is becoming quite a production. But… if you think it's necessary. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. Though I really don't have the time for a lot of lying around in a machine. And will it interfere with my luncheon? I have a very important hat to wear. Fine, do the MRI. But please, make it as quick as possible. And tell me exactly what I need to do. I don’t do well with complicated instructions.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I will do my best to expedite the process. The MRI will take approximately 30-45 minutes. You will lie on a table that slides into a large machine. It’s important to remain very still during the scan to get clear images. You will be able to communicate with the technician throughout the procedure. Regarding your hat, you won’t be able to wear it during the scan due to the metal content. However, you can bring it with you. To proceed with the MRI, I need to obtain your consent and ensure you don’t have any contraindications, such as metal implants or pacemakers. Do you have any metal implants or a pacemaker?
PATIENT: Metal implants? Goodness, no. I've never had anything implanted in my body! I’m a perfectly natural woman. Well… I had a wisdom tooth removed years ago, but that’s hardly an implant. No pacemakers, either. Never needed one. Honestly, Doctor, do you think I’m made of metal? Just get the scan done. And please, tell me when I can expect the results. I need to know if I can still attend my luncheon. It’s a very important occasion.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Nissenbaum. That’s very helpful to know. I will have the radiology department schedule your MRI as soon as possible. They will contact you directly to arrange a time. Typically, the results are available within 24-48 hours. Once I have the results, I will contact you to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, to protect your eye on the affected side, I recommend using artificial tears frequently and applying a lubricating ointment at night. If you experience any severe pain or vision changes, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Artificial tears? Lubricating ointment? Honestly, this is becoming quite a nuisance. It's just a bit of facial weakness, not some catastrophic illness! But fine, I’ll try the artificial tears. And I suppose I can manage the ointment. No, I don't think I have any further questions. Just… get the scan done quickly, and tell me if I can still wear my hat to the luncheon. That’s all I care about. I really must be going now. I have preparations to make. Thank you, Doctor. Though, frankly, I’m not very optimistic. It’s probably something dreadful. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I will do everything I can to expedite the process and provide you with a clear diagnosis. We will certainly discuss the possibility of wearing your hat once we have the MRI results. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you experience any changes in your condition. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. .
