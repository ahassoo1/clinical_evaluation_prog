DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome in. I’m Dr. IUzzolino. It's… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Norval is fine, please. Well, it’s… it’s about my stomach, mostly. I get full awfully quick these days. Even with just a little bit of food. It’s been happening for a few months now, I’d say. Not sure why it started, just… does.
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. Just Norval it is. A few months, you say… getting full quickly, even with small amounts of food. Hmm. And is this happening with all foods, or are there certain things that bother you more than others?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. I think… I think it's mostly everything, yeah. Doesn't seem to matter what I eat, to be honest. Soup, a sandwich… even just a few bites of salmon. It all feels like too much after a little while. Not that I don’t want to eat, mind you. Just… can’t get much down.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's not tied to any specific food. It's a general feeling of fullness… and you do have an appetite, you just can’t eat a lot before feeling full. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this, Norval?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… Well, now that you mention it… sometimes I feel a little bit queasy afterwards. Not sick, exactly, just… unsettled. And I’ve been a bit tired lately, but… well, I'm 88, Doctor. Lots of folks my age are tired. It's hard to say what’s normal anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s fair, Norval. It is hard to say. The queasiness afterwards… is that soon after eating, or does it come later?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s pretty soon after, I’d say. Within half an hour or so. Not a terrible feeling, just… uncomfortable. Like maybe I ate too fast, even when I didn’t. It doesn't last long, though. Maybe an hour, then it fades away. It's just annoying, is all. Makes it hard to enjoy a good meal with the family.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your… bowel habits, Norval?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, now that’s a question. I… everything’s pretty regular, if you know what I mean. Nothing different there, thankfully. It's mostly just the full feeling, and the bit of queasiness. I don't want to be making a fuss about nothing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No fuss at all, Norval. It's good to rule things out, and it’s important to me you feel heard. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, years ago, I had my gallbladder out. That was a long time ago, though. Must be forty years now. And I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure for a while, but it’s been managed with pills for ages. Other than that… nothing major that I can think of. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal many years ago, and managed blood pressure. Do you recall what medication you are currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a good question. Let me see… I think it’s… Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. My wife helps me with the pills, mostly. I try to remember, but… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily. That's good to know, thank you. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Norval?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with anything, thankfully. Penicillin, other pills… nothing. My wife always asks when I get a new prescription, and she says I’m clear. She’s got a good memory, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to cover all the bases, have you had any major surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Oh! Years and years ago, when I was a young man, I broke my arm pretty bad. Had to have surgery to set it. But that was… goodness, must be 60 years ago now. Nothing since then, to my knowledge. Just the gallbladder, the arm, and now this.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, arm surgery many years ago. And now this stomach issue. Just one more question about your history before we move on to a quick examination. Do you have any family history of stomach problems, like ulcers or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tough one. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her stomach. Always complaining of indigestion, but I don’t think it was anything serious. And my uncle, on my father’s side… he had stomach cancer, I think. That was a long time ago, though. Real sad thing. It's hard to say what was what back then, though. They didn't have all the fancy tests they have now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Indigestion in your mother, stomach cancer in an uncle. That’s good to know. Now, Norval, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your stomach, feel around a little bit. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything does bother you. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels… wrong, right? I trust your judgment. Been meaning to get this checked out for a while now, so I’m glad we’re getting to it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start by listening to your abdomen. I'm just listening for any unusual sounds. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness or masses. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit there, yes. Not pain, exactly, more like… a dull ache. Like a full feeling, even though I haven't eaten anything. It's not too bad, though. Just a little bit uncomfortable. Right about there, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Dull ache in the upper right quadrant. And what about here, on the left side?
PATIENT: No, not much there. Feels pretty normal, I’d say. Just the regular… belly feeling. It’s mostly on that right side, like you said. Not sharp, just… full. Like someone stuffed a little pillow in there. A very small pillow, mind you. It's just a bit annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And down here, any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not down there. Feels alright. Like I said, it’s mostly that upper right side. Somewhere around… here. It’s hard to say exactly, Doctor. I’m not a medical man, you know. Just feels… tender.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Norval. That gives me a little more information. It sounds like there may be some tenderness in your upper right quadrant, but no significant masses or other abnormalities. Given your symptoms – early fullness, queasiness, and the tenderness I feel – and your family history, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be something simple like gastritis, or perhaps an issue with your gallbladder, even though it was removed some time ago. Sometimes issues can develop with the bile duct. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests, and I think an ultrasound of your abdomen would be a good idea. That will allow us to see your gallbladder area, liver, and bile ducts. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and an ultrasound. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'd just like to know what’s going on, you know? It's just been bothering me, and I’d like to get it sorted out. Yes, please. Let's get those tests done. When can we schedule them?
DOCTOR: Alright, Norval. That's good. I’m glad we’re doing this. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests and the ultrasound right now. The blood tests can be done at the clinic tomorrow morning, if that works for you. And I’ll get the referral for the ultrasound sent over to the imaging center. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. It’s usually pretty quick turnaround. Let’s see… I’ll also write you a prescription for a medication called Omeprazole. It’s a proton pump inhibitor, which can help reduce the acid in your stomach and may provide some relief from your symptoms while we’re waiting for the test results. It’s a low dose, and generally well-tolerated. I’ll give you some instructions on how to take it. It's important to follow those instructions carefully. And if you experience any side effects, such as severe diarrhea or abdominal pain, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Omeprazole, you say? I've never taken that before. What kind of side effects should I be looking out for, exactly? And how long will it take to start working, if it does work at all? I just don’t want to be taking a lot of pills if I don’t need to. And will it interfere with any of the other pills I’m taking?
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Norval. It’s important to be informed. Omeprazole, as I mentioned, reduces the acid in your stomach. The most common side effects are usually mild – things like headache, diarrhea, or constipation. Rarely, some people experience nausea or abdominal pain. If you do experience severe or persistent abdominal pain, or any severe diarrhea, please contact me right away. It usually starts working within a few days to a week, but it can take up to two weeks to feel the full effect. Let me check your current medications… Lisinoprazole, which is for your blood pressure, shouldn’t interact with Omeprazole. It's always a good idea to be cautious, though, so I’ll make a note in your chart to monitor that. We'll start with a low dose, and see how you tolerate it. If it doesn't provide relief, or if you experience any side effects, we can always adjust the dose or try a different medication. I’ll write clear instructions on the prescription, and the pharmacist can also answer any questions you might have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… better, Doctor. A low dose to start, and keep an eye on things. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. I’m just getting old, I guess. Everything takes a bit longer, and there’s always something new to worry about. Alright. Let’s get that prescription, and schedule those tests. I’m ready to get this sorted out, if we can. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel a bit better just knowing what we’re doing.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Norval. Getting older comes with its own set of challenges, that's true. But we’ll take it one step at a time. Here’s the prescription for the Omeprazole. The nurse will schedule you for the blood tests before you leave, and they’ll also give you the information for the imaging center to schedule the ultrasound. I’ve also documented everything we discussed today in your chart. I want to see you back in about two weeks, after we get the test results, to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – like severe pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool – please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time and your patience. I appreciate you listening to me and explaining things so clearly. I'll see you in two weeks, then. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Norval. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. You have a good day too, and take care. .
