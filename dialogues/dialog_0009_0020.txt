DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you also. I… how do you say… the office called, yes? For a check-up. A talk on the… telephone, you know? My knees, they are… not so good lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. The office did schedule you for a general check-up and you mentioned some knee trouble during the phone call. That's perfectly alright; we can definitely address that today. Let’s start with the knees. Can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, they… ache. Mostly when I stand for too long. Or… when I walk a lot. I used to garden, you know? Big garden. But it is hard now. They feel… stiff. And sometimes a little… crackly? I do not know if that makes sense. It is not a sharp pain, just… old. Like they are very, very old.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Benites. "Old" is a very good way to describe it. Stiffness, aching with activity, and a bit of crackling—those are all common symptoms. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Slowly. At first, I just thought I was… out of shape, you know? I used to be very active. But it has gotten… worse. Not suddenly, but… steady. Every month, a little harder. I try to ignore it. But it is… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of gradual onset. That's helpful to know. And you said it’s been affecting your gardening?
PATIENT: Yes. Very much. I used to do it every day. Now… maybe once a week, if I am lucky. And not for long. I have to sit down a lot. My husband… he liked the garden very much also. He is… gone now. So it is hard in other ways too, you know? But the knees… they make it harder. I miss it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Benites. Gardening sounds like it was very important to both of you. It’s completely natural that it’s harder to do things you love when you’re experiencing pain. Aside from the gardening, are you experiencing any pain in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: No, not really. My back… sometimes a little stiff, but nothing like the knees. And my hands… they ache a little in the cold, but I think that is just… old age. I do not know. Nothing that keeps me from doing things. Just the knees… and the garden. And… missing my husband. But the knees are the worst part, physically.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the primary issue seems to be the knee pain, with some minor stiffness in your back and hands. Let's do a quick physical exam of your knees, if that's alright with you. I'll just take a look, feel around, and have you do a few simple movements so I can get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… good. I trust you, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I am not afraid. Just… be gentle, please? They are very old knees.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Benites. I will be very gentle. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, I'm just feeling around now. I notice some mild swelling around both knees, and when you bend them, there is a bit of crepitus—that crackling sound you mentioned. Your range of motion is a little limited, and there's some tenderness along the joint line. The stability seems okay, but it's a little difficult to assess fully with you seated. Do you feel any pain with any of those movements specifically?
PATIENT: Yes… when you bend them… a little pain on the inside. And… when you push on that side. Not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache. Like a deep bruise. And… yes, the inside feels… warmer, maybe? I do not know if that is just me. It is hard to explain. It is not a bad pain, just… annoying. And it makes me not want to move. Which is not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Ms. Benites. Pain on the inside of the knees with bending and palpation, and a sensation of warmth. That suggests some inflammation is likely present. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your knees – a fall, a twist, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. I was always very careful. I used to play volleyball when I was young, but I never had a bad fall. Maybe a few scrapes and bruises, but nothing serious. My husband… he was the clumsy one. He broke his arm once, skiing. But me… no. My knees have always just been… knees. Until now. I do not know what I did to them.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of significant knee injury. That's good to know. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions, like arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have… high blood pressure. The doctor gave me pills for it. I take them every day. And… my cholesterol is a little high, I think. But that is all. Nothing else that I can remember. I see my regular doctor every six months, and he checks everything. I have Medicare, so they check everything very carefully. And… I had a bad flu a few years ago, but that is not a medical condition, is it?
DOCTOR: No, the flu isn't a chronic medical condition. High blood pressure and high cholesterol are important to know, though, and it's good that you're being regularly monitored. What medications are you currently taking for those conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… for the blood pressure, I take… lisinopril. Yes, that is it. One pill every morning. And for the cholesterol… atorvastatin. That is the one. Also every morning. I have a little box with all my pills. My daughter helps me make sure I take them. She is very good.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you have support from your daughter. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I have taken many different medicines over the years, and I have never had a reaction. Sometimes they make me a little sleepy, but that is all. Nothing serious. My husband… he was allergic to penicillin. But me… no. I have always been lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. That’s good to know. Now, one last question about your history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never. My husband… he used to drink a little beer sometimes, with dinner. But I never liked it. And I do not smoke. Or… anything like that. I believe in taking care of myself. And… my husband always said I worried too much. But… it is better to be safe, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It's always better to be cautious. Okay, Ms. Benites, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing osteoarthritis in both knees. The gradual onset of pain with activity, stiffness, crepitus, and tenderness are all consistent with that diagnosis. The warmth you're feeling is likely due to inflammation. Now, osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition, meaning the cartilage in your knees is wearing down over time. It’s very common, especially as we get older. It's important to remember that it's not necessarily something that will rapidly worsen. We can manage the symptoms and help you stay active and comfortable. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… osteoarthritis. I have heard of that. My neighbor, Mrs. Novak, she has it in her hips. It sounds… serious. But you say we can manage it? You can help me? I do not want to stop gardening. It is… important to me. Will the pills help? And… will I need surgery? I do not like the sound of surgery.
DOCTOR: Yes, it can be managed very effectively for many people, Ms. Benites. It’s not necessarily serious in the sense that it’s life-threatening, but it can certainly impact your quality of life if it's not addressed. Let's talk about treatment options. We'll start with conservative measures first. This includes things like: Weight management: If you’re carrying any extra weight, losing even a few pounds can significantly reduce the stress on your knees. Physical therapy: A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve your range of motion. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Medications like ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce pain and inflammation. Topical creams: Creams containing capsaicin or menthol can also provide some pain relief. We can also discuss a prescription medication if the over-the-counter options aren't enough. There are several medications available, but we'll choose one that's right for you based on your medical history and other medications you're taking. Surgery is usually a last resort, and it’s not something we'd consider unless all other options have failed. It’s important to remember that we can often manage osteoarthritis very effectively with non-surgical treatments. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… good. Not surgery right away. I do not like that. I can try the exercises. And I can try the pills. I am not very heavy. Maybe five pounds. But I like my food. The physical therapy… is that hard? And… how long will it take to see if it helps? I want to get back to my garden soon. It is almost fall, you know? And the tomatoes… they are best in the fall.
DOCTOR: I completely understand wanting to get back to your garden, especially for the tomatoes! Physical therapy can be tailored to your abilities, so it shouldn't be overly strenuous. It will start with gentle exercises to improve your range of motion and flexibility, and then gradually progress to more strengthening exercises. The therapist will work with you to develop a program that's right for you. It typically takes about 4-6 weeks to see significant improvement with physical therapy, but you may start to feel some relief within a week or two. We can also discuss starting you on an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen or naproxen to help reduce pain and inflammation while you're starting the physical therapy program. I'm going to write you a prescription for a referral to physical therapy and give you some information about over-the-counter pain relievers. I also want to order some routine blood work to make sure everything else is looking good. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfect. Blood work is good. Make sure everything is okay. And the physical therapy… I will try my best. I am not very strong, but I am willing to try. I want to get back to my garden. And… thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. And you do not rush me. That is very nice.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I'm happy to help. And you're right, there's absolutely no rush. It’s important to take things at your own pace. I've sent the referral for physical therapy to our scheduling department, and they will call you to set up an appointment. The lab order for the blood work is in your chart, and you can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. I want to see you back in about 6 weeks to see how you're progressing with the physical therapy and to review your blood work results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening pain, or if you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. I will call if I have any questions. And… thank you again, Doctor. You have made me feel much better. I can go back to my garden now… and worry a little less. .
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Benites. That’s exactly what I hope for. Enjoy your gardening! And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a good day.
