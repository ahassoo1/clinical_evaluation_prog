DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Velda Squiers, as you know. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise in a few weeks – the 18th of September, to be precise – and the cruise line requires a form filled out by a doctor. Just some basic medical information, they said. Nothing terribly complicated, I shouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-cruise form. Yes, those are…common enough. Still, it’s important to be thorough. Just to be certain you’re fit for travel. Let’s start with your general health. Have you been seeing a regular doctor?
PATIENT: Not…regularly, no. My husband, God rest his soul, he always handled the doctor visits. It’s been…well, it’ll be three years next month since he passed. I haven’t really needed to see a doctor since then, thankfully. Just the occasional cold, nothing more than a wee sniffle. I’m generally quite healthy, I believe. But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to be certain for the cruise, of course.
DOCTOR: I see. So, no established primary care physician then. That makes things…a little more difficult. Alright. Let’s go through a brief medical history, just to get a baseline. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis…anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I've never been told I have high blood pressure, or diabetes, or arthritis. My joints ache a bit sometimes, like when the weather changes, but I just put that down to getting older. I suppose everyone gets a bit creaky as they age. I’ve been very fortunate with my health, all things considered. I did have a bout of pneumonia when I was a girl, maybe eight or nine years old, but that was a long time ago and I recovered fully. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Pneumonia as a child is…not particularly relevant now, Ms. Squiers, but thank you for mentioning it. Let's move on. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had any need for them, thank goodness. I broke my wrist once, when I was a teenager – fell off my bicycle, silly thing – but it healed perfectly well with a cast. No operations, though. Just a cast, and a bit of a sore arm for a few weeks. I was rather clumsy as a girl, I’m afraid! But nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think. I take a multivitamin every morning, just a general one, to keep things ticking over. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take a half a tablet of over-the-counter sleep aid – just the ones you get at the chemist, nothing prescribed. Other than that…no, Doctor. I don’t take any regular medications at all. I try to stay away from pills whenever possible, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I eat everything, thankfully! I've never had a reaction to anything, not even when I was a wee bairn. I can eat shellfish, nuts, all sorts of things people are allergic to these days. It's a blessing, really. Though, I do find strong perfumes give me a bit of a headache sometimes, but that's not an allergy, is it? Just a sensitivity, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A sensitivity is noted. Alright, Ms. Squiers. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… That’s a bit tricky. My mother, she lived to be eighty-seven, and she was quite healthy for most of her life. She did have a bit of trouble with her eyesight in her later years, and she passed away from a stroke, I believe. My father, he was a strong, hearty man, but he smoked quite a bit and he passed away from lung cancer when he was in his sixties. My brother… well, he’s still alive, thankfully, but he’s got a touch of high blood pressure, I think. Other than that… it's not a particularly sickly family, if I'm honest. We’re a hardy bunch, mostly. Do you need me to be more specific, Doctor? I can try to remember more, if you’d like.
DOCTOR: “A touch” of high blood pressure isn’t terribly helpful, Ms. Squiers. But we’ll note the lung cancer and stroke. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, I've never smoked a day in my life! I always thought it was a dreadful habit. My father, as I mentioned, was a smoker, and I saw the effect it had on him. It was enough to put me off for life. I find the smell quite unpleasant, to be honest. And I do enjoy a wee bit of fresh air, you see. A healthy constitution requires it, don't you think? No, smoking is certainly not for me. And I encourage others to steer clear of it as well.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I enjoy a glass of sherry with my dinner sometimes. Perhaps two, if it's a special occasion. Nothing excessive, I assure you. A wee bit of sherry helps me relax, you see. And I do enjoy a nice brandy around Christmas time, but that’s maybe once or twice a year. I'm not a heavy drinker, not at all. I prefer a cup of tea, if I’m honest! But a small glass of sherry is a nice treat now and then. Do you consider that excessive, Doctor? I do try to be sensible.
DOCTOR: “Sensible” is subjective, Ms. Squiers. Alright. Let’s move on. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Well, I don't go to a gym, if that's what you mean, Doctor. I’m not one for all that modern equipment. But I do enjoy a good walk. I walk to the shops most days, and I potter around in my garden quite a bit. Gardening keeps me active, you see. Bending and stretching, digging and weeding… it's good exercise, if you ask me. And I do a bit of housework, of course. Dusting and polishing and so on. I try to keep myself busy, and I’m not one to sit idle. Do you consider that exercise, Doctor? I do try to stay active in my own way.
DOCTOR: It’s…adequate. Finally, are you currently experiencing any symptoms – any pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness…anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I feel perfectly fine, thank you very much. No pain, no fatigue, no shortness of breath, no dizziness. I feel as fit as a fiddle, if I'm honest. I sleep well, I eat well, and I’m not troubled by anything at all. That's why I'm surprised you're asking all these questions, to be perfectly frank. But I'm happy to answer them, of course, just to be certain for the cruise. But I can assure you, I feel perfectly healthy. A wee bit creaky in the mornings, perhaps, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Other than that, I’m in tip-top condition. Are you satisfied now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. It’s standard procedure. Please step onto the scale for me.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Standard procedure, you say? I suppose that’s sensible. I always worry these scales are a bit off, you know. They can be very deceiving. Still, I’ll step on, if it puts your mind at ease. I'm rather proud of my figure, actually, despite my age. Though I do enjoy a good piece of cake now and then…
DOCTOR: 109 pounds. And your height is listed as 171 centimeters. That puts your BMI at…rather low, Ms. Squiers. Now, if you'll follow me, we'll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, is that low, Doctor? I've never paid much attention to my BMI, to be honest. I just eat a sensible diet, and I stay active, as I mentioned. I do hope everything is alright. I'm not a fan of doctors, you know. Not that you're doing anything wrong, of course. It's just…well, I prefer to stay healthy without too much poking and prodding, if you understand. But I'll do as you say, if it’s necessary for the cruise. Do let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, will you?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Squiers. Now, please relax and breathe normally. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is regular, but a bit slow. Lungs are clear, but breathing is shallow. Blood pressure is… 98/62. That's quite low, Ms. Squiers. Are you often lightheaded or dizzy?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Low again? Is that bad, Doctor? I do sometimes feel a bit…faint, perhaps, when I stand up quickly. But I just put that down to getting older, you see. And I don't drink enough water, probably. I prefer a nice cup of tea, as I mentioned. And I don't get out in the sun much. Perhaps that's it? I do try to take care of myself, but I'm not a young woman anymore, am I? Are you concerned, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is significantly low, Ms. Squiers, and your BMI is also low. While a low blood pressure isn't always a cause for concern, coupled with your reported occasional dizziness and low BMI, it warrants further investigation. It could be something simple, like dehydration, as you suggested, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Oh dear, you're worrying me now, Doctor. Further investigation? What sort of investigation? That’s a bit startling, isn't it? I do try to be sensible, as I've said, and I'm not one for causing trouble. Is it something serious? Should I be calling my brother? He’s a retired accountant, you know, very sensible fellow. He might have some advice. I just want to enjoy my cruise, you see. It’s my first proper holiday since… well, since my husband passed.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are diminished, Ms. Squiers. Based on your low blood pressure, low BMI, reported dizziness, and diminished reflexes, I am concerned about possible orthostatic hypotension and potential nutritional deficiencies. It's not necessarily something serious at this moment, but it requires further evaluation. We need to rule out underlying conditions. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, electrolytes, a vitamin D level, and a thyroid panel. And I’d like you to schedule an appointment with a cardiologist for a full cardiac evaluation, including an EKG and possibly a Holter monitor. And yes, it’s advisable to inform your brother. He may be able to offer support. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you are fit to travel. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear, blood work and a cardiologist? That sounds… rather complicated, doesn’t it? A Holter monitor? What is a Holter monitor? It all sounds very frightening, Doctor. Are you sure it’s nothing serious? I just want to enjoy my cruise. And what about the cruise, Doctor? Will I have to cancel it? It’s on the 18th of September, you see, and I’ve already paid for it. I’ve been looking forward to it for months. And my brother… well, he worries terribly. He’ll have a fit when I tell him this. Please, Doctor, tell me it’s nothing serious. And tell me I won’t have to cancel my cruise.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I understand your concerns. It's not necessarily serious, but we need to be thorough. These tests are a precaution to rule out potential underlying conditions that could become serious if left untreated. A Holter monitor is a small device that records your heart rhythm over 24-48 hours. It’s non-invasive and quite simple. Regarding your cruise, I'm not saying you have to cancel it at this point. However, I strongly advise you not to travel until we have the results of these tests and have a clear understanding of your cardiac health. Traveling with an undiagnosed cardiac condition could be risky. We need to prioritize your health, Ms. Squiers. It's better to postpone the cruise if necessary than to risk a medical emergency while at sea. I’m going to write a note to your primary care physician as well, recommending these tests. Let’s get these tests scheduled as soon as possible, and then we can discuss your options. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Tests… so many tests. I don't have a primary care physician, Doctor. As I mentioned, my husband always handled those things. I haven’t really needed to see a doctor since he passed, until now, it seems. A medical emergency at sea… that sounds dreadful. I hadn’t even thought of that. Will the tests take long, Doctor? And are they… expensive? I don't have insurance, you see. My husband handled all the finances as well. I have a bit of savings, but I don’t want to deplete it all on medical bills. I suppose… postponing the cruise is better than risking a medical emergency. But it’s just… it’s been so long since I’ve had a holiday. And I was so looking forward to it. What sort of questions will the cardiologist ask, Doctor? I’m not very good with medical jargon, and I don’t want to get confused.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers. Let’s address your concerns one at a time. The tests will likely take a few days to schedule, and the results usually come back within a week or so. Regarding the cost, I understand you do not have insurance. I will ask the lab to provide you with the cash price for each test, and we can discuss payment options if needed. I can also see if the lab offers a discount for paying upfront. As for the cardiologist, they will likely ask you about your medical history, any symptoms you're experiencing, your family history, and your lifestyle. They will perform a physical exam and an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. They may also recommend further tests, such as a Holter monitor or an echocardiogram. It’s important to be honest and thorough with the cardiologist, Ms. Squiers. Don't hesitate to ask them to explain anything you don't understand. Medical jargon can be confusing, and it’s their job to make sure you understand your condition and treatment options. Here is the name of a cardiologist I recommend. They are very good and will explain everything to you in plain language. Schedule an appointment with them as soon as possible, and then we can discuss the results when you return. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… another appointment. It all feels very overwhelming, Doctor. I just wanted a simple form filled out for my cruise, and now… now I have a cardiologist, and tests, and potential medical emergencies. You said potential medical emergencies. What sort of emergencies are we talking about, Doctor? Are we talking about… serious things? I’m not a brave woman, you see. I get very flustered easily. And my brother… he’ll have a fit. And what about the cruise line? Will they accept a form filled out by the cardiologist? Or will they want all these test results as well? I don’t want to lose the money I’ve already paid. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now, Doctor. I just feel very… confused and overwhelmed. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I understand your anxiety. Let’s address your concerns. Potential medical emergencies could include arrhythmias – irregular heartbeats – or underlying heart conditions that could be exacerbated by travel. These are not necessarily serious conditions, but they require evaluation and management. Regarding the cruise line, it's best to contact them directly and inquire about their requirements. They may accept a form filled out by the cardiologist, but it’s possible they will require test results as well. I will write a note stating your evaluation and my recommendations, which you can provide to them. It’s important to prioritize your health, Ms. Squiers. While I understand you're concerned about losing money, your well-being is more important. We need to rule out any potential risks before you travel. Here is a note summarizing your evaluation and my recommendations. I will also provide you with a referral to the cardiologist. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. It all feels very… daunting. Thank you for your time. And for… explaining everything. I suppose I’ll contact the cruise line and the cardiologist. And I’ll try not to worry too much. I just hope… I just hope everything will be alright. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Squiers. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, it's always best to err on the side of caution. .
