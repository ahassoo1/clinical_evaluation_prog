DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about this… procedure. My daughter insisted I come. Says I need a “clearance” before I can… get it done. Honestly, sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing. Just want to get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see here you’re referring to a colonoscopy scheduled for next week. And your daughter was concerned about ensuring you’re healthy enough for the procedure, is that right?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy. Yes, that’s it. Healthy enough. I’ve lived eighty-one years, haven’t I? Outlived most folks. What could possibly be wrong with me? My daughter… she worries too much. Always has.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of your daughter to be proactive about your health. Even if you feel perfectly fine, it’s always a good idea to make sure everything is functioning as it should before any procedure. Just a standard precaution. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Look, I work with stone. Terrazzo. Been doing it since I was a boy. It’s hard work. Always has been. Keeps a man… sturdy. Aside from that… nothing much bothers me. A little creaky in the mornings, what do you expect? I don't go to doctors unless absolutely necessary, and this… this is my daughter's doing, not mine.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you've been active for so long. Terrazzo work is physically demanding. And it's understandable you only come in when needed. To get a better picture, could you tell me if you've been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Diagnosed… well, old age, I suppose. That's a condition, isn't it? No, seriously… I had my gallbladder out years ago. Must have been… forty years ago? And… the doctor once said my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on a pill for a while. Stopped taking it, though. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and I don’t like being full of chemicals. Other than that… nothing comes to mind. Not a sickly man, never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal approximately forty years ago, and a history of elevated blood pressure. Good to know. Do you remember what medication you were on for your blood pressure, or for how long?
PATIENT: Medication… no, can't say I do. Little white pill, I think. Or maybe it was pink? Honestly, it was a long time ago, and I don’t pay attention to such things. The doctor kept changing it, if I remember correctly. Something about… side effects, maybe? I just stopped taking it when I didn't feel any different. Waste of money, if you ask me. Now, are we nearly finished? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Alright, no worries about the specifics of the medication. It sounds like it was a while ago, and it’s not essential right now. Just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I told you, I don't like being full of chemicals. I eat a good breakfast, work hard, and that’s all I need. Vitamins are for people who don’t eat right, and I certainly do. No pills, no powders, nothing. Are we done yet? I really must be going. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. That's good to know. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness no. I've eaten everything under the sun. Worked outside my whole life. Dust, pollen, stone dust… I'm used to it all. Never had a problem. Honestly, doctor, are you trying to find something wrong with me? I’m perfectly fine. Let’s just get this “clearance” done so I can get on with my life.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, I think it would be best to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline before your colonoscopy. That’s standard procedure, and it will only take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? Must you? I suppose… if it's absolutely necessary. But make it quick, doctor. I haven't got all day. And I expect a full explanation of why you're doing everything. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll explain everything as I go. We'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. I’ll also palpate your abdomen. Just a routine check to make sure everything looks good before the procedure. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Honestly… all this fuss over a little look inside. It's ridiculous. Just get it over with. And be gentle, I have important work to do. Stone doesn’t carve itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 82. It's not alarmingly high, but it is something we should be aware of. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, lungs sound a bit… congested. It could be a number of things, and doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. Do you cough frequently?
PATIENT: Congested? What's that mean? I do cough a little in the mornings, always have. Dust, you know. Stone dust. Been breathing it in for eighty years. It’s what I do. Always thought it was just a bit of a tickle. Never bothered me enough to see a doctor about it. Honestly, doctor, are you trying to find something wrong where there isn’t anything? I feel perfectly fine, and my daughter is going to be furious if she finds out you’re trying to keep me from getting this done.
DOCTOR: I understand. A chronic cough with a history of stone dust exposure is certainly something to consider. The crackling I heard could be related to that. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Okay, throat is a little red, but nothing significant. Just some mild irritation. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen, just to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Okay. A little tenderness here on the right side. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, a bit! What are you doing? That’s… uncomfortable. It's probably just… old age. Or maybe I lifted something heavy yesterday. Stone is heavy work, you know. Honestly, doctor, are you trying to hurt me? I’ve had enough of this poking and prodding. What do you think is wrong with me? Just tell me straight. I don’t have time for guessing games. And if you’re going to tell my daughter I’m “not healthy enough”, she’s going to have my hide!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Orwin. I understand your frustration. Based on what I’ve found during the exam – the elevated blood pressure, the crackling in your lungs, the mild tenderness in your abdomen, and the chronic cough – there are a few things we need to investigate further before proceeding with the colonoscopy. It’s not that you’re necessarily “not healthy enough,” but it would be irresponsible of me to proceed without getting a clearer picture of what’s going on. The tenderness in your abdomen, combined with the cough and lung sounds, could indicate a possible respiratory infection, or something else going on in your abdomen. The elevated blood pressure needs to be managed as well. I recommend we order some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? An X-ray? Good heavens. This is getting ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. My daughter is going to be furious. But… I suppose if you insist. I don’t want her blaming me if something goes wrong during this… colonoscopy. Fine. Do what you have to do. But make it quick. And tell me when I can expect this “clearance”. I have work waiting for me. And don’t you dare tell my daughter I’m “sick”. I’m perfectly fine. Just a bit… worn down, that’s all. Now, are we finally finished? This has taken long enough. .
