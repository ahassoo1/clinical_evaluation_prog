DOCTOR: Good morning, Lytisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think? Something about making sure… things are alright. My memory isn't what it used to be, so I’m a bit fuzzy on the details. Something to do with… checking for stuff, yeah. It was the nice lady on the phone who said I needed it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you're referring to a routine screening. Let's see… Yes, it looks like you are scheduled for a cognitive assessment today, as recommended by your primary care physician. It's a fairly common test, especially as we get older, just to get a baseline and see how things are functioning. Before we get started, could you tell me a little bit about why your doctor recommended it?
PATIENT: Oh, my doctor… Doctor… uh… Evans, I think? Yes, Doctor Evans. He… he mentioned something about me being a little forgetful, and… well, I am forgetful. He said it was just to be on the safe side. He didn't say much more, honestly. I mostly drive heavy equipment, you know? Paving and such. It's loud, and I'm usually pretty tired after a long day. Maybe that's part of it? I don't really remember when he suggested this test, either. Sorry, I'm not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Lytisha. It’s perfectly normal to be forgetful, and it’s even more understandable with a physically demanding job like yours. Loud environments and fatigue can definitely play a role. It’s good your doctor is being proactive. So, just to clarify, Doctor Evans mentioned this forgetfulness during a routine check-up?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. It was… sometime after I had that little fender-bender with the roller. Not a big one, thankfully. Just bumped into a mailbox. He asked me a lot of questions afterwards. About… about how I felt, and if I remembered what happened. And then he talked about getting this test done. It was a few months ago, I think. Time just… slips away, you know? He said something about it being a good idea to have a baseline, in case… well, in case anything changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fender-bender a few months ago, and Doctor Evans wanted to establish a baseline due to some concerns then. That's very helpful. Now, outside of the occasional forgetfulness or the mailbox incident, have you noticed any other changes in your thinking or memory?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, sometimes I get… mixed up with directions. Even on roads I’ve driven a hundred times. And my daughter, bless her heart, she says I repeat myself. A lot. I don't mean to, but I'll tell her the same story twice in five minutes, sometimes. And… oh, and names. I struggle with names these days. It’s embarrassing, really. I’ll look right at someone and… blank. It's just… frustrating, more than anything. I used to have a really good memory. Especially for faces. Not anymore, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some difficulty with directions, repeating stories, and trouble recalling names. Those are all things we'll want to look into. And it’s understandable that it's frustrating, especially when you used to have a strong memory. Just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality lately?
PATIENT: Mood… hmm. I get… easily irritated, I suppose. Little things bother me that never used to. And I've been… less patient, definitely. Not with anyone in particular, just… generally. My daughter says I’m more withdrawn, that I don't talk as much. I don't feel sad, not really. Just… tired. And… a bit overwhelmed, I guess. Everything feels like a lot of effort these days. It's hard to explain. I just… want to be left alone sometimes. Which isn't like me at all. I used to be the life of the party! Now… I just want a quiet evening. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Lytisha. Irritability, feeling withdrawn, and increased fatigue can all be important clues. It’s good you’re noticing these changes and sharing them with me. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been under control with medication for years now. Doctor Evans monitors it regularly. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy years ago, maybe thirty years ago? Something like that. Other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve been pretty healthy, actually. Until recently, I mean. I don't remember being sick much as a kid, either. Just the usual colds and flu. Nothing serious. Do you need all this information? It's hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is all very helpful, Lytisha. Knowing your medical history helps me get a complete picture. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a hysterectomy thirty years ago. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let’s see… I have this for my blood pressure, like we said. And… oh, this little orange one is for my arthritis. Just something to help with the aches and pains. And sometimes I take something for sleep, but not every night. Just when I’m really restless. That's about it, I think. Doctor Evans prescribed all of them. He’s a good doctor, really. I trust him. I just wish I could remember things better.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication, something for arthritis, and an occasional sleep aid, all prescribed by Dr. Evans. That's excellent. Now, just one last question about your history, before we move on to the physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. I don’t think so. I used to be allergic to bee stings as a kid, but I haven't been stung in years, and I don't think I'm allergic anymore. Other than that… no, I don’t have any known allergies. Not to food, not to medications, nothing. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Except for this forgetfulness, of course. But that doesn’t really feel like an allergy, does it?
DOCTOR: No, forgetfulness isn’t an allergy! It’s good to know you don’t have any known medication or food allergies. Okay, Lytisha, that gives me a good baseline understanding of your health. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to check your vital signs and do a quick neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… don’t be too surprised if I’m a bit slow. Like I said, my brain isn't working quite as fast as it used to be. I’ll try my best, though. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lytisha. We'll take things at your pace. No need to rush. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6 – all within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe in and out deeply for me. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Next, I'm going to do a few simple tests to check your reflexes and coordination. Can you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is this… is this going to be difficult? I'm a little worried I'll mess it up. My hands sometimes tremble a bit, especially when I’m nervous. But I’m trying my best. It’s a little hard to focus, though. Everything feels a bit… blurry, like I’m looking through a fog. But I'm following it. I think. Is this okay? Should I… should I stop? I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: You’re not wasting my time at all, Lytisha. And it's perfectly okay to stop if you’re uncomfortable. It sounds like you’re a little anxious, which can certainly affect your coordination. And the slight tremor is noted. Given your concerns about memory and the slight tremor, and based on what you've told me, I think it would be best to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. These will include a blood test to check for vitamin deficiencies and thyroid problems, and an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh dear. Is that… is that serious? I don’t like being in enclosed spaces. It makes me feel… claustrophobic. And I'm a bit worried about what they might find, if you're looking for problems. But… if you think it's necessary, I suppose I can do it. I trust your judgment. But could we… could we talk about it a little first? What exactly are you looking for? And what if… what if something is wrong? I don't want to get too upset. I’m already feeling a little overwhelmed. Perhaps just the blood test would be enough to start with?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, Lytisha, and it’s perfectly okay to feel anxious about an MRI. It’s a common concern. Let me explain. The MRI is primarily to rule out any structural changes in your brain that could be contributing to your memory problems. Things like small strokes, tumors, or shrinkage of brain tissue. We're not necessarily expecting to find anything wrong, but it's important to have a baseline and rule out those possibilities. As for the enclosed space, many MRI centers offer open MRIs, which are less confining. We can certainly schedule you for one of those if you prefer. And you can always take a mild sedative to help you relax during the scan. As for starting with just the blood test, that's perfectly reasonable. It can give us some helpful information about vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems that can sometimes cause memory issues. We can do that first and see how it goes. If the blood test is inconclusive, then we can revisit the MRI. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better. Starting with the blood test feels a lot less scary. And the open MRI… that’s a relief to hear. I think I could manage that if it comes to it. But let’s definitely do the blood test first. And… if it turns out something is wrong, will you explain everything to me? In plain English, please. I don’t understand a lot of medical terms. And… will my daughter be able to come with me to the appointments? She’s very good at taking notes and asking questions. I sometimes forget things, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lytisha. We will absolutely start with the blood test. And I promise to explain everything to you in plain English, no medical jargon. I understand that can be confusing, and I want you to feel fully informed every step of the way. And yes, your daughter is more than welcome to come with you to any and all appointments. Having someone with you for support and to take notes is a great idea. Okay, I’m going to order the blood test now. You can go to the lab at [Name of local lab]. They’re open from 8 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Alzoubi ordered the test. It should take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me right now before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And… I appreciate you listening. It’s nice to finally talk about this. I’ve been feeling a little silly worrying about forgetting things, but you made me feel like it’s okay to ask for help. I guess I’ll just… go to the lab when I have a chance. And I’ll call to schedule the follow-up appointment when I hear back. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Lytisha. You go to the lab when you have a chance, and call to schedule a follow-up appointment when you have the results. And you're absolutely not silly for worrying! It’s always good to be proactive about your health, and I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment.
