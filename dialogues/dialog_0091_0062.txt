DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today with Medicare insurance. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Yes, Medicare is correct. I am here today regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the masks, or rather, the requirement to wear them. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and… well, I have some difficulties with them, and need to discuss a possible exemption, or perhaps an alternative.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Knabenshue. I understand you're seeking guidance regarding the mask requirement at your workplace as a Protective Service Worker. We can certainly discuss that. To help me understand the situation fully, could you describe the specific difficulties you’re experiencing with wearing a mask?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is… difficult to explain precisely. It isn't that I am against protecting myself or others, understand. It’s more… a physical discomfort. The masks, they feel… constricting. My breathing feels labored, and I experience a tightness in my chest. Not a pain, precisely, but a… pressing sensation. It makes concentrating on my work, which requires a fair amount of focus, rather challenging. And, if I am being honest, it brings about a degree of… anxiety. It makes me feel… trapped, if that makes any sense. I’ve tried different types – the surgical ones, the cloth ones, the N95s – and the feeling is consistent across all of them.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of physical discomfort and psychological distress related to mask wearing. That's important information. To get a clearer picture, let's go through some questions, if you don't mind. First, how long have you been experiencing these difficulties?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Please, proceed with your questions. I am happy to answer them as thoroughly as I am able. The difficulties began when the mask requirement was implemented, approximately six months ago. Initially, I thought it was simply a matter of adjusting, of becoming accustomed to the sensation. However, the feeling has not lessened with time. If anything, it has… remained consistent, or perhaps even slightly worsened, particularly during periods of increased stress at work. It is… discouraging, as I take my responsibilities very seriously, and I do not wish to compromise my ability to perform my duties.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Mr. Knabenshue. That's helpful. Now, have you had any prior history of respiratory issues – asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not. I have always been in good health, to the best of my knowledge. I have never been diagnosed with any respiratory illness, nor have I ever experienced any prolonged breathing difficulties prior to the implementation of the mask requirement. I am not a smoker, and I maintain a reasonably active lifestyle, with regular walks and occasional light gardening. My family history is also unremarkable in regards to lung conditions. It truly is… puzzling, this reaction to the masks. It feels rather… isolated, this experience.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Knabenshue. It’s certainly unusual to develop these symptoms without any prior respiratory history. Let’s move on to a brief review of other systems. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the breathing difficulties and anxiety – perhaps dizziness, palpitations, headaches, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been experiencing occasional headaches, particularly at the end of a long workday. They are not debilitating, but a persistent throbbing sensation, usually located at the base of my skull. And… I have noticed a slight dizziness from time to time, especially when standing up quickly. Palpitations, no, I haven’t experienced that. My vision is unchanged, as far as I can tell. It’s… I hadn't made a direct connection between these symptoms and the masks, but in retrospect, they seem to coincide with periods of mask wearing. It's… concerning.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing those details, Mr. Knabenshue. Those additional symptoms – the headaches and dizziness – are important to note. To rule out any underlying medical causes, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your blood pressure, heart rate, and listening to your lungs. I would also like to assess your oxygen saturation levels with a pulse oximeter. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly acceptable. I understand the need for a thorough assessment. I have no objections whatsoever. Please, proceed at your convenience. I am… eager to discover the source of these difficulties, and if possible, to find a resolution that allows me to continue performing my duties without compromise. I am… grateful for your attention to this matter.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s begin. Your breath sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles noted. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air, which is within the normal range. Now, I’m going to have you take a few deep breaths while I listen again. Breathing sounds remain clear. No abnormal findings upon palpation of your neck or chest. Your neurological exam is grossly normal; no deficits detected. Given your symptoms and the findings of this examination, it’s difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause at this moment. However, the dizziness and headaches, combined with the anxiety and discomfort related to mask wearing, suggest a possible contribution from hyperventilation and heightened stress response. It is also possible, though less likely given the normal oxygen saturation, that there is a subtle sensitivity to the mask material itself. To be more certain, I recommend a few additional tests. Would you be willing to undergo a complete blood count, and potentially an EKG to rule out any cardiac abnormalities?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… reasonable. I am willing to undergo whatever tests you deem necessary. A complete blood count and an EKG… yes, those seem prudent. I appreciate your thorough approach. I… I admit, I was beginning to worry that this was simply a matter of… my own anxieties, but your examination and proposed tests reassure me that you are taking this seriously. I… I want to ensure that I am not compromising my health or the safety of others. So, please, proceed with those tests at your earliest convenience. I… I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Knabenshue. I’ll order those tests for you right away. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will guide you through the process. It should take approximately 30-45 minutes. In the meantime, while we await the results, I recommend practicing some simple breathing exercises to help manage the anxiety and hyperventilation. Diaphragmatic breathing – also known as belly breathing – can be particularly effective. I can provide you with a handout outlining the technique, and there are also many helpful resources available online. I would also like to refer you to a counselor specializing in stress management. Addressing the psychological component of your symptoms may be beneficial, regardless of the underlying cause. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, both of those suggestions sound… helpful. A handout outlining the breathing exercises would be greatly appreciated, and a referral to a counselor… yes, please. I… I have always prided myself on my self-reliance, but I recognize that seeking assistance is not a sign of weakness, but rather, a responsible course of action. I… I am willing to explore all avenues to resolve this matter. I… thank you for your comprehensive approach, and for your… understanding. This has been… a relief, actually. I was… apprehensive about bringing this matter to anyone’s attention.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I commend you for taking proactive steps to address this issue. It takes courage to acknowledge these difficulties, and I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for you. Here is the handout. And I’ll have my assistant schedule a consultation with a qualified counselor for you. They’ll be in touch to discuss available options and scheduling. Once the lab results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have addressed all of my concerns thoroughly and provided me with a clear course of action. I… I genuinely appreciate your time, your patience, and your… compassionate approach. I… I feel much more hopeful now than I did when I arrived. Thank you. I believe that will be all. .
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to reviewing the lab results with you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Knabenshue. .
