DOCTOR: Hi Liza, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s very nice to meet you too, Dr. DeCosta. Well, I’ve been thinking about… trying to be more present, I guess. I keep hearing about mindfulness and meditation, and it sounded like something that might help. I work on the railway – signal and track switches – and it can be… a lot. Sometimes I feel like my mind is always racing, even when things are quiet. I thought maybe you could tell me a little about it?
DOCTOR: That's a really thoughtful thing to consider, Liza. It sounds like you're experiencing some stress and a racing mind, and exploring mindfulness is a great idea. It’s very common, especially with demanding jobs like yours. It's good you’re being proactive about it. Before we dive into mindfulness specifically, could you tell me a bit more about when you notice your mind racing?
PATIENT: Hmm, good question. It's not really at work, not usually. When I'm actually doing the repairs, I have to be very focused, and I am. It's more… before and after work, and especially at night. I lie in bed, and my brain just… goes. Thinking about things that happened during the day, or worrying about tomorrow. Even silly little things, really. And sometimes even during the day, if I have a few minutes downtime, it starts up. It’s not crippling or anything, just… annoying and makes it hard to relax. I remember things very clearly, though, so it's not like I'm forgetting what I need to do, just… processing too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So it sounds like it’s more prominent during periods of rest, and not interfering with your job performance, which is good to know. It’s a pattern of heightened awareness and rumination, especially when you’re not actively engaged. To get a better understanding of what might be contributing to this, and to rule out anything else going on, could you tell me a little bit about your sleep?
PATIENT: Well, I usually sleep okay. I get about seven or eight hours a night, I think. I don’t have trouble falling asleep, but I do wake up a couple of times during the night. Usually just to use the bathroom, but sometimes… I wake up and my mind is already going. Then it takes me a little while to get back to sleep. I don't usually feel tired during the day, but… not always completely rested, if that makes sense. I don't drink coffee or anything, and I try to have a regular bedtime, but it doesn’t always work out that way. Work shifts change sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: That makes a lot of sense, especially with the shift work. Irregular sleep schedules can definitely disrupt things. So, about seven to eight hours, but potentially fragmented sleep with some nighttime awakenings and a racing mind making it harder to fall back asleep. Now, let's talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really, no. I mean, nothing major. I eat pretty regularly, although maybe not always the healthiest things when I’m on a tight schedule. I haven’t been feeling more anxious or depressed, if that’s what you mean. I enjoy my work, even though it can be stressful. I see my friends occasionally, mostly on weekends. I don't really have any big hobbies, just… relaxing, watching TV, reading. Nothing strenuous. Oh! I did have a little bit of a cold a few weeks ago, but it didn't last long. That’s about it, I think. I feel pretty… normal, except for the thinking-too-much part.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. It sounds like you’re generally healthy and functioning well, and this “thinking-too-much” is really the main concern. Given what you've described – the racing thoughts primarily during rest, fragmented sleep, generally good health and mood – it doesn’t sound like there’s an obvious medical cause we need to immediately investigate. However, to be thorough, and since you mentioned a recent cold, let’s quickly go through a little review of systems. Just a few questions about different parts of your body to make sure we haven’t overlooked anything. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Better to be sure, I suppose. Go ahead. I'm happy to answer whatever you need to know.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, starting with your head – have you had any recent headaches, dizziness, changes in your vision, or hearing problems?
PATIENT: No, none of that. No headaches, no dizziness, my vision is fine – I get it checked every year for my work, actually – and my hearing is good. I haven't noticed any ringing in my ears or anything like that. I'm a little sensitive to bright light sometimes, but that's always been the case. I work outside a lot, so that makes sense, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. Moving down to your neck, chest, and lungs – any shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, or wheezing?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I mean, I get a little winded sometimes when I’m climbing around on the tracks, but that's just from the physical exertion. No chest pain, no cough, no wheezing. My lungs feel fine. I haven't had any trouble breathing when I’m resting. I did have a little bit of a sore throat when I had that cold, but it went away.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. How about your stomach and bowels?
PATIENT: No problems there either. I eat pretty regularly, like I said, and everything goes through as it should. No stomach pain, no bloating, no nausea, nothing unusual. I haven’t had any changes in my appetite. Sometimes I feel a little heartburn if I eat something spicy, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Let's move on to your extremities – any pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My arms and legs feel fine. I do get a little bit tired after a long day at work, but that's just from the physical activity. No pain, no numbness, no tingling, no weakness. I can walk and move around just fine. I haven't noticed any swelling in my ankles or feet.
DOCTOR: Alright, and finally, any recent changes in your weight, fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My weight has been pretty stable, maybe a pound or two here or there, but nothing significant. I didn’t have a fever or chills with that cold, just a stuffy nose and a sore throat. And no night sweats, thankfully. I sleep pretty warm as it is! So, no, nothing unusual on that front. I think that’s everything?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is everything. Thank you for answering all those questions so thoroughly. It sounds like, physically, you're in good health. And based on everything you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing what we might call a period of heightened stress and rumination, which is causing the racing thoughts, particularly at night. This is quite common, especially with a demanding job and irregular sleep. Now, we can explore some strategies to help manage this. Are you familiar with techniques like mindfulness, meditation, or relaxation exercises?
PATIENT: I've heard of them, of course. I think I saw something on TV once about meditation, but I don't really know what it involves. I've never actually tried any of it. It always seemed a little… out there, I guess. Like something you'd have to be really good at to be effective. And I’m not very good at sitting still, to be honest. I always feel like I should be doing something. But I’m willing to try, if you think it might help. What exactly is mindfulness, and how would it work for someone like me?
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable reaction, Liza. It often does seem a little daunting, and there's a lot of misconception about it. The good news is, you don’t need to be “good” at it, and it’s not about emptying your mind – it’s actually about acknowledging your thoughts without getting carried away by them. Think of it like this: your mind is like a busy street. Thoughts are like cars driving by. Mindfulness is like sitting on the sidewalk and watching the cars go by, without trying to stop them or jump in. You simply observe them, acknowledge them, and let them pass. There are many different ways to practice mindfulness. Some people prefer guided meditations – there are lots of free apps and online resources. Others find it helpful to simply focus on their breath for a few minutes each day. We could also talk about progressive muscle relaxation, which can help reduce physical tension. Would you be interested in trying a short guided meditation right now, just to get a feel for it?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay, a short one sounds alright. I'm a little skeptical, but I'm willing to give it a try. As long as it doesn’t involve chanting or anything like that! I’m not really a “woo-woo” kind of person. And if it's too hard, I can just stop, right? I don't want to feel pressured.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no chanting! And yes, you can absolutely stop at any time. It's about finding what works for you. This is just a starting point. Okay, let’s try a very short body scan meditation. It’s about bringing awareness to different parts of your body and noticing any sensations without judgment. It’s okay if your mind wanders – just gently redirect your attention back to your body. Let’s get comfortable. Sit with your feet flat on the floor, and your hands resting in your lap. Close your eyes if that’s comfortable for you, or simply lower your gaze. Take a few deep breaths, noticing the rise and fall of your chest. And now, let’s begin… Bring your attention to your toes… Notice any sensations – warmth, coolness, tingling, pressure… Simply observe, without judging… And now, move your attention to your feet… Notice any sensations… And now, your ankles… Just notice…
PATIENT: It's… hard to not think about everything else. My mind is just racing. I'm thinking about the track repairs I need to do tomorrow, and whether I remembered to order the right parts… and now I'm wondering if I left the stove on. This is… not relaxing.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal, Liza. Your mind will wander – that’s what minds do. The point isn’t to stop the thoughts, but to notice when they arise, and gently redirect your attention back to your body. Don’t judge yourself for thinking – just acknowledge the thought, and let it go. Okay, let’s bring our attention back to the present moment. Take a few deep breaths, and when you’re ready, you can slowly open your eyes. How was that experience for you?
PATIENT: It was… frustrating, to be honest. My mind just wouldn't quiet down. I kept getting distracted, thinking about work and everything else. I felt like I was more aware of my thoughts than before! It's not like in the movies, where everyone is all zen and peaceful. I just kept thinking about all the things I need to do. I don't think this is for me. It's… too hard. Maybe I'm just not wired that way. I need to be doing something, not sitting here trying to empty my head.
DOCTOR: That’s completely valid, Liza. It’s very common to find it challenging at first, and it’s absolutely not for everyone. And you're right – it's not about emptying your head, and it’s definitely not about achieving some kind of zen state. It’s a skill that takes practice, and it sounds like it might not be the right fit for you right now. That's perfectly okay. We can explore other strategies to help manage your stress and racing thoughts. Have you ever considered talking to a therapist or counselor?
PATIENT: A therapist? No, I haven’t. I mean, I don’t have any problems problems, you know? I’m not depressed or anything. I just get a little stressed sometimes. I don’t really see the point of talking to someone about it. I can usually handle things on my own. And honestly, the thought of sharing my personal life with a stranger… it doesn’t appeal to me. I just need to find a way to relax, I guess. Maybe I should try taking up a hobby or something. Something to take my mind off things. Do you have any suggestions?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Liza. It’s very common to feel hesitant about therapy, especially if you don’t feel like you have “problems” problems. And you’re right, a hobby can be a fantastic way to manage stress and take your mind off things. Often, finding something engaging that you enjoy can be incredibly helpful. Something creative, physical, or even social. Have you thought about anything you used to enjoy, or anything you’ve been curious about trying?
PATIENT: Hmm… when I was younger, I used to enjoy gardening. My grandmother had a beautiful garden, and I helped her with it. It was very relaxing, getting my hands dirty and watching things grow. But I don’t have a garden now, and I don’t really have the space for one. I also used to like reading, but I haven't had much time for it lately. I mostly watch TV these days, which isn't very stimulating. Maybe I should try to get back into reading. Or… I’ve always been curious about learning to paint, but I don’t know where to start. It seems… intimidating. I'm not very artistic, to be honest. I'm better with my hands, fixing things. Maybe a woodworking class? That might be more my speed.
DOCTOR: Those all sound like excellent options, Liza! Woodworking sounds particularly promising, given that you enjoy fixing things and working with your hands. It’s a great way to engage your mind and create something tangible. It’s wonderful that you’re already thinking about things you might enjoy. Perhaps looking into a local woodworking class would be a good first step?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe. I'll look into it. I have a friend who takes a pottery class, I could ask her about it. Honestly, I think I just need to make more time for myself. Work has been really busy lately, and I haven't been taking care of myself. I've been eating poorly and not getting enough sleep. I need to prioritize my own well-being, I guess. It’s just hard sometimes. Well, thank you, Dr. DeCosta. You've given me a lot to think about. I don’t think I need anything else today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. It sounds like you have a good understanding of what you need, and that's a fantastic first step. Prioritizing your own well-being is essential, and you're right – it can be challenging. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or if things change. And remember, small steps can make a big difference. Here's a brochure with some local resources for recreational classes, including woodworking. Have a wonderful day, Liza, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you. You too, Dr. DeCosta.
