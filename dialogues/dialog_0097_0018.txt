DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… going to the bathroom rather a lot lately. More than usual, certainly. It’s a bit bothersome, really. I suppose that's why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. More frequent urination than usual. That is bothersome. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. When you say "a lot," could you give me a rough idea of how many times you’re going in a day, and how that compares to your normal?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… aren’t my strong suit, Doctor. Let me see. Normally… I’d say perhaps four or five times a day? Perhaps less on some days. Now… it feels like every couple of hours. Maybe six or seven times, at least? It’s hard to be precise, I apologize. It's just… more frequent. And a good amount each time, if you understand. Not just a little trickle.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Verbos, it's perfectly alright. Six or seven times a day is definitely a change from four or five. And you mentioned a good amount each time – so not feeling like you're completely emptying your bladder each time you go?
PATIENT: Now that's a good question. I hadn’t really thought about it like that… No, I don’t believe so. It feels like… a reasonable amount, certainly, but not… completely empty, no. There's a little left behind, perhaps. Though, to be honest, I haven't been consciously trying to… fully empty it, if that makes sense. It’s just a feeling.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Verbos. Thank you for being so open. Okay, so increased frequency, and a sensation of incomplete emptying. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No… not really. I haven’t noticed anything particularly unusual. No pain, no burning… I sleep through the night without needing to get up, which I am grateful for. I suppose I'm a little more thirsty than usual, now that you mention it, but I attributed that to the warmer weather. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about sleeping through the night, and it's helpful you noticed the increased thirst. Yes, increased thirst can be relevant. No pain or burning is also good. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That’s a bit of a blur, honestly. I’ve seen a few doctors over the years, of course, but I’m not one for remembering details. I believe I had… a touch of high blood pressure years ago, but it was managed with… something. A pill, I suppose. And… no, I don’t believe I’ve ever been told I have diabetes. No prostate problems that I’m aware of. I mostly just try to stay active and eat reasonably well. Does that help? I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. Staying active and eating well is excellent. Knowing you had high blood pressure in the past is helpful. Do you remember what medication you were taking for it, or roughly when you were on it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… the name escapes me completely. A small white pill, I think. Perhaps… decades ago? Thirty or forty years, perhaps? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t terribly interested in the specifics. The doctor just said it would help lower my blood pressure, and I took it as prescribed. I stopped taking it eventually, when my numbers improved, I believe. I truly wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mr. Verbos. We'll work with what we have. Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Yes, actually. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, perhaps twenty years old. A standard procedure, I believe. And… I was hospitalized once for a bout of pneumonia, many years ago, but it wasn’t serious. Just a few days of rest and antibiotics. I don't believe I've had any other surgeries or prolonged hospital stays. Is that helpful? I'm trying my best to recall everything.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have been diagnosed with diabetes, kidney problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… that's another tricky one, Doctor. My parents… they both passed away some time ago. My mother had… heart trouble, I believe. My father… he was generally healthy, as far as I know. I have a sister, but we haven't spoken in many years. I honestly don't know much about her health, and I don't recall any specific illnesses running in the family. I apologize for my lack of information. We weren't a particularly close family, and medical details weren't often discussed.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Verbos. You’ve told me what you know, and that’s what’s important. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. Always considered it a rather foolish habit. And I drink… very occasionally. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but nothing more. I’m not much of a drinker, to be honest. Prefer a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had any serious allergic reactions. I’m not particularly sensitive to anything, as far as I know. Perhaps a mild seasonal allergy to pollen in the spring, but nothing that requires medication. I've been quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Mr. Verbos. Thank you for answering all of my questions so thoroughly. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief abdominal exam. Then we can discuss some potential causes for your symptoms and what steps we can take next. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. Everything sounds reasonably good, but your blood pressure is a little elevated, and I did feel some fullness in your lower abdomen. It doesn’t seem to cause you any pain, though. Given your symptoms – increased frequency, feeling of incomplete emptying, and the fullness I felt – and your slightly elevated blood pressure, several things could be going on. One possibility is an enlarged prostate, which is common in men your age. Another could be a urinary tract infection, though you don’t have any pain or fever, which makes that less likely. A third possibility is simply an overactive bladder. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a urine test to rule out an infection and a blood test to check your kidney function and prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, level. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An enlarged prostate… that doesn't sound particularly pleasant. A blood test and a urine test… yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If it will help determine the cause of the problem, then please proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I understand those are routine procedures, yes? Will they require much of my time? I have a… rather full schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Verbos, they are routine procedures. The urine test will just require a small sample, which you can provide here in the clinic. The blood test will involve a small vial of blood drawn from your arm. It will take about 15-20 minutes for the blood draw, and then we’ll send the samples to the lab. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have those results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I’d like you to try to drink at least eight glasses of water a day and avoid caffeine and alcohol. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Eight glasses of water… yes, that seems quite manageable, actually. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol… well, that won’t be a hardship, to be honest. So, just a urine sample and a small blood draw, then. And then we wait for the results. Very well, Doctor. Let’s proceed with the tests, then. Where would you like me to provide the sample?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The restroom is just over there. There’s a collection cup and instructions inside. Just bring the sample back to me when you’re finished, and we’ll get the blood draw scheduled right away. I'll have the nurse, Sarah, come in to take your blood after you've provided the sample. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe I have everything I need. A collection cup and instructions… and then Sarah will come to take my blood. Very well. I’ll be right back. Thank you for your clear explanation.
