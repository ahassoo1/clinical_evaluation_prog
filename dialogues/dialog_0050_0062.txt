DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you are forty-seven years of age, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that is correct. Forty-seven years this past April, actually. A good many winters, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s about the masks at work. My job, Protective Services, it requires a good bit of close contact with folks, and… I have some difficulty with wearing them for long periods. I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or maybe some other way to manage things.
DOCTOR: Protective Services, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I work with families, mostly. Checking in on the well-being of children, ensuring folks have what they need… it’s important work, but it often puts me face-to-face with people. And the masks… they just don’t quite work for me, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I see. And what specifically is the difficulty you’re experiencing with the masks, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: It's… hard to breathe, Doctor. Not all the time, but after a little while, maybe fifteen, twenty minutes, it feels like my lungs are closing up. Like there isn’t enough air getting in. It makes me a bit dizzy and anxious, to be honest. I've tried different kinds, different sizes… nothing seems to help much.
DOCTOR: "Difficulty breathing," you say. Have you had this difficulty prior to the mask mandates, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: That's a fair question, Doctor. No, sir, I haven’t. Before all this… masks weren’t something I ever needed to worry about. I've always been a healthy man, strong lungs from a life outdoors. It started with the masks, that’s why I’m concerned. I don’t have asthma or any lung problems, if that's what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you discussed this with your employer, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, I have. I spoke with my supervisor, Ms. Henderson. She was understanding, but she explained that they need documentation from a medical professional before they can consider an exemption. That’s why I’m here today, hoping you can help me figure out what’s going on and if I qualify for one. She's a good woman, Ms. Henderson, but policy is policy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: And what, precisely, does your job entail?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it varies day to day. Mostly, I conduct home visits to assess the safety and well-being of children. I talk with the families, observe the home environment… make sure the kids have what they need – food, shelter, a safe place to be. Sometimes it’s just offering support and resources. Other times, it’s more serious, involving reports of neglect or abuse. It’s a lot of face-to-face interaction, a lot of talking, and a lot of being close to people. It requires me to be able to read body language, build trust… things that are harder to do with a mask on.
DOCTOR: I see. So, close contact with the public, assessing families, some level of physical proximity. Now, have you had a recent physical examination?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, I did. Just last November, with Dr. Olsen over at the clinic in town. Routine check-up, blood work, everything. He said I was in good health, strong heart, normal lung function… He even commented on how good my blood pressure was. I can get you a copy of the report if you’d like. I always keep good records.
DOCTOR: That will not be necessary. While I appreciate your thoroughness, Mr. Knabenshue, a report from another physician is of limited value. I prefer to conduct my own assessment. Now, let us proceed with a brief examination. Please remove your shirt and shoes.
PATIENT: Remove my shirt, Doctor? I wasn't expecting a full examination. Is that necessary for a mask exemption request? I just thought a quick listen to my lungs might be sufficient. I’m not trying to be difficult, sir, but I’m a bit… private.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, I am a physician. A thorough evaluation is always necessary. To properly assess your condition and determine if a medical exemption is warranted, I must perform a complete physical examination. It is not simply a matter of listening to your lungs. It is a matter of professional responsibility. Now, please proceed. We have limited time, and I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If that's what you require… But I must say, I still don’t understand why a full examination is necessary for a mask exemption. It feels… excessive.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Chest expansion appears symmetrical. Heart rate is regular and within normal limits. Respiratory effort is normal at rest. No signs of accessory muscle use. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation. 98%. Within normal limits. Now, please take a deep breath and hold it. 18 seconds. Acceptable. All vital signs are within normal parameters. There is no objective evidence to suggest a medical condition that would preclude you from wearing a mask.
PATIENT: So… that's it? You've examined me and found nothing wrong, but that doesn't mean I don't have trouble breathing with a mask on? It's a feeling, Doctor. A discomfort. It's hard to explain if you haven't experienced it. Are you saying I'm just… imagining things? I came here for help, not to be told my feelings aren't valid.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, with all due respect, medicine is based on objective findings, not subjective feelings. While I acknowledge your discomfort, there is no physiological basis for a medical exemption. Your lungs are clear, your oxygen saturation is normal, and your respiratory effort is adequate. I understand you find masks uncomfortable, but that does not constitute a medical condition. Perhaps you should consider alternative methods of coping, such as relaxation techniques or mindfulness exercises. I am unable to provide a medical exemption. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. I believe you've made your position quite clear. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I guess I'll have to find another way to manage. .
