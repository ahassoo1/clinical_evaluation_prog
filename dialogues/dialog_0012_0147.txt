DOCTOR: Hi Amy, welcome. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been feeling… a lump in my lower stomach, I suppose. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower stomach. That’s good you’re getting it checked out. When you say “a little while”, about how long are we talking?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably around six weeks, maybe a little longer. At first, I didn't think much of it, honestly. I thought it was just something I ate, but it hasn’t gone away. It doesn’t hurt, usually, but sometimes I feel a bit of discomfort.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, okay. And no pain, just occasional discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. No real pain, just… a feeling of pressure, sometimes. It's not constant, thankfully. More when I’m active, I think. Like, if I’m walking a lot or lifting something.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure with activity. Is the lump on one particular side, or more in the middle?
PATIENT: It seems to be more on the right side, if I’m being precise. Not dramatically, but that’s where I notice it most. It’s not huge, Doctor, I should add. It's… noticeable when I lie down, that's when I really feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, right side, more noticeable when lying down. That gives me a little more to work with. Has anything else changed along with this – any changes in your bowel habits, appetite, or weight?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… my appetite has been a little off, I suppose. Not that I’m not eating, just not as much as usual. And I think I’ve lost a tiny bit of weight, but honestly, it’s hard to say for sure. I haven't been weighing myself regularly. My bowel habits seem normal, thankfully. No issues there.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight decrease in appetite and possible slight weight loss, but normal bowel habits. Do you have any medical conditions that you are aware of or are currently being treated for?
PATIENT: No, nothing that I'm aware of. I generally consider myself quite healthy. I have Medicare, as you probably know, but I haven't really needed to use it much up until now. I see a chiropractor occasionally for my back, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And no surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. Just the regular childhood things, like tonsils out when I was little, but nothing major since then. I mostly stay active with my work, you know, choreography keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical or surgical history. And family history – any history of cancer, particularly colon or abdominal cancers, in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a tough one. My mother’s side, my grandmother had something… I think it was colon cancer, but it was a long time ago and we didn’t talk about it much. My father’s side, I don’t really know. He wasn’t very forthcoming about family health issues. So, I’m not sure, honestly. It's possible, but I don't have a lot of details.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible family history of colon cancer on your mother's side. That’s helpful to know. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, I’ve never smoked. Never been interested in it, thankfully. And I don’t drink alcohol very often – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s about it. I try to eat pretty healthily, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, no tobacco or heavy alcohol use, healthy diet. And lastly, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can take most medications without issue. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, thankfully. So, no, nothing I need to worry about there, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. That gives me a pretty good picture. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll listen to your abdomen and gently feel around to check for the lump and assess its size and tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I understand. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I'm a little nervous, but I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing, deep breaths for me. I'm listening now… sounds normal so far. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything is tender or uncomfortable. Okay… I do feel a slightly firm mass on your right lower quadrant. It’s not particularly large, maybe about the size of a walnut. It does seem a little tender when I press on it, but you haven’t grimaced, so it’s not intensely painful. I'm also checking for any rebound tenderness - No rebound tenderness. I'm assessing for guarding as well - no guarding. No noticeable swelling or fluid sounds. It's difficult to assess size definitively without imaging, but it’s roughly 2-3 centimeters.
PATIENT: Okay… yes, that feels a little bit like what I’ve been noticing. It’s not terribly painful, just… noticeable. The tenderness you’re feeling is probably what I’ve been experiencing, that little bit of discomfort. 2-3 centimeters… that doesn’t sound huge, thankfully. What does this mean, Doctor? Should I be worried? I apologize for being anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be anxious, Amy. I wouldn't want you to worry unnecessarily, but it’s good we’re getting it checked out. A mass like this could be a number of things, and it's too early to say definitively what it is. It could be a muscle issue, a swollen lymph node, or something else entirely. However, given the location and the tenderness, we need to rule out more serious possibilities, like appendicitis, a hernia, or even a growth that needs further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count to check for signs of infection, and a metabolic panel to assess your overall organ function. I also recommend an abdominal CT scan with contrast to visualize the mass and surrounding tissues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… thorough. Blood work and a CT scan. Yes, I’m comfortable with that, Doctor. I want to know what’s going on, so whatever you think is best. A CT scan with contrast… will that involve any radiation? I’ve heard things about that. And how long will it take to get the results? I apologize for all the questions. I’m just… trying to understand everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Amy. Asking questions is a very good thing. You’re absolutely right to be concerned about radiation, and you’re correct to ask. A CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but it’s within acceptable limits, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks in this situation. We use the lowest dose possible to get a clear image. As for timing, the blood work should be back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan results usually take a little longer – typically 1-2 business days for the radiologist to review and send a report. Once I have both sets of results, I’ll contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and come up with a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, please go to the nearest emergency room right away. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Blood work within 24-48 hours, CT scan 1-2 business days… and to come back if I experience any severe pain or other symptoms. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It does feel a little overwhelming, but I feel better knowing we’re taking steps to figure it out. What about the cost? Will Medicare cover these tests? I don’t want to be surprised with a huge bill. I apologize again for asking so many questions, but it's on my mind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. And please, don’t apologize for asking questions at all. It’s my job to make sure you understand everything, and to address your concerns. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover both the blood work and the CT scan, but it’s always best to confirm with your insurance provider directly. They can give you a more precise estimate of your out-of-pocket costs, based on your specific plan. I’ll have the receptionist provide you with the necessary codes for both tests, so you can easily contact Medicare. We can also discuss financial assistance options if needed. Our office has resources available to help patients navigate insurance and potential costs. For now, let’s get the lab orders and CT scan request scheduled. Then you can focus on contacting Medicare and taking things one step at a time. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Lab orders and the CT scan request… and the codes for Medicare. I appreciate all your help, you’ve been very kind and patient with me. I feel much calmer knowing we have a plan. Thank you. I think that’s all I need for now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. I’ll have the receptionist get those orders ready for you right away, and she’ll give you the necessary codes for Medicare. Don’t hesitate to call our office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. .
