DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… honestly, I don’t have all day. It’s my vision and… and my ears. They’ve just… stopped working properly. Suddenly, you understand. It’s quite inconvenient. I’m a surgeon, you know. I need to see and hear.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. I understand your time is valuable, and we'll do our best to be efficient. It sounds like you’re experiencing some changes in both your vision and hearing. Let’s start with the vision. When did you first notice these changes?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven't the slightest idea. A few days ago, perhaps? It all feels rather… blurry. And dark. It’s not like a gradual fading, it was just… poof. Gone. Though, I do believe I was rather busy with a particularly difficult case at the hospital. Perhaps I simply didn’t notice it sooner. Really, I haven’t got time for this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I see. So it came on rather suddenly, a few days ago, and it's affecting your clarity and brightness. And you were occupied with a demanding case at the hospital. That’s helpful to know. Is it affecting both eyes equally, or is one worse than the other?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor, must you interrogate me like a common criminal? They both seem… equally dreadful. I can barely make out shapes, let alone details. It’s all rather distressing. And, truthfully, I haven’t bothered to examine them closely. I have more important things to attend to, you know. I’m a surgeon, not an optician.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem thorough, Ms. Julie. It's simply important for me to gather as much information as possible to understand what's going on. We want to rule out any serious causes. Let’s move on to your ears. You mentioned they've "stopped working properly." Can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s quite obvious, isn’t it? I can’t hear. Sounds are… muffled. Distant. As if I’m underwater. Though, the hospital is rather noisy. Perhaps I simply wasn’t paying attention. Though, I do recall a rather loud beeping sound recently… But I’m sure it’s nothing. A temporary blockage, perhaps? I really don’t have time for a full audiogram, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie, and I appreciate you clarifying. So, the muffled hearing came on relatively recently, and you suspect it might be related to a loud noise at the hospital. Is there any pain, ringing, or dizziness associated with the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Pain? Good heavens, no. I’m a surgeon, Doctor, I’m accustomed to discomfort. Ringing… perhaps a slight… whooshing sound. Though, I attribute that to the stress of the profession. And dizziness? Well, I was on my feet for twelve hours yesterday, so a slight lightheadedness is to be expected. Honestly, I think I just need a holiday. This is all rather unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay. No pain, slight ringing described as a whooshing, and a bit of dizziness you attribute to being on your feet for a long period. Given the sudden onset of both vision and hearing changes, even with the explanations, I’d like to perform a brief examination to get a better sense of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Brief, you say? Absolutely. But do hurry. I have patients waiting, you understand. And please, try not to poke and prod too much. I’m a delicate woman. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s check your vision. Could you please look straight ahead and tell me if you can see clearly out of both eyes?
PATIENT: Doctor, I told you, I can’t see clearly out of either eye! It’s all blurry and dark! Are you even listening to me? Honestly, this is a waste of my valuable time. Just tell me what’s wrong and let me get back to work. I have a reputation to uphold, you know.
DOCTOR: I apologize for repeating the question, Ms. Julie. I understand your frustration. It's important for me to document the extent of the vision loss. Now, let's move on to your ears. I'm going to use an otoscope to look inside your ears. This won't be painful, but it may be slightly uncomfortable. Hmm. There appears to be some cerumen buildup, but the tympanic membrane appears intact. Now, let’s test your hearing with a simple rub test. I’m going to gently rub my fingers together near your ears. Tell me when you can hear it, and how loud it is. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Cerumen? Honestly, Doctor, are you suggesting I’m unhygienic? I assure you, I maintain a perfectly clean lifestyle. And please, be careful with those… instruments. The rub test… fine. But hurry up. This is rather undignified. And if it's too loud, I’ll tell you. I’m not deaf, you know. Although, you seem determined to make me so.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Patient reports diminished hearing bilaterally to rub test, approximately 2 feet distance. Reduced response compared to expected. No response to whispers.” Ms. Julie, given the sudden onset of both vision and hearing loss, and the reduced response to testing, I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue. It could be something affecting the nerves that control both senses. I recommend an immediate MRI of the brain to rule out any serious causes, such as a tumor or stroke. It’s a precaution, but a very important one. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… tumor? A stroke? Doctor, are you being serious? I’m a surgeon! I don't have tumors! And I’m far too young for a stroke. Honestly, this is preposterous! Are you trying to scare me? I think I need a second opinion. Immediately. And I certainly won’t be subjected to any… MRIs! This is ridiculous. I'm leaving. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, please, sit down. I understand your concern, but I’m only recommending this test to be thorough and rule out any potential serious causes. It doesn’t mean you have a tumor or had a stroke; it simply means we need to investigate. I am obligated to ensure your well-being. However, if you are insistent on seeking a second opinion, I respect your decision. I will provide you with a referral to a neurologist, and I will document your refusal of the MRI. Before you leave, I strongly advise you to refrain from driving or operating heavy machinery until you’ve been evaluated by the neurologist. And if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe headache, weakness, or dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here is the referral information. Thank you for coming in today, Ms. Julie. Please take care of yourself. .
