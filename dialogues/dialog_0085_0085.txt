DOCTOR: Good morning, Gabbrielle. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it's about my skin. It’s just… discolored. Not all over, thankfully, but enough to bother me. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it doesn't seem to be going away on its own. It’s rather unsightly, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, "discolored" – can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, must I? Fine. It’s… patches. Sort of brownish, a little bit greyish. Not a uniform color, definitely not a tan. And it's on my arms, mostly. A little on my chest, but thankfully, not on my face. I keep covering it with sleeves, naturally. It just… doesn’t look right. I haven’t changed anything in my routine – same soaps, same lotions, same everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. Patches on your arms and chest, brownish and greyish, and it’s been happening for a few weeks. You haven’t changed anything in your skincare routine. And you're understandably wanting to find out what's going on. Before we go any further, have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain associated with these patches?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. It doesn’t feel like anything. That’s what’s so frustrating! It's purely cosmetic. No itching, no burning, no pain… just there. Honestly, if it didn’t look so dreadful, I probably wouldn’t even bother coming in. It’s simply… not a pleasing sight. I’ve always taken pride in my appearance, you see.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's good to know there's no discomfort, but I agree, any change in your skin you're unhappy with is worth investigating. Let’s get a little more detail. Has this ever happened before?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never. I’ve always had… good skin. A little pale, perhaps, but always even-toned. My grandmother had lovely skin, and my mother, too. This is… quite alarming, actually. I haven’t been out in the sun any more than usual, I assure you. I'm very careful with sun exposure, you know. It's simply… inexplicable.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous history, and you're diligent about sun protection. That's helpful to know. Now, thinking a bit broader, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside these skin changes?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. What do you mean? Like… what other symptoms could there be? I haven't been ill, if that's what you're getting at. No fever, no fatigue, no weight loss… nothing. I'm perfectly healthy, otherwise. I eat well, I exercise regularly, I sleep enough… I maintain a very good lifestyle. This skin thing is the only… deviation from perfection, really. I suppose.
DOCTOR: No other symptoms, and you maintain a very healthy lifestyle. Good. Just trying to rule things out. I'd like to take a closer look at these patches if you don’t mind. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a luncheon scheduled for two o’clock. And frankly, I'd rather not spend the entire afternoon discussing… this. Just be quick about it, please. And try not to poke too much. It’s rather sensitive, you know, even if it doesn’t feel like it.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could just have a seat here, and I'll examine your arms and chest. We'll start with your arms. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Very well. Do try to be delicate, Doctor. I'm rather particular about my skin.
DOCTOR: Okay… I see the patches you're referring to. They are irregularly shaped, varying in shades of brown and grey, and appear slightly raised. The skin texture feels a little rougher in those areas, but not significantly. They are primarily located on the outer aspects of your forearms. And you mentioned a few on your chest as well?
PATIENT: Yes, on my chest. Though they’re smaller, thankfully. And… less noticeable. I try to keep a cardigan on, naturally. They’re… similar in appearance to those on my arms, just less pronounced. Honestly, I barely even look at them. It’s rather depressing, you know. Are they… serious? Is it something dreadful? You’re making me quite anxious now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see them here as well. You’re right, they are smaller and less prominent. Based on what I’m seeing, it’s unlikely to be anything dreadful. They could be a few different things. One possibility is pityriasis rosea, a common skin condition that often presents with similar patches. Another possibility is tinea versicolor, a fungal infection, though that often comes with some slight itching. A third possibility, though less likely given the lack of itching and your history, is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. To be certain, I’d like to perform a simple skin scraping to rule out a fungal infection. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A skin… scraping? Oh, dear. Must you? Honestly, it sounds rather unpleasant. And you say it's "quick and painless," but you always say that. What exactly does it involve? And what if it is… a fungal infection? Is that contagious? I have a luncheon, you know. I simply cannot have a contagious skin condition. This is dreadful. Absolutely dreadful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It truly is a very simple procedure. I use a small, blunt instrument to gently collect a tiny sample of skin cells from one of the patches. It’s not like a deep scrape, more like a very light brushing. It shouldn't cause any discomfort, and there’s no need for any anesthesia. As for whether it’s contagious, tinea versicolor can be, but it’s easily treated with a topical antifungal cream. It’s not something to be overly worried about, and it's rarely spread to others. We can confirm with a microscopic examination of the sample, and then start treatment immediately if necessary. It’s very straightforward. Would you like me to proceed with the scraping?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. But be quick about it, Doctor. And gentle. I do have a reputation to uphold, you know. And please, tell me exactly what you’re doing as you go. I don’t want any surprises. Honestly, I’m starting to regret even coming in. This is all so… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm going to gently cleanse the area with an alcohol wipe. Then, using the scalpel blade, I’ll very lightly scrape the surface of one of the patches. It shouldn’t cause any pain, just a slight pressure. Then, I’ll place the sample on the slide with a drop of mineral oil. There we go… just a tiny bit of skin cells collected. Now, I’ll examine it under the microscope to see if we can identify any fungal elements. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Well? What do you see? Is it… dreadful? Is it contagious? Don't spare my feelings, Doctor. I need to know the truth. And please, don’t use any medical jargon. I haven’t the faintest idea what “fungal elements” even are. This is quite stressful, you know. My luncheon is rapidly approaching…
DOCTOR: Okay, good news. I don't see any fungal elements under the microscope. That rules out tinea versicolor. Given the appearance of the patches, the lack of itching, and the negative fungal scraping, the most likely diagnosis is pityriasis rosea. It’s a common skin condition, often triggered by a viral infection, and it’s not contagious. It usually resolves on its own within a few weeks to a few months, although it can sometimes be a little itchy. For now, we can simply monitor it. I recommend keeping your skin moisturized, avoiding harsh soaps, and wearing loose-fitting clothing. If it becomes itchy, we can prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Pity… what-now? Is that… serious? And it resolves on its own? You mean I don't need any… injections or pills or anything dreadful? Goodness. That’s… surprisingly good news, actually. Though, it still sounds rather unpleasant. Moisturize, you say? I suppose I can manage that. And loose-fitting clothing… well, that’s always preferable, isn’t it? Still, it's all rather disconcerting. A viral infection? I haven't felt ill. So, I can simply go to my luncheon and pretend nothing’s amiss? That’s all? No special precautions? No need to quarantine myself? This is… acceptable. Just keep the moisturizer handy, I suppose. And avoid harsh soaps. Right. Thank you, Doctor. I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. You can absolutely go to your luncheon and don’t need to take any special precautions. Pityriasis rosea isn’t contagious, so you don't need to worry about spreading it to anyone. And you're right, it often resolves on its own without any treatment. The moisturizer and avoiding harsh soaps are simply to help manage any potential discomfort. I'll document our findings in your chart and schedule a follow-up appointment for a month from today just to ensure it's resolving as expected. If you notice any changes or worsening symptoms before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: A month, you say? Very well. No, I believe that’s all. Honestly, I’m quite relieved. It’s not as dreadful as I feared, thankfully. I suppose I can live with a little moisturizer. And avoid harsh soaps. Thank you, Doctor Lahn. You’ve been… surprisingly helpful. Though, I do wish medical procedures were a little less… undignified. Still, I suppose one can’t have everything. I believe I’ll be going now. My luncheon awaits. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gabbrielle. I'm glad I could help. Enjoy your luncheon, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a lovely day!
