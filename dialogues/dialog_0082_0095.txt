DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day. I woke up yesterday and… well, I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face feels… droopy on that side too. It's quite alarming, really. I expect you to know what that means.
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. That does sound concerning, you’re right to come in. Droopy face and sudden hearing loss… hmm. Just to be clear, which ear is it, and when exactly did you first notice these symptoms?
PATIENT: The left one, obviously. And yesterday morning. I told you. I woke up, went to make tea, and realized I couldn't hear the kettle. Then I looked in the mirror… and well, you see it, don't you? It's not subtle. I don’t understand why you need me to repeat everything. Are you even listening?
DOCTOR: I apologize, Stephane. You’re right, I should be more focused. My memory… isn't what it used to be, and I sometimes need to clarify details. It's important to get everything right. So, yesterday morning – you noticed the hearing loss first, then the facial drooping?
PATIENT: Yes! Then the drooping. Honestly, it's a bit insulting you have to ask. It’s not like I woke up with a paralyzed arm and a sudden urge to sing opera. It was one thing after the other. Is this going to take long? I have… commitments.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I understand your frustration, and I assure you I'm taking this seriously. We need to rule out a few things. Have you had any fever, headache, dizziness, or trouble with your vision?
PATIENT: No. None of those things. Look, I’m a perfectly healthy woman. I eat well, I get my sleep… well, I used to get good sleep before this happened. It came on suddenly, out of nowhere. It’s not like I’ve been ill. This isn’t some complicated case, is it? I haven't got time for a lot of tests.
DOCTOR: Sudden onset is… certainly concerning. No fever, headache, dizziness, or vision changes, good. Let's do a quick examination, just to assess things. Can you close your eyes?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it. I have things to do, you know. And try not to poke me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. Okay, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's not exactly a glamorous affair, is it? You can see it’s lopsided. What does it mean? I really need you to just tell me what’s going on. I haven't got time for guessing games.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that asymmetry. And I also noticed some weakness when I asked you to smile. It appears to be Bell’s palsy. Though we do need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any history of diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Absolutely not! And my blood pressure is always perfectly normal, thank you very much. I’m very careful about my health, as I've already said. This… Bell's palsy… is it serious? Will I be like this forever? I have a… an event next month. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good, no history of either. Bell's palsy is often temporary, Stephane, that’s important to remember. Most people recover fully within a few weeks to months. However, we need to be sure that's what we're dealing with. I'd like to get a blood test just to rule out anything else. And, I’m going to prescribe a course of oral steroids, which can help reduce inflammation and improve your chances of recovery. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Steroids? Are they safe? I don’t like taking a lot of medication. What are the side effects? And how long will this take to work? I don’t have weeks to wait. The event… it’s on September 10th. Can you guarantee I’ll be better by then?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about the steroids. They do have potential side effects – things like temporary increase in blood sugar, some mood changes, and rarely, some digestive upset. But for a short course, these are usually mild. We'll monitor your blood sugar levels to be safe. Now, I wish I could guarantee you'll be fully recovered by September 10th, but unfortunately, I can't. Everyone responds differently to treatment. However, starting the steroids now gives you the best possible chance. It's crucial to start them as soon as possible. We'll also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you're progressing. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. But if they make me feel awful, I’m stopping them. And if I’m not better by the 10th… I’ll be holding you personally responsible. I don't have time for this. Just write the prescription. And make it quick, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your concerns, and we'll certainly monitor you closely for any side effects. Here’s the prescription for Prednisone, 60 milligrams, to be taken once daily for five days, then tapering down as instructed on the label. The label will also have detailed instructions on potential side effects to watch out for. I’ll also give you a handout explaining Bell's palsy and what to expect. We'll schedule that follow-up appointment for August 23rd. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Just get this over with. I need to go. I suppose… thank you. Though I'm not convinced this will do any good.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome. And please, try not to worry too much. We're doing everything we can. If you don’t see any improvement after a few days, or if you experience any concerning side effects, please call immediately. Take care, Stephane.
