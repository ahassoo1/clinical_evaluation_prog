DOCTOR: Alright, Sherrell, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good day to you too, Doctor… Havird, is it? It is… difficult to explain. Words… they do not come as easily now. It is like they are… hiding. I find myself searching for them, even for simple things. It is… frustrating, you understand? It has been happening for… some time now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand it can be frustrating when things don't come easily. “Some time now…” Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. That is difficult. Perhaps… six months? Maybe longer. It is hard to keep track, you see. My wife… she always remembered everything. Now… the days blend together a little. I noticed it first when… when talking to my grandchildren. I would… stumble over what I wanted to say. They were very patient, bless them. But it made me… uneasy.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or longer. And it started with difficulty finding the right words when speaking with your grandchildren. Has this difficulty spread to other areas of your life?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. Now it is… everywhere. Talking to the shopkeeper, reading the newspaper… even thinking to myself! Sometimes I know what I want to say, but the word… it is just gone. A blank space. It is… unsettling. It makes me feel… old, I suppose. Although, I am… well, I am of an age where these things happen, I understand. But it is still… worrying.
DOCTOR: Worrying is understandable. So, it’s impacting your speech generally, not just in specific situations. Are you having any difficulty understanding what people say, or is it purely with finding the words yourself?
PATIENT: No, no, I hear everything perfectly well. It is not my ears, Doctor. It is… in my head, I think. I can understand you perfectly, and I can understand the television, and… people speaking around me. It is just… producing the words. Getting them from my thoughts… to my mouth. That is the difficult part. It is like a… a blockage, perhaps? A very frustrating blockage.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed…? Hmm. Let me think… My wife, she passed away last year. That was… a significant change, of course. A very large change. Everything changed after that, really. But I do not know if this… this trouble with words… is directly related. It began some time after that, I believe. No other… major changes. I retired a few years ago. I try to keep busy, gardening mostly. I do not… travel much anymore. No, nothing specific that I can think of. Just… life, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to clarify, you said this started some time after your wife passed. About how long after?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. “Some time” is not very helpful, is it? Let me see… I would say… perhaps four or five months after? Six, maybe? It is difficult to be precise. Everything was… rather a blur, you understand. The grief… it takes a long time to… settle. I began to notice it around the time of the anniversary, I think. The anniversary of her passing. Yes, that sounds right. Around then. I started to feel… more aware of the difficulty then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me consider. No… I do not think so. No headaches, no dizziness. My vision is… not as good as it used to be, but that is just age, I believe. I do tire easily, but I am… not a young man anymore. No shaking, no numbness, no… strange feelings. Just… this trouble with words. It is… quite isolated, really. A very peculiar problem. It is not… painful, if that is what you mean. Just… frustrating and… unsettling. It makes me feel… less myself, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or memory besides difficulty finding words?
PATIENT: Changes in mood… well, naturally, I still miss my wife very much. There are days when I feel… quite sad, of course. But I have good days too. I try to stay positive. As for memory… I forget things, yes. Small things mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I had for breakfast. Nothing… serious. I do not… wander off, or forget who people are. It is just… normal forgetfulness, I suppose. Old age again. I do not believe it is related to this trouble with words, but… perhaps you should consider it? I am not a doctor, you understand. I am simply… telling you my experiences.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, yes. A small pill, every morning. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, you understand. Nothing… strong. And occasionally, a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it last winter. No… nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if you understand. I prefer… natural remedies, when possible. Gardening is very good for the soul, you know. And… keeps me active.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not that I am aware of. I have never had a… serious reaction to anything. I sometimes get a little itchiness when I am stung by a bee, but that is just… normal, isn’t it? Nothing… life-threatening. I have never been hospitalized for allergies, or anything like that. No, I do not believe I have any allergies to be concerned about. I am… quite a robust fellow, really. At least, I used to be. Now… well, now I just struggle to find the right words. It is a very different kind of problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherrell. I’d like to do a brief physical exam and then we can discuss some possible causes and next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam. Yes. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I am quite happy to… cooperate. I just want to… understand what is happening, you understand? And… hopefully, find a way to… improve things. Yes, a physical exam sounds… perfectly fine. Lead the way, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we'll start with your vital signs. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Very good. A neurological assessment… that sounds… complicated. But I will do my best to… cooperate. Just tell me what you want me to do, Doctor. I am… at your service. I just hope this does not take too long. I have… a rather nice garden that needs tending. But… your health is important, of course. Yes, proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and some basic balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you go. Quite steady, I think. Although, my eyes do get tired easily these days. Is that… alright? Am I doing it correctly? I just want to… cooperate and… provide you with the information you need. I am… a willing participant.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're doing very well. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up slowly, if you’re able. Good. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can walk. One… two… three… Is that… alright? I am trying to be… careful. I do not want to… fall. It is a little wobbly, perhaps, but I am… still upright.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Just a little unsteadiness, which is not uncommon at your age. Now, can you try to touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try that. There. Was that… alright? It is a little difficult, perhaps. My coordination is not what it used to be. Is something… wrong? Am I doing something incorrectly? I am… trying my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay. No, you're doing fine. Just a little bit of tremor, which isn't necessarily cause for alarm. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: The year…? Hmm. Let me see… Is it… 2024? No… That cannot be right. Is it… 2025? Yes, I believe it is 2025. August, is it not? Yes. 2025. Is that… correct? I am… not always very good with dates. My wife always remembered everything. It is… difficult without her.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. It is 2025. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words…? Yes, of course. What are the words, Doctor? Tell me the words and I will… repeat them. I am… ready when you are. It is just… a little difficult to… focus sometimes. My mind wanders, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please try to remember them. I will ask you to repeat them in a few minutes. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you had any previous strokes or head injuries?
PATIENT: Stroke… or head injury…? No, I do not believe so. I have never been… hospitalized for a stroke. And I have never… hit my head particularly hard. A few minor bumps and bruises, perhaps, when I was a boy. But nothing… serious. I have always been… quite careful. I do not engage in… risky activities. No, no stroke or head injury. At least, not that I am aware of. I have always… been fortunate, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision…? Well… it is not as sharp as it used to be, naturally. Things are a little blurry sometimes. I need… stronger glasses, I think. I have an appointment with the optician next month. But no… sudden changes, or… double vision, or anything like that. Just… the normal deterioration that comes with age, I suppose. I do not… struggle to see things in the distance, or… read the newspaper. It is just… a little more effort required. Yes, a little more effort.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any difficulty with sleep?
PATIENT: Difficulty with sleep…? Well… I do not sleep as soundly as I used to. I wake up a few times during the night. Sometimes I need to get up to… use the restroom. And sometimes I just… lie awake, thinking. It is not… a major problem, but it is… disruptive. I do not… feel particularly tired during the day, but I do not… feel as rested as I used to. It is just… part of getting older, I suppose. Yes, a little less sleep than I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's go back to those three words. Can you repeat them for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… … chair… book… and… uh… I am… terribly sorry. I seem to have… forgotten them. They were on the tip of my tongue just a moment ago… It is… frustrating. I do not usually forget things so easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. That’s alright. It happens. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your daily life. Do you have any difficulty with tasks like managing your finances, preparing meals, or remembering appointments?
PATIENT: Well… managing my finances is… alright. I have a friend who helps me with some of the more complicated things, you understand. I used to do everything myself, but… it is easier to have a little assistance these days. Preparing meals… I manage that fine. Simple things, you understand. Soup, sandwiches. Nothing fancy. Remembering appointments… that is… a little more difficult. I rely on my grandchildren to remind me, mostly. I do… sometimes forget things, but nothing… major. I am still… relatively independent, you understand. I do not… need constant care, or anything like that. I just… need a little assistance with some things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how would you describe your mood lately?
PATIENT: My mood…? It is… alright. I have my good days and my bad days, you understand. I miss my wife very much, of course. That sadness… it comes and goes. But I try to stay positive. I have my grandchildren, and I enjoy gardening. I do… feel a little lonely sometimes, but that is… natural, I suppose. Overall… I would say I am… relatively content. Not as happy as I used to be, but… alright. I do not… feel depressed, or anything like that. Just… a little sad sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell. I’ve asked you a lot of questions, and thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, I suspect you may be experiencing some early signs of cognitive impairment. It could be a number of things, including normal age-related changes, mild cognitive impairment, or early dementia. It’s too early to say definitively. However, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I would also like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a neurologist…? Yes… alright. If that is what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I… just want to understand what is happening, you understand. I do not… want to worry my grandchildren unnecessarily. Will these tests… be painful? And… will they take a long time? I have… a rather nice garden that needs tending. But… my health is important, of course. Yes, blood tests and a neurologist… alright. Do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: The blood tests are very straightforward, just a small sample taken from your arm. It will only take a few minutes, and there’s minimal discomfort. The neurologist appointment will take longer, of course, but it’s important to get a thorough evaluation. They may do some cognitive tests and possibly some brain imaging, like an MRI, to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I'll give you a referral to a good neurologist in the area, and I’ll also order the blood tests for you today. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results to discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active and engaged, both physically and mentally. Gardening is excellent! And it's important to have a strong support system, so please lean on your grandchildren if you need to. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions…? Will these tests… tell me if I am… losing my mind? I do not mean to be… rude, Doctor. It is just… a worrying thought. And… what if they find something… serious? Will there be… treatment? Or… is it too late? And… will I still be able to… garden? That is… very important to me.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid questions, Sherrell. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about these things. The tests are not about determining if you are "losing your mind," but about understanding what’s going on in your brain and identifying any potential causes for your symptoms. There are many possible causes for cognitive changes, and not all of them are serious. Even if we do find something, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the end. There are treatments available that can help manage symptoms and slow the progression of some conditions. And yes, you asked a very important question. Most people with early cognitive impairment are still able to continue doing the things they enjoy, like gardening. We'll work with you to develop a plan that allows you to maintain your quality of life and independence for as long as possible. I know this is a lot to take in. I want you to know that I’m here to support you every step of the way. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll work together to find the best course of action for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: One step at a time… No… I do not think so. Not at the moment. You have… answered my questions, Doctor. And… you have been very… kind. I suppose… I will just wait for the tests, then. And… hope for the best. Thank you, Doctor. I believe… that is all for today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. Remember, I'm here if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. My staff will contact you to schedule the blood work and the neurology appointment. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out.
