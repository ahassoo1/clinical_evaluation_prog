DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Yes, well... it's my ear. Feels blocked, you see? Like something's… stuffed in there. Not painful, exactly, just… full. I suppose. It's been… a while now. Honestly, I can't say how long. Time… slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, time often does. "Blocked," you say. And you've noticed this for… some time. Could you be more specific about how long, even a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe… a few months? Perhaps longer? It started gradually, I think. I spend a lot of time outside, with my work… agricultural inspections, you see? Lots of wind. Could be that. Or… something else. I really don't know. It's not urgent, if that makes sense. Just… annoying.
DOCTOR: "Annoying," yes. While it may not feel urgent to you, any change in hearing should be investigated. Agricultural work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Inspections. Mostly fields, orchards… things like that. A lot of walking. And, like I said, the wind. It's… a bit of a lonely job, if I'm honest. Not much talking, mostly just… looking. And writing things down. Does that… matter? I'm not sure why you're asking about my work.
DOCTOR: It matters because your occupation can give us clues about potential causes. Exposure to wind, dust, and perhaps even loud machinery could contribute to your symptoms. Now, besides the feeling of fullness, have you experienced any other changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Loud machinery… not really. Maybe tractors, occasionally. But not… consistently loud. Hmm… other changes? Let me see… I suppose things sound… muffled sometimes? Like someone's talking through a pillow. It's not constant, though. Comes and goes. And… I think I've been turning the television up a bit louder lately. My wife… well, she used to notice. But… that was a while ago now.
DOCTOR: "Muffled" sounds, and increased television volume. We're gathering information. Now, have you noticed any ringing in your ears – a buzzing, hissing, or clicking sound?
PATIENT: Ringing… Now that you mention it… yes, perhaps. A very faint ringing. I mostly notice it when it’s… quiet. Like at night, before I go to sleep. It’s not… bothersome, not usually. Just… there. I hadn’t really paid it much attention, to be honest. It comes and goes, like everything else. I'm not very good at remembering things, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll do our best to piece everything together. Now, have you experienced any dizziness, balance problems, or any pain in or around your ear?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. Maybe a little unsteady sometimes, but I put that down to… getting older, you know? Balance… no, I don’t think so. Pain… definitely no pain. Just… the fullness. And the muffled hearing. And the faint ringing. It’s all… quite mild, really. I don’t want to make a fuss. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: "Not making a fuss" is admirable, Mr. GuerreroloLopez, but it's my job to investigate changes in your health, however mild they seem to you. Now, let's proceed with a quick examination of your ears. It won’t take long. I'm going to use an otoscope to look inside your ear canals and assess your eardrums. Please remain still.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. An examination. Yes, alright. As long as it’s… quick. I have appointments later, you see. Agricultural inspections don't schedule themselves. Go ahead, then. But please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm looking in your right ear now. I note some cerumen – that’s earwax – present, but nothing obstructing the canal. The eardrum appears intact, though slightly dull. Now, let's examine the left ear. And the left ear… similar findings. Some cerumen, intact eardrum, also appearing slightly dull. Both eardrums appear normal, but the dull appearance could indicate fluid build-up behind the eardrum.
PATIENT: Fluid build-up? Is that… bad? I told you, I don’t really pay attention to these things. My wife… she used to handle all the doctor appointments. She knew what all the terms meant. Dull appearance… is that why the hearing is muffled? What does this mean? Will I need… medicine? Or something worse? I really don't have time for anything complicated.
DOCTOR: “Complicated” is premature at this point. Fluid build-up behind the eardrum can be caused by several things, including a simple ear infection, allergies, or even Eustachian tube dysfunction – that’s when the tube that connects your middle ear to the back of your throat doesn’t open properly. The muffled hearing is certainly consistent with that. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a tympanometry test. It’s a quick, painless test that measures how well your eardrum moves. It will help us determine if there is fluid present and whether the Eustachian tube is functioning correctly. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A tympanometry test… More tests? Honestly… Look, I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor, but I really must get back to work. Agricultural inspections… they’re time-sensitive. Can’t we just… give me something for it? Ear drops, maybe? Something simple? I don’t have time for all these… measurements. Is a tympanometry test absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: Mr. GuerreroloLopez, while I understand your time constraints, a proper diagnosis is crucial before prescribing any treatment. Giving you "something for it" without knowing the underlying cause could mask a more serious problem and potentially delay appropriate care. The tympanometry test takes less than five minutes. It's a simple procedure that will provide valuable information. If you refuse the test, I can only offer symptomatic relief – perhaps a decongestant if allergies are suspected – but I strongly advise against it without a definitive diagnosis. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but I'm recommending the test to ensure we address the root cause of your hearing issue. Are you willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Five minutes, you say? Just… get it over with, then. But if it takes any longer than five minutes, I’m leaving. Agricultural inspections, you understand. Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s complete. The results indicate some reduced mobility in your middle ear, consistent with fluid build-up. It doesn’t appear to be a severe infection, but there’s definite evidence of Eustachian tube dysfunction. Based on this, I recommend a course of a nasal decongestant and a short course of a mild steroid nasal spray to help reduce inflammation and open up the Eustachian tube. I’ll also advise you to try chewing gum or yawning frequently to encourage the tube to open naturally. I’m prescribing a ten-day course of both.
PATIENT: Chewing gum? That’s… all? Chewing gum and nasal spray? My wife used to get stronger medicine for a common cold. But… alright. If you think that will help. Ten days, you say? Very well. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my inspections. And… is there anything else I need to know? Any side effects? Anything I should avoid? I really don’t want to have to come back here again anytime soon. Agricultural inspections, you understand.
DOCTOR: The nasal spray may cause some mild nasal irritation or dryness. If it becomes bothersome, you can use a saline nasal rinse to help alleviate it. As for the chewing gum… it’s a simple measure to encourage the Eustachian tube to open. It’s not a cure, but it can help. I’ll also advise you to avoid forceful nose blowing, as it can exacerbate the problem. If your symptoms don’t improve after ten days, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. In that case, we may need to consider further testing or a referral to an ENT specialist. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. No forceful nose blowing… got it. Chewing gum, nasal spray, no blowing. Alright then. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll be on my way. Agricultural inspections, you understand. Goodbye.
