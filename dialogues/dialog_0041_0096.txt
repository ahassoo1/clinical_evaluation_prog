DOCTOR: Hi Arbin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it's a bit strange, to be honest. I’ve been getting really bothered by the sun lately. Like, way more than usual. It feels like my skin is super sensitive, and even just being outside for a short time leaves me feeling really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is good to know. Sensitive to the sun… hmm. And when did you first start noticing this discomfort, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started maybe… three months ago? Around the end of April, beginning of May. It was gradual at first, just feeling a little more glare than normal. But it’s definitely gotten worse since then, especially this past month with the hotter weather. I remember distinctly it being right after a particularly bright sunny day when I was gardening.
DOCTOR: Gardening, alright. And can you describe what "uncomfortable" feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not exactly pain, but it’s not just a sunburn feeling either. It's more like… a burning itch all over my skin where the sun hits it. And my eyes feel really gritty and hurt, even with sunglasses on. It makes them water a lot, and everything just seems too bright. It's just… really annoying, and makes me want to stay indoors all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning itch, gritty eyes… that sounds pretty unpleasant. Do you notice any rash, blisters, or changes in the skin’s texture where you’re getting this discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no rash or blisters, thankfully. The skin just looks… a little red, maybe, but nothing major. It doesn't feel bumpy or anything. It's more like a really bad, persistent sunburn feeling, even if I haven’t been in the sun that long. Like, you can barely see it, but it’s definitely there.
DOCTOR: Alright, no rash, just redness. And is this happening all over, or are certain areas more affected than others?
PATIENT: It’s mostly on my face, neck, and arms. Those are the parts that are usually exposed, I guess. My chest gets a little bothered if I’m wearing something low-cut, but not as bad. My legs seem okay if I’m wearing pants, thankfully. I’ve been trying to cover up as much as possible, to be honest. It's a bit warm for long sleeves, though!
DOCTOR: Okay, face, neck, and arms… that makes sense. Have you tried anything to soothe it so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’ve tried a few things. I’ve been using a really good sunscreen, factor 50, every time I go outside, even on cloudy days. I’ve also been using some aloe vera gel, and a moisturizer. They help a little bit, but it doesn’t really last long. It usually comes back within an hour or so. Honestly, nothing seems to fully take it away.
DOCTOR: Alright, sunscreen, aloe vera, moisturizer… good steps. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this sensitivity?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever or anything like that. I haven’t felt tired or sick. I guess… maybe my eyes have been a little more sensitive to light in general, even indoors? Not just when I’ve been in the sun. It’s hard to explain. Like, things seem a bit too bright sometimes, even with my normal glasses.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased light sensitivity in general… that’s good to know. Now, let's go over some other things. Any family history of skin conditions, like eczema, psoriasis, or skin cancer?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had… she had some skin issues when she was younger, but I’m not exactly sure what. She passed away a long time ago, and my father… well, he didn't talk much about it. I think it was some sort of rash that she used to get, but it wasn't anything serious, as far as I know. No one in the family that I’m aware of ever had skin cancer. We didn't really talk about health much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, vague history of a rash in your mother, no known skin cancer. And how about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, right! I'm sorry, I should have thought of that earlier. I’m not on any regular medications at the moment. Just… over-the-counter stuff, like pain relievers if I get a headache. Nothing long-term. And I’m allergic to penicillin, if that’s important. That's about it, really. I try to stay as healthy as possible, so I don't need much!
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, penicillin allergy. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to take a look at your skin, and check your eyes as well. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I’m just hoping you can figure out what’s going on! It’s really starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your skin does appear mildly erythematous, meaning a bit red. No obvious rash or blistering, as you said. Your pupils are reactive to light, but I do notice some mild conjunctival injection – slight redness of the whites of your eyes. It's subtle, but present. It doesn’t seem to be anything overly alarming at this stage. I'm going to document these findings.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. “Erythe-what-ous”? I’m terrible with medical terms! But if you say it’s not alarming, that’s a relief. What do you think it could be? Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: "Erythematous" just means red, don't worry about it! It's a doctor thing. It could be a number of things, to be honest. Given the timing and your symptoms, it could be photosensitivity – increased sensitivity to sunlight. That can sometimes be caused by certain medications, although you aren’t taking any right now. It can also be related to underlying medical conditions, although we haven’t found anything suggesting that at this point. Or, it could just be a particularly bad case of sunburn reaction, even with sunscreen use. To be cautious, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, and a metabolic panel to rule out anything systemic. We'll also do a test for antinuclear antibodies - that can sometimes indicate autoimmune conditions, although it’s unlikely given your other symptoms. Do you have any objections to blood work?
PATIENT: No, no objections at all. If it helps figure out what’s going on, please go ahead. Blood work is fine. I just want to get this sorted out. I hate feeling like I have to hide inside all the time. When will I know the results? And… is there anything I can do in the meantime, besides covering up and using sunscreen? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab right away. It usually takes a few days – let’s say 3-5 business days to get the results back. The lab will contact you when they're ready. In the meantime, definitely continue to be diligent about sun protection – sunscreen, hats, sunglasses, and avoiding peak sun hours. I also recommend a cool compress on your face and neck if it feels particularly uncomfortable. A bland, fragrance-free moisturizer can help soothe the skin. And, just to be on the safe side, I'm going to recommend a topical corticosteroid cream, a mild one, to help reduce the inflammation. It’s available over-the-counter, a 1% hydrocortisone cream, apply a thin layer twice a day to the affected areas. If that doesn't provide relief, or if your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Sunscreen, cool compress, moisturizer, and the cream. I can definitely do all of that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind a little at ease, knowing we're taking steps to figure it out. I'll keep an eye on it and contact the clinic if anything changes. 3-5 business days, okay. I'll make a note of that. Is there anything else I need to do, or pay for today?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help. The blood work will be billed to your Medicare, so there shouldn't be any out-of-pocket expenses for you today. The hydrocortisone cream is over-the-counter, so you’ll need to purchase that separately. Just continue with the sun protection and monitor your symptoms. We’ll discuss the results when they come back, and go from there. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. I'll see you in a few days. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. It was a pleasure meeting you. You have a good day as well, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
