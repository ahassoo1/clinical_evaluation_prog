DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… off. Really off. Like, a lot of diarrhea. It’s been going on for a while now, and it's just... persistent. I don't really remember exactly when it started, to be honest. Maybe a few weeks? It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, “off” and persistent diarrhea for a few weeks. That does sound frustrating. Let's try to pinpoint things a little more specifically, if we can. When you say “a lot”, can you give me an estimate of how many times a day you’re experiencing diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh, um... let me think. It's… most of the day, actually. Like, at least five or six times. Sometimes more, if I eat something. It’s just... really disruptive. I don’t really go anywhere without worrying about it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jase. That is disruptive, and five to six times a day is significant. And it sounds like diet might be playing a role. Can you describe what a typical day of eating looks like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, that’s… a hard question. My husband does most of the cooking, so I don’t always know exactly what’s in things. We eat a lot of… Pakistani food, obviously. Rice is a big thing, usually with some kind of curry. Sometimes chicken, sometimes lamb. And bread, lots of naan. I think we had… biryani yesterday? And I had some yogurt with fruit for breakfast. But honestly, I don’t pay super close attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, Pakistani cuisine with rice and curries frequently. And you had biryani yesterday, yogurt with fruit for breakfast. That's helpful. Have you noticed any particular foods that seem to worsen the diarrhea, or conversely, any that seem to make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think… dairy sometimes makes it worse? Maybe the yogurt? But I also just feel bad a lot, so it’s hard to tell if it’s the food or just… me feeling generally unwell. And honestly, when I’m feeling really bad, I don't really try new things, so I don’t know if anything helps. I just try to eat bland things if I can. Rice, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dairy possibly exacerbates things, and you gravitate towards bland foods like rice when you're feeling unwell. You mentioned feeling generally unwell – can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s hard to explain. Just… tired. Really tired. And kind of achy, like a low-grade fever, but I don't actually have a fever. Sometimes my stomach hurts, not just from… everything going through it, but just a dull ache. And… I’ve lost some weight, I think. My clothes feel looser. But that could be the stress, honestly. It's just a general feeling of… not being right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, achiness, a dull stomach ache in addition to the diarrhea, and unintentional weight loss. And you're experiencing stress as well. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I… think so? Sometimes. It’s not… a lot, but I’ve noticed it a few times. It’s… red. And sometimes there's… stuff mixed in, like… slime? I didn't really want to mention it, to be honest. It feels kind of embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s embarrassing to talk about, Jase, and I appreciate you being open with me. Seeing blood or mucus in the stool is something we definitely need to investigate further. Now, thinking back a little further, have you had any recent travel, or been exposed to anyone who has been sick recently?
PATIENT: No, no travel. And I don’t think so… but my husband’s sister and her kids were visiting last month, and one of the kids had a stomach bug. But that was a few weeks ago, and I didn’t get sick then. It's just… things have been gradually getting worse. It feels like it’s been building up for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent travel, potential exposure to a stomach bug a few weeks ago. Given the persistence of the diarrhea, the presence of blood and mucus, the unintentional weight loss, and your overall feeling of being unwell, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and order some lab tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good, actually. I just want to know what’s happening. I'm tired of feeling like this. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then I'll palpate it – gently press on it – to check for any tenderness. Then, I'll check your vital signs: your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiration rate. After that, we'll get some blood and stool samples collected. I'm listening now… sounds are… normal. No unusual gurgling or anything concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort anywhere.
PATIENT: Okay. Ow… that’s a little sore. Right… there. It’s not terrible pain, just… tender. Like a dull ache. The rest feels okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower left quadrant. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's check your vital signs. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Your blood pressure is 118 over 72, also normal. Pulse is 78 and regular, and your respiration rate is 16. Everything is within normal limits so far. Now, I need to collect a stool sample and some blood for testing. The stool sample will help us look for any infections or parasites, and the blood tests will check for inflammation, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The nurse will give you the necessary containers and instructions. Do you have any questions about that process?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. The nurse will bring me containers? And I just… put some in there? It’s not very glamorous, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to figure this out. So, the blood tests and the… sample, and then we wait for the results? How long does that usually take?
DOCTOR: That’s right, the nurse will bring you the containers with clear instructions. And you’re absolutely right, it’s not glamorous, but very helpful! As for the results, the blood tests typically take 24-48 hours to come back, and the stool tests can take a bit longer, usually 3-5 business days, depending on what they’re testing for. While we're waiting, I'm going to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , an inflammatory marker test called C-reactive protein , and a stool culture and ova and parasite exam. Given your symptoms and the tenderness in your lower left quadrant, I also want to rule out some other possibilities. I'm going to order a fecal calprotectin test as well, which can help us determine if there's inflammation in your colon. Do you have any questions about any of those tests?
PATIENT: Wow, that's a lot of tests. CBC, CMP, CRP… fecal calprotectin? I don’t even know what half of those are. Is something seriously wrong? I mean, you’re ordering a lot of tests. And what does calprotectin even… do? I don’t want to freak out, but this is starting to sound scary.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel a little anxious, Jase. It is a lot of tests, and you’re right to ask questions. I order a comprehensive panel initially to gather as much information as possible and rule out a wide range of potential causes. It's much better to be thorough. The CBC checks your red and white blood cell counts, which can indicate infection or anemia. The CMP assesses your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte levels. The CRP measures inflammation in your body. And fecal calprotectin, as you asked, is a protein released when there’s inflammation in your intestines. It helps us differentiate between inflammatory bowel disease, like Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, and other causes of your symptoms. I don’t want to jump to conclusions or scare you. These tests are simply to gather information. The majority of the time, we’re able to identify a manageable cause and treatment plan. We're not necessarily looking for something serious, but we want to be sure to investigate thoroughly given the persistence of your symptoms and the tenderness you’re experiencing. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that makes a little more sense. So you're just… trying to figure out what's going on, and not necessarily thinking it is something awful. Crohn’s… ulcerative colitis… are those… serious? I've heard of those, but I don’t really know anything about them. And if it is one of those… what happens then?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, that's precisely it – we’re trying to figure out what's going on. And yes, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory conditions affecting the digestive tract. They can be serious, but they are also very manageable with proper treatment. Symptoms can vary widely, ranging from mild to severe, and often involve diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss – all of which you’ve been experiencing. If it turns out you have one of those conditions, the treatment typically involves medications to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, and prevent complications. This could include anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, or even biologics. Lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and stress management, can also play a significant role. We would discuss all the options with you in detail and create a personalized treatment plan that's right for your needs. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We need to wait for the test results before we can say anything definitively. The nurse should be in shortly with the containers for the samples. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m okay for now. You’ve explained everything really well, actually. I’m still a little nervous, but less panicked than I was. Thank you, Dr. Petrimoulx. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so thoroughly. I’ll go find the nurse and get the samples done.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could ease your worries a little. Please don't hesitate to reach out if any questions come to mind while you're waiting for the results. The nurse will be right with you. I’ll review the results as soon as they become available and we can discuss them in detail. Take care.
