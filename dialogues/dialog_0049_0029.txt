DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's... it's kinda hard to explain. I just don't seem to get hungry much anymore, and when I do eat, I get full awful quick. Like, really quick. It's been going on for a few weeks now, I'd say. Not sure exactly when it started, just kinda noticed it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A few weeks, you say. And it’s not a matter of not wanting to eat, just a lack of appetite, and feeling full very quickly… Okay. And has your weight changed at all during these few weeks?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I think I have lost a bit. Not a lot, mind you. My wife keeps saying I'm looking thinner, but I didn't pay much attention. I haven't been weighing myself regularly. I'm usually around… well, I'm a small fella, always have been. But yeah, probably a few pounds, maybe? It's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: A few pounds… alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this – any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, not really. No sickness, no stomach pain... everything's working down there like normal, if you know what I mean. Bowels are regular, yeah. It's just the eating thing. That’s the only thing bothering me. It's just... frustrating, you know? I like my food. Always have.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you taking any medications currently, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Nope, not a one. Never been much of a pill-taker, if I can help it. Just the usual aches and pains that come with being an old fella, and I just deal with those. I try to stay active, you know? Walk around, do a bit of gardening… nothing strenuous.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to anything – foods, medications, environmental things like pollen?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. My wife tries to give me all sorts of healthy things, fruits and berries mostly, and I eat 'em all. Never had a reaction, thankfully. She's a good cook, but it's hard to get a good meal down when you fill up after just a few bites, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family history, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Family history... hmm. That's a good question. My mother lived to be 92, healthy as a horse until the very end. My father... he had a bit of trouble with his heart, I think. But other than that, not much. No one really talked about illnesses much when I was growing up. We just... dealt with things as they came. Did that make sense? I'm not very good at remembering those sorts of things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Obarr. That gives me something to work with. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go right ahead, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… regular, but a bit faint. Not necessarily cause for concern at your age, but we’ll keep it in mind. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please tell me if anything feels tender or painful. No obvious tenderness… Your abdomen is soft, but… I notice it's not distended. No masses palpable. Alright, Mr. Obarr. Everything feels relatively normal on initial exam, but given your weight loss and decreased appetite, I'd like to order some blood work. Just a routine CBC and a metabolic panel. We can also check a thyroid panel, just to rule out any thyroid issues. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work is fine. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I appreciate you taking the time to look into it. I just want to be able to enjoy my meals again, you know? I like a good plate of salmon and rice.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. I’ve ordered the blood work. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of you. You don't need to fast beforehand. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It usually takes a few days. In the meantime, try to eat smaller, more frequent meals, even if you don’t feel very hungry. And stay hydrated. Do you have any questions for me before you head down to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything pretty well, Doctor. Smaller meals… I can try that. It’s just…hard when you’re not feeling it. But I will. Thank you again for your help. I feel a bit better just knowing we're looking into it. Where exactly is the lab, do you mind telling me?
DOCTOR: It's just down the hall to your left. You'll see a sign for the lab. The receptionist there will take care of you. If you have any trouble finding it, just ask one of the nurses. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I'll see you when the results are back.
PATIENT: Right, of course. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll find my way. .
