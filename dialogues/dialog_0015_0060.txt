DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, my mother… she had a lot of health problems. A lot. And her sister, my aunt, same thing. It just feels like… inevitable, you know? I want to make sure I don’t end up like them. I’m trying to be proactive, I guess. I just… want to know everything’s alright.
DOCTOR: “Proactive” is… admirable, I suppose. Though frankly, worrying about inherited conditions before anything is actually wrong is often unnecessary stress. Still, we can indulge you. Let’s start with some basics. You mentioned your mother and aunt had “a lot of health problems.” Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Okay, well, my mother… heart issues, mostly. Lots of doctor appointments, medication, the whole thing. And then she got… something with her lungs. Couldn’t breathe. It was awful. My aunt… similar. Plus diabetes. Both of them got diabetes. I try to eat well, I really do. I’m not overweight. Do you need a list? I could probably get one from my dad, he kept all the records. He’s… organized, to a fault.
DOCTOR: A list would be… helpful. Though “heart issues” and “something with her lungs” aren’t particularly informative. Dates of diagnosis, specific conditions if you have them… those are useful. But yes, please ask your father. We’ll need that family history. Now, let’s focus on you. You say you're eating well and not overweight. That's good. What does “eating well” mean to you, specifically?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t eat a lot of junk food. No fried stuff, not much sugar. I try to have a protein with every meal. Chicken, fish, sometimes beef. Lots of vegetables. Salads, steamed broccoli, that kind of thing. I drink water, mostly. No soda. And I exercise a couple of times a week, go to the gym, do some weights, treadmill. It’s not like I’m a bodybuilder, but I keep active. Look, I take care of myself. That's why I'm here - preventative care, remember? I don't want to end up needing all those medications like they did.
DOCTOR: “Preventative care” is best utilized when guided by actual risk assessment, not generalized anxiety. Very well. You’re 24, you say. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, that's about it. Broke my arm once, playing basketball, but it healed fine. No surgeries, no chronic conditions, nothing. I'm generally healthy. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like you're treating me like I’m already sick. I just want some reassurance, maybe a few tests, to make sure I’m not headed down the same path as them. Is that so much to ask? I mean, it runs in the family. You'd think that would be enough for something to be done.
DOCTOR: “Runs in the family” is not a diagnosis, Mr. Theriot. It’s a vague statement. We need specifics. However, since you’re insistent, we can proceed with a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel. It will give us a baseline. And we will do a physical exam. It’s standard procedure. Please sit up, and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Then we’ll check your blood pressure and weight again—you seem… quite thin. It's important to rule out any underlying issues before we dismiss your concerns.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. A physical exam is… fine. I just… don’t see why it needs to be so complicated. I eat healthy, I exercise… what’s there to find? But, okay, go ahead. Just… be gentle. I hate needles. And honestly, the whole "thin" comment? A little unnecessary, don’t you think? I'm naturally slim. It's genetics. Again.
DOCTOR: It is a routine observation, Mr. Theriot. A healthy weight is within a range, and it is my responsibility to assess whether you fall within it. Now, please take a deep breath... and hold it. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Heart rate is… slightly elevated, but not alarming given your anxiety. Blood pressure is 110/70. Weight is 60 kilograms, height is 181 centimeters. BMI is 19.6. That is… on the lower end of normal. Do you experience any shortness of breath, even with mild exertion?
PATIENT: No. Never. I told you, I exercise. I go to the gym, I run. I feel fine. Maybe… a little tired sometimes, but that's just from work. I'm a teacher, I'm on my feet all day. It’s not… anything. But still, you’re making me feel like there’s something wrong. Are you going to order the tests or not? I have things to do. I took time off work for this.
DOCTOR: I have ordered the basic metabolic panel and lipid panel, as you requested. The lab results will be available in approximately three to five business days. While we wait for the results, let’s review your family history again. Specifically, can you recall what your mother and aunt were officially diagnosed with, and at what age?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. My mom… she had congestive heart failure. I think it was around 55, maybe 56. And… she developed type 2 diabetes a few years before that. My aunt… I think she was diagnosed with diabetes a little earlier, maybe in her early 40s. And she had… I think it was coronary artery disease, something with her arteries being blocked. She had a stent put in, eventually. That's what I remember. My dad kept all the paperwork, like I said. It’s all in a file at home. I can bring it next time. Is that good enough? Or do you need a notarized copy?
DOCTOR: That is… marginally more helpful. However, knowing the specific types of heart failure and diabetes is important. Was your mother’s heart failure ischemic, valvular, or something else?
PATIENT: Look, I'm an engineering teacher, not a doctor. I don't know about "ischemic" or "valvular"! My mom had a weak heart, okay? She couldn't breathe, she had fluid buildup in her legs, she was constantly tired. That’s what I remember! My aunt was just… always tired, always thirsty, always going to the bathroom. And then she had chest pain and they put a thing in her artery. That's all I know. Are you trying to trick me or something? I feel like you're deliberately trying to make me look stupid. I’m just trying to get some peace of mind here. It's not that complicated.
DOCTOR: It is my job to gather precise information, Mr. Theriot, not to provide reassurance based on vague recollections. Given your family history of both cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and your… limited medical knowledge, I recommend a referral to a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation. I will also write a prescription for a fasting glucose test to be performed at home. We can discuss the results, and adjust the course of treatment at that time. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Seriously? That seems… excessive. I just wanted some blood work. Look, I appreciate you taking the time, but this is getting ridiculous. And a glucose test at home? I'm perfectly capable of monitoring my own health. I eat healthy, I exercise… I'm not the one who needs to be "evaluated." Fine, do whatever you want. A cardiologist, a glucose test… whatever. Just… send me the referrals, and let me get out of here. I have a class to prepare for. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I will have my assistant print out the referral forms for a cardiologist and the instructions for the fasting glucose test. She will also schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to review the results. Please keep me informed of any new symptoms or changes in your health. Have a good day, Mr. Theriot. .
