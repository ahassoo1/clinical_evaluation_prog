DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re still going. It’s really annoying, honestly. Over 48 hours now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for over 48 hours. That is annoying. Let’s try to figure out what might be going on. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Sure. They come and go, of course. Not constant, thankfully. But they happen quite a bit throughout the day. Like, maybe every ten or fifteen minutes, a little burst of them. And…they don’t really seem to be triggered by anything specific. I haven't been eating too fast or drinking anything fizzy, that I know of. I'm not sure what sets them off. They just start.
DOCTOR: Alright, so intermittent hiccups, happening roughly every 10-15 minutes, and not obviously linked to anything you’ve eaten or drunk. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Let me think. No, not really. No pain, no shortness of breath, no…weird feelings. Just the hiccups. I’ve been a little tired lately, but that’s usual for me, I think. Work keeps me busy. I manage a small entertainment venue, so it can be stressful. But I wouldn't say it's more stressful than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other accompanying symptoms, and the tiredness seems typical for you. Do you have any trouble swallowing or any heartburn or indigestion that you've noticed?
PATIENT: No trouble swallowing at all. And no heartburn, thankfully. I get a little indigestion sometimes, but nothing major. Just…a little uncomfortable after a big meal, you know? But I haven’t had any of that with the hiccups. It really is just the hiccups themselves. It’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest!
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can be incredibly frustrating. Let's go through some of your medical history, just to get a more complete picture. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it's been managed with medication for a while now. And… I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Other than that, not much, really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. I haven't been to the doctor much lately, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so managed hypertension and a cholecystectomy ten years ago. Do you know what medication you are on for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It’s Lisinopril, 20mg once a day. I take it every morning. And I haven't changed the dose recently, it's been the same for a long time now. I make sure to take it regularly, it’s important, you know. My old doctor always warned me about keeping on top of it.
DOCTOR: Good, that's helpful to know. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental things?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. I eat everything, pretty much. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. And no environmental allergies either – no hay fever, no reactions to pets, nothing like that. I live in the city, so I’m exposed to everything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. Sometimes I take a multivitamin, but not regularly. It depends if I remember. And… occasionally, if I’m feeling particularly stressed, I’ll take a herbal tea with chamomile in it, for relaxation. But that’s it, really. Nothing prescribed, nothing I take every day. I try to stay healthy, but I'm not very good at remembering all the vitamins and supplements, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional multivitamin and chamomile tea. That's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family had any significant medical problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… My mother had diabetes, type 2, for many years before she passed away. And my father had heart disease, he had a stroke about ten years ago. My brother is healthy, as far as I know, but we don’t see each other very often. Oh, and my aunt on my mother's side had breast cancer. I think that’s it, really. Nothing else that I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of type 2 diabetes in your mother, heart disease in your father, and breast cancer in your aunt. And finally, just a couple of questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, if I’m celebrating something. And definitely no recreational drugs. I don’t have time for all that, honestly. Work keeps me pretty busy, you know? I prefer a good cup of tea!
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. That's helpful to know. Alright, Ivette, I've got all the information I need for now. Given the duration of the hiccups – over 48 hours – and the fact that they don't seem to be related to anything specific, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to get checked over. Hopefully, you can figure out what’s causing these pesky hiccups!
DOCTOR: Great. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look in your throat and feel your abdomen. It won't take long. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat appears normal, no redness or swelling. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Everything sounds and feels normal so far, which is reassuring. Given your history and the exam findings, it's unlikely to be anything serious. However, hiccups that last this long can sometimes be caused by a variety of things, including irritation of the diaphragm, nerve compression, or even certain medications. To rule out any underlying medical conditions, I’d like to order some blood work. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good idea, just to be on the safe side. I’d rather rule things out than worry about them. What sort of things will the blood work check for? I don’t mind, but it’s always good to know what’s being looked at, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll do a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out any thyroid problems. We'll also check your liver function. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and help us identify any potential causes for your hiccups. I'll write you a lab order. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll be able to draw the blood for you. It shouldn’t take long. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, you can try some simple home remedies, like drinking a glass of water slowly or holding your breath for a short period of time. These don’t always work, but they’re worth a try. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. A glass of water slowly… I've tried that a few times, actually, but it hasn't really helped. I’ll try the holding-my-breath thing. And I'll go get the blood work done now. Just one thing… how long roughly should it take to get the results back? I'm not very good with medical things, so I'm not sure what to expect.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Typically, the results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. I'll have the lab fax them directly to the clinic, and my nurse will contact you as soon as we have them. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and plan accordingly. In the unlikely event that the hiccups worsen significantly – if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or difficulty swallowing – please go to the emergency room immediately. But for now, let's just focus on getting these blood tests done and see what they reveal. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. 24 to 48 hours is reasonable. And I will definitely remember to go to the emergency room if things get worse. I appreciate you telling me that. Thank you so much for your help today. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit. I’ll go and get that done now. Have a good day, Doctor Asami.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. You have a good day as well, and I hope those hiccups resolve soon. I’ll see you in a couple of days.
PATIENT: .
