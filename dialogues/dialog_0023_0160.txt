DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly? It's this tiredness. Just…dragging. And it's not just normal old tired, you know? It’s…different. And frankly, it's embarrassing to even say what else is going on. It’s just…I’ve been eating dirt. Yes, dirt. Don’t look at me like that. It sounds ridiculous, I know. But it's happening, and it’s getting worse. I just want to know what’s wrong with me, and hopefully be done with this whole thing quickly.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt… I see. Well, it’s good you’re being honest with me, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s not common, certainly, but we’ll try to figure out what’s going on. Let’s start with this tiredness. When did you first start noticing it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…it started…well, probably around last fall, maybe October? It just crept up on me, you know? Not a sudden thing. I just found myself needing more naps, and then more coffee, and then…well, it wasn’t enough. I’m usually a very active woman. I like to garden, keep my little place tidy. Now? I barely have the energy to walk to the mailbox. Honestly, I thought it was just getting old. But then…the other thing started. I don't understand why I'm doing this, and I don't want to spend all day talking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to discuss it, Ms. Hardenburgh, but it’s important information. We need to understand why you're eating dirt to determine the cause of the tiredness, and rule out anything serious. Was there anything specific that triggered it?
PATIENT: Triggered? Goodness, no. It just…started. I was in the garden, pulling weeds, and I just…tasted the soil. I know, it's awful. It’s not like I’m craving it, exactly. It’s more like…an urge. A strange, uncomfortable urge. And if I don't...well, I feel restless. And then I just have to. It started with just a little bit, a tiny taste. Now…well, it's a bit more. And I don’t even like the taste, it's gritty! I’ve never done anything like this in my life. I’m a sensible woman. It’s unsettling, to say the least. Look, are we getting anywhere? I don’t have all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re providing helpful information. This isn’t typical behavior, and the urge you describe is concerning. Let’s try to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings lately?
PATIENT: Unusual cravings? Besides…that? No. Not really. I always liked a good chocolate biscuit with my tea, but that’s hardly unusual. I’ve not been eating anything else strange, I assure you. Just…the dirt. It’s really quite embarrassing. I’m not some…child, digging around in the yard. I've lived a perfectly normal life until recently. I eat a sensible diet, mostly. Fruits, vegetables…a little bit of meat. I don't understand what’s happening to me, and I wish you'd just tell me what test I need to take, instead of asking all these…questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh, but a proper diagnosis requires a thorough history. It's not simply about running a test; it’s about understanding the why behind your symptoms. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite – beyond the…unusual craving?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Appetite? No, not really. I eat when I'm hungry, don’t eat when I'm not. It’s not like I’ve lost my appetite entirely. Though, I haven’t been cooking as much. Too tired, you see. And frankly, what's the point of cooking a nice meal if I'm just going to feel exhausted afterwards? I used to enjoy it, but now…it just feels like effort for nothing. And I keep telling you, it’s the tiredness. That's the main problem! I just want to feel like myself again. Is there a test you can give me to rule out…I don’t know…everything?
DOCTOR: We can certainly order some tests. Before we do, I need to ask a few more questions, if you’ll indulge me. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm…now that you mention it…yes, I suppose so. My clothes feel a little looser than they used to. Not a lot, mind you. But enough that I had to tighten my belt a notch or two. I just figured it was…a good thing. I’d been meaning to lose a few pounds. But now that you ask…perhaps it’s not so good. Honestly, everything feels off. It’s all connected, isn’t it? The tiredness, the…the dirt, the weight loss… I just want this over with. What kind of tests are we talking about? Blood tests? A scan? I’d rather not have a scan, if you can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. We will start with some blood work. It will help us check for common deficiencies and rule out a number of possibilities. We’ll also check your iron levels, as that can contribute to both tiredness and unusual cravings. Given your age and the fact you've noticed weight loss, we’ll also include a complete metabolic panel. Would you be willing to allow me to check your thyroid function as well?
PATIENT: Thyroid? What's that got to do with anything? Look, if it's not absolutely necessary, I’d rather not. I don't like doctors poking around. Blood tests are fine, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take all day. And if those don’t show anything, I want you to be honest with me. Don't just keep sending me for more tests. I’m not made of money, you know. Just do the blood tests, and let’s see what they say. And can you hurry, please? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hardenburgh. We will start with the complete blood count, metabolic panel, and iron levels. I’ve added a thyroid function test as well, given your symptoms; it’s a simple blood test and can rule out a very common cause of fatigue and, in some cases, unusual cravings. I’ll have the lab order ready for you now. The lab is just down the hall, and they're expecting you. Once the results are back—typically in three to five business days—we will review them and discuss next steps. I understand your concerns about costs, and we can discuss options if further testing is needed. Do you have any questions before I send you to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Just…get it over with. I really don't want to be here any longer than I have to be. Thank you. Now, if you'll excuse me… .
