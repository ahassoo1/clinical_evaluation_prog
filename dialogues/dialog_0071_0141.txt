DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I’m Dr. Galena. It’s… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this itching, really. Everywhere, it seems. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s… well, it's just driving me nuts. Not terrible, just… constant.
DOCTOR: Constant itching, alright. Hmm. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started, I’d say, maybe six weeks ago? Around the end of June, probably. It was just a little bit at first, easy to ignore. But it’s gotten steadily worse since then. I remember because the garden was really taking off then, lots of weeding. Maybe it's something from that? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Six weeks… end of June. Gardening, you say. Possible. Is it all over, or are there specific areas that are worse than others?
PATIENT: It’s pretty much everywhere, to be honest. But my back… my upper back and shoulders are the worst. It's hard to reach back there to scratch, so that makes it even more annoying. And sometimes my ankles itch really badly, especially at night. It wakes me up.
DOCTOR: Upper back and shoulders, ankles worse at night… alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, life’s pretty routine for me these days. I lost my wife, Eleanor, about two years ago, so things have settled down a lot. No new soaps, no new detergents, haven’t traveled anywhere… I did start taking a new vitamin, a multi-vitamin, maybe three months ago? But I doubt that’s it. It was just something the pharmacist suggested.
DOCTOR: Eleanor… I’m sorry for your loss, Mr. Ferneding. It's good you're thinking about changes, though. That multi-vitamin… do you remember the brand name?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… it’s alright. Time moves on, you know? Let me see… the vitamin… it was Nature's Best, I think. The orange bottle. It was on sale at the drugstore down the street. Nothing fancy. I figured it couldn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: Nature's Best… alright. And any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. No rash, no fever, no… well, nothing else. Just the itching. It’s just… persistent. It doesn't seem to be getting better, and it's starting to wear me down, you know? It’s hard to concentrate on anything when you’re constantly scratching.
DOCTOR: Right, just the itching. No rash, no fever… alright. Let's have a look at your skin. If you don't mind, could you please take a seat on the exam table and we'll take a quick look?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. I hope it's not anything serious. It just feels so… random.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a look. It’s often something simple. Now, I'm just going to examine your skin, mostly on your back and shoulders since you said that's where it's the worst. Please let me know if anything feels tender. Hmm… no obvious rash, no hives… skin appears generally normal, slightly dry perhaps. Are you using any moisturizers?
PATIENT: No, I haven't been using any moisturizer. Eleanor always took care of that sort of thing. I just haven't gotten around to it, I guess. It didn't really occur to me. It's just… itchy. That's the main thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ankles… a little bit of dryness here as well. No visible signs of insect bites or irritation. Skin temperature is normal. Now, do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I used to help Eleanor with her gardening, she was allergic to bee stings, but I never had any problems. It’s just… this itch. It's driving me a little crazy, honestly. Is there anything you can prescribe?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Hmm… it's possible it's just dry skin, exacerbated by the summer heat. But given the persistence and the fact that it's waking you up at night, we should rule out a few other things. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a liver function test, just to be safe. And I'm going to recommend an over-the-counter antihistamine for now—something like cetirizine, Zyrtec. It might help relieve the itching.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and something for the itch. Okay. Will the antihistamine make me sleepy? I need to be able to think clearly. I do a bit of volunteer work at the library.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Cetirizine can cause some drowsiness in some people, but it's generally non-drowsy for most. I'll write the prescription with a note to start with a lower dose and see how you tolerate it. If it makes you too sleepy, we can try a different antihistamine. Now, the blood tests… we can get those done right here at the clinic. The nurse will draw the samples after this. It’ll be a quick process. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Blood tests here, lower dose antihistamine… I appreciate you being thorough. It's good to know you're checking everything. When should I expect the results? And how long should I try the antihistamine before seeing if it helps?
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll order the tests now. The results should be back within a few days—I’d say 3 to 5 business days, typically. As for the antihistamine, give it a week—a full seven days—at the prescribed dose. If you’re not seeing any improvement in the itching after a week, please give the office a call, and we’ll discuss other options. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for your time and for listening. It's a relief to have a plan. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. We’ll get those tests done and see what we find. If anything changes or gets worse before then, don't hesitate to call. Have a good day. .
