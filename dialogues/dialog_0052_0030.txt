DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It's lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest, but I’ve noticed a change in my… body odor. It’s not like, bad bad, but different. I’m just not used to it and wanted to get it checked out, you know? Just in case.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Purtee. It's perfectly reasonable to want to investigate any changes in your body, and you've done the right thing by scheduling an appointment. There's no need to be embarrassed at all. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this change?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Um… well, it used to be… pretty much nothing, honestly. I mean, normal body smell, you know? But now it’s… sweeter, almost? And a little stronger, even after I shower. It started maybe a month or two ago, I think. Hard to say exactly, I don’t usually notice these things unless something changes. I work pretty hard, physical labor, so I sweat a lot normally, but this is different than the sweat smell, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Ms. Purtee. It’s helpful to know it's distinct from your usual sweat odor. And you've noticed it persists even after showering?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. Like, I shower every night, sometimes twice if it’s been a really hot day. And I use soap, you know? Regular soap. It’s just… still there, not as strong, but it’s noticeable. My daughter even commented on it last week, which is why I decided to come in. She’s usually pretty good at ignoring things, so if she noticed… that worried me a little.
DOCTOR: I see. That's a good observation – your daughter noticing is certainly a reason to investigate. And it’s good you’re proactive about your health. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. First, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I’m getting older, things ache a little more than they used to, but that’s just… life, you know? No new rashes, no weight loss or gain, no fever, nothing like that. I've been sleeping okay, eating pretty normal… mostly. Just the smell, really. Oh, wait! Now that I think about it, I have been a little more thirsty than usual, maybe? But I figured that was just the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Increased thirst can be significant, even if you attribute it to the heat. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, maybe ten years ago, but the doctor put me on some pills and it went away. I haven’t taken those pills in years. And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed when I was younger, but that was a long time ago, no problems with that since. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy, for my age. I’ve always been lucky, I guess. I have Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Purtee. Both the history of hypertension and the gallbladder removal are important pieces of information. And yes, your Medicare coverage is helpful for billing purposes. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a multivitamin sometimes, if I remember. But honestly, half the time I forget to take it. And… oh! I take ibuprofen sometimes, when my back is really bothering me. But that’s it. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. Just over-the-counter stuff, when I need it. I try not to take too much, you know? Don’t want to mess with my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Sporadic ibuprofen use and occasional multivitamins. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything, never had a reaction. My daughter is the one with allergies, she can’t have peanuts or shellfish. But I’ve never had any problems myself. I'm pretty sure, anyway. I've never gone to the hospital for an allergic reaction or anything. It's a good thing, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Purtee. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… well, my mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. And her mother did too. And my father had heart problems, he had a stroke when he was older. On my husband’s side… his mother had high blood pressure, like I did, but other than that… I don't know much about their history, we didn't talk about it much. They weren't really ones for doctors. It’s probably not much help, honestly.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Purtee. A family history of diabetes and heart disease are important to note. We'll keep those in mind. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I’m a floor layer, like I said. So I’m on my feet all day, lifting heavy things, bending over… it’s hard work. I usually get home pretty tired. I don’t really have time for a lot of hobbies or anything. I used to go dancing, but… that was a long time ago. I don’t smoke, never have. I drink a little wine sometimes, with dinner, but not every night. And I try to eat healthy, but it’s hard when you’re working all day. I eat a lot of… well, whatever’s easiest, I guess. Sandwiches, pasta, things like that. Not a lot of vegetables, probably. I try. It’s just hard.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee, that gives me a very good understanding of your overall health. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a general look at your skin and overall appearance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold, I always get chilly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll make sure to be mindful of that. First, let’s check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 140 over 90. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your thyroid feels normal. I did notice a slight, sweet odor during the examination, but it's not particularly strong. Now, I'm going to gently listen to your abdomen. Your bowel sounds are also normal. Do you experience any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes a little heartburn, like I said, but no actual pain. I get that sometimes when I lie down after eating. It’s not a big deal, really. Just a little burning in my chest. I take some antacids sometimes, but I don’t always remember. Mostly I just try to avoid lying down right after I eat. It usually goes away on its own. Nothing serious, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Intermittent heartburn is common. Given your symptoms – the change in body odor, slightly elevated blood pressure, and family history of diabetes – I'd like to order some blood work. It will help us check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and thyroid hormones, as well as rule out any other potential underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Blood work is fine. Where do I go to get that done? Is there a lab nearby? And… will the insurance cover it? I always worry about those things. It's Medicare, so it should, but you never know.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, Ms. Purtee. Yes, Medicare should cover the blood work, but we'll verify that before you go. There’s a lab right across the street, at 123 Main Street, called “Suburban Labs”. It’s very convenient. I’m sending an electronic order to them now, and they’ll be expecting you. They’ll likely draw a few vials of blood. The order includes a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a hemoglobin A1c, which will give us a good picture of your average blood sugar levels over the past three months. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: No, that sounds pretty thorough. A1c… that’s the sugar test, right? My mother had that done all the time. Okay, so just go across the street to 123 Main Street, and they’ll know what to do. Do I need to fast beforehand? That's always a pain. I hate being hungry. I usually eat breakfast pretty early.
DOCTOR: Yes, the A1c is a measure of your average blood sugar. And you do need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks – just water is okay. Since you usually eat breakfast early, I recommend scheduling the appointment for later in the morning, perhaps around 10:00 AM, so you can skip breakfast. Here are the instructions and the lab’s information. Once the results are back – typically within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not making me feel silly about the smell. I was really worried about it. So, go to 123 Main Street, fast for eight hours, and then schedule a follow-up. Okay. I can do that. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. It's my job to listen and help you figure things out, and you did the right thing by coming in. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. I’ll see you then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
