DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my foot… it’s been bothering me. A sore, really. It won’t go away, and it hurts to walk. Been hurting for… oh, maybe a month now? Longer, even. I forget so easy these days. It’s my… my sugar, I think. The doctor before, he said something about that.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Stoegbauer. A sore on your foot that’s been present for a month or longer, and you suspect it may be related to your sugar levels – diabetes, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Diabetes. That’s what he said. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my… my heel, I think. It’s not a big sore, but it’s deep. And it’s… it’s getting red around the edges. It worries me, because my friend, he had… problems with his feet, and he… well, he lost his leg. I don't want that to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Stoegbauer. That’s certainly a valid worry, and it’s good you’re addressing this now. Foot problems can be serious with diabetes, but we’ll take a look and see what we’re dealing with. First, let's get a bit more detail. When you say it’s getting red around the edges, is there any swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… swelling. Let me think. It’s a little puffy, maybe? Not much. It’s hard to tell, because my feet always swell a little bit when I stand too long. But yes, I think it’s a little bit puffier than usual around that sore. And it feels… warm. Not hot, but warmer than the rest of my foot. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Stoegbauer. Warmth and increased swelling are things we definitely want to investigate. Now, have you noticed any drainage – any fluid coming from the sore itself?
PATIENT: Drainage… Oh, yes. A little bit. It’s not much, but when I change my bandage… there's some wetness. It’s clear, I think. Not… not pus, or anything like that. Just clear liquid. Sometimes a little bit of blood, if I bump it. But mostly clear. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Clear drainage is good, Mr. Stoegbauer, that's less concerning than pus. However, any drainage warrants a closer look. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your foot. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, please. My feet are… sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Stoegbauer. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, I’m assessing your foot now. The sore is located on the plantar surface, near the heel, as you described. It appears to be approximately 1 centimeter in diameter and about half a centimeter deep. There's some surrounding redness and mild swelling. The tissue feels warm to the touch, and it's tender when I palpate it. Your pulses are present, but somewhat diminished. I'm also checking the sensation in your foot… and it appears to be reduced in the area around the sore.
PATIENT: Reduced sensation? What does that mean, Doctor? Is that bad? I… I can feel things, but sometimes my feet feel… numb. Especially at night. Is that what you’re talking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Stoegbauer, that’s precisely what I’m referring to. Reduced sensation is common with diabetes, it’s called peripheral neuropathy. It means the nerves in your feet are being affected by the high sugar levels. It’s why you might experience numbness, tingling, or reduced ability to feel temperature or pain. It's concerning because it can make it difficult to notice small injuries, like blisters or cuts, which can then become infected. The diminished pulses and reduced sensation, combined with the redness and drainage, do indicate we need to take this seriously. I want to get a blood test to check your current sugar levels and rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Blood test is good. I want to know what’s going on. Infection… that's what I was afraid of. My friend… he got an infection, and that’s how he lost his leg. But you think we can catch it early, right? Before it gets too bad?
DOCTOR: That’s exactly right, Mr. Stoegbauer. Early detection is key, and that’s why you’re doing the right thing by coming in today. We'll run the blood tests to check for infection and assess your blood sugar control. We’ll also want to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. I’m going to order those tests now. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend we keep pressure off your foot as much as possible. I’m going to write you a prescription for a pair of special diabetic shoes and recommend a referral to a podiatrist for ongoing wound care. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Diabetic shoes… and a podiatrist? That sounds… a lot. But if it helps, I guess. Okay, shoes and a doctor for my foot. Write whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want this sore to heal, and I don't want to lose my leg. Is it going to hurt to get the blood test? I don't like needles much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s completely reasonable to feel anxious about this. The blood test will be a simple prick of the finger, and it shouldn't cause much discomfort. It's a quick procedure, and the nurse will be very gentle. I'll also write a detailed referral for the podiatrist. They specialize in foot care, and they’ll be able to provide expert wound care and monitor the sore closely. In the meantime, please avoid putting any weight on your foot as much as possible and keep the area clean and dry. I'm going to get the nurse to draw your blood now, and then we can discuss the results and a long-term care plan once they are available. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it, Doctor. Just… thank you. For explaining everything, and for not making me feel… silly for worrying. Okay, let’s get the blood test done. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s my job to address your concerns and provide the best possible care. Please, let me call the nurse, and she'll be right in to assist you with the blood test. Don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you feel any discomfort during the procedure. "Nurse, could you please come in and draw some blood from Mr. Stoegbauer?
