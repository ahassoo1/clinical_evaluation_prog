DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Dr. Blim. I see you’re here today. Now, tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m even here. Something about not being able to see or hear properly, I suppose. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least. My staff insisted, said I needed to be checked. Frankly, I’m a very busy woman. Can we please get this over with?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, staff can be overly cautious. “Not being able to see or hear properly” is quite vague, Ms. Julie. When did you first notice these… inconveniences?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I notice? It was… sometime recently, I should think. A few days, perhaps? A week? It all blurs together, you see. I have a very demanding schedule. It’s just… things seemed a little fuzzy, and people sounded… distant. It wasn’t a dramatic event, Doctor, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… a gradual fading. Really, I don’t understand why I have to detail every single moment.
DOCTOR: A “gradual fading” requires details, Ms. Julie. We must establish a timeline to understand the nature of the problem. Was this sudden, or progressive?
PATIENT: Progressive, I believe. Definitely progressive. Not like a switch being flipped, though I wish it were that simple. More… like looking through a dirty window that gets dirtier over time. And the volume knob slowly turning down. Is that satisfactory? Honestly, Doctor, I’m a surgeon. I tell people what’s wrong with them, I don’t usually have to explain what it feels like to be a patient. It’s… degrading.
DOCTOR: A surgeon, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a pediatric surgeon. For many years, in fact. A very respected one, I might add. I simply don't have time for… this. I have patients waiting. Important patients. I trust you're capable, Doctor, but truly, I’d rather be anywhere else right now. Is there a quick test we can do? Just to prove I'm… reasonably functional?
DOCTOR: We will proceed with a standard examination, Ms. Julie. It’s necessary. Now, regarding your vision… do you experience any blurring at any distance, or is it consistent?
PATIENT: Consistent, I think. Everything appears… muted. Like looking at a painting through Vaseline. Honestly, it's difficult to describe precisely. And frankly, I'm not inclined to spend the entire morning dissecting my visual experience for you, Doctor. If it helps, I can assure you my surgical precision has not been affected. Yet. Though, at this rate…
DOCTOR: Very well. And your hearing?
PATIENT: The hearing is… muffled. Voices sound distant, even when people are standing right in front of me. I find myself asking people to repeat themselves quite often, which, as you can imagine, is incredibly frustrating. It's not a complete loss, Doctor, but it's… inconvenient, to say the least. And rather embarrassing, if I'm being honest. My staff has been particularly… solicitous, which is simply not necessary.
DOCTOR: Do you experience ringing in your ears, Ms. Julie?
PATIENT: Ringing? Hmm… now that you mention it… perhaps. A faint… high-pitched tone. It comes and goes. I hadn’t really paid it much attention. I assumed it was simply the stress of the practice. Honestly, Doctor, I have so many things on my mind, a little ringing in my ears is hardly worth noting. Is this going to take much longer? I have a very important call scheduled in less than an hour.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I need to perform a basic neurological exam. It’s a standard procedure, Ms. Julie, and will help us determine the extent of the problem. And then, perhaps, we can be done.
PATIENT: A neurological exam. Honestly. Very well. But do hurry, Doctor. My time is exceedingly valuable. Let’s just get this over with. I trust you won’t poke me with anything sharp?
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Julie, I am a professional. Now, please follow the light with your eyes… do not move your head.
PATIENT: Is there any point to all this, Doctor? I'm a surgeon, remember? I have excellent hand-eye coordination. And a perfectly functioning nervous system, or at least I did until… well, never mind. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. Please relax your arms.
PATIENT: Must you be so forceful, Doctor? It’s hardly pleasant. I assure you, my reflexes are perfectly adequate. I’ve performed countless delicate procedures. Honestly, this is rather undignified. Is there a quicker way to determine what’s wrong? Perhaps a scan? An MRI? Anything to expedite this process?
DOCTOR: An MRI may be necessary, Ms. Julie, but we need to establish a baseline first. Now, can you feel this?
PATIENT: Feel what exactly, Doctor? And please be gentle. I have very sensitive hands. I wouldn't want to compromise my surgical dexterity.
DOCTOR: Do you feel any sensation in your fingertips?
PATIENT: Yes, of course I feel sensation. I am not… insensible, Doctor. Though, it's… diminished, perhaps? A slight… dullness. It's difficult to describe precisely. Honestly, this is all rather pointless. I already know something is wrong. I just want to know what it is and how quickly I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: And finally, can you clench your fist, and hold it?
PATIENT: Is that it? Are we finally finished? I can clench my fist perfectly well, Doctor. I’ve performed countless intricate surgeries, as I’ve mentioned repeatedly. Honestly, I’m beginning to suspect this entire examination is a waste of my valuable time. Let’s get to the results. Now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, based on my examination, there is some diminished sensation in your hands, and reduced reflexes compared to your other side. Your vision and hearing, as you described, are also affected. This could indicate a number of things, but given your age and symptoms, we need to rule out some serious possibilities. I recommend an MRI of the brain and spine to investigate further. I also want a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An MRI? A neurologist? Honestly, Doctor, you’re suggesting a battery of tests based on a few… minor inconsistencies? I’m a surgeon! I've spent my life diagnosing others. I assure you, I don't need an MRI to tell me something is amiss. Fine. Schedule the MRI, if you insist. But I expect a prompt appointment. And I want a second opinion. From someone… reputable. Honestly, the entire situation is preposterous. And utterly inconvenient. Let's just get it over with. .
