DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting surgery. Weight loss surgery, I think? My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details, but it’s something we’ve been talking about for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kochubey, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common to feel a little overwhelmed with all the information. Weight loss surgery is a big decision, and it’s good you’re discussing it with your wife. So, you're interested in exploring weight loss surgery options. Before we dive into that, let's get a clearer picture of your overall health and why you're considering this now. Could you tell me a little bit more about your weight history?
PATIENT: My weight… hmm. That’s a tough one. It’s been up and down, you know? I used to be… lighter, I guess. Before… well, before things got complicated. I don’t really track it, if that makes sense. My wife probably has a better idea of the numbers. It’s just been getting harder and harder to do things, to move around… and I’m tired a lot. I don't know if that answers your question.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like it’s been a gradual process, and focusing on the difficulties you’re experiencing is very helpful. It's good you're able to articulate that it’s becoming harder to move and you’re feeling fatigued. To help me understand things a little better, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… let me think. I think I had high blood pressure for a while, but I was taking something for it. And maybe… something with my cholesterol? Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit fuzzy. I don't go to the doctor much, if I'm being honest. My wife usually handles all that. I just… show up when she tells me to. Does that sound bad?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound bad at all, Mr. Kochubey. It’s very common for people to have different roles in managing their health. It’s good you’re here today, and we can work together to get a clearer picture. Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Not that I can remember, no. Nothing major, anyway. I broke my arm when I was a kid, I think, but that was a long time ago. And… maybe I had my tonsils out? But honestly, it’s all pretty hazy. My wife would definitely know if I’d had anything serious. I just… don’t have a good memory for that kind of thing. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s good you’re letting me know. We can always confirm things with your wife if needed. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, or obesity?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My dad, he had… something with his heart, I think. He wasn’t very healthy towards the end. And my mom, she had diabetes. She needed shots for it. And… yeah, a lot of people on my side of the family have weight problems, if that’s what you mean. It seems to run in the family, unfortunately. It’s… hard to explain. It’s just always been there, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kochubey. That gives me a good sense of your family history. Knowing about the heart issues and diabetes is helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked. My wife wouldn’t let me. She’s very… health-conscious. And I'm glad she is, to be honest. I’ve always tried to stay away from that stuff. It just never appealed to me.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Kochubey. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a little sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe, on the weekends. Nothing too much. My wife and I, we'll share a bottle of wine occasionally. But really, not very often. I don't drink to excess, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I haven't had any reactions to anything I can remember. But, honestly, I'm not very good at remembering things like that. My wife usually knows if I'm allergic to something. She's always very careful about what I eat and take. I don't think I have any major ones, though. Not that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like you don’t have any known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's fine. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know what you’re doing, okay? My wife always tells me it’s good to get checked out. I'm not very good with medical stuff, so I just try to follow your lead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kochubey. I’ll explain everything as we go. Okay, your blood pressure is 158/92, pulse is 88, respiration is 16, and temperature is 98.6. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, but we can monitor that. Your heart sounds are a bit muffled, and I can hear some mild wheezing in your lungs. Let's take a look at your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I notice some fullness. No significant tenderness. Reflexes are normal, and pulses are good. I’d also like to check your weight and height. You mentioned you're around 5'0", is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, 5 feet. Maybe a little less, actually. I’m not very tall. And… yeah, that sounds right about the weight too. I haven’t weighed myself in a while, but that seems about right. My wife has the scale at home, she's probably more accurate.
DOCTOR: Okay, your height is 5’0” and your weight is 139 pounds. Your Body Mass Index is 26.8, which puts you in the overweight category. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some challenges with weight and potentially elevated blood pressure. Before we discuss surgical options, I’d like to order some blood work to get a more detailed picture of your overall health. This will help us rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to your weight gain and fatigue. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work is fine. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? And if surgery is the right thing to do. My wife will be happy to hear we’re getting some tests done. She’s always pushing me to get checked out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a thyroid panel. These tests will give us a good baseline. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll let you know when they’re ready. Here’s the form, and the nurse will give you instructions on how to fast if necessary. After we get the results back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and explore your options further. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe fatigue, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can answer for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I'll let my wife know about the tests. She'll be happy.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will be with you shortly to go over the lab instructions. Have a good day.
