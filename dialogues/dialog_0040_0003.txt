DOCTOR: Right, well, Mr. Baide, let's get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Tremor, they said. Doctor said I should come in. Honestly, it's not… it's not that bad. Just a little shake now and then. Old age, probably. What do you think?
DOCTOR: "Old age," right. Well, we don't just assume things, do we?
PATIENT: Look, I've lived eighty years. I think I have a pretty good idea what's going on with my body. But fine, ask your questions. Let’s just… hurry it up, alright? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get testy. When did you first notice this "shake," as you call it?
PATIENT: Honestly? Can’t rightly say. A few months, maybe? It comes and goes. It’s not like I’m… shaking all the time. More when I'm trying to do something precise. Like… tying my tie, or holding a fork. Doesn't happen when I'm just sitting here, does it?
DOCTOR: So, it’s activity-related. And primarily affects fine motor skills. Anything else you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I’m a bit slower than I used to be, but who isn’t? My hands… they feel a little stiff sometimes, but that could just be the arthritis. My wife used to rub them with something… can’t recall what it was called. Look, is this going to take long? I told my caretaker I’d be back by one.
DOCTOR: Right. Arthritis… okay. And is this stiffness constant, or does it come and go like the shaking?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I suppose. Like everything else at my age. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. One thing aches, then another. I used to have a wonderful memory… directed a whole film series, you know. Now… Never mind. Point is, it's not a big deal. I just need a quick look, a quick diagnosis, and I need to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick neurological exam then. Just follow my finger with your eyes, don't move your head. It’ll be quick.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don't expect miracles, Doctor. I'm eighty years old, not a spring chicken.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, can you touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: There. See? Perfectly fine. A little shaky, maybe, but I assure you, I haven't lost all my coordination. What's next? Honestly, this is a waste of time. I should be at home… having lunch.
DOCTOR: Can you open and close your hands repeatedly for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's not exactly a smooth operation, is it? But I built a career with these hands! Directed everything from comedies to dramas… What was the question again? Oh, right. Hands. Yes, they work. Sort of.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Changes in my… speech? What do you mean? I’m talking perfectly fine, aren’t I? Maybe a little hoarse, but that's just from age. I used to have a very commanding voice, very good for directing. See? Perfectly clear! This is ridiculous. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Baide, it could be a number of things. Essential tremor is a possibility, and age-related changes are, of course, always a factor. But given your age and some of the findings, I think we should rule out Parkinson's disease. I’m going to order a DaTscan. It's a scan that looks at the dopamine levels in your brain. It'll give us a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Parkinson's?! Now you're just being dramatic! I feel perfectly fine! A scan? Really? Look, I appreciate your… concern, Doctor, but honestly, I don't need a scan. I need a nap. And lunch. I told my caretaker I'd be back hours ago! What does this scan even do? And how long will it take? I haven’t got all day, you know. .
DOCTOR: It's a simple scan, Mr. Baide. Non-invasive. It takes about an hour, including prep time. And while I understand you feel fine, it’s better to be sure. I'm referring you to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist specializing in movement disorders. She's excellent. Here's the referral. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And please, follow up with her. It’s important. .
