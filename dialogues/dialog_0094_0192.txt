DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I'm here for this... exam. For the military. They want me to get checked out first, you know? Gotta make sure I'm... fit enough. It's all paperwork, mostly. Though, I am in pretty good shape, if I do say so myself. Been working with machines my whole life. Keeps a man strong.
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-placement exam for the military. I understand. And you feel generally healthy, then?
PATIENT: Generally? Yeah, I suppose. I mean, I don't get sick often. Little aches and pains, like anyone my age. Working with engines isn't exactly a soft job, you know? Lots of bending, lifting... It's honest work. Never needed a doctor much. My wife, she worries too much, always telling me to get checked, but I tell her, "What for? I feel fine!". She’ll probably be relieved to hear I’m finally doing this.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're generally healthy and active. It’s always better to be proactive, and it’s wonderful you're doing this for peace of mind – for both you and your wife. Let's go through a bit of your history, just to be thorough. I’ll start with some questions about your current health. Have you been experiencing any new symptoms lately?
PATIENT: New symptoms? Hmm... Let me think. Not really. Maybe a little tired some days, but that’s just from working long hours. And my back, it gets a bit stiff after a long shift, but that’s nothing new, like I said. Been like that for years. Nothing that keeps me from working. I don't get fevers or anything like that. Mostly just... old man stuff. You know? Is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Hartness, and I’ll be as efficient as possible. Just a few more questions to get a complete picture. When you say tired, is that a constant feeling, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, mostly. Some days I'm fine, wake up and can work all day no problem. Other days… just feel a bit sluggish, I guess. Don’t have the… oomph like usual. Usually happens after a really busy week, lots of overtime. It's nothing serious. I just push through it. Been doing that for years. I don't understand why they need all this information just for an exam. It's not like I'm falling apart!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. The military has specific requirements for physical fitness, and the exam is designed to assess your overall health and ensure you meet those standards safely. The fatigue you’re describing is good to note. Do you have any difficulty sleeping, or does the fatigue persist even after a full night’s rest?
PATIENT: Sleep? No, I sleep fine. Always have. Don't need any fancy pillows or anything. Just get in bed and knock out. And yeah, the fatigue… it usually goes away after a good night's sleep, but sometimes it lingers a bit. It's… hard to explain. Like there’s still a bit of… heaviness. Not a lot, but it’s there. Like I’m walking through mud a little bit. I don’t know. Honestly, it's probably just stress from work. My boss has been on my back lately. It's just work, though. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful, Mr. Hartness. “Heaviness” is a good way to describe it. And you suspect it's related to stress at work. Let's move on to a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions—anything at all, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Never had anything seriously wrong with me. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox, measles... But that was ages ago. And I haven’t been to a doctor for anything since… honestly, I can’t even remember. My wife keeps track of all that stuff. I think she said I had a bad flu a few years back, but I was just out of it for a day or two, not a big deal. I’m a strong, healthy man. Never been one for complaining.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And your wife keeps track of things, which is very helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Not me. Never been under the knife. I've busted a few knuckles over the years working on engines, had to get stitches once or twice, but that's it. Nothing major. Always patched myself up and got back to work. I don’t sit around waiting for doctors to fix me. Honestly, all this seems like a lot for just a simple exam. They’re making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Hartness. The exam is thorough because the military requires a complete assessment of your health, and we want to ensure you're fully prepared and safe for service. Let’s move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me think. My father... he had some heart trouble towards the end. Got real weak, couldn't work anymore. That was a long time ago, though. And my mother… she had arthritis, bad pain in her joints. That's about it, I think. My wife knows more about all that stuff. She's got charts and lists and everything. She worries about these things. I don't really pay attention to all that family medical stuff. It's not like I can do anything about it, is it?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. It's good to be aware of potential predispositions. Now, would you mind if I ask a few questions about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What's that supposed to mean? Look, I work. Long hours. I eat when I can. Mostly just whatever my wife makes. I don’t sit around drinking fancy drinks or going to clubs or anything. It’s a simple life. A good life, if you ask me. What kind of questions are you gonna ask? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Hartness. Just a few quick questions. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife wouldn't allow it. She’s very health-conscious. Always telling me to eat my vegetables and get enough sleep. She says it's important to take care of yourself. I listen to her… mostly. It's just… sometimes a man needs a good steak and a bit of relaxation. I take pretty good care of myself, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Well… I have a beer with dinner sometimes. Or a glass of wine on the weekend. Nothing excessive. Just to relax, you know? It’s not like I’m out drinking every night. Just a drink or two. My wife has one with me sometimes too. It's all in moderation. Perfectly normal.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. Never needed any. I get the occasional headache, but I just drink some water and rest. I don't believe in filling my body with chemicals. I prefer to let it heal itself. That's what my grandfather always said. I'm a strong man. I don't need pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. That's a good overview. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. My wife makes all sorts of things, and I haven't had any trouble. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. Bee stings, maybe a little swelling, but nothing serious. Never needed an EpiPen or anything like that. I’m pretty tough, you know? Skin gets a bit irritated sometimes from working with grease and oil, but that’s not an allergy. It’s just… work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Hartness. That's a very helpful history. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a physical exam. This will just involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – listening to your heart and lungs, and a general assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. I got things to do. Just don't take too long, alright? I need to get back to work. This military thing is taking up a lot of my time as it is.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hartness. I'll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. 140 over 88. A bit elevated, but we'll keep that in mind. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulses are strong and regular. Reflexes are normal. General appearance is that of a well-developed male, but slightly overweight. Weight is 53kg, height is 187cm, BMI is 15.2, which is underweight. Mr. Hartness, your weight is significantly low for your height. Is this a recent weight loss?
PATIENT: 53 kilograms? What are you talking about? I’m a solid build, always have been! 187cm, I know that’s right. My wife measures me every year! Solid muscle, you see? Maybe your scale is broken. I'm not… underweight. I’m… powerfully built. And no, I haven't lost any weight. I eat plenty. Look, I work hard all day, lifting and bending, I burn calories! Maybe you need to recalibrate your equipment. This is ridiculous!
DOCTOR: I understand your surprise, Mr. Hartness. I double-checked the reading, and it remains consistent. 53 kilograms for a man of your height is considered significantly underweight. It is important to address this. It’s possible there was a misunderstanding with your previous measurements. Significant weight loss or being underweight can have several implications for your health and ability to safely perform physical tasks. Do you have access to a scale at home we could compare with?
PATIENT: My wife has a fancy digital scale. She weighs herself every morning. She’s always on about her weight. But she measures me every year too. Always has. 187cm… and she keeps a chart. A very detailed chart. I… I haven't looked at the chart in a while. She handles all that stuff. I trust her measurements. But… she has been a bit worried lately. Saying I've been looking tired, and not eating enough. But I am eating! It's just… smaller portions, maybe. I don't have much of an appetite sometimes. Working so hard… But 53 kilograms? That can’t be right. Maybe… maybe we should check her scale. Just to be sure.
DOCTOR: That’s a good idea, Mr. Hartness. Checking your wife's scale would be helpful. It’s possible there's a discrepancy, or that there’s been a recent change. In the meantime, could you give me a rough estimate of your usual daily food intake?
PATIENT: Look, it’s… it’s hard to say exactly. My wife does most of the cooking. I eat what she puts in front of me. Usually… breakfast is just coffee and maybe a slice of toast. Lunch is a sandwich, sometimes soup. Dinner is… whatever she makes. Meat and potatoes, usually. Vegetables sometimes, if she’s feeling generous. I don't really keep track of all that. I just eat until I’m full. It’s not a big feast, but it’s enough to keep me going. Lately… I haven’t been as hungry. The work is stressful, and… it takes a lot out of me. I just don't have much of an appetite. And my wife… she’s been trying to get me to eat more, but… it’s hard. I just don’t feel like it sometimes. It's not that I'm trying to lose weight. I just… don't have the energy to eat a lot.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Hartness. It sounds like you've been under a lot of stress lately, and your reduced appetite is likely contributing to the weight loss. Given your low weight and reduced appetite, I'm concerned about the possibility of underlying medical issues or nutritional deficiencies. While we can't definitively diagnose anything without further investigation, I recommend we order some blood work to check your nutritional status, thyroid function, and overall health. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Look, I really don’t like needles. And I don’t want to be poking around with all sorts of tests… Is it… is it serious? You think there’s something really wrong with me? I feel… tired, yes, and I haven’t been eating much, but I just thought it was the stress from work. My wife will be worried sick if I tell her. She already nags me enough about eating my vegetables. Could we… could we wait a bit? Maybe just try to eat more? I promise I’ll try. And I’ll ask my wife to make sure I get enough sleep. I really don’t want to go through all that blood work if it’s not necessary. It’s just… I’m a busy man. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Hartness. I wouldn’t recommend blood work if I didn't think it was important. It's not about trying to find something wrong, but about making sure everything is functioning as it should. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and rule out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. We don't have to make any immediate decisions. If you're uncomfortable proceeding with blood work right now, we can hold off for a short period. However, I strongly recommend it. Given your weight and reduced appetite, it's important to investigate. If we wait and your symptoms worsen, it could delay proper treatment. In the meantime, let’s focus on improving your nutrition and managing your stress. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess your condition. If your appetite doesn’t improve or you experience any new symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Two weeks… Alright. Fine. Two weeks. I’ll try to eat more. And I'll try to get more sleep. My wife will be happy to hear that. She's already on my back about it. But I still think it's just the stress. And I really don't like needles. But what if… what if the tests show something bad? What if it’s something serious? What would we do then? I have a job to do. I can’t be… sick.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious about that possibility, Mr. Hartness. While it's important to be prepared, it’s important to remember that we don't have any definitive information yet. Most often, these types of symptoms are related to lifestyle factors like stress and diet. But if the tests do reveal any abnormalities, we'll discuss the results thoroughly and develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your needs. We’ll explore all available options and make sure you have all the information you need to make informed decisions about your health. We have excellent specialists in the area if we need to consult with someone. I’ll provide you with a referral if necessary. I want to emphasize that we’ll be with you every step of the way. Let’s focus on the positive. We’ll start with improving your nutrition and managing your stress. I will write you a referral for blood work. The lab is just down the street, and they are very efficient. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Improve my nutrition… manage my stress… get the blood work done. And if it’s bad… you’ll let me know. And you’ll help me. My wife will be relieved to hear I’m finally taking this seriously. She's been nagging me about it for months. Alright. Let’s get this over with. Can I get a note to show my boss? I might need to take a few hours off to get the blood work done. And to… try to eat more.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hartness. I'll write a note for your employer explaining that you've been advised to take some time off for a medical appointment and to focus on your health. I’ll also include a brief summary of the symptoms we discussed. Here you go. I will also print out a summary of our discussion today, including the instructions for the blood work, as well as some resources for managing stress and improving your diet. I'm glad you're taking these steps, Mr. Hartness. Remember, I’m here to support you. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You seem… nice. A lot nicer than I expected. I’m not very good with doctors. Usually just try to avoid them. But you… you made me feel a little bit better. Alright. I guess I should go. I have things to do. I'll see you in two weeks. Hopefully, everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hartness. I’m glad I could help. Please take care of yourself and remember to prioritize your health. I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes before then. A strong man, indeed. But even strong men need to take care of themselves. I hope he finds the support he needs.
