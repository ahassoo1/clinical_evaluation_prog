DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nahrwold. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Um… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. It’s been… not great. I’ve had diarrhea for a while now, and it just won't stop. I think it’s been going on for a couple of weeks, maybe longer? Honestly, time gets a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, you say. And you’re finding it difficult to pinpoint the exact start date… alright. Can you describe the diarrhea for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds about right. It's… watery, mostly. And pretty frequent. Like, I’ve been going to the bathroom a lot. It’s not… bloody or anything, if that makes sense. Just… constantly needing to go. It's really tiring, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no blood, that’s good. Frequent and watery, for a couple of weeks. Have you noticed any cramping or abdominal pain with this?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, actually. It’s not bad pain, like, it doesn't take my breath away or anything. But it's definitely uncomfortable. It feels… kind of like a dull ache, mostly in my lower stomach. Comes and goes, but it’s there a lot of the time when I’m having… issues.
DOCTOR: And is this cramping constant, or does it seem to correlate with bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. It definitely gets worse before and during a bowel movement. Like, that’s when it really bothers me. Between… well, you know. It’s just… quieter then. Not gone, but… less noticeable. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining this.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Nahrwold. Don't worry about explaining it perfectly; I'm here to help sort things out. Have you noticed any fever, nausea, or vomiting along with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever, thankfully. And I haven't been sick, like throwing up. I get a little… queasy sometimes, maybe, but it's not full-on nausea. Just a bit off. Everything else feels pretty normal, actually, besides… this. It’s just so disruptive, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: Um… it's been a bit off, yeah. I don't feel sick when I eat, but I haven't been very hungry. I've been eating less than usual, definitely. Mostly just… bland things, things that won't upset my stomach even more. Like toast, or crackers. I don’t really want anything fancy, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. Reduced appetite, preferring bland foods. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Not really, not that I can think of. I mean, I always try to eat pretty healthy, you know? Lots of vegetables, lean protein… nothing too crazy. Maybe I had a little more dairy last week, but that’s it. I don't think that would be it, though. I've had dairy before without any problems. I'm really not sure what's causing this. It’s just frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, sorry. I take… Medicare, so they cover some things. Let me think… I don't really take anything regularly, honestly. Just the occasional pain reliever, like ibuprofen, if I get a headache. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I haven’t taken that in a while. Nothing for my stomach specifically, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Um… that’s… a good question. Honestly, I don’t really remember. I’ve seen doctors before, of course, but… it was a while ago. I think… maybe something with my stomach when I was younger? But I don’t really recall the details. It was a long time ago and my memory isn’t the best. I think they mentioned something about… needing to watch what I eat? But I could be wrong. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It is potentially important, Ms. Nahrwold. We'll get to the bottom of it. Do you know if you've ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had any surgeries. Never. I don’t like hospitals, so I try to avoid them as much as possible. It's one of the reasons I put off coming in about this for so long, to be honest. It's just… a lot. And then remembering all the details… it's hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, grandparents—who have had any digestive problems, like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Um… my mom… I think she had some stomach problems sometimes? But it wasn't anything serious, as far as I know. Mostly just… indigestion. And my grandmother… she had some issues, too, but I don’t really remember what. I wasn't very close to her, and my family doesn’t really talk about medical things much. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I don’t like the smell of it. And I don't really drink alcohol, either. Maybe a sip at a wedding or something, but that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm pretty healthy, honestly. That's why this is so confusing. It just came on suddenly, and it won't go away. It’s really worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nahrwold. Thank you for that information. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and I'll gently press on your stomach to check for any tenderness. Would you mind lying down on the table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. That sounds good. I'm ready when you are. Hopefully, you can figure out what’s going on. It's just… tiring, constantly worrying about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Nahrwold. I'm listening to your abdomen now… and gently pressing on your stomach. I do note some mild tenderness in your lower left quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly hyperactive. Your abdomen is soft overall, no masses palpated. Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing acute diarrhea with some abdominal cramping. Given the duration, we need to rule out a few things. I’m going to order a stool sample analysis to check for any bacterial or parasitic infections. We’ll also do a complete blood count to check for signs of inflammation. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies. I've never had a reaction to anything before, thankfully. A stool sample… okay. That sounds… not fun, but if it helps, then okay. How long will it take to get the results? And what if it is something bad? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It typically takes about 2-3 business days for the lab to process the stool sample and CBC. If it is a bacterial infection, we’ll start you on antibiotics. If it's a parasite, we’ll use appropriate antiparasitic medication. In the meantime, it's important to stay hydrated – drink plenty of clear fluids like water, broth, or electrolyte solutions. Avoid dairy, fatty foods, and caffeine. While we are awaiting the results, if you develop a fever over 101°F, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that's clear. Hydrate, avoid certain foods, watch for fever or blood… okay. I can do that. And what if it’s not an infection? What if it’s… something else? You mentioned IBD earlier, and now I'm worrying about that. I really don't want to have something serious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nahrwold, it's understandable to be worried, but let’s not jump to conclusions. The most common cause of acute diarrhea is a viral or bacterial infection, and that’s what we’re ruling out first. If the stool sample and CBC come back negative, we’ll discuss further investigation. That may include a colonoscopy to examine your colon directly, but we won’t even consider that until we've ruled out more common causes. For now, focus on staying hydrated and following the dietary recommendations. I'll also give you a prescription for an anti-diarrheal medication to help manage the symptoms. It’s important to remember that most cases of acute diarrhea resolve on their own with supportive care. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… a prescription for something to help, that’s good. And you said a colonoscopy… that sounds scary. But you’re right, let’s not worry about that yet. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything and not just… panicking me. It’s just… hard, being so unsure about everything. I guess I’ll just… wait for the results and try to drink more water.
