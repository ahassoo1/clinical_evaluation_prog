DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a reset, or a jumpstart, to get my health back on track. I’m not sure how to explain it better than that, really. I just don’t feel myself.
DOCTOR: “Stuck,” alright. And how long have you been feeling this way, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It hasn’t been sudden, you see. More like…gradual. Perhaps six months, maybe longer? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. It’s just…less energy, less motivation. Things feel harder than they used to.
DOCTOR: Six months…that’s…significant. And when you say things feel “harder,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s…everything, a little. Simple tasks around the house feel exhausting. I used to enjoy gardening, but now I just look at it and…feel overwhelmed. And I’m a molder, you see, with my hands, shaping things. It requires a lot of focus and stamina, and lately…it’s been a struggle to concentrate, and my hands…they ache more easily. Not a sharp pain, just…tired.
DOCTOR: I see. Fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and aches in your hands. And has this impacted your appetite or your sleep at all?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My sleep…it’s not very restful. I fall asleep alright, but I wake up several times during the night. And my appetite has definitely decreased. I don't have much of a hunger, to be honest. I mostly eat because I know I should. It’s just not enjoyable anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Difficulty sleeping, decreased appetite…These things can all be connected, of course. Now, have you noticed any weight loss along with this decreased appetite?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes do feel a little looser than they used to. I suppose I have lost some weight, yes. Nothing dramatic, but noticeable. I would say… perhaps five or ten pounds? It’s hard to say for certain.
DOCTOR: Five to ten pounds can be significant, Ms. Pitzel, especially over six months. We'll need to get a better measurement. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing chronic, as far as I know. I've always been fairly healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. My husband, Ricardo, he sometimes worries about my blood pressure, but I haven’t had it checked recently. He's very… attentive. He’s always urging me to see a doctor, to be honest. Perhaps that’s why I am here today.
DOCTOR: Alright. No chronic conditions. And no surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries either. Just the usual dentist appointments, you see. Nothing major. I’ve been very fortunate, health-wise, until…well, until recently. Do you think…do you think there’s something we can do about this? I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: We'll see, Ms. Pitzel. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother…she had arthritis, later in life. And my father, he had some heart trouble. He wasn’t very careful with his diet, you see. And my older brother, he has diabetes. So, there’s a bit of a family history of those sorts of things, yes. Does that…concern you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s…relevant, Ms. Pitzel. Now, do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I avoid medication whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, if I can. Mostly just herbal teas for calming, and things like that. I’ve always been quite careful about what I put into my body. Ricardo sometimes suggests I take something for my aches, but I haven’t yet. I really don't like taking pills, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. And do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, and never had a reaction. I grew up in Colombia, you see, where we eat a lot of different fruits and vegetables and spices. I suppose I’ve built up a tolerance to most things. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: It's…good to know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor! Never. I find it…disgusting, frankly. And Ricardo, he doesn't either. We both believe in keeping our bodies healthy, you see. We did smoke socially when we were younger, but that was a very long time ago. It wasn't a habit, just… experimentation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Only occasionally, Doctor. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. Nothing excessive, I assure you. We’re not big drinkers. I prefer a nice cup of herbal tea, myself. Ricardo, he enjoys a beer sometimes, but he’s very moderate.
DOCTOR: And finally, what do you do for work?
PATIENT: I am a molder, Doctor. I shape things - clay, plaster, sometimes wax. It requires a lot of handwork, a lot of focus. It’s…a very physical job, you see. And I enjoy it, when I have the energy. But lately, it’s been a struggle. It requires a lot of stamina.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Well, based on what you’ve told me, we'll need to do a physical exam and some lab work. It sounds like fatigue, decreased appetite, and some aches. It could be a number of things, and we'll need to rule some out. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds sensible. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary. There you are.
DOCTOR: 115 pounds. And what is your height, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… surprisingly low, isn’t it? I haven’t weighed myself in quite some time. I am… one ninety eight centimeters, Doctor. It’s quite tall, I know. I always have been.
DOCTOR: One ninety eight centimeters and 115 pounds. That gives you a BMI of…quite low. Alright, let’s listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your reflexes and range of motion. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Please let me know if you need me to do anything. I always feel a little awkward during these examinations, you see.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Reflexes are normal. Now, can you raise your arms over your head?
PATIENT: There you are, Doctor. Is that alright? It feels a little stiff, to be honest. It hasn't been as easy as it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Some mild tenderness to palpation in the metacarpophalangeal joints. And can you make a tight fist?
PATIENT: There. It’s a little…painful, to be honest. Not a sharp pain, just an ache. It’s worse in the mornings, you see. And after I’ve been working with the clay for a while.
DOCTOR: Mild tenderness and reduced range of motion in both hands. Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Based on this initial examination, it’s difficult to say definitively, but it could be early signs of osteoarthritis. We’ll need to get some blood work done to rule out other conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis or thyroid issues. I’ll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. And we’ll get some X-rays of your hands to assess the joint damage.
PATIENT: Osteoarthritis? Oh dear. Is that…serious, Doctor? And what about the blood work and X-rays? Will that take long? I just want to know what's happening, you see. And if there's something we can do about it.
DOCTOR: It’s not immediately serious, Ms. Pitzel, but it’s something we need to address. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease, which means it gets worse over time. The blood work and X-rays will help us determine the severity and rule out other possible causes. The lab results usually take 2-3 business days, and we can schedule the X-rays for tomorrow. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid activities that aggravate your hand pain, and we’ll discuss some over-the-counter pain relievers and possible physical therapy options once we have the results. And try not to worry too much until we have more information.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds…sensible. I will avoid aggravating my hands, and I’ll wait for the results. And perhaps I will look into some gentle hand exercises in the meantime, just something light. Thank you, Doctor Kur. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain things so clearly. I feel a little better just knowing we're getting to the bottom of it.
DOCTOR: Good. I will have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they will schedule your X-rays. I’ll also print out a sheet with some gentle hand exercises you can start. In the meantime, if your pain becomes severe, or you develop any fever or swelling in your joints, please contact the office immediately. And try to remember, Ms. Pitzel, it's important to be proactive about your health. Don't wait until things get worse to seek medical attention. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and your thorough examination. I will certainly be more proactive in the future. I appreciate your advice. Have a good day, Doctor Kur.
DOCTOR: Yes, you as well, Ms. Pitzel. .
