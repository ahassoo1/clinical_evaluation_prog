DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some…well, pressure in my bladder, and it’s become quite bothersome recently. It's been happening for about a week now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure for about a week. I see. Can you describe the pressure for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not painful, exactly. More like…a constant fullness, even after I’ve just gone to the restroom. It feels like I haven’t completely emptied my bladder, if that makes sense. And I find myself needing to go quite frequently, even if it’s just a small amount. It’s a bit disruptive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, a constant fullness and frequent urination, even after feeling like you haven’t fully emptied. Disruptive is a good word to use, that sounds frustrating. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don’t think so. The color seems normal, as far as I can tell. I haven’t noticed any blood, and the smell seems the same. No burning sensation either, when I go. I haven’t really paid close attention, honestly, until this pressure started. Would I have noticed something if it was unusual? I apologize if that sounds…unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Marialena, that’s perfectly alright. It's common to not notice subtle changes until something feels off. No blood or burning is good. So, just to clarify – the frequent urination is a new symptom that started around the same time as the pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Both the pressure and needing to go so often began approximately one week ago. Before that, everything was…normal. I didn’t have any issues whatsoever. I remember specifically because we took a short trip last week, and I didn’t have any problems while traveling.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s helpful information. And just to get a bit more of a picture, have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower back pain along with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and no lower back pain at all. I have been a little more tired than usual, but I attributed that to just…the general stress of work lately. It’s been quite busy. But there’s been no pain associated with this bladder issue.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or back pain, just increased fatigue you're attributing to work stress. Now, thinking about your medical history… have you ever had any urinary tract infections, kidney problems, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have been generally quite healthy, thankfully. I haven’t had any urinary tract infections, as far as I know. My mother had some kidney stones when she was older, but I don’t have a family history of kidney problems, specifically. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about five years ago, but it’s well-managed with medication, and I see my primary care physician regularly for check-ups. I also have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that here, Marialena. High blood pressure, well-managed, that's good. And you mentioned seeing your primary care physician regularly, excellent. Are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, just the one for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, 20mg daily. And a daily multivitamin, but that’s over-the-counter, nothing special. I make sure to take everything as prescribed. I don’t take any herbal supplements or anything like that, if that’s what you’re wondering. I’m generally quite cautious about putting things into my body.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Marialena. Okay, so Lisinopril 20mg daily and a multivitamin. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a graphic designer, so I spend most of my day sitting at a computer. I try to take short breaks and walk around, but it’s not ideal, I admit. My husband and I enjoy gardening when we have the time. I drink a fair amount of water throughout the day, maybe six to eight glasses, and I don't smoke. We have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I wouldn’t say I drink heavily. I try to eat a balanced diet, mostly home-cooked meals.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly sedentary work, gardening, good hydration, no smoking, occasional wine, balanced diet. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. We'll just listen to your abdomen, check your lower back for tenderness, and then I’d like to do a quick urine sample. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I understand. Please proceed whenever you’re ready. I’m a little nervous, I confess, but I trust your expertise. Just let me know if there's anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No need to be nervous, Marialena. It’s just a standard check. First, if you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. It may feel a little cool, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Okay, I’m listening now… everything sounds normal so far. No unusual sounds. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. And finally, I'll need a urine sample. I'll give you a cup, and I'll step out for a moment to give you some privacy. Just try to collect a midstream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a little bit in the cup, and then finish. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds straightforward enough. Midstream sample, I understand. I don’t have any questions at the moment. Would you like me to let you know when I'm finished?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do, Marialena. I’ll step out now and give you some privacy. Just call out when you're done, and I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: Doctor, I’m finished!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marialena. Okay, let's take a look at this sample. We'll send it off to the lab for a urinalysis – that’ll check for things like infection, blood, and glucose levels. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial examination, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of a urinary tract infection, although we can't confirm that until we get the lab results back. It could also be something else, like an overactive bladder or even bladder irritation. To be on the safe side, and while we wait for the lab results, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics. It’s a common medication, and it usually helps clear up a UTI quickly. We can adjust the treatment plan if the lab results show something different. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. If it’s a precaution and could help, I think that's a good idea. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. What are the potential side effects of the antibiotic? And how long will the course last? I prefer to be well-informed, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. It's good to be informed. The antibiotic I'm prescribing is Nitrofurantoin, and it’s usually well-tolerated. The most common side effects are nausea, loss of appetite, and stomach upset. These usually subside within a few days. Less common, but important to watch out for, are allergic reactions, such as rash, itching, or difficulty breathing. If you experience any of those, stop taking the medication immediately and contact me or go to the emergency room. The course will be for seven days. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished, to make sure the infection is completely cleared. I’ll also recommend drinking plenty of fluids – at least eight glasses of water a day – to help flush out your urinary system. And try to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods, as they can irritate your bladder. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, that’s very clear, Doctor. Seven days of Nitrofurantoin, finish the entire course, drink plenty of water, avoid caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. I think I’ve got it. What if the symptoms don’t improve after seven days? Or if they worsen? And will I need to come back for a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Good questions, Marialena. If your symptoms don’t improve after seven days, or if they worsen at any point, please contact the clinic immediately. We may need to run further tests to determine the cause of your symptoms and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in about two weeks, just to make sure everything is clearing up as expected. We’ll call you to confirm the appointment time once the lab results are back. In the meantime, if you experience any severe symptoms, such as high fever, chills, back pain, or blood in your urine, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and I appreciate your patience with my questions. Thank you for your time and expertise. I feel much more reassured now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns. And remember, finish the entire course of antibiotics, drink plenty of fluids, and take care. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
