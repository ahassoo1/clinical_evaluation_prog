DOCTOR: Hi Demondre, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, I just been feelin' okay, you know? Not sick sick, just... wanted to check things out. It's been a while since I saw a doctor, and figured now was a good time. Just curious, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable. It's always a good idea to get a check-up, even if you’re not feeling particularly unwell. “Just curious” is a great reason! To get a better picture of things, let's start with a little more detail. When you say “not feeling okay”, can you tell me a bit more about what that means?
PATIENT: Hmm... it's hard to explain. Not like a bad pain or a cough. More like... tired, I guess? And sometimes, kinda just... off. Like somethin' ain't right, but I can't put my finger on it. It comes and goes, you know? Not every day. Maybe a couple times a week. It don't stop me from work or nothin', I still get my job done. Just... makes me wonder.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness and that feeling of being "off" – that's definitely worth looking into. And it's good you're still able to work, that gives us a good baseline. When you say tired, is it more of a physical fatigue, or more mental exhaustion, or both?
PATIENT: Hmm... good question. I think... both, maybe? After work, I'm always beat. Like, just wanna collapse. But even on days off, sometimes I just feel... drained. Not really sad or anything, just... no energy. Like my battery is low all the time. Does that make sense? I don't usually sit around thinkin' too hard, so it's not a brain thing, usually. Just... body tired, and kinda... spirit tired, I guess.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. "Spirit tired" is a good way to put it. It sounds like this has been going on for a little while. To get a better understanding, could you tell me roughly when this started?
PATIENT: Shoot... that's a tough one. Probably... maybe six months ago? It started slow, just a little more tired than usual after work. Thought it was just the job, you know? Being on the boats and all. But it kinda hasn't gone away. It's been pretty steady, I guess. Not gettin' worse, but not gettin' better either. It's just... there.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of this consistent fatigue. That helps. Being on the boats is definitely physically demanding work. Let’s talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before—anything at all?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. I mean, I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbin' a tree. But nothin' serious. I don’t really get sick much, to be honest. A cold now and then, but nothin' that needed a doctor. Just the usual stuff. Never been told I had anything wrong with me before, if that makes sense. I ain't the type to go seein' doctors unless somethin' is really wrong.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No major medical history is helpful. And it's perfectly reasonable to only seek medical attention when you need to. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had anythin' cut open. Just the arm when I was little, they set it, but no cuttin'. I kinda stay away from hospitals if I can. Not a fan of 'em.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That's good. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mom, she had high blood pressure. And my grandpa on my dad's side, he had somethin' with his heart, I think. But other than that, not really. Everyone else seemed pretty healthy, as far as I know. My mom passed away a few years back, so I don't really have anyone to ask about it. It was a while ago, so I don’t remember much about it. It was kinda a shock, you know? She was pretty active.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your mom. It’s tough losing someone suddenly. High blood pressure and a heart condition in the family are good things to know. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been a smoker. Don't really care for it. I might have a beer with my buddies sometimes, after work, just one or two. But nothin' regular. And I don’t do any of that other stuff. Never really seen the point. Just try to stay outta trouble, you know? Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, very light alcohol use. That’s helpful to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. Been stung by a bee once, but that didn’t bother me too bad. Just a little pain. Never had a reaction to any medicine, to my knowledge. I try to stay away from pills if I can, though. Don't like feelin' weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's great. Okay Demondre, I’ve got all that down. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Just to get a baseline and see if anything obvious stands out. It'll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doc. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything hurts, or somethin'. I ain't shy, just don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me anytime if you feel uncomfortable. Okay, first, let’s check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… 130 over 85. That’s a little elevated, but not significantly. We’ll keep an eye on that. Okay, listening to your heart now… sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Okay, take a nice deep breath in… and out… again… Good. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your throat… say "ahhh" for me… Throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. And finally, let me just take a quick look in your ears… Ears look clear as well. Okay, everything seems normal on the initial exam. Your blood pressure is a little high, but that could be due to stress or just being in the office. Now, I’d like to order some blood work to get a better picture of what's going on. It'll check your thyroid levels, vitamin D, iron, and a general blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Blood work is fine. Whatever it takes to figure things out. I just wanna know what’s goin' on, you know? I don’t like feelin’... off. So do whatever you think is best, Doc. Just tell me what I need to do. Where do I go for it? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'm sending the order to the lab right now, it should be in their system. You can go to the lab located at 123 Main Street, just a few blocks from here. They're open 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. You don’t need an appointment, just tell them you're here for blood work ordered by Dr. Maskal. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and go over a plan. In the meantime, if anything changes or if you start experiencing new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. 3-5 days, got it. 123 Main Street. Thanks a lot, Doctor. You been real helpful. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen, and not makin’ me feel like I was crazy for just feelin’… off. I’ll call if somethin’ changes. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Demondre. It’s important to listen to your body and get things checked out, and you weren’t at all crazy. It’s good you came in. I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything.
