DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't have a lot of time for this. It's...well, it's my stomach. Been having issues. Bad ones. And nothing seems to be helping. I’ve tried a bunch of things, you know? Over-the-counter stuff. It just keeps...going. It’s embarrassing to even talk about.
DOCTOR: “A bunch of things,” you say. Right. Well, we need to be a bit more specific than that if I’m going to help you, Ms. Woodring. When did these issues start?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t even remember exactly. A while ago. Maybe...a month? It comes and goes, but lately it’s been constant. It’s just… disruptive. I have things to do. Important things. Not sit around worrying about…this. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And when you say “constant,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: It means I'm going to the bathroom all the time. Like, constantly. And it’s… watery. Really watery. And sometimes… cramping. Look, I don’t need a detailed description of what diarrhea is, okay? I have diarrhea. That's why I’m here. I just want something to stop it. Fast.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Frequent, watery stools with cramping. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Definitely not blood. Look, I pay attention to things like that, okay? I’m not… careless. It’s just… a lot of water. And it smells… bad. Really bad. I don’t know what else you need to know. Is this going to take long? I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Fine, no blood. And you said it’s been constant for a month now, despite trying over-the-counter remedies. What exactly have you tried?
PATIENT: Ugh, I told you, a bunch of things! Pepto-Bismol, Imodium… you know, the usual stuff. Those little pink pills. And that… bismuth stuff. Honestly, I don't remember the names. It all just feels like a waste of time. I expect you to just know what fixes this, you're the doctor, aren't you? I'm not a chemist. Is this going anywhere? I have paint to apply.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, “a bunch of things” isn’t helpful. Knowing what you've taken, and for how long, is important. It helps me understand what hasn’t worked. Have you had a fever?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I don't get fevers. I haven't felt sick, exactly. Just… really uncomfortable. And constantly running to the bathroom. Look, I'm a very busy person. This is really interfering with my work. I need something strong. Something that actually works. Is this going to involve tests? Because I really don't have time for a lot of that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand you’re busy. However, “something strong” without knowing the cause could be… unwise. We need to rule out some possibilities. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Travel? No. Where would I go? I work. I don't have time to go gallivanting around the world. It's just… local stuff. I've been here, working, mostly. Honestly, I think it might be something I ate. But I can’t pinpoint anything specific. It's probably just a bug or something. Look, can we just skip to the part where you give me a prescription? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: “Something I ate” could mean a number of things. And prescribing medication without a proper assessment is… not standard practice. Now, have you noticed any nausea or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. No throwing up. Just…the other thing. Constantly. And a really upset stomach. Honestly, I’m getting really frustrated. I feel like you’re just asking questions to waste my time. I came here for a solution, not an interrogation. Can't you just give me something to stop it? I'm a grown woman. I can tell you what I'm experiencing. It’s severe diarrhea, okay? Now, can we move this along? I have deadlines.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I am trying to determine the cause of your diarrhea so I can recommend the correct treatment. Persistent diarrhea can lead to dehydration and other complications. Have you been experiencing any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? Yes, sometimes. Cramping, I told you. It comes and goes. It’s… uncomfortable. It's just… my stomach hurts when it's happening. Honestly, I’ve had worse pains. I’m not a delicate flower. Look, is this going to involve blood tests? Because if it is, I’m going to have to reschedule. I have a big job on Monday, and I can’t be wasting the whole day at a clinic. I need something quick and effective. That’s all. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright. Frequent watery stools with cramping, no fever, no vomiting, no blood in the stool. You’ve tried Pepto-Bismol and Imodium with no relief. We should rule out some common infections, just to be safe. And yes, that does involve a stool sample. And potentially some blood work. It's standard procedure. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. A stool sample. Great. What do I have to do, bring it in a jar? And blood work? Honestly. Okay, allergies… let me think. I think I had a reaction to penicillin once, a long time ago. Made me itchy. And… I don't know, maybe something else. I don't really keep track of things like that. Just… no shellfish. Definitely no shellfish. Honestly, this is a whole lot of trouble for something that’s probably just a bad bug. Can we just get this over with? I really need to get back to work. And I'm starting to feel a bit… uncomfortable again.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. No shellfish. Very well. I’ll print out the lab requisition forms for the stool sample and blood work. The lab is just down the hall. We’ll need to rule out some parasitic and bacterial infections. While we wait for the results, I recommend sticking to a bland diet - toast, rice, bananas, applesauce. And drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. I'll also write you a prescription for a mild anti-diarrheal medication. It's not a long-term solution, but it may help manage the symptoms while we figure out the cause. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Bland diet. I suppose. And a prescription. Okay, that's… something. Honestly, I just want this over with. And yes, that sounds acceptable. As long as it helps me get back to work. When will I have the results? I have deadlines, you know. And… … I really need to use the restroom again. Is this prescription something I can pick up today?
DOCTOR: The lab usually gets results back within 48-72 hours. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. The pharmacy down the street should be able to fill it today. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. Please don't hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen.
PATIENT: .
