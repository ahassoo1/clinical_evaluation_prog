DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Good morning to you too, doctor. They tellin’ me I gotta come get checked ‘cause of the… the place I work. Not feelin’ nothin’ wrong, you know? Just… they say I gotta. Old man’s business, I suppose. Been workin’ in them mines a long time. Long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. A check-up as part of your employment requirements. That’s perfectly reasonable. Even if you’re not feeling unwell, it’s good to get a baseline assessment. Okay, so you said you've been working in the mines for a long time. Could you tell me a little more about the type of work you do there?
PATIENT: Work? I operate the machines. Big ones. Loadin' and movin’ the… the stuff. Rocks, mostly. Underground. Dusty work, always dusty. Been doin’ it… oh, close to fifty years now, I reckon. Fifty years of dust and noise. Not much to tell, really. Just machines and rock. And a lot of sweat. You need to know what kind of machines? I don’t know all the fancy names.
DOCTOR: Okay, fifty years... that's a long time. Operating heavy machinery underground, a lot of dust. That is helpful. No need for fancy names, just knowing it's heavy machinery is fine. Have you noticed any changes in your breathing over that time?
PATIENT: Breathing? What kinda changes you mean? I breathe, doctor. Always have. Gets a bit harder sometimes, climbin’ stairs, you know? Old age, I figure. Not like when I was a young man, runnin’ around. But… no, nothin’ bad. Just… slower. And the dust. Always coughin’ up a bit of dust, even now. Is this place air-conditioned? It’s warm in here.
DOCTOR: Okay, slower breathing, especially with exertion, and coughing up dust. That’s good to know. And yes, it is a bit warm in here, I'll make a note to have that checked. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… what did you say? Press…sure? No, never. Always been strong as an ox, me. Heart problems neither. Bit of aches and pains, like any old man, but nothin’ the doctor ever needed to look at. Diabetes… that’s the sweet sickness, right? No, never had that either. I eat my yam and fish, good Nigerian food. Always have. Keeps a man strong. You thinkin’ I’m sick or somethin’? They just sendin’ me on a wild goose chase, I bet.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I’m just gathering information to get a complete picture of your health. It’s good you’ve been strong and eating well! Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? No, never been inside a hospital. Not for nothin’ serious, anyway. Once broke my toe kickin’ a football when I was a boy, but my mama just wrapped it up with a cloth. Good ol’ Nigerian remedies. That’s all I ever needed. No fancy surgeries for me. Waste of time and money, that is. Are we gettin’ anywhere with this? I got things to do, you know. A garden waitin' for me back home.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your time is valuable. No surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s helpful. Now, before we move on, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills, creams, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? You think I need medications? I got strong Nigerian blood, doctor! I take… maybe a little pain reliever for my joints sometimes, when it’s cold. But that’s it. Nothing fancy. Herbs? Maybe a little ginger tea for my stomach, when it’s botherin’ me. My wife used to make it. But that's just… food. Not medicine. She’s gone now, you know. Good woman, that one. Don’t write that down. Don’t need that in your… your records.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. I apologize if I touched on something sensitive. We can absolutely skip that line of questioning. I'm just trying to get a complete health history. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had no allergies. Eat anything, doctor. Yam, fish, goat… whatever’s put in front of me. Bit of pepper, maybe, but that’s just good flavorin’. No, never had no allergies. Strong Nigerian blood, remember? You startin' to understand yet? I'm a healthy man, even at my age. This whole thing is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger, and I do appreciate you telling me you feel healthy. Just to be thorough, let's do a quick physical exam, just to confirm everything. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? You gotta poke and prod now? What for? I told you, I'm fine. But… … alright. Get it over with. But don’t go stickin’ nothin’ up my nose or down my throat, alright? I don’t like that. And make it quick. I got a garden waitin'.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. Just a quick check of your heart, lungs, and a look in your ears and throat. Nothing invasive, I promise. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. It's just a simple squeeze.
PATIENT: Squeeze? Fine. But don’t squeeze too tight, alright? My bones ain't what they used to be. You youngsters and your machines... always pokin' and proddin'. Back in my day, we just felt if somethin’ was wrong. Not all this fancy stuff. Hurry up now. I'm losin' daylight.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90. Okay, that’s a little elevated, but not terribly concerning at your age. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs… Can you cough for me, please?
PATIENT: Hmph. See? Dust. Always dust. Been breathin’ dust for fifty years, doctor. What you expect? It’s the mine, alright? That’s all it is. Don't need no fancy diagnosis. Is that all you’re gonna do? You takin’ too long. I can feel my garden callin' me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear the crackling in your lungs, and it likely is related to your work in the mines. But it's important to rule out anything else. I'd like to order a chest X-ray just to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Also, given your blood pressure, I’d like to check your kidney function with a simple blood test. How does that sound?
PATIENT: X-ray?! Blood test?! You're tryin' to scare an old man now?! What for? I told you, I'm fine! It's the dust! Dust and old age! You're gonna poke and prod and stick needles in me and then tell me nothin' I didn't already know! No. Absolutely not. I ain’t gettin' no X-rays. And I ain’t givin' you my blood. It’s a waste of time and money, and it won't change nothin’. I'm leavin'. I got a garden waitin'. This whole thing is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, please, just let me explain the importance of these tests. It’s not about scaring you, it’s about being thorough and making sure nothing serious is going on. I understand you're frustrated, but these are routine precautions. We can at least start with the chest X-ray to rule out any lung problems related to your work... ...Mr. Bigger, if you’re not willing to get these tests, I strongly recommend you see a pulmonologist for a full evaluation. Given your history, it's crucial to have your lungs checked. Here's a referral. Please, think about it. Your health is the most important thing. .
