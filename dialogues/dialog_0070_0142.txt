DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning, Doc. Yeah, hi. Right, well… it’s my head. It’s been… bad. Not all the time, thankfully. Comes and goes. And when it does come… it’s pretty rough. I get really sweaty and my heart… it feels like it’s thumpin’ way too fast. I dunno, that’s the gist of it, I guess. It's been happenin’ for a while now, on and off.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Headaches with sweating and a fast heartbeat… that certainly sounds concerning, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. When you say “a while now,” could you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that’s the tricky part. It’s… fuzzy. Maybe six months? A year? It's hard to say exactly. It's not constant, like I said. There’ll be weeks where I don’t even think about it, then BAM… it hits. I’ve been divorced a couple years now, and things were pretty stressful then… maybe it started around that time? Honestly, I'm not great with dates. Everything kinda blurs together after a while.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult to pinpoint the start of something when life is busy or stressful. Six months to a year is helpful, though. And it’s good you’ve recognized a possible connection to a stressful period in your life. Now, could you describe these headaches a little more?
PATIENT: Right, yeah. Well, they’re not… like a normal headache, you know? It's not just a dull ache. It feels… intense. Like a really bad pressure, all over my head, kinda. And it feels like it’s behind my eyes, too. Sometimes it’s just on one side, sometimes both. And it gets worse if I move around too much. I usually just have to lie down in a dark room until it passes. It can last… hours, sometimes. Honestly, it scares me a bit. I get kinda worried somethin’ serious is wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern; those symptoms do sound quite disruptive and worrying. Pressure behind the eyes, worsening with movement, and lasting for hours… that’s important information. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, like I’m gonna be sick, but I haven’t actually been sick. And I get really sensitive to light, yeah. Like, even normal room light feels too bright. I also… kinda get confused when it’s happenin’. Not like… totally lost, but things just don’t seem to… click right. It’s hard to explain. It’s like my brain’s a bit foggy. Oh, and I feel really tired afterwards, wiped out for the rest of the day, even if it wasn't a long headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea, sensitivity to light, a feeling of confusion or fogginess, and significant fatigue afterward… that’s a helpful picture. It sounds like these episodes are quite debilitating. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Uh… not really, no. I mean, I broke my arm when I was a kid, playin’ football, but that’s about it. Never had anything serious, not that I remember. I went to the doctor for check-ups when I was younger, with my parents and all, but they never told me I had anything wrong. I haven't really needed to go much since then, to be honest. Just the usual colds and flu, like everyone gets. I don't take any medication regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, just the broken arm as a child and occasional colds and flu. That’s good to know. And you don’t take any regular medications. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Definitely not. I’m not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. Avoid ‘em whenever I can. Like I said, I don’t get sick often enough to warrant much doctoring.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries, that’s helpful. Let’s move on to family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family… that’s a tough one. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mum… she always complained about headaches, but just normal ones, I reckon. Nothing like what I’m gettin’. My granddad on my dad’s side… he had somethin’ with his heart, I think. But honestly, I didn’t pay much attention to all that stuff. We weren't a family that talked about illnesses much. I don't really know specifics. Sorry, I'm not much help on that front.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Lawther. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history in detail. High blood pressure and headaches in the family are good to know, though. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. I work in a factory, packin’ boxes mostly. It’s not the most glamorous job, but it pays the bills. I don't do much exercise, to be honest. Usually just walkin’ to and from work. I used to play football, but that was years ago. I drink… maybe a couple of beers on the weekend, sometimes more if I’m stressed. I don’t smoke. I try to eat alright, but it’s hard when you’re tired after work. Mostly just convenience food, I guess. And I don’t get much sleep. Workin' shifts messes with your body clock. That's about it, I reckon. Pretty boring, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, factory work with shifts, occasional alcohol consumption, and not much exercise. And you mentioned difficulties with sleep. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken paracetamol for headaches before, just the over-the-counter stuff, and that’s been fine. I’m not allergic to any food that I’m aware of, either. I wouldn’t say I have any allergies at all, actually. Nope, can’t think of anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for providing that information, Mr. Lawther. That's very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then do a neurological exam, which involves testing your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Sounds good, Doc. Whatever you need to do. I’m happy to get it checked out. Hopefully, it’s not somethin’ too serious. Let's get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, 145/90. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Pulse is 88, regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yeah, no problem. There you go. I'm followin' it. Just tell me if you want me to stop.
DOCTOR: Good. Your eye movements are normal. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? I didn't want to break anything. I'm not super strong, like I said, just factory work.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s good strength. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Both knee reflexes are present and equal. Finally, I’m going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me. Your gait appears normal. Alright, thank you. That completes the physical examination. I've documented everything. Now, based on your symptoms and the examination findings, I’m concerned about several possibilities. We need to rule out a few things. It could be tension headaches, but the sweating, nausea and feelings of confusion point towards something else. I'm particularly concerned about the possibility of migraine headaches, or something more serious, such as a neurological issue. The elevated blood pressure is also something we'll need to monitor.
PATIENT: Ugh. That doesn't sound good, does it? "Neurological issue"... that sounds scary. Migraine… I’ve never really had proper migraines, just normal headaches. Is it somethin’ serious? Do I need… scans or somethin'? I just wanna get back to normal, really. I don’t like all this talk of serious stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Lawther. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned when you hear those terms. While it’s important to consider all possibilities, it doesn’t necessarily mean it is something serious. We need to investigate further to determine the cause. You are right to ask about scans. I’d like to order a CT scan of your head, just to rule out any structural abnormalities. I'd also like to order some blood work to check for inflammation, infection, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Also, I'd like you to keep a headache diary for the next two weeks. Note down when the headaches occur, how long they last, the intensity of the pain , any accompanying symptoms, and anything that seems to trigger them. This will help us identify any patterns.
PATIENT: A scan… right. Okay. I guess if you think it’s necessary. I don't like hospitals, but… I’ll do it. A headache diary… that sounds like a lot of effort, but I’ll try. Is there anything else? Anything I need to be lookin' out for before the scan? And how long does the scan take? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you, Mr. Lawther. I understand your apprehension, and we'll make it as comfortable as possible. The CT scan itself is a quick procedure, usually taking around 15-20 minutes. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It’s painless, but you will need to remain very still. You may be asked to drink some contrast dye beforehand, which can sometimes cause a mild, metallic taste in your mouth and a warm sensation. We'll explain the process in detail before you go for the scan. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe headache, accompanied by fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness or numbness on one side of your body, or difficulty speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of something more serious that requires immediate attention. I’ll also write you a prescription for a medication to help manage the headaches while we await the scan results. It's a mild pain reliever, and we can adjust it if it’s not effective.
PATIENT: Okay. Sudden, severe headache… got it. Fever, stiff neck… I'll remember. And the medicine… that’s good. Anything to help. It’s just… it’s all a bit much, you know? Work, headaches, scans… feels like my life is fallin' apart a bit. But… I appreciate you explainin’ everything, Doc. It makes it a bit easier. What happens after the scan? Do you just… call me with the results? And how long will that take? I gotta get back to work, eventually.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Lawther. It's a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Please know that we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and help you get back to feeling like yourself. After the scan, the results will be sent to me. I typically receive them within 24-48 hours. I will then review them carefully and call you to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. Regarding work, I can write you a note for your employer explaining that you are under medical evaluation and may need time off for appointments and potential treatment. I'll also let you know the estimated duration of any potential time off once we have the scan results. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and avoid any known headache triggers. And remember, if anything changes or you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doc. Rest, stay hydrated… avoid triggers… Okay. I’ll try. Thank you. Really. You’ve been… helpful. I'll… I’ll see you after the scan, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lawther. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before the scan. We’re here for you. I’ll see you after the scan. Take care, and get some rest.
