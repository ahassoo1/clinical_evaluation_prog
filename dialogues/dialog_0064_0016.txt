DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's…Farson, yes. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors unless it's absolutely necessary, but my wife—well, she passed last year—always insisted on regular checkups. And now…I’ve been bruising. A lot. It’s probably nothing, but I’m on that blood thinner, you know, the one they give you to prevent clots. And I bump into things, naturally, I’m not as steady as I used to be, but this is…excessive.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it's good of you to be proactive about your health, especially with being on a blood thinner. Bruising easily is something we need to look into, just to be safe. You mentioned being on a blood thinner to prevent clots. Do you recall the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Warfarin, I think. Or is it…Coumadin? Honestly, they gave me a bottle and told me to take one every evening. I don’t bother remembering the names of pills, just that I need to take it. It’s a small orange pill. Does that help? And I get my blood checked regularly, like they tell me to. I have the lab slips somewhere…
DOCTOR: Warfarin and Coumadin are the same medication, Mr. Farson – the brand name is Coumadin. It's perfectly alright that you don't remember all the details, that's what we're here for. And it's excellent that you're keeping up with the regular blood checks. That's very important. Do you happen to know what they are checking for with those blood tests?
PATIENT: Something about how thick the blood is? Or…not thick enough? Honestly, the nurse just tells me to come back in a week or two, and then I get another slip. It’s all rather…inconvenient, frankly. I’m a pathologist, you know. I deal with blood all day. I don’t need to be having it drawn all the time. Though, admittedly, it’s different when it’s my blood.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand how it might be frustrating, being on the receiving end of blood draws when you spend your days analyzing it! They’re checking your INR – International Normalized Ratio – that tells us how long it takes your blood to clot, and helps us make sure the Warfarin dose is correct. Now, about the bruising. Besides bumping into things, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I feel…fine. A little tired, perhaps, but I'm 58. I bruise easily, that’s the problem. And it seems to be getting worse. A small scratch will turn into a purple mess. And sometimes…sometimes I get a nosebleed. Not huge, mind you, just a little trickle. It’s probably nothing. But it’s…concerning. My wife always said I should be more careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, increased bruising, even with minor injuries, and occasional nosebleeds. And you’ve noticed the bruising seems to be getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It wasn’t this bad a few months ago. It feels like everything is just…more fragile. I haven’t fallen or anything, just…ordinary things. Reaching for a book, bumping my arm on the doorframe. And the nosebleeds are…sporadic. Maybe once a week, maybe less. It’s hard to keep track. I should probably pay more attention, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: It's good you’re noticing these changes, Mr. Farson. And yes, it’s important to be aware of them. To get a better picture, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Oh, dear. Well, I had my appendix out when I was a boy, fairly standard. And a bout of pneumonia in my thirties, but I recovered fully. Otherwise…I've been remarkably healthy, truthfully. I’ve always been careful about what I eat, exercise regularly…well, used to exercise regularly. It’s harder now. And, of course, I had the usual childhood illnesses. Nothing serious. My wife had high blood pressure, but that’s…
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, appendix removal, pneumonia in the past, and otherwise relatively healthy. No other significant medical problems that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I mean, I get the occasional ache and pain, as anyone my age does, but nothing that required a doctor’s attention. I had a wisdom tooth removed, but that was ages ago. And…well, I had a rather nasty sunburn a few years back on a trip to the Caribbean, but that healed fine. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting your time with all this…
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Farson. It's important for me to have a complete picture of your health, and even seemingly minor details can be helpful. Now, have you had any surgeries besides your appendix removal and wisdom teeth?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries. Just those two, decades ago. And no serious illnesses, like cancer or heart problems. I've been fortunate, really. My wife wasn’t so lucky. She had…well, never mind. It’s best not to dwell on it. It’s just…this bruising is worrying me, and I thought I should get it checked out. I don’t want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history…Hmm. My father had high blood pressure, like his wife. He lived to be 78, though. My mother…she had arthritis, mostly. Nothing major. On my wife's side…her father had diabetes, and her aunt had…I think it was breast cancer. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, we weren’t a particularly sickly family. That’s why this is so…unexpected.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol? Occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner. Nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a pathologist, Doctor, not a… I maintain a respectable lifestyle. I've always been very careful about my health. That’s why this whole situation is so perplexing.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Farson. I wasn't implying anything, just gathering information. Now, do you take any other medications besides Warfarin?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just Warfarin, as far as I know. Occasionally, I take an antacid for heartburn. And sometimes, a pain reliever for a sore muscle. But those are over-the-counter, nothing prescribed. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. My wife always said I should be more natural about things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Warfarin, occasional antacids and over-the-counter pain relievers. And you mentioned allergies, do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I’m remarkably robust, usually. I pride myself on my constitution. It’s just…this bruising is really unsettling. And the nosebleeds, though minor, are new. I suppose it could be nothing, but…
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Farson, thank you for providing me with all of this information. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at the areas where you've been bruising. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Though, frankly, I’m still convinced it’s just a minor side effect of the Warfarin. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I see some bruising on your forearms, varying in color, which suggests different ages of the bruises. Are these recent injuries, or did they happen over a period of time?
PATIENT: A little of both, Doctor. Some are quite recent—I bumped into the coffee table just yesterday—and others…well, I can’t even remember how I got those. They just appeared, gradually. It’s unsettling, honestly. I’m usually very careful. And they seem to be getting bigger, even without further injury.
DOCTOR: There's some mild tenderness to palpation, but no significant swelling. Now, I'd like to check your spleen. Sometimes, an enlarged spleen can cause easy bruising. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don't feel any enlargement of the spleen. Based on the exam, I don't see any obvious signs of a serious underlying condition. However, your easy bruising and occasional nosebleeds, especially given your Warfarin use, do warrant further investigation. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your platelet count, clotting factors, and complete blood count. These tests will help us determine if your Warfarin dosage needs adjusting or if there might be another cause for the bleeding. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…sensible. I suppose it’s better to be thorough. Honestly, I was hoping it was just a minor adjustment to the medication, but… Platelet count, clotting factors…very well. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. Just…please let me know as soon as you have the results. I’d like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I'll order those tests right away, and the lab should be able to get them done quickly. You'll receive a call from the clinic within 24-48 hours with the results. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause injury, and please let us know immediately if you experience any unusual bleeding, such as blood in your stool or urine, or if you have any severe headaches or dizziness. I’m also going to send a notification to your primary care physician so they're aware of these findings. Would you like me to provide you with a written summary of our discussion and the ordered tests?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A written summary would be very helpful. I like to keep things organized, and it's good to have a record of everything. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and investigate this matter. It’s reassuring to know that you’re taking it seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. That’s what I’m here for. Here’s a summary of our discussion and the list of tests I’ve ordered. It also includes contact information for the clinic if you have any questions. I will also send a notification to your primary care physician. Please follow up with them as well. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. And thank you again for taking the time to listen to my concerns. I’ll wait for the test results and follow up accordingly. I suppose I should be going now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns or questions before your test results are available. Have a good day, and try to take it easy. We’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
