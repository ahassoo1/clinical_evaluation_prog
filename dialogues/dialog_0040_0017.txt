DOCTOR: Right, yes. Danny Bartok, 51. Okay. Well, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, well, the… the tryouts. For the… team. You know. Baseball? I gotta get checked, somethin' like that. Doctor said I needed this paper. For the… the guys. It's August, right? Seems hot.
DOCTOR: Baseball, right. Yes, well, some people actually prepare for these things. So, you need a physical for a baseball team. August it is. Hot indeed. Let’s start with this ‘something’. What exactly are you worried about?
PATIENT: Worried? I ain't worried. Just… gettin' older, you know? Knees ain't what they used to be. And maybe a little… ache in the shoulder. But nothin' a little… rub won't fix. I just need the paper. Is that… is that a problem?
DOCTOR: A little ache. Right. Well, "little aches" can be… misleading. So, this shoulder ache—when did it start?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start… Geez, that's a tough one. Sometime last year, I think? Maybe after I… helped Mr. Henderson with his roof. Heavy work. Lots of liftin'. But honestly, I don’t remember exactly. It comes and goes, you know? Not a big deal. Really. I just wanna play ball.
DOCTOR: Right. "Comes and goes." Convenient. And how would you describe this pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Well… it's like… a dull throb. When I… throw. Or lift somethin' heavy. Not sharp. Just… uncomfortable. It's not like I can't do things. I just… don't wanna pull somethin'. That’s what I’m worried about. Gettin’ old, you know? Everything takes longer to heal.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a dull ache with exertion. Have you noticed any weakness in that shoulder?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Not really. I can still… I can still do most things. I mean, I helped carry that big… the dresser, for Mrs. Rodriguez. That was heavy. But… maybe I don’t throw as far as I used to. But that's probably just… age. Is that what you wanna know? About throwin'?
DOCTOR: We’re getting somewhere, slowly. Let's try this. When you say 'most things', are there any specific movements that aggravate the pain?
PATIENT: Aggravate… you mean make it worse? Hmm. Reachin' up high, I guess. Like… puttin’ somethin’ in a cabinet. And… twistin’ it a certain way. Like… tryin’ to get somethin’ from the back seat of a car. Little things. Not big, important things. Like throwin’. I can still throw. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hand or arm?
PATIENT: Numbness? No. Tingling… maybe a little. Sometimes. In my fingers. But just for a second. Usually when I… when I’ve been workin’ with my hands a lot. Like… buildin’ things. I do a lot of… helpin’ out. I don’t think it’s a big deal. Probably just… tired.
DOCTOR: Right. Tired. Let’s just… get this over with. Alright, stand up. Let me have a look at that shoulder. Remove your shirt, please. We need to see what we’re dealing with. And don’t worry, I’ve seen it all.
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, you make it sound like I've got somethin’ awful. It's just an old shoulder. I'll just… stand here. Don't expect miracles, okay? I ain’t no young fella anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Raise your arm out to the side. Now, forward. Good. And rotate it inward… outward. Hmm. Mild tenderness to palpation of the anterior deltoid and rotator cuff. Range of motion slightly limited with external rotation. No obvious deformity. Strength is… acceptable, but noticeably weaker than the opposite side. Alright. Let’s sit down. Tell me about any previous injuries to that shoulder.
PATIENT: Previous injuries? Geez, doctor, you askin’ a lot. I probably… pulled somethin’ years ago. Playin’ baseball when I was younger. But nothin’ serious. Just a little… ache. I didn’t go to the doctor about it. You didn’t need a doctor back then. You just rubbed it, and kept goin’. I honestly can’t remember much about it. A long time ago. It probably healed. Mostly. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Right. "Mostly." Alright. Any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Uh… nothin’ much. I get a little… achy in the mornings. Knees, mostly. But that’s just… gettin’ old. I got… somethin’ with my blood pressure, I think. The doctor told me about it. But I take a little pill. Every day. That’s it. Honestly, I don't remember all the details. Old age, you know? Everything gets… foggy. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Right. Foggy. What is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… hmm. It’s a… little white pill. Small one. I think it starts with an ‘A’. Or maybe a ‘B’. Honestly, doctor, I just take the pill. My wife used to… she used to handle all that. After the… divorce, I just kept takin’ it. I don’t remember the name. It helps. That’s all I know. Is it important? For the baseball?
DOCTOR: It's always important! Look, I'm documenting this for your health. And, yes, it's relevant. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. I can eat anything. Drink anything. Never had a problem. Maybe a little… heartburn sometimes. But that’s just… from spicy food. That’s not an allergy. Honestly, I’m a pretty tough guy. Never had to worry about allergies. Never. Is that what you needed to know? About allergies? It's gettin' late, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. So, no allergies. And, you said your wife handled the medications?
PATIENT: Yes. Maria. She… she used to take care of everything. Appointments, pills, doctor visits… Everything. After… well, it's been a while. Things happen. I just… I just keep goin'. I guess that's what you do. Honestly, I don’t like talkin’ about it. It’s… it’s just… hard. Is this important for the baseball tryout? Can we just get back to that?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Look, based on what you’ve told me, and my examination, it sounds like you likely have some mild rotator cuff tendinitis, possibly aggravated by previous injury. The limited range of motion and slight weakness are concerning. And I need to know what medication you're taking for your blood pressure. Do you have a pharmacy you use?
PATIENT: Pharmacy? Uh… I think so. Down the street, maybe? The one near… the bakery? I honestly don't remember the name. I just… give them the little paper, and they give me the pills. It’s been… a long time. I guess they have my information. Would they… would they tell you? If you called? Honestly, I just want to play ball. Is this going to stop me?
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, I can’t clear you for the baseball tryout without knowing what medication you are taking. It could interact with… well, it doesn’t matter. It’s a safety issue. I'm going to write a note for your primary care physician requesting your medical records, including your medication list. You need to schedule an appointment with them to discuss this further. Until then, I advise against strenuous activity. No baseball. I'm also going to recommend a course of physical therapy to address the shoulder pain. Here’s a referral. Do you understand?
PATIENT: No baseball? Just like that? But… I’ve been practicin’. All summer. And… physical therapy? That sounds… expensive. And my doctor… I haven’t seen him in… a while. Honestly, this is a mess. I just wanted to play ball. I don’t understand. What does “interact” mean? And… you’re saying I can’t play? Is that what you’re saying?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Bartok. "Interact" means the medication you are taking could potentially cause a harmful reaction when combined with the physical stress of playing baseball. It could affect your blood pressure, your heart… it's serious. And, yes, I am saying you should not play until we have a complete understanding of your medical history and can ensure your safety. This isn’t about stopping you, it's about preventing a potential emergency. I have other patients. Please schedule an appointment with your primary care physician as soon as possible. And no strenuous activity. That includes baseball. .
