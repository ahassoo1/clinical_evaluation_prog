DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… a pleasure, I suppose. I’ve been experiencing an awful lot of thirst lately, and… well, hunger, too. More than usual. It's quite bothersome, really. I’d like to get to the bottom of it if you don’t mind, and be done with it, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Christen. I understand. Increased thirst and hunger can be quite disruptive. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think. It began… oh, perhaps three or four weeks ago? It wasn’t immediate, more of a gradual increase. At first, I just thought I was perhaps a bit more active than usual, but it hasn't lessened. It's been… consistent, to say the least. And it’s not just feeling thirsty – I am thirsty, all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over three to four weeks, consistently increasing thirst… and you said increased hunger as well?
PATIENT: Yes, the hunger is… significant. Not like a craving, just a constant feeling of needing to eat. I find myself snacking more often, and even after a proper meal, I don't feel full for very long. It’s… unsettling, to be honest. I’m not gaining weight, thankfully, but it's a worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Constant thirst and hunger, no weight gain despite increased eating… Have you noticed any other changes alongside these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. Not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. I’ve been a bit more… fatigued, perhaps? But that could just be the general state of things these days, if you understand me. Nothing particularly alarming, I don’t think. I haven’t been going to the bathroom any more or less than usual, if that’s what you were going to ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, no change in urination, some fatigue… And have you experienced any blurry vision, any unexplained weight loss, or any skin changes like increased itching or slow-healing sores?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not that I’m aware of. Weight loss, definitely not, as I said. And my skin… no, nothing different. I shave daily, so I’d notice any sores, I think. It’s just the thirst and hunger, really. It’s… rather inconvenient, if I’m honest. Is there something seriously wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's good you've noticed these details, Christen. While it's too early to say definitively, your symptoms—increased thirst, hunger, and fatigue—can sometimes be associated with a few different things, including diabetes. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. First, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I’ve always been rather… robust, health-wise. A few colds, of course, but nothing serious enough for a diagnosis, or even a proper visit to the doctor, if you understand me. My ex-wife always said I was too stubborn to admit when I was unwell. Perhaps she had a point. But no, no prior diagnoses. I’m divorced, by the way, if that’s relevant. It’s been… some years now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Christen. No prior diagnoses. And thank you for sharing about your divorce, it’s not directly relevant to your current symptoms, but it's good to have a complete picture. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid needing any surgeries. Always considered myself quite… careful, you see. I wouldn’t willingly go under the knife if it could be avoided. Just a bit of wisdom from an old Scotsman, if you don’t mind me saying. It’s been… a relatively uneventful life, health-wise. Until this, of course. Is this a common ailment, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Christen. No surgeries. As for whether it's common… increased thirst and hunger are symptoms that can occur with a variety of conditions, so it's not necessarily unusual to experience them. However, because they can be associated with conditions like diabetes, it’s important to investigate. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, God rest her soul, had… well, she suffered from a bit of everything, if I’m honest. High blood pressure, I believe, and some arthritis in her later years. My father was… remarkably healthy, actually. Lived to be eighty-five, and still gardening until the very end. No diabetes that I’m aware of, though. My sister, she’s… well, she lives in Canada now, and we don’t speak often. I don’t know anything about her health, if that’s relevant. It’s a bit of a fractured family, you see. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Christen. That's helpful. High blood pressure and arthritis in your mother, good health in your father, and limited information about your sister. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I work as a shipping and receiving clerk, so it’s quite active, lifting boxes and so on. I don’t smoke, and I drink… perhaps a single glass of whisky on a Friday evening. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I try to eat a balanced diet, though admittedly, I’ve been snacking more lately, as we discussed. I don’t do much exercise, per se, but the job keeps me moving. I live alone now, so I cook for myself, mostly simple meals. It’s… a rather solitary existence, if I’m honest. But I keep myself busy. Is there something specific you’re looking for, Doctor? I’m rather keen to get this sorted, if you don’t mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Christen. That's very helpful. No smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, active job, mostly balanced diet. Now, one final question regarding your medical history: Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times over the years for various ailments, and never had any issues. I'm quite… resilient, if I may say so myself. I suppose that's the Scottish blood, if you believe in that sort of thing. Can we get to the bottom of this now, Doctor? I’m rather eager to know what’s going on. This thirst is becoming… quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, Christen. Thank you for providing all of that information. Based on what you've told me, your symptoms of increased thirst and hunger, along with your normal medical history, raise a suspicion of diabetes. However, it's important to confirm this with some tests. I'd like to order a blood glucose test and a complete metabolic panel. These tests will help us determine your blood sugar levels and assess your overall kidney and liver function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you recommend, then certainly. I’d like to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Blood tests… alright. Where do we go from here? And how long will it take to get the results? I have… commitments, you see. And I’d like to know what to expect, if you don’t mind. It’s just… I’d rather not be kept in the dark, if you understand me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Christen. I understand. We’ll get this sorted as efficiently as possible. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood tests, and you can go to the lab just down the hall. They're open until 5 PM today. The results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or severe symptoms—like blurred vision, confusion, or excessive fatigue—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the blood tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything quite clearly. Blood tests… alright. Down the hall, you say? And 24 to 48 hours. I can manage that. I appreciate your… efficiency, Doctor. It’s a relief to finally be doing something about this. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Thank you. I suppose I’ll just head down the hall then. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Christen. That's good. I’ll see you in a few days. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then.
