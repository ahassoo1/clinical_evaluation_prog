DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bulaong. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Um… my chest hurts. Not all the time, but… yeah. It’s my chest. Feels kinda… sore, you know? Like, not a bad pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomfortable chest soreness. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s… mostly on this side. <points to left chest> Not like, sharp pain. More like… dull ache. It started, I think, maybe a week ago? Not sure exactly. Sometimes it feels worse before… before my wife and I… you know… sleep. But not always.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a dull ache on the left side of your chest for about a week, sometimes worse before you go to sleep. Does anything specifically make it worse – like exercise, deep breathing, or eating?
PATIENT: Hmm… exercise, no. I do roofing, it’s hard work, and it doesn't really make it worse. Deep breathing… I haven't really tried that. Eating… no, I don't think so. It just… is there sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a pain that starts when I do something. It's just… there. <shrugs>
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not related to exertion or eating. And it’s not a sharp, sudden pain. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not really. I… I haven’t noticed anything else. No fever, no… coughing. Nothing like that. Just the… sore chest. My wife asked if I felt a lump, but I didn’t feel anything. I asked her to check, and she didn’t feel anything either. <pauses> Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. No fever, no cough, no palpable lump. Alright. Let’s get some more information. Do you have any history of medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart trouble?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I… I haven't really been sick much. Just… little colds sometimes. My wife is always telling me to go to the doctor, but I usually just… wait it out. <chuckles nervously> She worries a lot. I don’t have any problems, really. I work hard, eat okay, and… that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never. Never been in the hospital. Not even for a broken bone. Just… bumps and bruises from work sometimes. My wife puts bandages on them. <smiles slightly> She's very good at taking care of me, even when I don't want her to.
DOCTOR: Alright. What about your family – do any of your close relatives have heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. She's… she's not with us anymore. My father… he was okay, I think. He worked on a farm. Never got sick much. My wife’s side… her grandfather had something with his heart, maybe? I don’t really know much about it. It was a long time ago. <pauses> Sorry, I’m not very good with remembering things like that. It was a long time ago, and we don't talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension in your mother and potentially some heart trouble in your wife’s grandfather. And you said you work as a roofer?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Roofer. It’s hard work, but I like it. Keeps me busy. It’s… it’s mostly lifting and walking on roofs. Sometimes it’s hot, sometimes it’s cold. But… mostly just hard work. <looks down at hands> I’ve been doing it for… almost fifteen years now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. No smoking. No drinking. And definitely no… those other things. My wife would kill me if I did. <chuckles> She's very strict about that. I don’t need any of those things. I just… work. And sleep. And try to make my wife happy. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just… water. And sometimes coffee when I’m really tired. My wife tells me to drink more water, so I try to. But… no pills, no vitamins, nothing like that. Just… plain old water. <smiles weakly> I’m pretty simple, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your blood pressure and feel around your chest a bit. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. <adjusts position slightly> Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. I’m not good with… being poked and prodded. But I’ll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 142/88. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Palpation of your chest wall does not reveal any obvious tenderness or masses. I did note some muscle tightness in your upper back and chest on the left side. It's not significant, but it could be contributing to your discomfort. <pauses> Have you experienced any recent injury or strain to your back or chest?
PATIENT: No, sir. No injury. Nothing like that. I lift heavy things all the time, like… shingles and wood. But I haven't… dropped anything or fallen or anything. Maybe… maybe I just slept wrong? Or maybe it's from lifting. I don't know. <rubs upper back> It just feels… tight. Like a knot. But not a bad knot. Just… uncomfortable. It’s hard to explain, Doctor. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon to experience muscle tightness with physical labor. Given your description and the exam findings, it’s possible this is a musculoskeletal issue – strain or tension in the chest wall muscles. However, because you're experiencing chest discomfort, it's important to rule out any cardiac causes. I'd like to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm and a chest X-ray to make sure there's nothing else going on. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, sir. No allergies. Not to pills, not to anything. My wife always checks, because she worries. She says I’m allergic to everything, just in case. But… no, I don’t have any allergies. EKG and… X-ray? Is that… will that hurt? <looks concerned> I don’t like being poked and prodded, you see. And I don't like being around… machines.
DOCTOR: The EKG is completely painless, Mr. Bulaong. It just involves placing some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. The X-ray doesn't involve any poking or prodding, and the radiation exposure is very low – comparable to a few days of natural background radiation. It's a quick scan, and it will give us a better picture of what's going on in your chest. Would you like me to explain the procedure in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… stickers and a quick scan. No poking. That sounds… better. My wife always says I worry too much. But… it's my chest, you see. I need to know it’s okay. <takes a deep breath> Yes, please. Explain it a little more. What will the stickers do? And what will the scan show? Just… tell me everything, Doctor. The more I know, the less I worry. And… how long will it take?
DOCTOR: Alright. The stickers, called electrodes, are connected to a machine that records the electrical activity of your heart. It's like listening to your heart's rhythm, but instead of using a stethoscope, we use these stickers to detect the signals. The machine will print out a graph showing your heart rate and rhythm. It doesn't hurt at all – you won't feel anything. The chest X-ray is similar. You'll stand in front of a machine that takes a picture of your lungs and heart. It’s a quick scan - only a few seconds. It helps us look for any problems in your lungs, like pneumonia or fluid buildup, and it also gives us a view of the size and shape of your heart. It doesn’t hurt either, but you’ll need to hold very still for a few moments. Both procedures should take about 15-20 minutes in total. After we get the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Stickers and a picture. No pain. Fifteen minutes. That sounds… okay. I can do that. My wife will be happy to hear that it doesn't hurt. She worries so much. <smiles weakly> Okay. Let’s do it. Where do we go? And… who will do the stickers and the picture? Will it be you, Doctor? I trust you, you see. I just… don’t like strangers touching me. <looks anxious>
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll head just down the hall to the radiology department. A technician will perform the EKG and chest X-ray. I’ll be reviewing the results myself, so I’ll be the one interpreting them. The technician is very skilled and professional, and they’ll explain everything to you before they start. They'll be wearing a uniform, so they are easy to identify. It's a standard procedure, Mr. Bulaong. I'll wait here while you get it done, then we can discuss the results when you return. Do you have any questions before we head over?
PATIENT: No, sir. I think I understand. Stickers, picture, technician… you will look at the results. <takes another deep breath> Okay. Let’s go. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. And… I hope everything is okay. <looks worried> Lead the way, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's go. It won't take long, Mr. Bulaong. I assure you. I’ll be right here when you get back. I’ll also have the nurse come in to check on you while you’re waiting for the results. Please don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you’re feeling any discomfort or have any questions at all. <pauses at the door of the radiology department> Here we are. I’ll be waiting for you.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. <hesitates at the doorway, looking apprehensive> I’ll… I’ll see you soon. <enters the radiology department, looking around nervously>
DOCTOR: .
