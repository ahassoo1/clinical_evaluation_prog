DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Giganti, is it? Yes, well, it’s not really a problem, you understand. More… a formality. My daughter, she says I need a note. A “get well” card, she called it. From you. Honestly, the things young people think of. It’s just… she worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of your daughter to be so attentive to your health. Even if it feels like a formality, it’s always wise to check things out. To be thorough, and just to be sure everything is as it should be, would you mind telling me a little more about why your daughter suggested you come in?
PATIENT: Oh, it was just a little… tiredness, I suppose. Nothing serious! I’ve been feeling a bit… not quite myself, these past few weeks. But I’m a very strong woman, Doctor. I work every day. Assembly work, you know? Very precise. It takes a lot out of you, but I manage. She just thinks I should “rest.” Rest! As if that’s going to solve anything. Honestly, young people these days… they think a little nap can fix everything. It’s just… she saw me yawn a few times. And I might have mentioned feeling a little… off. But I’m fine, really. Perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a bit of fatigue, feeling generally “off,” and your daughter noticed you yawning. You mentioned it's been going on for a few weeks. Has this tiredness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, definitely. Some days I feel quite alright, actually. I can work a full shift, no problem. Other days… well, I just feel a bit… heavy, you know? Like I’m wading through water. It’s not painful, not at all. Just… draining. And it's not like I'm doing anything different, Doctor. Same routine for years. Work, home, a little bit of cooking… it's just… age, I suppose. Things start to slow down, don't they? It’s nothing you need to worry about, honestly. It's just… she's making a big fuss over nothing. She wants a note so I'll take it easy. Ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it sounds like the fatigue is intermittent, and you've noticed it doesn't impact your ability to work every day. You also feel a sense of heaviness sometimes. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and heaviness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… well, my appetite hasn’t been quite the same, I suppose. Not that I’m not eating, just… not as much. And I’ve been sleeping alright, thank goodness. Never had trouble with sleep. But I have been a little… forgetful lately. Not anything major, you understand. Just… misplacing things. Like my glasses, or where I put the remote. Little things. Old age, I tell you! It’s the only explanation. My daughter keeps asking if I’m “stressed”, but stressed about what? I have a simple life. It’s just… things slip your mind, don't they? Especially when you're busy. And I am very, very busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite and some forgetfulness along with the tiredness and heaviness. And you haven’t noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing else. I feel… well, I feel like myself, mostly. A little tired sometimes, a little forgetful, but who isn’t at my age? Honestly, Doctor, I think my daughter is just overreacting. She watches too much television, all those medical dramas. She thinks I'm on the verge of collapse! It’s quite embarrassing, really. I just want a note so she’ll stop fussing. Is that so much to ask? Can we just… get the note, please? I have work to get back to. It's important, you know? Not like sitting around worrying about… nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Micucci, and I appreciate you being so candid with me. Of course, we can certainly address your daughter’s concerns with a note. However, even if it feels like "nothing," it's important for me to do a quick examination just to rule out any underlying issues, especially with the change in appetite and some forgetfulness. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, really, Doctor? Must we? I told you, I'm perfectly fine. But… alright. If it will just get my daughter off my back, I suppose I can endure a few minutes of poking and prodding. But don’t expect any exciting discoveries. I assure you, I'm a very healthy woman for my age. Just… get it over with quickly, please. I have things to do. Assembly work doesn't do itself, you know. And the foreman… well, he’s not known for his patience.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Micucci. I’ll be as quick as possible. First, let’s just listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please sit back and take some deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Deep breaths… Honestly, all this fuss over a little tiredness. My grandmother worked until she was ninety, you know. Ninety! And she never had a doctor’s appointment in her life. But… fine. inhales deeply, then exhales slowly Is that deep enough? I'm not very good at this sort of thing. I prefer doing things, not sitting around letting people listen to my insides. exhales again, a little more forcefully. Hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, could I just take your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… oh, dear. I always get nervous when they take my blood pressure. It always goes up. It’s the anticipation, you know? And the cuff… it’s so tight! But… alright. Just get it over with. But don’t be surprised if it’s a little high. I told you, I get nervous. I tense up slightly as you prepare the blood pressure cuff. And be gentle, please. My arms are sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm for me. I'll only need a moment. I take her blood pressure, carefully noting the reading. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/90. That’s not drastically high, but it’s something we should be aware of. Now, could I just check your pulse?
PATIENT: 142/90? See! I told you! It’s the nerves, Doctor, completely the nerves. I get anxious at the doctor’s office, always have. It’s the smell, the white coat… it's all very unsettling. I tap my foot impatiently. Just get it over with. Check my pulse, whatever. I hold my arm out stiffly. And don’t tell me it’s something serious, please. I haven’t got time for serious. I have work to do. Assembly work, you know. It's very demanding.
DOCTOR: Your pulse is 78, which is normal. Now, just one more quick thing. Could I take a look at your throat?
PATIENT: My throat? I frown, tilting my head. What for? I don’t have a sore throat. I haven’t been sick in years. Honestly, Doctor, you’re going to find nothing. It’s a waste of time. I open my mouth reluctantly, peering at you over my glasses. But… alright. Get it over with. Just… be quick, please. And don't poke around too much. I wince slightly. I don't like having things shoved down my throat. It's very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, your throat looks clear. No redness or swelling. Everything seems alright there. Now, Ms. Micucci, based on what you've told me, and the quick examination, it does sound like you're generally healthy. The tiredness and forgetfulness could be related to stress, changes in routine, or just normal aging. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor. I can certainly write a note for your daughter stating that you've been evaluated and are doing well, and recommend getting some extra rest. But I also strongly recommend that you schedule a follow-up appointment with me, or perhaps your primary care physician, to discuss your blood pressure and get some strategies to manage it. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, finally. A note. That’s all I wanted. And a follow-up appointment? Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. My blood pressure is probably just high because I was nervous here! I cross my arms tightly. Fine. Write the note. That's what I came for. And… no, I don’t want a follow-up appointment. I haven't got time for appointments. I have work. I tap my foot impatiently. Just get the note done so I can leave. And please, make it sound convincing. My daughter is very… thorough. I adjust my glasses and glare at you expectantly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Micucci. I'll write a note stating that you've been evaluated today, and that you are generally well, but recommend routine check-ups with your primary care physician to monitor your blood pressure. Here you go. I print the note and hand it to her. I strongly advise you to reconsider the follow-up appointment, but I respect your decision. Please, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as severe fatigue, dizziness, or headaches, please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Hmm… “routine check-ups”… that’s acceptable. As long as it doesn’t sound too alarming. I fold the note carefully and tuck it into my purse. No, I don’t have any questions. I told you, I'm fine. Perfectly fine. I stand up stiffly, smoothing my clothes. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I offer a curt nod. And try not to worry so much about people who are perfectly healthy. It’s a waste of everyone’s time. I turn to leave, then pause at the door. Oh, and one more thing… Tell your staff to smile more. It’s very unsettling being greeted by so many serious faces. I exit the office without waiting for a response. .
