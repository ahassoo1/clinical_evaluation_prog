DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about my bruising. It’s… more than usual, I suppose. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, ever since… well, never you mind. But lately, a little bump will turn into a purple mess. It's just… concerning.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. It’s certainly wise to investigate any changes in bleeding, especially when you’re taking a blood thinner. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s not like I’m walking into walls or anything. Just… everyday things. Knocking my arm on the furniture, that sort of thing. And it seems to last longer than it used to. I'm a fairly careful man, Doctor. I really am. This isn’t some clumsy accident waiting to happen.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that, Mr. Farson. It’s helpful to know you haven’t experienced any recent trauma or changes in your activity level. When you say it lasts longer than it used to, could you give me a rough estimate of how long a typical bruise now takes to fade, compared to before?
PATIENT: Well, before... a week, maybe? Now? It feels like… two weeks, easy. And they’re bigger, too. Not enormous, mind you, but… noticeable. My housekeeper keeps giving me these looks. Like I'm falling apart. Honestly, it's embarrassing. And quite frankly, I don't appreciate the implication. I take very good care of myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. It sounds quite bothersome, and I assure you, we'll get to the bottom of this. To help me build a more complete picture, let's go through a quick review of your medical history, if that's alright. I see in your chart you’re currently on a blood thinner… could you remind me which one it is, and for what condition you’re taking it?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Must we? It was… Warfarin, I think. Or maybe Coumadin? They all sound the same to me. It was for… atrial fibrillation. Something to do with the heart. Doctor Ramirez put me on it. Good man, Ramirez. But he retired, you know. And frankly, I'm tired of explaining my life story to every new physician. It's all in the records, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mr. Farson; it should be in the records. My apologies for asking you to repeat information that’s already documented. I’m just trying to ensure I have a complete understanding before proceeding. I see here that you've been on Warfarin for atrial fibrillation for approximately five years. Have you had any issues with it previously – any bleeding episodes or needing adjustments to your dosage?
PATIENT: Well, there was that time I cut myself shaving. Nothing major, a little nick. But it bled for a while, naturally. They adjusted the dosage then, I believe. And… oh, yes. A nosebleed. But those things happen, don't they? It wasn’t because of the Warfarin, I'm quite sure. I have sensitive sinuses, you know. Always have. It's the humidity here, I suspect. Dreadful humidity.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Farson. It's helpful to have those details. So, a slightly prolonged bleeding time after a minor cut and a nosebleed. Have you noticed any other unusual bleeding – for example, bleeding gums when brushing your teeth, blood in your stool or urine, or any unexplained bruising anywhere else besides the arms?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I’m not some sort of… walking hemorrhage! No, everything else is perfectly normal. I take pride in my hygiene, Doctor. And I assure you, I’m quite aware of my own body. Just the arms, recently. And it’s frankly disturbing. This isn't like me at all. I've always been a robust, healthy man, despite my age.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you assuring me, Mr. Farson. It sounds like you're very attuned to your body, and I understand your concern about this change. Now, let’s briefly review your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Besides the atrial fibrillation, do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, really? Must we dredge everything up? Well… I had my prostate checked a few years back. Benign, thankfully. And… a touch of high blood pressure, years ago. They put me on a pill for it, but I managed to get it under control with diet and exercise. Honestly, I don't like being medicated if I can avoid it. I’m a firm believer in natural remedies. Though, clearly, the Warfarin is… necessary. But everything else? I’m remarkably healthy for my age, Doctor. Truly.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for minimizing medication, Mr. Farson, and I appreciate you sharing that. It’s good to know you’ve been able to manage your blood pressure effectively with lifestyle changes. And thank you for letting me know about the prostate check – good to hear it was benign. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. There was my tonsils, when I was a boy. Ages ago. And… a hernia repair, many years later. Nothing recently, though. Absolutely nothing recently. I’ve been fortunate, really. No major medical interventions. I avoid hospitals if I can. Dreadful places, hospitals. Full of… germs. And inefficiency. Honestly, they don't care about you, you know. They just see you as a number.
DOCTOR: I understand your aversion to hospitals, Mr. Farson. Many people share that sentiment. Knowing you've had your tonsils removed and a hernia repair is helpful. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Must we? Honestly, Doctor, my family history is… unremarkable. My father lived to be eighty-five, I think. Heart trouble, eventually. My mother… she had arthritis, I believe. And… a sister had high blood pressure, perhaps. It’s all very… blurry, frankly. They weren’t ones for discussing their ailments. It was considered… unseemly, you know. Bad luck to dwell on such things. So, unremarkable. A lot of vague complaints and early deaths, if I recall correctly. Nothing specific.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Farson. That's helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Do I look like the sort? I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol? Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. A very small glass. And recreational drugs? The very thought! I am a man of… refinement, Doctor. I believe in moderation. And good health. This is a preposterous line of questioning, frankly. A bit insulting, actually. I’ve always led a very… respectable life.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mr. Farson. I assure you, I don't intend to cause offense. I ask these questions as a matter of routine to get a complete picture of your health. It sounds as though you maintain a very healthy lifestyle. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Besides the Warfarin, are you taking any other prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the Warfarin, Doctor. I told you. And… occasionally, an antacid. For heartburn. But that’s it. I prefer to treat most things naturally, you know. Ginger tea, for example. Very good for digestion. And I take a multivitamin, occasionally. A basic one. Nothing fancy. I don’t believe in flooding my system with unnecessary chemicals. Honestly, I’m very careful about what I put into my body. I have to be. At my age.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Farson. So, Warfarin, occasional antacids, and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none whatsoever. I’m remarkably resilient, you know. Never had an allergic reaction in my life. I’ve always been a very… robust individual. No allergies. Absolutely none. I’ve eaten everything, traveled everywhere. No problems. Truly. It’s rather… annoying, actually. Everyone around me is constantly sneezing and wheezing, and I’m perfectly fine. It’s… infuriating. But no allergies. None.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, and then I'd like to examine your arms where you've been experiencing the bruising. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. Though I must warn you, my blood pressure is probably elevated simply from this… interrogation. All these questions! Honestly, it’s enough to give anyone a headache. But yes, examine away. But be gentle, Doctor. I have sensitive skin. And I assure you, this bruising is far more extensive than it appears. You’ll see. A dreadful mess. Absolutely dreadful. Proceed, but be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 148/92. That's likely due to some anxiety about being here, as you suspected. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, let’s take a look at your arms. Please extend them for me. I see bruising on both forearms, primarily on the outer aspects. The bruises vary in size, the largest one being approximately 5 centimeters in diameter. The color ranges from reddish-purple to a darker, bluish hue, indicating varying ages of the bruises. The skin feels normal to the touch, and there’s no swelling or tenderness to palpation. I don't notice any signs of underlying muscle damage. Are these the areas you've been most concerned about?
PATIENT: Yes, those are the worst of it. Though they’re constantly appearing in new places, you know. It's quite alarming. And they hurt, Doctor. Not terribly, but… a dull ache. And they never seem to fully disappear. A faint discoloration always remains. Honestly, it makes me look like I’ve been in a fight! A dreadful appearance. And my housekeeper… well, she doesn’t say anything, but I can see the judgment in her eyes. A dreadful situation, all around. Are you sure there isn’t something seriously wrong? Something beyond just… old age?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Farson. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. While some bruising is expected with Warfarin, the extent and persistence you describe warrants further investigation. The fact that the pain is ongoing, even if mild, and the discoloration remains after a significant amount of time is also concerning. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count to evaluate your platelet count and red blood cell levels, a Prothrombin Time and International Normalized Ratio to assess your Warfarin dosage, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to rule out any underlying liver or kidney issues. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests? Honestly, Doctor, must we? All this poking and prodding! I was hoping for a simple explanation, perhaps a minor adjustment to the dosage. But tests… it sounds rather serious, doesn't it? Liver? Kidneys? I’ve always been a very healthy man, you know. A robust constitution. But… if you think it’s necessary… fine. But please, be quick about it. And tell me, what exactly are you looking for? Don’t just say “rule out.” I want specifics. I’m a man who likes to be informed, Doctor. Thoroughly informed.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Farson, and I apologize for any anxiety this is causing. I assure you, I’m not trying to alarm you. However, it's always best to be thorough, especially when evaluating unexplained bleeding. The Complete Blood Count will check the number of platelets in your blood. Platelets are crucial for clotting, and a low platelet count can cause easy bruising and bleeding. The PT/INR test measures how long it takes your blood to clot. Warfarin works by slowing down clotting, and we need to ensure your dosage is within the therapeutic range. If the INR is too high, it could increase your risk of bleeding. The Comprehensive Metabolic Panel checks the function of your liver and kidneys, as these organs play a vital role in blood clotting and medication metabolism. If there’s an issue with either organ, it could affect your clotting ability. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help me determine the best course of action. It is a standard procedure, Mr. Farson. And I assure you, we’ll discuss the results thoroughly as soon as they’re available. Does that alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Well… that’s… slightly better. Slightly. Explaining it, rather than just saying “rule out,” is… appreciated. I still maintain this is unnecessary, but… if you insist. Just promise me you won't keep me waiting for days on end. I have a life, you know. And I abhor waiting rooms. A dreadful experience, those waiting rooms. Germs everywhere. And the magazines are always hopelessly outdated. Very well, Doctor. Proceed with your tests. But be quick about it. And I expect a full explanation of the results, in plain English, not some sort of medical jargon I can’t understand. Do you understand? Plain English.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Farson. Plain English, absolutely. I will ensure you receive a clear and concise explanation of the results, avoiding any unnecessary medical jargon. We’ll discuss everything thoroughly, and I won’t keep you waiting longer than necessary. The lab work should be processed within 48-72 hours, and my office will contact you as soon as the results are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could cause injury. If you experience any significant bleeding – such as nosebleeds that won’t stop, blood in your urine or stool, or unusually heavy bruising – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve sufficiently interrogated me for the time being. Just… do the tests. And get back to me quickly. And remember, plain English. I’m trusting you with my health, you know. A dreadful responsibility. Honestly, all this fuss over a few bruises. It’s quite… unsettling. Very well. I shall await your call. And try not to keep me waiting.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Farson. I assure you, I’ll do my best. My office will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and please be careful.
