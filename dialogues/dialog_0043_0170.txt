DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. I’m here for a life insurance thing. They need me to get a medical exam, that’s all. Just wanna get it over with, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. A life insurance physical is quite straightforward. We’ll go through a standard examination and complete the necessary paperwork for your insurance company. I see here you’re 49 years old. Do you have any particular concerns about your health that we should discuss while we're at it, or is this solely for the insurance requirements?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I get tired easier than I used to, but I figure that’s just getting older. Divorced and working…it’s a lot, you know? Mostly just wanna make sure everything’s okay for the insurance. Don’t wanna slow things down with a bunch of extra tests if I don’t need ‘em.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Putney. It's sensible to be mindful of time and unnecessary procedures. We’ll certainly proceed with the essentials for the life insurance exam first, and if anything arises that warrants further investigation, we can discuss it then. The fatigue is worth noting, though. Could you describe it a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like…sick tired. More just…at the end of the day, I’m done. Like I’ve been running all day, even if I just sat at my desk. And sometimes, in the afternoons, I just feel…blah. Hard to explain. It's been going on for…a while now, I guess. Maybe a year or so?
DOCTOR: Okay, "done" at the end of the day, even with a relatively sedentary workday, and an afternoon feeling of “blah” for about a year. That's helpful, Mr. Putney. Is this fatigue interfering with your daily activities – work, hobbies, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Not really interfering, no. I still get everything done. It just…takes more effort. And I don’t feel like doing much after work. Mostly just watch TV. I used to go fishing a lot more, but…haven’t been in a while. But I wouldn’t say it’s stopping me from doing things, just…less enthusiastic, I guess.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's more a decrease in motivation and energy levels rather than a physical inability to do things. That’s useful information. Alright, let's start with a basic physical exam. I’ll check your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate – and then listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sounds good. Just get it done, please. The quicker the better. I got things to do later.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I appreciate your patience. Blood pressure is a bit elevated at 142 over 90. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Pulse is 78 and regular, temperature is normal at 98.6, and respiratory rate is 16. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Now, let me just palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Nope, doesn't hurt when you push. Everything feels...normal, I guess. Like I said, I don't really feel sick. Just tired.
DOCTOR: Good. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and neurological function appears intact. Now, could you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Sure. There. Hope that's not too bad. I’ve been stress-eating lately, I think.
DOCTOR: 198 pounds. And I see here in your chart you're listed as being 5’8”. That puts your BMI at approximately 32. That falls into the obese category, Mr. Putney, which can contribute to several health concerns. It sounds like you're aware of some weight gain, and that's a good first step. Before we finish the physical, let's just check your thyroid. It can sometimes cause fatigue. Thyroid feels normal, no nodules detected. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I take a little bit of something for my blood pressure sometimes, but that's it. The doctor a while back said I should watch it. Nothing else. Just the tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and you take medication for your blood pressure as needed. And the primary complaint remains the fatigue. Let’s talk about that blood pressure medication. What’s the name of it, and how often do you take it?
PATIENT: Uh… honestly, I don’t remember the name. The doctor just gave me a little white pill. I take it when I feel dizzy or my head’s pounding. Not every day, maybe a couple of times a week? It’s been a while since I’ve needed it, actually. It’s in a bottle somewhere, I just haven’t looked at it in months.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon to forget medication details, especially if it's not a daily routine. Given your fatigue, elevated blood pressure, and the fact that you're taking medication for your blood pressure, I think it would be prudent to order some blood work. This will help us assess your overall health, check your thyroid function more thoroughly, and rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds…okay. If it’ll help get this done quicker, then sure. I just wanna know if I’m gonna be okay. What kind of blood work? Is it gonna take long? I got stuff to do, remember?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Mr. Putney. It’s a standard complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test – TSH. It should give us a good overview of your health. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes, and the results should be available in about 3-5 business days. While we wait for the results, I recommend trying to incorporate some regular, moderate exercise into your routine – even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a difference. Also, focusing on a healthy diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Now, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just get the blood work done, and hopefully it’s nothing serious. Where do I go to get that done? And can I get a copy of the results for myself? I like to keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I'll write you a lab order for Quest Diagnostics – there’s a location right here in town. They'll take care of the blood draw. And absolutely, you have every right to a copy of your results. Once they're available, we can either mail them to you or you can access them through our patient portal online. Do you have any questions about accessing the portal?
