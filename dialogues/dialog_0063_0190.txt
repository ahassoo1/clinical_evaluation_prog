DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. I have limited time, so if you could be concise, that would be appreciated.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling quite unsteady on my feet lately. Like I might fall. It’s been happening for… some time, now. I don’t recall exactly when it started, truthfully. It just… is.
DOCTOR: “Some time?
PATIENT: Yes. I apologize for the vagueness. It feels like… months, perhaps? Possibly longer. It’s hard to place. My husband… he always kept track of things. After… well, after he passed, dates just… blurred. It’s not a deliberate attempt to be unclear, Doctor. I assure you. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Right. Months, you say. And this unsteadiness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I believe. Though, lately, it’s been… more frequent. There are times when I feel perfectly normal, walking around just fine. And then, without warning, it’s like the floor is… shifting. Or I’m losing my balance. It’s quite frightening, actually. I work with… heavy machinery, you see. It’s not ideal to be unsteady in that environment.
DOCTOR: Heavy machinery, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I operate a rotary drill for an oil and gas company. It requires… a great deal of focus and stability. It’s… a physically demanding job, generally. Though, I've been doing it for quite some time, so I should be accustomed to the demands. It’s just… this new unsteadiness is worrying. I’m concerned it might… interfere with my work, or worse. I’ve been very careful, but one can only be so cautious, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you've been operating this… drill for some time. And this instability developed recently while continuing this work. Have you experienced any falls?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no actual falls. I’ve managed to catch myself each time. Though, there was one instance… perhaps a week ago? I stumbled quite badly, nearly collided with some equipment. A colleague had to steady me. It was… embarrassing, and concerning. That’s when I decided I really ought to come and see someone. Before something… serious happens. It’s just… a wobble, really. A significant wobble, but… not a fall.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I haven’t noticed anything… drastic. Perhaps a little… dizziness, occasionally. But nothing consistent, and it’s easily dismissed. Sometimes I feel a bit… fatigued, but that could simply be from the job, you understand. Long hours, strenuous work… It’s difficult to separate what’s normal and what isn’t, truthfully. I don't believe so, no. Nothing obvious, at least.
DOCTOR: Right. Fatigue, occasional dizziness. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… Now that you mention it… yes, perhaps. It’s subtle, but I’ve noticed things seem… a bit blurry sometimes. Especially at night. I attributed it to… age, mostly. Or perhaps the long hours staring at machinery. I hadn't considered it might be related to the unsteadiness. It's not a constant blur, Doctor, just… occasional. And more noticeable when I’m tired, I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I need to assess your balance and neurological function. Please stand up slowly when I ask you to.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Please, just let me know when you’re ready. I hope it won’t be too… disruptive. I am a bit unsteady, as you know.
DOCTOR: Right. First, I'd like you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Try to maintain your balance for as long as possible. I will be observing.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’m standing with my eyes closed. It’s… a bit precarious, to be honest. But I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: Hmm. As expected. Noticeable sway. Now, please walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for ten steps.
PATIENT: There. Ten steps, Doctor. As you can see… it wasn’t entirely smooth. It required… considerable focus. I wouldn’t recommend operating heavy machinery in this state.
DOCTOR: Yes, unsteady gait. Now, sit back down, please. I will assess your reflexes.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed as you wish. I’ll remain still. Please, let me know if you require anything from me. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… diminished, but present. Now, I need to briefly check your eyes. Please follow my finger with your gaze, without moving your head.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’m following your finger as instructed. Is everything alright? It feels… a bit strange, having my eyes examined so closely.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal and reactive to light, but I do detect a slight nystagmus. Now, I need to access your EHR to review any prior medical history. One moment.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Take your time. I understand you need to review my records. I simply hope we can determine the cause of this issue soon. It’s… rather disruptive to my work, and quite frightening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your records are…sparse. Limited information regarding prior neurological assessments. No significant findings. However, there is a notation of a recent upper respiratory infection, about six weeks ago. Given your symptoms – the unsteadiness, occasional dizziness, blurry vision, and the recent infection – a likely, though not definitive, diagnosis is Vestibular Neuritis.
PATIENT: Vestibular Neuritis… is that… serious, Doctor? And is it related to the infection? I do recall being quite ill, about six weeks ago. A bad cold, with a persistent cough. Is it… treatable? And what does this mean for my work? I operate heavy machinery, you see…
DOCTOR: It’s an inflammation of the inner ear, often following a viral infection – like the cold you mentioned. It disrupts your balance. It’s rarely serious, in the sense that it’s not life-threatening, but it is debilitating. Treatment involves symptomatic management – anti-nausea medication to control dizziness, and vestibular rehabilitation exercises to improve balance. As for your work… operating heavy machinery while experiencing these symptoms is highly inadvisable. I will prescribe you Meclizine for the nausea. I also recommend a referral to a physical therapist specializing in vestibular rehabilitation. You should not return to work until you have completed a course of therapy and your balance has significantly improved. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. No work until my balance improves. And medication for the nausea. Vestibular rehabilitation… I’ll need to schedule an appointment with a physical therapist, then. Is there anyone you recommend? And how long… how long might this take to resolve? I have… financial obligations, you see. I need to return to work eventually.
DOCTOR: I will provide you with a list of physical therapists in the area. As for the timeline… it varies. Some patients recover within a few weeks, others may take several months. It depends on the severity of the inflammation and your response to therapy. I cannot provide a definitive timeline. It's unpredictable. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to assess your progress. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Two weeks… for a follow-up. Very well. And the list of therapists… I appreciate that. No, I don't think I have any other questions at the moment, Doctor. Just… I truly hope this doesn't take too long. I rely on my work. But I understand the unpredictability, and I'll follow your instructions carefully. I’ll schedule the therapy and take the medication as prescribed. Thank you for your time, Doctor Jules. .
DOCTOR: Very well. See that you do. .
