DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor… Alzoubi, yes? It's… Kile. Just moved here, you see. Need… check-up, I think? Old doctor… far away now. Everything feels… new. Medicare, that's what I have. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, Kile, that’s perfectly fine. We take Medicare here. And it's good you're getting a check-up since you're new to the area. “Everything feels new” – can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Hmm. What do you mean? New… house, new town, new… everything. Used to live… bigger place. More… people. Here… quiet. Too quiet, maybe. I do… faces, you know? Make people look good. That's my job. But… hard to explain. It's just… different. Not sick, though. Just… getting old. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A lot of change can be… unsettling. You’re a… cosmetologist, then?
PATIENT: Cosme… what? No. I make up actors. For the… plays. And… movies. Sometimes weddings. Important faces. Need to look… right. Not just… pretty. Important work. Very important. You understand? It's… artistic. Not like… just anyone can do.
DOCTOR: Yes, I absolutely understand. That is very important work. It requires a great deal of skill. So, you’re a professional makeup artist. And aside from the move and getting used to things, are you experiencing any specific health concerns?
PATIENT: Health… concerns? Not really. Maybe… tired sometimes. Old tired, you know? Like… been working too long. But everyone gets tired. I eat… food. Sleep… sometimes. Nothing broken. Nothing hurting… much. My back… a little. But that’s just… age. Is that a concern? You doctors always worry about things.
DOCTOR: Okay, “old tired” and a little back discomfort. We do worry about things, that's our job! Let's start with the tiredness. Is this a recent change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Slowly… getting more. Not like… suddenly fall asleep. Just… not as much energy. Used to work all night, you see? Now… need a little rest. Maybe two naps. Sometimes three. It's… annoying. Makes the faces… take longer. Very important faces, remember? Can't rush perfection.
DOCTOR: Right, very important faces. Okay, so increasing fatigue over time. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? Like… a fever? No. No fever. No cough. Don't get sick much. Sometimes… a little dizzy. But that’s… maybe the heat? It’s very hot here. Hot and… quiet. Makes you… feel things. Maybe that’s a symptom? Being… bored? Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Dizziness with the fatigue. Okay. And you said it might be the heat. Let’s rule out anything more serious first. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… yes. I eat. Sometimes. Not as much as before, maybe. Used to eat big meals. Now… small things. Soup, maybe. Little bit of meat. Weight… probably lost some. Clothes… a little loose. But I don't weigh myself. Too… complicated. You doctors like to weigh everything. Is that important? For the faces?
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some unintentional weight loss. It is helpful information. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? What does that mean? Like… poking and prodding? I don’t like being poked and prodded. Is it… necessary? For the faces? I need my hands for the faces. They need to be… steady. You won't hurt my hands, will you?
DOCTOR: It's just a routine check-up, Mr. Szmyd. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a quick look at your eyes, ears, nose, and throat. And I promise, I won’t hurt your hands. It’s important to make sure everything is working as it should be. It will only take a few minutes. I'll be very careful. Would you like to sit up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Exam table… fine. But be gentle. Very gentle. My face work… requires… precision. Just… quick, please. And don’t touch my hands. Unless you're applying… powder. That’s acceptable.
DOCTOR: Of course, very gentle. And no touching the hands, I promise. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. 138 over 76. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a little shallow. Now, can I just take a quick look in your ears?
PATIENT: Ears? Fine. But don't… poke anything in my ears. I need them for… listening. For the actors. They whisper things. Important things. And don't shine a bright light in my eyes either. Makes it hard to see… colours. For the faces, you see. Colours are very important. Quickly, please. Very quickly.
DOCTOR: No poking, I promise. And a gentle light. Your ears look clear. Eyes are clear as well. Slightly dry, but nothing concerning. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax for me. Sounds are normal. A little tenderness in the upper right quadrant, but nothing significant. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems generally okay, but I’d like to run some blood work just to get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking? Fine. But I hope it doesn't take too long. I have… faces to paint. Important faces. And… no needles, please. I don't like needles. They… ruin the precision. Just… quick, and no needles. Promise?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. It’s just a standard blood draw, and yes, I promise it will be as quick as possible. And yes, it involves a needle, but I’ll have a very skilled phlebotomist do it, and they’re very gentle. We’ll check your complete blood count, thyroid levels, and some basic metabolic panels. It'll help us see if there's a reason for your fatigue and weight loss. We can also check your Vitamin D levels, which can sometimes cause tiredness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Vitamin… D? Is that for… sunshine? I used to get lots of sunshine. Before… everything. Fine. Do whatever you need to do. Just… hurry. And tell the… needle person… to be very careful. My hands are… delicate. Very, very delicate. Important faces, remember? And no talking, please. It distracts me.
DOCTOR: Yes, Vitamin D is important, and it's made with sunshine. We'll take care of everything, and I'll make sure the phlebotomist is aware of your concerns. No talking. Just quick and careful. I’ll have the lab draw your blood now. We should have the results back in a few days, and we can discuss them then. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call. Do you have any questions for me before I send you to the lab?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm. No. Not really. Just… how long will it take? And will it hurt? I need my hands. And… can I still paint faces after? Important faces, you see. It’s a very… demanding job. Requires… steady hands.
DOCTOR: The blood draw itself should only take about 5-10 minutes. You might feel a slight pinch, but it’s very quick. And yes, you should be able to paint faces right afterward. It shouldn't affect your ability to work. I'll give you a bandage and you should avoid heavy lifting with that arm for a bit, but light work should be fine. Here's the order. Just take this to the lab, and they'll take care of you. The lab is just down the hall to your left. And please, if you feel faint or dizzy at any point, let them know immediately. Do you need me to write down the lab's phone number for you?
PATIENT: Phone number… no. I’ll find it. I always find things. Just… quick, and no needles. Remember that. Important faces… waiting. Fine. Let’s get it over with.
