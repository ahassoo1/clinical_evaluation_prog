DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too, Doctor... Doctor Donate, right? Yes. I am here because... well, my face gets very red. Like, flushing. It happens sometimes, and it's... not comfortable. It just comes on, you know? And stays for a bit.
DOCTOR: Yes, Donate. And please, call me Cabel. Flushing, okay. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Now, when you say “sometimes,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... specific... Let me think. It’s not every day. Maybe... two, three times a week? Sometimes more if I am... stressed. Or after I eat something spicy. Though, it happened last week and I didn’t have anything spicy at all. It’s hard to say exactly why it happens. It just… does.
DOCTOR: Right. So it seems to be triggered by stress and potentially spicy foods, but also happens at other times. How long does the flushing typically last when it occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Usually... maybe ten, fifteen minutes? Sometimes a little longer, if I’m really… bothered by something. It fades slowly. Not quick, you know? It's not like a switch. It gets lighter and lighter. But it's noticeable. People ask me if I am sick.
DOCTOR: Okay. And does anything relieve it?
PATIENT: Relieve it…? Hmm. Not really, not that I’ve found. Cool air helps a little. I’ll sometimes go outside if it’s not too hot. But it still… stays. Drinking water doesn’t really do much, either. I tried that. It just... goes away on its own, eventually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when this flushing happens, do you experience any other symptoms with it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… Sometimes my heart feels a little fast. Not like a panic, but… aware of it, you know? And… sometimes I feel a little… warm, all over. Not just my face. Sweaty, a little bit. But not always. Mostly just the red face and the fast heart sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Okay, so flushing, potential fast heart rate, and sometimes feeling warm or sweaty. Have you noticed any dizziness or lightheadedness during these episodes?
PATIENT: Dizziness… No, not really. I haven’t fallen or anything. I feel… off, sometimes. Like I should sit down. But not dizzy, exactly. More like… weak? A little shaky, maybe. But no spinning or anything like that. It's hard to explain. It's not a strong feeling. Just… not quite right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this something new, or has this been happening for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not new. It started… maybe six months ago? At first, it wasn’t so bad. Just once in a while. But it’s been happening more and more lately. That’s why I decided to come see you. It's starting to worry me a little. I don't like being red all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, gradually worsening. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing like that. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. My wife… she took care of all that. After she passed… it just… slipped my mind. I don’t take any pills. Never have. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Though I do like a good curry sometimes. But no, no conditions. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had… some problems with her stomach. Ulcers, I think. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. He took pills for it. But other than that… not much that I remember. My wife’s family… they were all pretty healthy, as far as I know. It's been a long time. I don't remember everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing that I know of. I can eat anything. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. That's good, right? I always thought it was good I didn’t have allergies. Makes things easier.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is good. Alright, Mr. Withycombe. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your face. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 148 over 92. Pulse is 88, regular. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your face does show some redness. Now, this could be a number of things. Given your symptoms and history, we need to rule out a few possibilities. It could be rosacea, though you don't mention bumps or pimples. It could also be related to your blood pressure, or something called a vasomotor flush. To be sure, I'd like to order a few blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. It’ll give us a better idea of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests… okay. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's causing it. The tests… they won't be too expensive, will they? I don’t have insurance, you see. It's just me now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Being without insurance can be a worry. We’ll keep the tests as focused as possible to minimize the cost. I’ll also see if the lab has a financial assistance program available. We can discuss that with the lab directly. It should be around $150 to $200 total, but I'll get you a more precise estimate before we proceed. Now, while we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding things that seem to trigger the flushing – spicy foods, stress if possible, and try to stay cool. Are you able to get those results back to me quickly?
PATIENT: $150 to $200… okay. I can manage that, I think. Hopefully. Yes, I can get the results back to you. I have a friend who can help me with the paperwork. He's good with those things. And yes, I will try to avoid the spicy food and… the stress. Easier said than done, though. But I will try. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Good. I'll have the lab requisition ready for you, and they can draw the blood anytime. Once the results are back – usually a few days – my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience dizziness, chest pain, or difficulty breathing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Emergency room if it gets worse. I will remember that. And I will bring the papers to the lab. Thank you again, Doctor Donate. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It helps to know someone is looking into it. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. .
