DOCTOR: Alright, Mystery Kobler, 25 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s been getting harder to breathe, I suppose. Not suddenly, just…gradually. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. Like…always. It’s a little uncomfortable, to be honest. I don’t really…remember exactly when it started, though. It feels like a long time.
DOCTOR: "Gradually getting harder to breathe," okay. And dry mouth and eyes… for how long exactly?
PATIENT: Oh dear…that’s a difficult question. Perhaps…several months? It’s hard to say precisely. Things…aren’t always very clear in my memory, you see. I apologize for not being more helpful. It just feels like it’s been a while. Longer than a few weeks, certainly. I wouldn't be here if it were only a few weeks.
DOCTOR: Right. Several months. And is this…constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant, I think. Though some days are…worse than others. When I’m trying to sleep, it feels particularly difficult. And the dryness…it’s always there, really. I drink a lot of water, but it doesn’t seem to help much. It just…is. Does that make sense? I feel a little silly trying to explain it.
DOCTOR: "A little silly," right. Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the breathing and dryness?
PATIENT: Hmm…other symptoms. Let me think. I…sometimes feel a little tired, but I always have, to be honest. It’s hard to say if it’s because of this, or just…me. I don't think so, no. Nothing else that I can recall at the moment. My joints ache sometimes, but again, I’m getting older. Perhaps that’s just part of life? I apologize for not being more…informative.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. I…believe I am allergic to penicillin. I had a bad reaction to it when I was younger. A rash, mostly. And…I don’t think I’m allergic to any foods, no. I eat pretty much everything. I don’t recall having any trouble with foods, thankfully. Though I don’t eat much seafood anymore. Not because of allergies, just…a preference, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I am not. I try to avoid medication if possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if that makes sense. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. Really, nothing regular. I haven't needed anything…until now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a listen to your lungs, and I'll take a look at your throat. Just to get a baseline. Can you sit up there for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whenever you are ready. I hope it isn’t anything too serious. I do try to be healthy, you see. Though my memory…well, it makes it difficult to recall everything I do to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lungs sound…relatively clear, though there's a slight wheeze. Throat looks a little dry, but nothing alarming. Do you have a history of smoking?
PATIENT: Smoking? Oh, no. Never. I…don’t care for it, personally. My mother smoked, and it wasn’t a pleasant experience. I've always avoided it. And I generally try to stay away from secondhand smoke as well. I hope that's helpful? I do try to be careful. Though, again, my memory... it can be unreliable.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…that’s a difficult question, Doctor. My family…isn’t very close. I grew up mostly with my grandmother, and I don’t know much about my parents’ side. She passed away a few years ago. I believe she had…arthritis, perhaps? And…something with her heart, maybe? I’m afraid I don't have very detailed information. It’s a little…sad, really. I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your symptoms – the gradual shortness of breath, the dry mouth and eyes – and your lack of a detailed family history, we'll need to run some tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. We'll also check your oxygen saturation levels here in the office.
PATIENT: Tests…of course. That sounds…thorough. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just…hope it isn’t anything too serious. Oxygen levels…that sounds important. Is that something I should be worried about? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just want to understand what's happening.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Ms. Kobler. Checking your oxygen levels will just give us a baseline. We need to rule out a few things, that’s all. It could be something simple, like allergies or a mild respiratory infection. But it’s better to be safe. I’m going to have the nurse draw your blood, and then we’ll get you scheduled for the chest X-ray. It's likely just precautionary. Let’s get started with the blood draw, then.
PATIENT: Very well. Blood draw it is. I suppose that's the most logical next step. Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. Please, let me know if there’s anything I should do to prepare for the X-ray?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just wear comfortable clothing, and remove any jewelry. The nurse will give you more specific instructions. I’ll have her come in to get you started. She’ll also review the results with you when they come back. We’ll go from there. Don't worry too much, Ms. Kobler. It's probably nothing.
PATIENT: "Probably nothing," you say? That is…reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. I will try not to worry. I shall be patient. And if I think of anything else, I will be sure to ask. Thank you again for your time and consideration.
