DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t you have a seat, and tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Krahn, yes, that’s me. Honestly, it’s… well, I think it’s for some kind of check-up? Something about a performance, I was told. A physical, they said. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. I do a lot of work at the theater – ushering, mostly. Ticket taking. It’s…it’s been a while since I’ve had a proper look-over.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. A check-up is an excellent idea, and it sounds like you lead a very active life with your work at the theater. We can certainly take our time and go through everything thoroughly. To start, could you tell me a little more about what prompted this check-up now?
PATIENT: Prompted… right. Hmm. I believe it was… a new role? They wanted to make sure I was… capable. Something about insurance, maybe? I’m not really sure. It’s all a bit fuzzy, truthfully. I just want to get it over with quickly, if that’s alright. I have a show tonight, you see. A small part, but still.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. We’ll do our best to be efficient while still being thorough. It’s good to know you have a performance this evening – we'll keep that in mind. To help me get a clearer picture of your overall health, let’s go over some basic information. Perhaps we can start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously – such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… that’s a tough one. Honestly, Doctor, I really can’t recall. It's been… a long time. I went to the doctor regularly with my ex-wife, but that was ages ago. She always handled all that. I vaguely remember something about… cholesterol, maybe? But I wouldn’t swear to it. I've never been seriously ill, if that’s any consolation. Just… the usual aches and pains for a man my age.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. These things happen. We can work with what you do remember, and if necessary, we can investigate further. Let’s move on to past surgeries. Have you ever had any operations or surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. No, I don’t think so. No surgeries. Not that I recall, anyway. I broke my arm when I was a child, but I think that just required a cast. Nothing… cutting. Definitely no major operations. I'd remember something like that, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You certainly would, Mr. Krahn. That’s very helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s another tricky one. My parents… they’re both gone now. And I wasn’t very close to my extended family. I know my mother had… something with her heart, I think. But I don’t know what exactly. And my father… he just… aged. A long, slow decline. Nothing sudden or dramatic. I really wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. It’s just… a lot of it is a blur.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s common for memories to fade, especially regarding family history. We can certainly work with what you recall. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My ex-wife smoked, terribly, but I always avoided it. Horrible habit, in my opinion. No, definitely no smoking. And I don’t drink much, either. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Krahn. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors – such as pollen or dust?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. A little bit of hay fever in the spring, perhaps, but nothing serious. No, I don't think I have any significant allergies. I can eat pretty much anything. My ex-wife had all sorts of sensitivities, but thankfully I didn’t inherit any of those!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Well… I was. My doctor – it was years ago now – prescribed something for my cholesterol. But I ran out a while back, and honestly, I haven't bothered to refill it. I mostly just try to eat healthy and stay active. That's about it. No vitamins, no supplements, just… trying to take care of myself the best I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just a quick check of your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. Just…try to be quick, if you would? Like I said, I have a show tonight. And I wouldn't want to miss my cue. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. We'll be as efficient as possible. First, I'll just take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 140 over 90. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are a bit irregular, a little bit of an arrhythmia. Not alarming, but something to note. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Lungs sound clear. Finally, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears and throat look good. Alright, Mr. Krahn, everything seems generally okay, but those slightly elevated blood pressure and irregular heartbeat are things we need to investigate further. I'd like to order a few lab tests - a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a cholesterol check, and an EKG to get a better understanding of your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lab tests… an EKG… oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it bad? Is something really wrong? I just wanted a simple check-up, you know? To make sure I’m fit enough for this small part I have. This is… a little overwhelming. I suppose… if you think it’s necessary. But can we hurry, please? I really need to get back to rehearsals. And I don't have insurance, so… how much will all of this cost?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed. These tests are simply precautionary. We’re not necessarily looking for something wrong, but rather getting a baseline understanding of your overall health, especially given the elevated blood pressure and irregular heartbeat. It’s much better to be proactive and know what’s going on. Regarding the cost, I'll speak with our billing department, and we can explore options for a cash price or potential assistance programs. We’ll do everything we can to make it affordable. To give you a clearer picture, the lab tests and EKG will help us assess your cholesterol levels, kidney function, blood sugar, and, most importantly, the cause of that irregular heartbeat. It could be something minor, like a skipped beat, or something that requires further attention. Would you like me to explain each test in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. More detail would be… helpful, I suppose. But please, keep it simple. I’m not very good with medical jargon. Just…tell me what each one does, in plain English. And how long will all of this take? I really don’t have a lot of time. And… will I need a follow-up appointment? This is starting to sound like a whole ordeal, and I just wanted a quick clearance.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. Absolutely no problem. Let’s start with the complete blood count, or CBC. This test simply looks at the different types of cells in your blood – red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets. It can help us identify any signs of infection, anemia, or other blood disorders. It takes just a few minutes, a simple blood draw. Next, the metabolic panel. This test measures different substances in your blood – things like glucose, electrolytes, kidney function. It gives us a good overall picture of how your body’s organs are functioning. Also a simple blood draw, a few minutes. Then, the cholesterol check. This test measures the different types of cholesterol in your blood – LDL, HDL, triglycerides. As you mentioned you were previously prescribed medication for this, it will let us see how well you are doing. Again, blood draw, few minutes. Finally, the EKG, or electrocardiogram. This test records the electrical activity of your heart. It helps us identify any irregular heartbeats, or signs of heart disease. It's completely painless, we just attach a few stickers to your chest and arms. It takes about ten minutes. All of these tests can be completed in about an hour, and we can get the results back within a few days. As for a follow-up appointment, that will depend on the results. If everything looks normal, we can just discuss the findings and make any necessary recommendations. If we find anything concerning, we’ll schedule a more in-depth appointment to discuss treatment options. Does that make sense, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: Okay… so a few blood draws and some stickers… that doesn’t sound too bad. An hour… I can probably squeeze that in. And then a few days for results… hopefully, it won't take too long. You said it could be something minor? That's… reassuring, I suppose. And you'll help me with the cost? I just… I really need to get back to rehearsals. This part is important to me. It's not a big role, but… it means a lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. We'll do everything we can to make this as smooth and stress-free as possible. And yes, we'll work with you on the cost. I’ll have our billing department contact you directly to discuss available options. It's perfectly understandable that getting back to rehearsals is a priority. We’ll do our best to expedite the tests and get you the results as quickly as possible. And regarding the possibility of something minor, it's important to remember that many irregular heartbeats are harmless. We simply want to rule out anything serious. Let's get you set up for these tests, and then we can discuss a plan for getting you back to rehearsals as soon as possible. Would you like me to have one of my nurses draw your blood and attach the EKG stickers?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I really appreciate it. I’m just… not good with all this medical stuff. It makes me anxious. Let's get it over with, shall we? The sooner I have these results, the sooner I can get back on stage.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. It's my pleasure. I completely understand. That's what I'm here for. And you're not alone in feeling anxious. It's perfectly normal. Nurse Ramirez, could you please come in and assist Mr. Krahn with his lab work and EKG?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Excellent. Nurse Ramirez will be with you in just a moment. She’ll explain everything in detail, and you’ll be in good hands. In the meantime, please feel free to relax and let me know if you have any questions at all. I’ll check back with you shortly. .
