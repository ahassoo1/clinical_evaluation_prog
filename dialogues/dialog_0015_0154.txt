DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my water. Keeps bothering me. Again. I don’t… I don’t really remember why it bothers me, just that it does. A lot. I hope we can get this sorted quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: "Again," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… happened before. Several times, I think. Not recently, but… frequently enough to be a bother. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. It just… is. It feels uncomfortable, burning mostly. And I have to… go to the bathroom a lot. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Burning, and frequent urination. Right. And when you say "a lot," could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… an estimate? I… I don’t really count. More than usual, I suppose. Definitely more than when I was younger. Every couple of hours, maybe? Perhaps even more often than that. It’s very distracting, Doctor. I really don’t like talking about this, if you don't mind. Is there a test you can just do?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Ms. Wease, simply doing a test isn’t sufficient. I need to understand what’s causing the problem to order the correct one – or, indeed, if one is even needed. Let’s try to be a bit more precise. Has the burning sensation been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, good gracious. Come and go, I think. It’s not always burning, no. Sometimes it’s just… a pressure. A discomfort. It’s hard to explain. And it… fades, then returns. Like a wave, perhaps? I really don't know, Doctor. I just want it gone. It’s been… a nuisance. A very persistent nuisance.
DOCTOR: A wave, coming and going. And is there anything that seems to trigger these waves?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. I drink water, I eat… normal things. I don’t do anything… unusual. Maybe if I walk a lot? Or if I’m a little… stressed? But I can’t really say for sure. Honestly, I’m terrible at remembering what makes it worse. Everything just feels… a bit blurry. Is this helping? I feel rather silly talking about this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wease, it is helpful, but vague answers don't give me much to work with. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness. Blood? I… I don’t think so. I haven't looked, Doctor. I really don’t… inspect things that closely. That sounds… unpleasant. I mean, I would notice, I suppose, if it was a lot. But a little…? I wouldn’t know. Really, I’m not one for details. Is that bad? I just… avoid those kinds of things. I hope you're not upset with me.
DOCTOR: Not upset, Ms. Wease, merely attempting to gather information. Alright. Let's move on. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t felt hot. And chills… well, it gets a little cool sometimes in the evenings, but that’s just the air conditioning. And back pain… oh, my back always aches a little. Old age, I suppose. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dullness. A constant sort of discomfort. Like everything else. I really don't understand what you're trying to find out. Is something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wease, I am trying to determine the cause of your urinary discomfort. Vague descriptions make that very difficult. Now, have you ever been treated for a urinary tract infection before?
