DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. It's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is good to meet you too. Well, it’s this weakness… getting worse, you see. Been happening for a little while now, but… feels different lately. It’s in my legs mostly, makes walking a bit hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness…and it's been worsening recently. And primarily in your legs, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Legs mostly. Sometimes feels… heavy, like I’m trying to move through water. And… well, my hands too, a little. Not as bad as the legs, though. It makes things… difficult, you know? Hard to hold things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Heavy feeling, like moving through water…that’s helpful. And it's affecting your hands as well, though less severe. When did you first notice this weakness starting, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It was… maybe six months ago? Started slow. I thought it was just getting old, you see? But… it’s kept getting worse, so I thought I should come see someone. My wife, she said I was being silly to wait so long!
DOCTOR: It’s good you came in when you did, Mr. Astores, and your wife sounds very sensible. Six months… okay. Has the weakness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Some days are better than others. But… the bad days are happening more often now. And… even on the good days, it’s there. Just… not as strong. It’s hard to explain… like a little weight always pulling me down. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense – a constant feeling, even on better days. Has anything specific triggered the worsening, or does it just seem to happen randomly?
PATIENT: That’s a hard one, Doctor. I don’t think anything specific… but… hot weather seems to make it worse. And… when I’m tired, definitely. If I do too much, it’s bad. My wife and I, we like to garden, but… I can’t do as much anymore. It’s a bit frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand that can be frustrating, Mr. Astores. Gardening sounds lovely. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, but it happens. And… I get tired really easily. More than just from doing too much, you know? Just… worn out. And… sometimes I feel a little numb, in my feet and hands. Not pain, just… not feeling everything. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, fatigue, and numbness in your feet and hands… all very good to know, Mr. Astores. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, just to cover everything, have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. My wife still yells at me to eat more vegetables! But no, appetite’s the same, weight’s pretty much the same too. I’ve always been a… bigger fella, you see. No big changes there.
DOCTOR: That's good. Now, do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really pain. Sometimes a little achy, like after working in the garden, but not… sharp pain. More like tired muscles, you see? Not… something I’d complain about, usually. The weakness is the bothersome part.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant pain. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had high blood pressure for a little while, but the doctor gave me pills and now it’s okay. Take ‘em every day. Other than that… no, not much. I've been pretty lucky, I think. Just getting old, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication. That’s helpful. Are you currently taking any other medications or supplements, besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the one. My wife keeps trying to get me to take vitamins, but I always forget! She says I should be stronger, but… I think it’s just old age! I don't take anything else, no. Just the pills for my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the blood pressure medication. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always checks, though. She’s very careful. I’m a lucky man. No allergies, just old age!
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a very good wife, Mr. Astores. Alright, no known allergies. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother, she had arthritis, bad in her hands. And my brother, he had… something with his nerves, I think? Made him weak sometimes. My wife says it was something… serious. I don’t really remember the name. It wasn’t contagious, she said. It’s been a long time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Arthritis in your mother and a nerve condition in your brother… That's helpful. And now, just one more area to cover. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, with dinner, but I stopped a long time ago. Doctor told me it wasn't good for my blood pressure. And… no, never touched anything else. Just old age, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. That’s all very good information, Mr. Astores. Now, if you’ll excuse me for a moment, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your reflexes, strength, and a few other things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’ll just sit here, won't I?
DOCTOR: If you could just sit up there for me, that would be great. We'll start with your blood pressure and then check your pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but symmetrical. Strength is 4 out of 5 in both arms and legs, with some weakness noted in the lower extremities. I see some mild swelling in your ankles and some decreased sensation in your feet. Okay, Mr. Astores. Everything seems to be functioning, but there are a few things I want to look into further.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds… thorough. What do you think it is? Is it serious? Is it this old age finally catching up with me?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking those questions. It’s possible it’s simply age-related changes, but given the weakness, diminished reflexes, and numbness, I want to rule out a few other possibilities. It’s unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, but we need to investigate. I suspect it might be peripheral neuropathy – nerve damage – or possibly a vascular issue affecting the circulation in your legs. It could also be related to your blood pressure, even though it’s controlled. To be sure, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar, kidney function, vitamin levels, and thyroid function. I also want to get an EKG to rule out any heart problems. Finally, I'd like to schedule a nerve conduction study to assess the health of your nerves. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay… a lot of tests. Nerve what-now? And blood sugar… I don’t have sugar problems! But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, then alright. I trust your judgment. What will these tests tell you? And… will they be painful? My wife will want to know.
DOCTOR: I understand it sounds like a lot, Mr. Astores, but it’s just to be thorough and get a clear picture. A nerve conduction study checks how well the signals travel along your nerves—it can help us pinpoint if there's nerve damage and where. It might feel a little like a mild electric shock, but it’s generally not painful—more like a tingling sensation. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions that could be causing your symptoms. The EKG will check the electrical activity of your heart and make sure everything is functioning normally. These tests will help us determine the cause of your weakness and numbness and come up with a treatment plan. We’ll get the results in a few days and discuss them together. I'll also write down everything for your wife. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that worsens your symptoms and wearing comfortable shoes. Do you have any questions about the tests or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds… complicated, but I appreciate you explaining it all. No strenuous activity, comfortable shoes… I can do that. My wife will be happy to hear that. She’s always telling me to rest more! Just… let me know when I need to go for these tests. And… will they be expensive? I'm on Medicare, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Astores. Let me check on the coverage with Medicare for you. Fortunately, most of these tests should be covered, but there might be a small co-pay or deductible. I’ll have the receptionist verify the exact costs for you before you schedule the appointments. She's very good at navigating insurance. We'll get everything set up for you, and I’ll have the lab order forms ready when you come in next week. I'll also put in a note to make sure the technician knows to explain everything carefully during the nerve conduction study. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… very good. Thank you for checking on the insurance. My wife will be very relieved to hear that. Next week is fine. Just let me know what I need to do. You've put my mind at ease a little, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate your patience. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. We'll take things one step at a time. The receptionist will contact you to schedule the appointments, and she’ll give you all the necessary instructions. If you have any questions before then, don't hesitate to call the office. In the meantime, remember to rest and take care of yourself. Have a good day, Mr. Astores.
