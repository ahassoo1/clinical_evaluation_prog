DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, but I have been noticing some things. Small things, mostly. I forget where I put my keys, or…what I was saying mid-sentence. It worries me. I am Venus Alvara, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Alvara, I see your name here. And it’s good you came in to discuss this. Forgetfulness…can you tell me a little more about these "small things"?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is not a…complete loss of memory, understand. More like…a blank space. For example, yesterday, I was making tea, and I completely forgot what kind of biscuits I wanted with it. I stood there, looking at the cupboard, for a good five minutes. And then…the keys. I put them down somewhere after coming in from the garden, and I could not recall. These things have been happening more often, lately. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it's not a gradual loss of long-term memory, but more frequent lapses in recent memory – things like what you were doing a few moments ago, or where you placed common objects?
PATIENT: Precisely. You explain it…very well, Doctor. Not things from my childhood, or even last year. Just…today. Or yesterday. It is frustrating. And…my blood pressure has been quite high, recently. My neighbor, she is a nurse, and she worries. She suggested I see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure is definitely something we need to address as well. So, to get a better picture, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or is this something new?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I was diagnosed about…ten years ago, perhaps? It has been…managed, mostly, with medication. But recently, it has been difficult to control. I have been…forgetting to take the pills sometimes. Shameful, I know. And then, I change them myself, thinking I have enough, but I do not know the correct dosage. My husband, he always took care of that. It has been…difficult, since he passed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Alvara. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult, and it’s very common for routines to be disrupted. It's not shameful at all to have trouble keeping up with things during a time of grief. So, you’ve been managing your blood pressure with medication for ten years, but it’s been harder to control lately, and you've been adjusting the dosage yourself?
PATIENT: Yes, that is…correct, Doctor. I do not want to bother the pharmacy constantly. They are very busy. I try to be independent. But I fear I have made a mistake. I sometimes take too much, I think, and then sometimes…not enough. And the forgetfulness, it worries me. Is it…the blood pressure? My neighbor says it can cause problems. She is very knowledgeable.
DOCTOR: Your neighbor is right to be concerned, and it’s good you’re taking this seriously. High blood pressure can affect cognitive function, absolutely. However, forgetfulness can have many causes, and we need to rule out other possibilities. Before we jump to conclusions, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Then, I’d like to check your blood pressure, of course, and we might need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…very sensible. A physical exam is good. And the tests. Whatever you think is necessary. I just want to…understand what is happening. And, if possible, to fix it. I do not wish to be…a burden. It is important to me to remain independent. So, please, do what you feel is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's start with a quick neurological exam – I’ll check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. If you could just follow my finger with your eyes…and tell me if you feel any dizziness.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am following it…yes. No dizziness, so far. Although…my vision has been a little blurry lately. I thought it was just…age. But perhaps it is related? I apologize for bringing so many things up at once. It is just…a lot to process.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Alvara, it’s important to mention everything. The blurry vision is good to know. We'll check that as well. Okay, reflexes seem normal on both sides… Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Here. Is that…sufficient? My hands feel…cold, Doctor. I always have poor circulation. And I apologize if my grip is weak. It is the weather, mostly. Very damp lately. And I have arthritis in my fingers. It makes things difficult. I do not wish to be a troublesome patient.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Ms. Alvara. I’m just noting everything. The tremor and cold hands are good to know as well – it could be related to your circulation, as you said. Alright, let's check your blood pressure now. Please relax your arm. Hmm… 160 over 95. That’s elevated. And your pulse is a little irregular.
PATIENT: That…is not good, is it? My neighbor warned me it would be high. I should have listened to her more closely. I do try to watch my salt intake, but… sometimes I indulge. Pickled herring is my weakness. A silly thing to worry about, I know. But it is…comforting. I apologize for the high reading. I will try harder to control it. Is there…anything I can do immediately?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Alvara. We’ll work on this together. The pickled herring isn't the main concern, but it’s good to be mindful of your diet. Given your elevated blood pressure and irregular pulse, and the recent forgetfulness, I'm a little concerned about a possible atrial fibrillation – an irregular heartbeat that can sometimes cause these symptoms. To be sure, I'd like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart rhythm. We should also run some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An…electrocardio…gram? And blood tests? That sounds…serious, Doctor. Is it something…terrible? My husband, he had heart problems, towards the end. It is…a frightening word, heart problems. I do not wish to cause trouble. Are you certain it is necessary? Perhaps the forgetfulness is just…age, as I said before? I do not want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, I understand your concerns, and it's perfectly normal to feel frightened when we talk about heart problems. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something terrible. The EKG is a simple, painless test that will give us valuable information about your heart rhythm. It will help us determine if your irregular pulse is a cause for concern. The blood tests are just to rule out other potential causes for your forgetfulness and make sure everything else is functioning properly. We're just being thorough, and it's better to be safe than sorry. I want to assure you that we'll take things one step at a time, and I'll explain everything clearly along the way. Would you be willing to let me order those tests?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you think it is necessary, then…yes. Please, do the tests. I trust your judgment. It is just…frightening, to think of another heart problem. My husband… But you are right, it is better to know. Please, explain everything to me, as we go. I do not wish to be left in the dark. And…thank you, Doctor, for being so patient with me. It is difficult, to talk about these things.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I understand it's difficult, and I will absolutely explain everything clearly. I'll order the EKG and blood tests right away. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and we can get you scheduled for the EKG. It's usually a quick procedure. In the meantime, let's discuss some lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure. We'll start with diet and exercise. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Diet and exercise... yes. I suppose I should be more active. I spend most of my days… indoors. It is the weather, mostly. And the garden… it is too much work now. My knees… But I will try, Doctor. I promise. What about… the forgetting? Is there anything I can do to improve my memory? It is the most worrying thing, you see. I do not want to… lose myself.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Alvara. It's good you’re thinking about these things. While we await the test results, there are some things you can try to help with your memory. Mental stimulation is key – things like puzzles, reading, or learning a new skill. Social interaction is also important. And try to establish routines – keeping a daily schedule can help with recall. We can also discuss some memory aids, like writing things down or using a calendar. As for the tests, the nurse should be in shortly. I'll be back to discuss the results as soon as they're available. .
