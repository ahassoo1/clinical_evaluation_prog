DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re still going. More than 48 hours now, I think. It’s quite annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups that have been going on for more than 48 hours. That is quite persistent. Annoying is a good way to put it! To get a better understanding, can you tell me a bit more about them?
PATIENT: Sure. They come and go, you know? Not constantly, thankfully. But several times an hour, at least. Sometimes it’s just one, sometimes a little burst of three or four. Nothing seems to cause them, which is odd. I haven’t been doing anything different. I’m eating normally, drinking water… no fizzy drinks, though, I don't like those. And I haven't been particularly stressed lately, not any more than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent, several times an hour, no obvious triggers like eating or stress, and you've avoided carbonated beverages. That's helpful. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Not really, no. No heartburn, no trouble swallowing… my stomach feels okay. I haven’t felt sick or anything like that. Oh! Actually… now that you mention it, maybe a tiny bit of bloating, but I just figured it was from… well, eating, you know? Nothing major. It’s not painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no associated heartburn, difficulty swallowing, nausea, or significant abdominal pain, just a little bit of bloating. Have you been taking anything for the hiccups already?
PATIENT: No, not yet. I usually just try to hold my breath or drink a glass of water quickly, those things sometimes work for a little bit, but they haven’t done anything this time. I didn’t want to start taking anything without checking with a doctor first, you know? I figured if they kept going this long, it was worth a visit.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you, Ivette. It's always best to check first, especially when something is persistent. Now, let's go through some general health questions. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago, but it's been well controlled with diet and exercise for a long time now. The doctor said I didn’t need medication anymore. Otherwise… no, I'm pretty healthy, all things considered. I have the usual aches and pains for someone my age, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension that is currently well-controlled with lifestyle modifications – that's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. That was a bit rough, but I recovered okay. And I was in the hospital once when I was a teenager with a really bad case of the flu, but that was a long time ago. Other than that, no. No other surgeries or hospital stays that I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a cholecystectomy ten years ago and a bout of influenza as a teenager. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my mother had diabetes, type 2, and my father had heart problems. He had a heart attack when he was in his 70s. And my brother has high cholesterol. That’s about it, really. Nothing too dramatic on either side of the family, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I haven’t had any allergic reactions to anything that I’m aware of. I eat everything, and I’ve taken a lot of different medications over the years for colds and headaches and things like that, and never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really believe in taking a lot of pills unless I absolutely have to, you know? I try to get everything I need from my diet. Just good, healthy food.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are regular, and I’m not hearing any abnormal lung sounds - no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don't feel any masses or enlarged organs. There is some mild bloating, as you mentioned, but nothing concerning. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Just a little… pressure, you know? Normal pressure when someone’s poking around. Nothing uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it doesn’t seem like there’s anything serious going on. Persistent hiccups can be caused by a lot of things, most of which are benign. Sometimes they just happen. However, given that they've lasted for over 48 hours, it’s good we’ve ruled out anything obvious. I would like to order a few blood tests just to be on the safe side. A complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. That will help rule out any underlying electrolyte imbalances or other issues that could be contributing to the hiccups. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. If it’ll put my mind at ease, then yes, please. Blood tests are fine. I don’t really like needles, but… needs must, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not anyone’s favorite thing. The phlebotomist will be as quick and gentle as possible. While we wait for the results, you can try a few things at home. Continue drinking plenty of water. Some people find relief with a teaspoon of sugar – just a small amount. You could also try holding your breath for as long as you comfortably can, several times a day. If the hiccups continue to be bothersome, or if you develop any other symptoms – like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or vomiting – please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Plenty of water, a little sugar, hold my breath… and come back if anything gets worse. No difficulty breathing, no chest pain, no vomiting. Got it. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on and having some things to try. Hopefully, the blood tests will show everything’s okay and they'll just… stop.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get those lab results back within a day or two. The nurse will call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything clearly. Thank you again for your time. I appreciate you fitting me in today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. It was my pleasure. Get some rest, and hopefully, those hiccups will be gone soon. Have a good day, and we'll talk to you when the results are back. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
