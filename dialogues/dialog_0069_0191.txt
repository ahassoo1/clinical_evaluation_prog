DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I requested to come in… to get tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, and I thought it was best to just get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub, that’s a very responsible decision. It’s good you’re taking this step. To help me understand things a bit better, could you tell me a little bit about why you decided to get tested now?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not that there’s been anything specific. My husband and I… we haven’t been entirely consistent with protection lately, and truthfully, I just want the peace of mind. It’s been weighing on my thoughts, you see? Better safe than sorry, as they say.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shaub. That’s a very valid reason to want to get tested – peace of mind is important. And you're right, better safe than sorry. Before we proceed with the testing, I'd like to ask a few questions to get a clearer picture of your risk factors. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Please, ask away. I'll answer as best as I can.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. This is my first time. I… I suppose I always put it off. It didn't feel relevant before, but now… well, now it does. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Shaub. Many people feel that way. Okay. And have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been quite fortunate, I think. My husband and I… we’ve been together for a long time, and we’ve always been very careful, until recently. As I said.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say "recently," could you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it’s been… perhaps the last six months. We started… being less diligent with protection around then. It wasn't a conscious decision, more… things just relaxed a bit, you understand? We’ve been together so long, we thought the risk was low.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently experiencing any symptoms – anything at all that feels unusual or different?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I feel perfectly healthy. That’s partly why I’m… a bit anxious, perhaps. Because I feel fine. It's just… the worry, you see? It’s hard to shake.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Sometimes there are no symptoms, especially early on, which can definitely add to the anxiety. Now, let’s talk about your husband. Does he know you’re getting tested today?
PATIENT: Yes, he does. He… he wasn’t thrilled about it, to be honest. He thinks it’s unnecessary, that we’ve been together too long for anything to be a concern. But I insisted. I needed to know, for my own peace of mind. He agreed, though, reluctantly. He said he'd get tested as well, if I wanted him to.
DOCTOR: That's good he's willing to get tested too, Ms. Shaub. Testing both of you is a good idea. Before we move on to the testing itself, I'd like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I’m quite healthy, actually. I do have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing serious. And I take a daily multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. Otherwise, I feel quite robust.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the multivitamin, as I mentioned. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. I prefer a natural approach, if possible. Though, I understand sometimes medication is necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, thankfully. I can eat anything, take any medicine… no problems there. I’ve always been very fortunate in that regard. It makes things so much simpler.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Shaub. Thank you for providing me with this information. It's very helpful. Now, before we proceed with the testing, I want to explain the process to you. We'll do a blood draw today. It’s a standard HIV test, and it looks for antibodies to the virus. It will take a few days to get the results back. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A blood draw… yes, that’s alright. A few days… that does seem a bit long, doesn't it? Will it be a long wait to find out? And… will someone call me with the results, or will I need to come back? I confess, I'm a bit anxious about waiting. I've never had any serious tests done before.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Shaub. It is a bit of a wait, and I apologize for that. The standard test does take a few days to process in the lab. We will definitely call you with the results – you won’t need to come back unless the results are unclear, and we need to discuss them in person. We'll also provide you with resources and support regardless of the outcome. Is there a phone number where we can best reach you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. My number is 0703-555-1234. And… thank you, Doctor. That’s very reassuring to know. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It does help calm my nerves a little. I confess, the waiting is what worries me the most. But if you'll call, that's good. Very good indeed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub, I have your number as 0703-555-1234. Excellent. Alright, let's proceed with the blood draw then. I’ll have the nurse come in and take care of that for you. She's very experienced and gentle. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think I am. As ready as I’ll ever be, I suppose. Thank you for being so patient with me. I appreciate your kindness. Please, send the nurse when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. I'll let her know you're ready. It will just be a quick procedure. I'll step out for a moment and allow the nurse to do her work. I'll be nearby if you need anything at all.
