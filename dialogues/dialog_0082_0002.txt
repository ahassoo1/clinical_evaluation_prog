DOCTOR: Good morning, Zoie. Welcome. I’m Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. IUZZOLINO, you say? That’s a nice name. Um… well, it’s my waterworks, mostly. Been a bit…troublesome, lately. Hard to…go, you know? It’s not painful, exactly. Just…difficult. I don’t really know what’s going on with it. It’s been like this for…a while now, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, “troublesome waterworks,” I understand. Difficult to go… not painful, just difficult. And you said this has been going on for a while… can you try to remember roughly how long?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long… That’s… tricky. Seems like a long time, doesn’t it? Maybe… six months? Or was it longer? I’m married, you know. My husband, he does the remembering mostly. I forget things easily these days. It’s just…getting old, I suppose. I don’t keep good track of time, no. It all blurs together.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Zoie. Six months or longer… that gives us a starting point. It's very common for things to feel a bit blurry with time, especially as we get older. So, it’s difficulty with urination… is it difficult to start going, or is it difficult to fully empty your bladder, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question… both, I think. It takes a while to start, like I have to…push a little. And then… even when I think I’m done, it doesn’t feel like everything’s out. I have to go back again a little while later. It’s… annoying, mostly. I don't want to be a bother, you know? I just want it to work right. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Zoie. It takes effort to start, and doesn't feel like you fully empty. That is annoying. We'll figure it out. Now, besides the difficulty, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think… Well, I go to the bathroom more often, I think. Especially at night! Waking up… two, three times, sometimes. My husband doesn’t mind too much, but I do. It interrupts my sleep, you see. And… sometimes I feel like I can’t hold it as long as I used to. That’s embarrassing! Does that make sense? I don’t want to make a mess, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoie, that all makes perfect sense. Increased frequency, especially at night, and a sense of urgency… needing to go more often and feeling like you can’t hold it as long. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not burning either. That’s good, right? It’s just… a weak stream, maybe? And like I said, it takes a while to get going. It’s not hurtful, just… inconvenient. I don't have any fever, or chills, or anything like that. I feel alright, mostly. Just this waterworks business. I hope it’s not something serious, Doctor. My husband worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: No pain or burning, just a weak stream and difficulty starting… that's helpful to know. And no fever or chills. It doesn't sound like anything terribly serious, Zoie, but we need to check a few things to be sure. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just involve listening to your abdomen and a brief check, nothing too invasive. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam… alright. As long as it’s not too… unpleasant. I don't like being poked and prodded, you know. But if you think it’s necessary… yes, alright. Just be gentle, Doctor. And tell me what you’re doing, so I don’t get startled. My nerves aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zoie. I will be as gentle as possible, and I’ll explain everything as I go. It’s just listening to your abdomen to check for anything unusual, and a quick external exam. First, if you don’t mind, I’ll listen to your belly. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, just breathing normally… sounds clear here… and here… anything feel uncomfortable?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort. It’s just… strange, having someone listen to my belly! But it’s alright. Clear here too, you say? That’s good. My husband always says I have a strong stomach, but that’s because he makes me try all his cooking, you know. He’s a good man, but his cooking… well, let’s just say it’s an adventure. Are you finished listening? It’s a bit cold, you know. A blanket would be nice.
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoie, all finished listening. Everything sounds clear, which is good. And yes, it is a bit chilly in here. I'll ask a nurse to bring you a blanket right away. Now, I'd like to do a very brief external exam, just to check a few things. It involves a quick look and gentle feel. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a look and a feel… Well, alright. But please be quick, Doctor. And gentle! I'm an old lady, you know. My skin is… delicate. And try not to startle me! Honestly, I don't like being examined. But if you really think it’s necessary… go ahead. Just tell me what you’re doing, please. And don’t laugh! I’ve had children, you know. Things aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. Absolutely. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I will explain everything as I go. I promise not to laugh! I understand things have changed over the years. Okay, just a quick look… everything appears normal here… and just a gentle feel… everything feels as expected… No tenderness or anything concerning. Alright, everything appears normal externally. Now, to get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order a simple urine test. It can help us rule out infection or other issues. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A urine test… oh dear. That means a little cup, doesn't it? I can do that, I suppose. It's just… embarrassing, you know. But if it will help… yes, alright. Do I need to… fill it up a lot? And where do I go? I don’t want to make a mess! Honestly, I'm always worried about making a mess. My husband says I'm too careful, but… it’s just how I am. Where do I go for the little cup?
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoie, a small sample in a little cup. You don’t need to fill it up completely – just a couple of ounces is fine. And don't worry about making a mess – we have everything you need, and the nurses will be happy to help. The bathroom is just over there. There's a clean collection cup and instructions inside. Take your time, and if you need any assistance, just call for one of the nurses. They're very kind and helpful. After you’ve collected the sample, just bring it back to me and we’ll send it off to the lab. Sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just a little cup… and the nurses will help. That’s good. I hope it doesn’t take long. I don’t like being in the bathroom for too long, you know. It makes my knees ache. Okay, I’ll go now. Thank you, Doctor. And please tell the nurses I might need a little help. Honestly, I'm getting too old for all this.
