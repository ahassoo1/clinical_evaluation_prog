DOCTOR: Right. Denis Minatra, 67. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Ruocco. It’s about some tests I had done… a test of my stomach, I believe. The results weren’t quite right, or so the office said. They suggested I come in to discuss them with you. It’s a little unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Tests, right. Always tests. Okay. And what exactly did the office tell you was “not quite right”?
PATIENT: Well, the woman on the phone… she said something about an “abnormal GI Endo Test”. She didn't explain what that means, precisely. Just that I needed to see a doctor to understand it better. I’m not very good with medical things, I’m afraid. It all sounds so complicated. Is that something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “GI Endo Test”… yes, that's… an endoscopy. Look, honestly, people worry too much. It could be something, it could be nothing. Depends on what they saw. Did they give you any written results?
PATIENT: They did, actually. Here… it’s all very… detailed. Lots of words I don't understand, and numbers. I tried to read it, but it was a bit overwhelming. Perhaps you could tell me what it says? It has my name and the date… August 2nd, 2025, that’s today, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: August 2nd, yes, fine. Hmm. "Mild erythema in the antrum, no visible lesions..." Erythema is just redness. Antrum is part of the stomach. No lesions is good. Basically… a little irritation. Probably stress, or something you ate. Are you prone to heartburn?
PATIENT: Heartburn? Not particularly, Doctor. I get a little indigestion sometimes, especially if I eat something spicy, but it’s never been… troublesome. It doesn’t keep me up at night or anything. It just… feels a bit uncomfortable for a short while. So, redness… is that bad? Is it something I need to worry about? I’ve been feeling a little tired lately, but I thought that was just from my age.
DOCTOR: Look, everyone gets tired when they get older. The redness… it’s not ideal, but it's common. We see it all the time. You’re a thin woman, aren’t you?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Always have been, I suppose. My weight hasn’t changed much in years. Is that… connected to the redness, do you think? Perhaps I’m not eating enough of something? I try to eat a balanced diet… mostly vegetables and fish, what my late husband used to cook.
DOCTOR: Balanced diet… right. Look, sometimes thin people have… more sensitive stomachs. It could be an ulcer, could be nothing. Let's just get you started on a proton pump inhibitor. It’ll reduce the acid. Take one tablet before breakfast for a month. See if that helps. If you’re still feeling tired, or if you start getting stomach pain, then we’ll talk. Any allergies I should know about?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not to medications, not to food, nothing. A proton pump inhibitor… that sounds like a big word. Is that a pill? And how will it help with the tiredness, if it’s the redness causing that? I just… I’m a little confused about how all of this connects. And if it doesn’t help, what happens then?
DOCTOR: It's a pill, yes. It reduces stomach acid. It won’t directly fix the tiredness, but if your stomach is bothering you, it might help you feel better overall. And if it doesn't work… we'll do more tests. Is there a family history of… anything?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother had some stomach troubles when she was older, but I don’t recall what exactly. Mostly just indigestion, I think. And she was a very anxious woman, so perhaps it was related to that. My father was quite healthy, really, lived to be 85. No stomach problems that I’m aware of. You’re not… worried about something serious, are you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Look, it’s unlikely. But you're thin, you're older… we have to rule things out. Take the pill. Come back in a month. If you start vomiting blood, or if you have black, tarry stools, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just see how it goes. Any other questions?
PATIENT: Vomiting blood… Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. And black stools? I’ll certainly remember that. No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Just… thank you for explaining everything. I appreciate it. So, one pill before breakfast… for a month. And then come back and see you again. Is that correct? Perhaps a little reassurance that it’s probably nothing would help me sleep better tonight.
DOCTOR: Yes, one pill. And yes, it's probably nothing. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Ruocco. Have a good day. And thank you again for your time. . .
