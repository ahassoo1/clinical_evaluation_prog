DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I’m Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're 37 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? I’ve got things to do. It’s my stomach. Been…well, it’s been awful. Just constantly going to the bathroom. Everything I eat goes right through me. And nothing seems to help. I’ve tried… things. Over-the-counter stuff. It just doesn’t stop.
DOCTOR: "Things," you say. Very well. While I understand your desire for expediency, Ms. Woodring, a thorough understanding of your symptoms is crucial for accurate care. “Constantly” is a rather vague descriptor. Could you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You need me to count how many times I run to the toilet? Fine. Let me think… at least ten times a day. Sometimes more. And it's not just in the morning, it's all day. It’s been going on for… a week, maybe longer? Honestly, I lost track. It's just miserable. And embarrassing, if you want to know. Is that good enough for you?
DOCTOR: Ten times a day for at least a week. That is more specific, thank you. And I appreciate your candor, Ms. Woodring, though professional detachment requires me to maintain a certain… distance. Now, tell me about the stool itself. Is it watery?
PATIENT: Look, do you really need me to describe my… bathroom habits in detail? It's… water. Mostly water. Sometimes a little… you know. It’s not solid. It hasn’t been solid in days. Does that answer your question? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I’m at a science experiment here.
DOCTOR: A fair assessment, perhaps. However, detail is paramount. Now, have you noticed any blood in the stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Not that I've seen. Look, I'm not exactly staring at it, okay? I just know it's… watery and awful. I wouldn't be here if it wasn’t bothering me, would I? Honestly, this is a waste of my time. I just want something that will stop it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Has there been any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this?
PATIENT: No fever. And no, I haven’t thrown up. Just… really weak. And tired. I don’t have much of an appetite, obviously. Everything feels… sloshy, if that makes sense? It’s just exhausting constantly running to the bathroom, honestly. I’m losing weight. Is that all? Can we please get to the part where you give me something to fix this?
DOCTOR: "Sloshy," noted. And weight loss... approximately how much weight have you lost?
PATIENT: I don’t know, exactly! A few pounds, probably. I haven’t weighed myself regularly. Look, I’m a painter, okay? I’m not sitting around tracking my weight. I just feel… lighter. And my clothes are fitting looser. Honestly, it’s not a huge deal, but it’s definitely noticeable. Can we just… skip the twenty questions and get me a prescription? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, while I understand your impatience, it is my professional duty to gather sufficient information before prescribing medication. It's irresponsible—and potentially harmful—to treat symptoms without attempting to ascertain the underlying cause. Now, let's move onto your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. No. Nothing. Never been sick a day in my life, until this. Look, I'm a healthy person. I work hard, I eat… well, I used to eat, before all this. I don’t have any allergies, I don't take any medications. I haven’t been to the doctor in years. Happy now? Can we please move this along? My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Look, my husband… he passed a few years ago. It was… sudden. Heart. And… my mom’s side? Just regular people. No one ever had… stomach problems or anything. No one was ever sick, really. We’re a strong family. Just… normal. Honestly, this is all so pointless. I feel like you’re just trying to make me relive my life story instead of fixing my stomach. I need something to stop this, and I need it now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I assure you, this questioning is not merely an exercise in biographical recall. It’s essential. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting personal? Really? Look, I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two. Who doesn’t? It's not like I’m an alcoholic or anything. And I certainly don’t drink when I’m sick, which is, conveniently, right now. Is this going anywhere? Because I'm starting to regret coming here. Honestly, I could have just gotten something over the counter and saved myself the aggravation.
DOCTOR: Do you smoke or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Are you serious right now? Look at me! Do I look like someone who smokes or does drugs? I’m a painter. I work with chemicals, sure, but those are for my job. I'm trying to run a business here, not… whatever you're implying. Honestly, this is insulting. I came here because I'm sick, not because I have a secret life I'm hiding. Can we please focus on that? I need a solution, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed to a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your abdomen and palpate it. And, with all due respect, Ms. Woodring, your dismissive attitude is not conducive to effective medical care.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I'm a grown woman, not a child. I'm already uncomfortable enough as it is. Don't expect me to be grateful for this. And please hurry. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, Ms. Woodring, and relax. I'm listening for bowel sounds... They are hyperactive. Increased bowel sounds are consistent with your symptoms. Tenderness… mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No rebound tenderness. No guarding. I'm not detecting any masses. Your abdomen is distended, but not significantly. A stool sample is necessary. I’ll have the nurse provide you with a collection kit. We also need a blood sample to assess for inflammation and dehydration.
PATIENT: Seriously? More tests? Look, I came in here for a quick fix, not a full-blown investigation. A stool sample? A blood sample? That’s… invasive. I’m already feeling awful. Can’t you just give me something to stop the diarrhea, and be done with it? I don’t understand why this has to be so complicated. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. And frankly, I’m starting to feel a little humiliated. Just give me a prescription, please. Anything. I’ll take anything. Just make it stop.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration, but prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis is irresponsible and could potentially mask a more serious underlying condition. While it’s tempting to simply alleviate your symptoms, that would be a disservice to your health. We need to rule out potential causes such as infection, inflammatory bowel disease, or malabsorption issues. I'm going to order a comprehensive stool analysis, a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a C-reactive protein test. These tests will provide valuable information. Pending the results, I can prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication, such as loperamide, to provide some symptomatic relief. However, it is crucial to understand that this is a temporary measure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I’ll do the tests. Just… promise me you’ll actually look at the results. And if it’s something serious, you’ll tell me. I don’t want any surprises. And I want that… loperamide. Now. The sooner I can stop running to the bathroom, the better. Honestly, I’m wasting a whole day on this. A whole day. It’s just… frustrating. Very frustrating. Can we please just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will review the results promptly. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood and provide you with the stool collection kit. The nurse will also explain the proper collection procedure. I am prescribing loperamide 2mg, take two capsules initially, then one capsule after each loose bowel movement, not to exceed eight capsules in 24 hours. Here is the prescription. Please follow the instructions carefully. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in five business days. If your condition worsens, or if you experience fever, bloody stool, or severe abdominal pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… I’ll see the nurse. Thank you. I have to get home. And I really hope this works. Honestly. .
