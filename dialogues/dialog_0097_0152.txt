DOCTOR: Hi Chelise, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Georgiou, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. Hyper… something. I don’t really understand all the medical words, but that’s why I’m here. I want to get it sorted out, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly reasonable. Hyperlipidemia – that's the word you're likely seeing, and it just means high cholesterol. It’s very common, and we can definitely get it sorted out. No need to worry just yet. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I'm glad it's common. Makes me feel a bit better! Let's see… overall health… I think I’m pretty good, for my age. I try to stay active, walk most days. I eat… well, I eat mostly normal food. Not a lot of fast food, I don't think. I live alone, so I cook for myself. Mostly vegetables and chicken, sometimes pasta. Oh, and I do like a little cheese now and then! Is that important?
DOCTOR: Cheese is always important! Don’t feel guilty about enjoying your food. It's good you're active and cooking for yourself – that's a fantastic start. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you’ve ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that’s about it. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, of course. And I had a bad knee a few years back, but I did physiotherapy and it's much better now. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had something with his heart when he was older. But I don’t know exactly what. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, thank you. Family history is important. High blood pressure in your mother and heart issues in your father – we’ll keep that in mind. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Let me see… I take a multivitamin every day, just a basic one. And sometimes, when my knee acts up, I take ibuprofen. Just when it's really sore. Oh, and I used to take something for my digestion, but I stopped that a long time ago. It didn’t seem to be doing much. That's it, I think. Nothing else regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of things, and I've never had trouble with any medicine. I’m pretty lucky, I suppose. Though, I do get bitten by mosquitoes a lot! Does that count?
DOCTOR: Mosquito bites don’t count as an allergy! That’s good to hear about no known allergies. Now, before we talk about the cholesterol specifically, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… okay. Well, like I said, I live alone. I used to work as an aerospace engineer, but I retired a few years ago. I keep busy with gardening, reading, and walking. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple of times a week. I try to stay active and eat well, but I'm not perfect, of course. I do like a good biscuit with my tea!
DOCTOR: Biscuits with tea are essential! That sounds like a very healthy lifestyle overall. Now, one last thing before we move on to the cholesterol results. Can you tell me if you have any pain, discomfort, or other symptoms like shortness of breath or fatigue?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but that's just from gardening, I think. And my knee aches a bit when it's cold, but that’s the old injury. Nothing that keeps me from doing things. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no strange feelings. I feel pretty good, all things considered. I just want to get this cholesterol thing sorted out, so I don't have to worry about it.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you’re generally very healthy, and that’s excellent. Now, let's talk about these cholesterol levels. I've pulled up your lab results here. Your total cholesterol is a bit elevated, and your LDL – that's the "bad" cholesterol – is higher than we’d like. Your HDL – the "good" cholesterol – is a little low. Do you want me to explain what those numbers mean in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I keep hearing those words – LDL and HDL – and I don’t really understand what they do. I know it’s bad to have high cholesterol, but I don’t understand why. And what do we do about it? Is it something I need pills for?
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's break it down. Think of cholesterol as a type of fat that's essential for your body to function. But, like with everything, too much of a good thing can be problematic. There are different types of cholesterol. LDL cholesterol, the “bad” cholesterol, can build up in the walls of your arteries, making them narrow and hard. This can lead to heart disease and stroke. HDL cholesterol, the “good” cholesterol, helps remove LDL cholesterol from the arteries, protecting your heart. Your LDL is a little high, meaning there’s more buildup potential, and your HDL is a little low, meaning you're not removing enough of the bad cholesterol. Now, as for what to do about it... it doesn't necessarily mean pills right away. We usually start with lifestyle modifications. Since you’re already active and eat a relatively healthy diet, we can focus on a few tweaks. We'll discuss dietary changes, like reducing saturated and trans fats and increasing fiber. We can also talk about exercise and weight management. I'd like to repeat the cholesterol test in three months to see if these changes make a difference. If the numbers don't improve, then we can consider medication. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: That makes a lot more sense, thank you for explaining it so clearly. So, it’s not an emergency, and we can try to fix it with food and exercise first. That’s good. Tweaks to my diet… okay. What kind of foods should I be avoiding, exactly? And what about exercise? I already walk most days, is that enough? I suppose I could try to walk a little further, or maybe add some hills.
DOCTOR: Exactly, it’s not an emergency. We have time to make changes and see what happens. Regarding diet, let’s focus on reducing saturated and trans fats. These are often found in red meat, processed foods, fried foods, and full-fat dairy products. Try to choose leaner cuts of meat, baked or grilled instead of fried foods, and low-fat dairy options. Increasing your fiber intake is also helpful. Foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes can help lower cholesterol. As for exercise, walking is a fantastic start! Continuing to walk most days is excellent. Adding some hills or increasing the duration and intensity of your walks would be beneficial. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. I can give you a handout with more detailed information about cholesterol-lowering foods and exercise guidelines. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, please! A handout would be very helpful. I write things down, you know, just to keep track. And it’s good to have a reminder. So, basically, eat less bad stuff, eat more good stuff, and keep walking. That sounds manageable. And just to be clear, are there any foods that I should completely avoid, or is it more about reducing the amount of certain things?
DOCTOR: Exactly! It’s more about reducing the amount of certain things rather than completely eliminating them. A small treat now and then won’t hurt. But consistently eating a diet high in saturated and trans fats will raise your cholesterol levels. Here's the handout. It includes a list of cholesterol-lowering foods, foods to limit, and exercise recommendations. It also has some helpful resources online. I also recommend increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids, found in fatty fish like salmon, tuna, and mackerel. These can also help lower cholesterol. And, as we discussed, we'll repeat the cholesterol test in three months to see how you're doing. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Does that all sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s very clear. Thank you, Dr. Georgiou. You’ve explained everything so well, and I feel much better about it now. I’ll try my best to follow the handout and eat more good stuff and less bad stuff. And I’ll definitely keep walking. Three months, okay. I’ll make a note of that in my calendar. I think that’s everything for now. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chelise. I’m glad I could help. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way. I'll see you in three months! Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your walk.
