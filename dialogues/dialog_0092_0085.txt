DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this patch on my skin. It’s rather unsightly, honestly. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it just doesn’t seem to be going away. It’s not painful, thankfully, but it’s… noticeable.
DOCTOR: I understand. A skin patch that's not going away can certainly be concerning, even if it isn't painful. To get a better understanding, could you tell me where exactly on your body this patch is located?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s on my left forearm, just below the elbow crease. It’s… well, it’s rather a dull color, not quite brown, not quite red. More… muddy, I suppose. And it’s slightly raised. Though, I suppose ‘raised’ is a generous term. It’s not very raised. I just… I don’t like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slightly raised, muddy-colored patch on your left forearm below the elbow crease. And you've noticed this for a few weeks now, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Perhaps three? I try to keep track of these things, you know. One doesn’t want things… progressing. It hasn’t changed size, thankfully. It’s about the size of a quarter, maybe a little smaller. I’ve been… observing it closely.
DOCTOR: That's good that it hasn’t changed in size. Observing it closely is a very sensible thing to do. Have you noticed any itching, bleeding, or crusting associated with this patch at all?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Absolutely not. It’s just… there. It doesn’t bother me, precisely, but it’s… aesthetically displeasing. And, well, one never knows, does one? I'd rather be safe than sorry, I always say. It’s not like I’m prone to dramatic illnesses, but one can’t be too careful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It’s always best to get things checked out, even if they don’t seem serious. And you’re right, it’s good to be proactive. Now, let's move on to some general questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. Let me think. No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not even bee stings. My mother always said I had a constitution of steel. Though, I suppose that was mostly her boasting. I do prefer natural remedies when possible, though. Less… interference with the body, you understand. I've had no reactions to any medications I’ve taken, if that’s what you mean. A little bit of ibuprofen for headaches now and then, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies and you tolerate ibuprofen well. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements on a regular basis?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I really try to get everything I need from my diet. My husband, bless his heart, keeps trying to get me to take a multivitamin, says I’m “lacking in essential nutrients”, whatever that means. But I tell him a good, hearty borscht has everything one could possibly need. And a bit of sour cream, of course. So, no. Just the borscht. Occasionally some herbal tea for… calming purposes. But that's hardly a medication, is it?
DOCTOR: Borscht sounds wonderful, and I certainly don’t disagree with a good, balanced diet. Herbal tea for calming purposes is fine as well. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My past medical history? It’s… rather unremarkable, truthfully. I’ve always been quite healthy. Childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps, chickenpox, the usual. But nothing serious. No surgeries, no hospitalizations… I broke my wrist once, when I was a child, climbing a tree, but that hardly counts. My husband keeps a very detailed medical record, actually. He’s a bit… obsessive about these things. He’ll likely have a more comprehensive list if you require it. But as far as I know, I’ve always been in perfectly good health. A bit of seasonal allergies in the spring, perhaps, but nothing that a good cup of tea can’t fix.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No major medical issues, surgeries, or hospitalizations. And seasonal allergies are quite common. It sounds like you’ve been very fortunate with your health. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. That’s… a bit more complicated. My mother’s side, they were all quite robust, lived to be very old. Mostly farmers, you see. Very little in the way of illness. My father’s side… well, he came from a city. A bit more… delicate, shall we say? His mother had some trouble with her heart, I believe. And his brother had something… I can’t quite recall what it was. Something with his lungs, perhaps? My husband has all the details, naturally. He’s been tracing our genealogy for years. It’s quite… extensive. But as far as I know, nothing that directly affects me. No cancer, no diabetes… just a general predisposition to… worrying, perhaps. That runs in the family, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart issues on your father’s side, and a possible lung condition. And a family tendency to worry, which I can certainly relate to – it's good you're being proactive about this patch. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, absolutely not. Smoking? Never. Alcohol? Only a small glass of wine with dinner, very occasionally. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! That’s quite… scandalous, isn’t it? I’ve always lived a very… temperate life, you see. My husband and I, we enjoy gardening, reading, quiet evenings at home. We take very good care of ourselves. It’s simply not in our nature to indulge in such… excesses. We find plenty of enjoyment in simple pleasures. A good book, a warm cup of tea, a beautiful garden… those are the things that truly matter. So, no. Not at all. A very healthy lifestyle, you see. Very, very healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. A healthy lifestyle is certainly key. Now, before I take a look at the patch, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical exam is perfectly fine. Though, I assure you, I’m in perfectly good health. Still, one can never be too careful, can one? I’m quite used to doctor visits, my husband insists on annual check-ups for everyone, even the cat. So, yes, please. Go ahead. Though, I do hope it won’t be too… disruptive. I have a rather important rose bush that needs pruning later this afternoon. But, of course, health comes first.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick as possible. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and a look at the patch on your forearm. Alright, your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, this patch… it's approximately one centimeter in diameter. It’s slightly raised, with a somewhat irregular border. The color is a muted reddish-brown. It’s firm to the touch, and doesn’t appear to be actively inflamed. No obvious signs of infection. Do you feel any tenderness when I press on it?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Not even the slightest bit. It doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t itch, it doesn’t burn… it simply is. I told you, it’s rather perplexing. It's just… there. It's quite… obstinate, isn’t it? You’d think something would do something, wouldn’t you? It’s rather unnerving, just sitting there. But no, it’s perfectly placid. Perfectly… unmoving. It’s rather strange, really. And you say it’s irregular? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound promising, does it? Is it something serious, Doctor? Please tell me it’s not something serious. My roses are counting on me, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Bartock. The irregular border is just something I note as part of the exam. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. Based on what I’m seeing, it could be a number of things – a benign skin growth, a localized reaction, or even a mild form of dermatitis. To be certain, I’d like to order a biopsy of the patch. This will involve taking a small sample of the skin and sending it to a lab for analysis. It’s a quick and relatively painless procedure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh dear. A biopsy sounds… rather invasive, doesn’t it? Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? Couldn’t we just… monitor it a bit longer? Perhaps apply some cream? I’m not particularly fond of needles, you see. And the thought of a lab… well, it’s not a very pleasant image. My husband always says I have a delicate constitution. I suppose that's why he's so meticulous about these things. Is there any way we could avoid it? I really don’t want to disrupt my gardening schedule. The roses are in full bloom, you see, and they require constant attention. Perhaps if we just watched it for another week or two… would that be possible? I do hope it's not something too concerning. My peace of mind is rather fragile, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Bartock. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel apprehensive about a biopsy. However, given the irregular border, it’s the most responsible course of action to rule out anything concerning. It’s a small procedure, and we can use a local anesthetic to minimize any discomfort. Think of it as a precaution. It will give us a definitive answer, and allow you to have peace of mind, one way or another. If the biopsy reveals it to be benign, then you can continue enjoying your gardening without worry. If it's something else, we can address it promptly and effectively. I wouldn't recommend a biopsy unless I felt it was necessary for your health and well-being. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, when you put it that way… I suppose you’re right. Peace of mind is rather important. And I do hate the thought of it… progressing. My husband would be terribly upset if I neglected to get it checked out. He’s very insistent on these things, you see. Alright. Alright, I suppose I can agree to a biopsy. But please, be gentle. And make sure the anesthetic is… effective. I really don’t want to feel a thing. And could you explain the procedure to me? In detail, please. I need to know exactly what’s going to happen. And how long it will take. And what the recovery process will be like. I do hate being kept in the dark. It unnerves me so. My roses are counting on me, you see. And I need to be able to tend to them.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. I'll explain everything in detail. The biopsy itself is a very quick procedure. First, I’ll clean the area around the patch with an antiseptic solution. Then, I’ll inject a small amount of local anesthetic – lidocaine – into the skin to numb it completely. You might feel a brief sting with the injection, but that should subside quickly. Once the area is numb, I’ll use a small, sterile instrument – a punch biopsy tool – to remove a tiny sample of the skin. It’s about the size of a pencil eraser. You shouldn’t feel any pain during this part. After the sample is removed, I’ll apply a small bandage to the area to stop any bleeding. The whole procedure usually takes about 15-20 minutes. After the biopsy, you might experience some mild discomfort, redness, and swelling at the site. You can manage this with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen. I’ll give you specific instructions on how to care for the wound – keep it clean and dry, and apply a bandage daily. The sample will be sent to a lab for analysis, and we should have the results back in about a week or two. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the next steps. Do you have any questions about the procedure so far?
PATIENT: A week or two? Oh dear. That seems rather a long time to wait. But alright. A week or two, I suppose. And the bandage… how often will I need to change it? And what if it… bleeds? I do tend to bleed easily, you see. And what if it gets infected? I worry terribly about infections. And what if… what if it's something serious? My husband will be terribly upset if it's something serious. He worries so much about my health, you see. He’s a very anxious man. And will it leave a scar? I do try to maintain a youthful appearance, you see. I do so much gardening, and I don’t want a unsightly scar on my arm. A scar would ruin everything. I do hope it won’t leave a scar.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Bartock. Let's address them one by one. You're right, a week or two can seem like a long time to wait, but that's the standard turnaround time for lab results. We'll contact you as soon as we have them. Regarding the bandage, you should change it daily, or whenever it becomes wet or dirty. I'll provide you with sterile bandages and instructions on how to properly care for the wound. If it does bleed a little, apply gentle pressure with a clean gauze pad for a few minutes. That should stop the bleeding. As for infection, that's a rare occurrence, but if you notice any signs of infection – increased redness, swelling, pain, or pus – please contact us immediately. Regarding the possibility of a serious result, I want to assure you that we'll be with you every step of the way. If it is something serious, we'll discuss all your treatment options and create a plan that's right for you. And finally, regarding scarring, it's possible that a small scar will remain, but it will be minimal. We'll use proper wound care techniques to minimize scarring, and there are also treatments available to help fade scars if necessary. It will likely be a very small, faint scar that will be barely noticeable. I want to reiterate that we'll be with you throughout this entire process, and we'll do everything we can to ensure a positive outcome. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Minimal scarring, you say? That’s good. Very good. And you’ll be with me, you say? Every step of the way? My husband will be so relieved to hear that. He worries terribly about me, you see. He’s a very anxious man. Alright. Alright, I suppose I’ll agree to the biopsy. But I do hope it won’t take too long. And I do hope it won’t hurt. And I do hope it won’t leave a scar. When can we schedule it? And what should I wear? I do have a rather sensitive complexion, you see, and I don’t want to irritate it. And what if I… faint? I do have a tendency to faint when I’m nervous. Perhaps I should bring my smelling salts?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you’ve decided to proceed. We can schedule the biopsy for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. It usually doesn’t take very long – about 15-20 minutes, as I mentioned. As for what to wear, comfortable clothing is best. Something loose-fitting, so we can easily access your arm. And yes, bringing your smelling salts is a very good idea – it’s always best to be prepared. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the entire procedure. I’ll explain everything every step of the way, and we can stop at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. We’ll have you lie down on a comfortable exam table, and I’ll make sure you’re properly positioned. Then, I’ll clean the area around the patch and inject the local anesthetic. We’ll monitor your blood pressure and pulse throughout the procedure, and we’ll have everything ready in case you do feel faint. We’ll also have a nurse present to assist us, so you’ll have plenty of support. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds alright, I suppose. A nurse present… that’s good. Very good. My husband will be so relieved to hear that. Tomorrow morning… alright. What time should I arrive? And should I eat breakfast? I do have a rather delicate stomach, you see, and I don’t want to upset it. And should I take my medication? I do take a small dose of chamomile tea for anxiety, you see. And what if… what if it’s something really, really serious? I do hate thinking about it, but I can’t help but worry. My husband… he’ll be devastated. And will I be able to drive myself home afterwards? I do have a rather long drive, you see, and I don’t want to risk an accident. Perhaps I should ask my husband to accompany me. He worries so much about me, you see. He's a very anxious man.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s address all of your questions. We can schedule the biopsy for 9:00 AM tomorrow morning. That will give you plenty of time to get here without feeling rushed. You can eat a light breakfast if you’d like, but avoid anything too heavy or greasy. And yes, you can definitely take your chamomile tea. It’s perfectly fine. Regarding the possibility of a serious result, I want to assure you that we’ll be with you every step of the way. We’ll discuss all your treatment options and create a plan that’s right for you. We’ll also provide you with resources and support. And finally, regarding driving yourself home, I would recommend having someone accompany you, especially given your long drive. It’s best to avoid driving if you’re feeling anxious or tired. Your husband would be a wonderful companion. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Bartock, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to make this process as comfortable and stress-free as possible. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. You’ve answered everything, I suppose. Alright. 9:00 AM tomorrow morning. Husband accompanying me. Chamomile tea. Light breakfast. And you’ll be there, you say? Every step of the way? That’s… reassuring. Very reassuring. And you’ll explain everything? In detail? That’s good. Very good. My husband… he worries so much about details. And the nurse will be there, too? That’s… good. Very good. Alright. I suppose I’m ready. As ready as I’ll ever be, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being so… patient. You’ve been very kind. Very, very kind. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Bartock. It’s my pleasure. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that you're in good hands. We'll take excellent care of you tomorrow. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And please, try to get a good night’s sleep. We’ll see you tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM.
