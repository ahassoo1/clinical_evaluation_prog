DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe I have a clearance appointment scheduled? My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I’m afraid I don’t recall all the specifics.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that here. You're scheduled for a surgical clearance. That's right. We just need to go through a little bit of your medical history and do a quick exam to make sure you're healthy enough for the procedure. No worries at all if you don’t remember everything—we’ll take it slow. To start, could you tell me a little bit about why you're planning to have surgery?
PATIENT: It’s… it’s a bit personal, but… my husband, he passed away last year. And… he always admired a certain feature of mine. He loved my… well, my face. After he was gone… I just… I lost a lot of myself, I think. And I’d like to… feel like myself again. The surgery is… to change something about my appearance, something he really liked. It feels silly saying it out loud, but… it would mean a lot to me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mackenzi. That’s very brave of you, and it doesn't sound silly at all. It's perfectly understandable to want to honor his memory in a way that feels right to you, and to seek comfort and healing through this process. It’s important to me that you feel supported in whatever you choose. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, I generally feel… okay. I work outside a lot, landscaping, so I’m fairly active, I suppose. I don’t get sick often, but… I did have a bout of the flu last winter, nothing serious, I don’t think. And… I have private insurance, if that’s helpful. Honestly, I don’t really go to the doctor unless something is really wrong. I don’t recall having any major illnesses or surgeries before… besides, perhaps, a few childhood things? My memory is just… patchy, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Working outdoors keeps you active, that’s good. And having private insurance simplifies things. Don't worry about the patchy memory; we'll work through it. Let’s try to fill in some gaps then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… no, I don’t think so. I’ve never been told I have that. Diabetes… my mother had that, but I don’t believe I’ve ever been tested. And asthma… no, I’ve always been able to breathe pretty easily. Although… I did have some trouble breathing a few years ago, after a particularly bad pollen season. But it went away on its own. It wasn’t… a constant thing. I really wish I could remember more details, I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. These things happen. It's good you mentioned the trouble breathing during pollen season; we can explore that a bit later, just to be thorough. Okay, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I might take ibuprofen occasionally for a headache, but that’s about it. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements regularly. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Fresh fruits and vegetables when I can get them. Although… my neighbor gave me some herbal tea a few weeks ago, for sleep. I’ve only had it once or twice. It tasted… minty? I don’t remember the name of it. It’s probably nothing important.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Even seemingly harmless things like herbal teas can sometimes interact with anesthesia, so it's always good to mention them. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction. I’m a little sensitive to bee stings, but it’s just localized swelling, nothing life-threatening. And I don’t have any known food allergies. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy after using certain soaps, but that’s about it. I did have a rash once, years ago, after using a new sunscreen. But I don’t recall the brand. It was… a red, bumpy rash. It went away after a few days. I’m really trying to remember everything, but it’s so difficult.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly alright to not remember everything. We’ll take our time. The bee sting sensitivity and the rash from the sunscreen are good things to note. Alright, let’s move on to a little bit about your past. Have you ever had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I recall, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I think. But that was… a very long time ago. And… I had a few stitches once, when I fell off my bicycle. But that’s about it. Nothing major. I’m almost certain I haven’t had any other surgeries. My husband… he would have remembered if I had. He remembered everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils as a child and a few stitches. That's helpful. And it's perfectly understandable to lean on memories like that, especially when remembering things from a long time ago. Now, thinking about your family, do you have a history of any significant medical conditions – like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or mental health issues – in your parents, siblings, or grandparents?
PATIENT: Oh, um… my mother had diabetes, as I mentioned before. She passed away a few years ago. And… my father had heart problems. He had a stroke, I think. He passed away when I was quite young, actually. As for my grandparents… I didn’t know them very well. My mother didn’t talk about them much. I think my grandmother had… high blood pressure? But I’m not sure. And… my uncle on my father’s side had some mental health issues, I believe. He was… a bit eccentric. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more specific. My family wasn’t very forthcoming with medical information, if you know what I mean. It was… a bit of a taboo topic.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. Many families are like that. It’s good to know about your mother’s diabetes, your father’s stroke, and the uncle’s mental health issues. That gives us something to work with. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, as I said, I work outside a lot. Landscaping is… physically demanding. I’m on my feet all day, lifting things, digging… it keeps me active, definitely. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol occasionally—a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but it’s not always easy when you’re working long hours. I don’t have many hobbies, to be honest. I used to enjoy gardening, but… it feels a bit strange now. It’s mostly just work, really. And… trying to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. You lead an active lifestyle, which is excellent. And you don’t smoke, and you only drink occasionally. That’s all very positive. It sounds like work takes up most of your time and energy, which is perfectly understandable. Alright, Mackenzi, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks healthy. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. Please. I just… I hope everything is okay. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Great. Just relax. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Just breathe normally. … 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not concerning given your activity level. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths for me… in and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now I'm just going to take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat… Ears look normal. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Everything looks good so far. And finally, I'll just palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. That feels… normal. It just… feels a little strange, that’s all. No, everything feels alright. It's just… I’m a little nervous, I suppose. I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It helps.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's perfectly normal to be nervous. Everything feels normal on my exam, Mackenzi. No immediate concerns. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. Given your history, and the fact you are scheduled for surgery, I think it would be wise to order a few routine blood tests. Just to check your overall health and make sure everything is functioning properly. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel would be a good start. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you recommend, then yes, please. Blood tests are fine. I just want to make sure everything is okay, so I can… move forward. When can I expect the results? And… what happens next?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll send the orders to the lab right away. They usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have the results, I’ll review them and contact you to discuss them in detail. Assuming the results come back normal, we can proceed with your surgical clearance. That involves a consultation with the surgeon to discuss the procedure itself, and to make sure you understand the risks and benefits. Do you have a surgeon already scheduled?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Not yet. I… I haven’t gotten that far. I was hoping to get the clearance first, before scheduling anything. I'm not sure who to choose, to be honest. My friend recommended someone, but… I haven't had a chance to research them yet. Do you have any recommendations, Doctor? Or… can you perhaps connect me with someone you trust?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I have a few colleagues who are excellent surgeons. Dr. Ramirez specializes in facial plastic surgery and has a very good reputation. Dr. Chen is also highly skilled, and focuses more on reconstructive surgery. Both are board certified and have extensive experience. I can give you their contact information, and you can schedule a consultation with whichever surgeon you feel most comfortable with. I’ll also send you some information about preparing for the surgery, once you’ve chosen a surgeon. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… wonderful. Thank you so much, Doctor. That would be incredibly helpful. Dr. Ramirez sounds… promising. Perhaps I’ll start with her. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, and for the recommendations. Is there anything else I need to do, before I leave? Or… any paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the lab order and Dr. Ramirez’s contact information printed out for you. And there’s a consent form for the blood tests that just needs a signature. It's just standard procedure. Other than that, no, that’s all for today. Just try to relax and get some rest. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll be in touch as soon as the lab results are back.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I feel much better now, knowing what to expect. I will definitely call if I have any questions. And… I look forward to hearing from you soon. Have a good day, Doctor Tosca.
