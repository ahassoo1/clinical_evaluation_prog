DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon to you too, Doctor. Kalinski, you say? Hmm. Well, I’m here… for the… the thing. The sports thing. My… someone told me I needed a check-up before I try out. It’s for a… a team. A baseball team, I think. It’s been a long time, you see. A long time.
DOCTOR: I see. A pre-participation physical exam for a baseball team. Excellent. It’s wise to get a check-up before starting any new athletic endeavor, especially after a long break. To get a better understanding of your current health status, could you tell me a bit more about when you last participated in sports, and what your activity level has been like since then?
PATIENT: Activity level…? Oh, boy. That’s a… a question. It was… a while ago. Back in… the eighties, maybe? I played a little softball with some fellas, here and there. But that was… before the divorce, I think. Since then… not much. Mostly just… around the house. You know, fixing things. I do a little work for folks sometimes, but it’s not like running around a field, Doctor. Definitely not. I don't remember how good I was back then either, to be honest. It's all a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, primarily a sedentary lifestyle for the past several decades, with some occasional light physical activity with home repairs and odd jobs. That’s helpful to know. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…? Hmm. Let me think. The doctor… the one before… he said something about my… my pressure. High pressure, I think. But I don’t really feel sick. I take a little pill every day, a white one. But that was… years ago. And my back… it gets a little stiff sometimes, after I’ve been bending over fixing things. That’s about it, I think. Nothing… serious. I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension, managed with medication, and some occasional back stiffness. Thank you. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medication…? Oh, goodness. Names… I never was good with names. It’s a little white pill. Small. I get it… from the drugstore. Every month. I ask the lady there, she knows me. I wouldn’t know the name if you paid me. It’s just… the white pill. That's all I know, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s alright, Mr. Bartok. We can likely get the name from your pharmacy records. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital…? Now that… that was a long time ago. When I was a kid, I broke my arm. Fell out of a tree. They put a cast on it. And… hmm. I think my wife… she had to go to the hospital once, but that wasn’t me. No, I haven’t been in the hospital myself, not since… not since I was a boy. Surgery… no. Never had surgery. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations as an adult, and a childhood broken arm. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, boy. That’s… a tough one. My mother… she lived a long time. But she… she had problems with her… her feet. Always complaining about her feet. And my father… he worked hard. Very hard. He died… young, I think. Something with his heart, maybe? I don't really know. We didn't talk about things much back then. They were… old-fashioned people, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. So a maternal history of foot problems and a paternal history of possible heart issues. That’s helpful, even with limited information. Now, have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Let me think… No, not really. I don't think so. I eat pretty much anything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy after I've been working in the yard, with the… with the weeds, but that’s just from the plants, I think. Not an allergy. No, Doctor. I’m not allergic to anything. Well, I don't believe I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, Mr. Bartok, are you currently taking any other medications besides the white pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think carefully… No. Just the white pill. Sometimes I take something for my back, when it's really stiff. But that's just… over-the-counter. You buy it at the drugstore, you know? It's a little red tablet, I think. But that's only when I really need it. It's not every day. Not like the white pill. The white pill is… regular. Everything else is… occasional.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the white pill daily for blood pressure and an occasional over-the-counter medication for back pain. That gives me a good overview of your current medications. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? That’s… a broad question, Doctor. I live alone. I watch a little television. I fix things for people when they ask. I try to stay busy. I drink a little coffee in the morning. I used to… I used to go dancing with my wife. But that was a long time ago. It’s a… a quiet life, you see. Not very exciting.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a comfortable life, Mr. Bartok. And it’s good to stay active when you can. Now, have you ever smoked cigarettes or used any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoked…? Oh, yes. When I was young, everyone smoked. It was… normal. I smoked for… a long time. But I quit. A long time ago. Maybe twenty years? I don’t remember exactly. The doctor… the one before, he told me to quit. So I did. It was… hard, but I did it. Never touched one since. No, I don’t smoke.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Bartok. Quitting smoking is a wonderful accomplishment. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol…? Just a little. Sometimes I have a glass of wine with dinner. Or a beer. But not every day. Not like… some people. Just… occasionally. It helps me relax, you see. But I don’t… I don’t drink much. Really. A little glass now and then. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol consumption. Now, finally, are you currently employed, and if so, what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: Employed… hmm. I do a little work for folks. Fixing things. Plumbing, mostly. Little jobs around the house. I used to work construction, a long time ago. But I don't do much heavy lifting anymore. Just… odd jobs. It keeps me busy, you see. It's not a… a regular job. More like… helping out.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bartok. That gives me a very good overview of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your current health status. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… don’t expect too much, you see? I’m not in the best of shape these days. But go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll take things at your pace. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Deep breath… like this? Is that right, Doctor? I haven’t had anyone listen to my chest in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Mr. Bartok. Just breathe normally. I’m hearing a little bit of wheezing in your lungs, which could be related to several things. I’m also checking your back now, noting any tenderness. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right there. That’s… that’s where it gets stiff. Sometimes it hurts to bend over. It’s been bothering me for… a while now. Not constant, you see? Just… when I move a certain way. Or after I’ve been working. That's the spot. Definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting some tenderness in your lower back. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let's check your pulse and temperature. Pulse is 76 and temperature is normal. Finally, I'll just quickly check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Whoa! That’s… that’s a bit startling, Doctor. It’s been a long time since someone did that. Everything feels a little… shaky. Is that normal? I used to be stronger, you see. Much stronger.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a normal response, Mr. Bartok. It just checks your reflexes. It’s good that they are still responsive. Everything seems to be within normal limits for your age, though we do need to address your slightly elevated blood pressure and the tenderness in your lower back. Given your history and the findings of today’s exam, I'm concerned about potential musculoskeletal issues and the need for better blood pressure control. I recommend the following: 1. Blood Pressure Monitoring: I would like you to monitor your blood pressure at home twice daily for a week and bring me the readings. 2. Physical Therapy: A referral to physical therapy would be beneficial to address your lower back pain and improve your strength and flexibility. 3. Follow-up Appointment: I would like to see you back in two weeks to discuss your blood pressure readings and how you're progressing with physical therapy. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm. Monitoring my blood pressure… I suppose I can do that. My daughter has one of those machines, I think. Physical therapy… that sounds like a lot of work, Doctor. But I suppose if it helps my back… And two weeks…? Alright. That sounds… reasonable. But… what about the baseball tryout? Can I still… try out? I don’t want to miss it. It’s been a long time coming, you see. A very long time.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Bartok. Given your history and the findings today, I would strongly advise against participating in any strenuous physical activity, including the baseball tryout, until we've had a chance to assess your blood pressure control and address your back pain with physical therapy. Attempting a tryout in your current condition could potentially lead to injury, or exacerbate any underlying health issues. We need to prioritize your health and safety first. Once we’ve gotten your blood pressure under control and you’ve made some progress with physical therapy, we can reassess your ability to participate in sports. We can even discuss a gradual return-to-play plan if appropriate. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: …Alright, Doctor. You’re right. I suppose you’re right. It's… disappointing, but I don't want to risk getting hurt. My health is more important. Okay. No tryout. For now. Blood pressure monitoring and… physical therapy. I’ll do it. But please… please keep me updated on the possibility of… of getting back into shape. It means a lot to me, you see. A lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bartok. I understand how important this is to you, and I will certainly do everything I can to help you achieve your goals, safely and effectively. We will monitor your progress closely and reassess your ability to participate in sports as you improve. I’ll write you a referral to a highly-rated physical therapy clinic nearby, and I’ll give you a sheet with instructions on how to monitor your blood pressure at home. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss your findings. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. You’ve been very… thorough. And patient. I appreciate that. It’s been a long time since someone took the time to… to really listen. Alright. I’ll go get the referral. And I’ll start monitoring my blood pressure. Thank you, Doctor Kalinski. I… I feel a little better now. Even without the tryout.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bartok. It was my pleasure. Remember, we are a team in this. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. .
PATIENT: I will, Doctor. Thank you again. .
