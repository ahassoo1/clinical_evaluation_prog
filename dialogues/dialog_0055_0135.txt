DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is my ear. It... how you say... leaking something. For maybe three days now. It not hurt, just... wet.
DOCTOR: Leaking, you say. Three days. And no pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No pain. Just... the wetness. It is…uncomfortable, yes. Like something is in there, but not sore. I clean it with tissue, but it keeps coming back. It is clear, Doctor. Not blood, not yellow. Clear.
DOCTOR: Clear fluid… I see. And has this happened before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, never. I have had… small problems with ear before. When I was young, maybe. But nothing like this. This is new. I… I was teaching a class yesterday. Maybe something got in then? But I do not think so. I wear these, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hearing aids, yes. Alright. We'll need to take a closer look, naturally. It is possible something could have entered the ear canal. Please lie down on the examination table, if you would. I'm going to use an otoscope to examine your ear canal and eardrum. It won’t hurt, but please remain still.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Still I can be. No problem. Is…is it cold, Doctor? This…thing? The otoscope?
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be cold, Mr. Radillo, but you may feel a slight sensation of pressure. Just relax, and let me know if you experience any discomfort. Hmm. The left ear canal appears slightly…inflamed. And there is some clear fluid present, as you described. The tympanic membrane—that’s the eardrum—appears intact, but slightly…bulging. It’s difficult to get a clear view with the inflammation, but I don’t see any obvious foreign body at this time. Now, let’s take a look at the right ear.
PATIENT: Right ear is the same, I think. No pain in either. Just… wet. Is bulging bad, Doctor? What does that mean? I…I am not good with these things. My field is history, not… ears.
DOCTOR: You are quite right; the right ear presents similarly to the left. Slight inflammation and clear fluid, and some bulging of the tympanic membrane. Bulging, Mr. Radillo, can indicate a buildup of pressure within the middle ear. This could be due to a number of factors. It's not immediately alarming, but it does warrant further investigation. Based on your description and my preliminary examination, it's likely you have otitis media with effusion – fluid in the middle ear – but without an acute infection at present. However, to rule out other possibilities and assess the extent of the effusion, I'd like to order a tympanometry test. This is a quick, painless test that measures the movement of your eardrum and helps us understand how well your middle ear is functioning. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A test, yes. That is…good. I do not want to ignore it. Tympanometry. Is that…difficult? I have appointments all week. But I can make time if it is important. And it does not hurt? You said painless. I just… want to be sure. This history… it is important to me. I do not want to miss things because of…ears.
DOCTOR: It is a very simple test, Mr. Radillo, and shouldn’t interfere with your schedule in the least. It involves a small probe being placed in your ear canal – similar to the otoscope – and a puff of air is gently blown to measure the eardrum’s response. It takes only a few minutes per ear, and is entirely painless. The results will help us determine the best course of action. If the effusion is significant, we may need to consider a referral to an audiologist. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We will start with the tympanometry test and proceed from there. I will have the nurse schedule you for tympanometry at our clinic tomorrow morning. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning is… acceptable. Yes. As long as it is not too early. I need time to… prepare my thoughts. And is there anything I should do before the test? Anything to avoid? I drink tea… is that bad? I have many questions, I am sorry. But it is important to know.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Mr. Radillo. It is my job to address your concerns. There is no need to avoid tea, or any other beverage for that matter. The only preparation is to simply arrive on time and be prepared to sit quietly for a few minutes while the test is conducted. The nurse will provide you with specific instructions when she calls to confirm your appointment. We’ll get you scheduled for a time that allows for your morning routine. For now, I recommend simply avoiding getting any water in your ears, if possible. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Water…yes. I shower. That is…water. And I sometimes swim. Not often, but… Is swimming very bad? Will it make it worse? Maybe I should stop until we know more? And the nurse… she will tell me about the appointment time? Not you?
DOCTOR: Yes, swimming and showering could potentially exacerbate the fluid buildup, Mr. Radillo. While it’s not absolutely necessary to cease all activity, I would advise against prolonged immersion in water until we have the results of the tympanometry. A quick shower is likely fine, but avoid swimming and diving, if possible. The nurse will contact you directly to schedule the appointment and provide any further instructions. I will review the results of the test, and then we can discuss the best course of action. Are there any other specific concerns you would like to address before I conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have been… very thorough. Thank you. And tell the nurse… not too early, please. I appreciate your time. And I will avoid swimming. For now.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will take your preference into account when scheduling your appointment. She is quite efficient. If you experience any worsening of symptoms – such as pain, fever, or hearing loss – please do not hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, we will see you tomorrow morning. Have a pleasant day, Mr. Radillo.
