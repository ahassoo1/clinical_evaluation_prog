DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my face. It gets… red. Flushes, you know? Like when you’re embarrassed, but… not always from embarrassment. It just happens. Been happening a few weeks now, maybe a little longer. It’s a little bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand. A facial flushing that occurs independent of embarrassment – that’s certainly something we should investigate. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Hard to say exactly when it started, honestly. I don’t keep good track of dates. But it's definitely been happening more often lately. Mostly in the evenings, I think. Sometimes after I eat. Not always, though. And not everything I eat. It's… confusing.
DOCTOR: That is a bit puzzling, yes. The fact that it's not consistently related to food makes it a little more difficult to pinpoint. Could you describe what the flushing feels like?
PATIENT: Well… warm. Very warm. Starts on my cheeks, usually. Then my neck. Sometimes my ears get hot too. It doesn’t itch or anything. Just… heat. And it feels like… everyone is looking at me. Even when they aren’t, I think. It makes me a little… uneasy.
DOCTOR: I see. Warmth starting on the cheeks and neck, potentially involving the ears, and a sense of self-consciousness along with it. And you mentioned it happens more often in the evenings?
PATIENT: Yes, evenings. After work, mostly. I’m a counselor, you see. I help people with… problems. It’s good work, but it can be tiring. I sit with them, listen to their stories. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don't know. It just started around the time things got really busy at the office.
DOCTOR: That’s a very insightful observation, Mr. Withycombe. Being a counselor, absorbing the emotions and stressors of others, could certainly contribute. Let's explore that further. Aside from the flushing, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think. Sometimes my heart feels like it’s beating a little fast. Not racing, just… noticeable. And maybe a little bit of sweating. Mostly just on my forehead. It's not much, really. I always carry a handkerchief, just in case. No dizziness or anything like that. Just… warm face and a little bit of fast heartbeat.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have the flushing, a slightly elevated heart rate, and some mild sweating. No dizziness, that’s good. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. My wife, she took care of all that. After she passed… well, I just didn't bother. I try to stay healthy, eat good food, get enough sleep. But I haven't had any… serious problems. No high blood pressure or anything like that. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s admirable that you prioritize your health through lifestyle choices. And I appreciate you sharing that about your wife. We can certainly catch up on your medical history today. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. And no hospital stays. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but that’s it. Just a cast for a few weeks. Nothing serious. Mostly, I just try to avoid getting sick. I don't like doctors, if I'm being honest. But this flushing… it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Withycombe. It’s perfectly understandable to feel apprehensive about seeking medical attention. We will take things at your pace. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had… diabetes, I think. And my father, he had problems with his heart, later in life. My sister, she's healthy as a horse. Always has been. But my mother's diabetes… that's the only thing I can really remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And very little alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, once in a while. I don't drink often. And absolutely no drugs. Never have. I’m a counselor, remember? I help people with those problems.
DOCTOR: Of course, I remember. And that’s excellent. Now, finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife used to say I had a cast iron stomach. She made wonderful food, though. Spicy Indian dishes… I miss her cooking. But no, no allergies. I can eat anything, drink anything, without any problems.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Withycombe. That gives me a good overview of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s causing this flushing. It’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. But I'm ready to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… Excellent. Your blood pressure is 138/82. That’s slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, let me listen to your heart… Deep breaths, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. I’m now examining your skin. I notice some mild redness on your cheeks and neck, but no rash or any other visible abnormalities. I do note some telangiectasia, small visible blood vessels, on your cheeks. Okay, Mr. Withycombe. Everything seems normal overall, but the elevated blood pressure and the telangiectasia are worth noting. Based on your history and this brief exam, the flushing could be related to several factors, including rosacea, a common skin condition, or possibly hormonal changes. The slightly elevated blood pressure could also be contributing. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a hormone level assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Blood tests are fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. Rosacea… is that serious? And hormonal changes… I’m a bit old for those, aren’t I? But if that’s what it is, I’ll take whatever medicine you think will help. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Withycombe. Rosacea is generally not serious, but it can be chronic and cause discomfort. We can manage it effectively with topical medications or, in some cases, oral antibiotics. As for hormonal changes, it’s true that they become less common with age, but they can still occur and contribute to flushing. The blood tests will help us determine if that’s a factor in your case. I’m now ordering the blood tests. They should be available within a few days. I will have the results sent to my office, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding things that trigger flushing, such as spicy foods, alcohol, and excessive heat. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild topical cream, metronidazole, to see if it helps reduce the redness. It’s often used for rosacea, and it might provide some relief while we wait for the test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Spicy foods, alcohol… I can manage that. And a cream… that’s fine. Anything to help. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s… nice to talk to someone about it. My wife… she would have known what to do. But you’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It’s my pleasure. I understand losing your wife must be incredibly difficult, and I’m glad I could provide some assistance. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here is the lab requisition form and the prescription for the metronidazole cream. The nurse will also provide you with instructions on how to apply the cream. We will get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you again. You've been very kind. I’ll see you when the test results are back. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day.
