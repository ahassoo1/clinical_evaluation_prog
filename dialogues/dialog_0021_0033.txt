DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie, welcome. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… it’s rather difficult to explain, truthfully. It just happened. My vision, and… and my hearing. They’ve both gone. Or, mostly gone. It’s quite inconvenient, you understand. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: "Mostly gone," you say. Hmm. And when did this… happen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… they escape me. It was… relatively recently. A few days, perhaps? A week? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I was in the middle of… something important. Very important. I really can’t recall precisely what it was, but it involved… arrangements. Yes, arrangements.
DOCTOR: Arrangements. Right. And was there anything at all unusual happening when you first noticed this?
PATIENT: Unusual? Well, I suppose… the gardener. He was terribly slow with the roses. Absolutely dreadful. Though I doubt that has anything to do with my… condition. Honestly, people these days have no work ethic. It’s simply appalling.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll come back to the roses later, perhaps. Let’s focus on what was happening with you when you noticed your vision and hearing going. Any headache?
PATIENT: Headache? Not particularly. A little… frazzled, perhaps. From dealing with… everything. It's a lot to manage, you understand. A woman of my standing has… commitments. And honestly, the sheer incompetence of some people is enough to give anyone a headache. But no, not a headache, specifically.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this vision and hearing loss come on suddenly, or was it gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, it was quite… abrupt, actually. One moment I was perfectly capable, the next… well, like looking through a fog, and the sound… muffled. Like being underwater, perhaps? It wasn't a slow fading, no. It simply… went. Quite unsettling, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Underwater… Interesting. And have you experienced any dizziness, weakness, or numbness with this?
PATIENT: Dizziness… a little, perhaps. Though I’m always a bit off-balance when I’m dealing with… the staff. Honestly, it’s exhausting. Weakness, no. I’m perfectly strong, thank you very much. Numbness… well, my patience is often numb when dealing with… certain individuals. But not physically numb, no.
DOCTOR: Right. Physical numbness. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, medications… I can’t be bothered with keeping track of all that. I take a few things, I suppose. For… well, various things. Allergies? Not that I’m aware of. Though I once had a rather unpleasant reaction to a… floral arrangement. But that was the flowers, not a medication. It was terribly gaudy, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, we’ll need to get a list of those medications. Do you remember anything specific you are taking?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, I have people for these things! I simply… delegate. There’s a little blue pill, I think. And a white one. Perhaps a yellow one, sometimes? They come in little bottles. Really, I haven’t the faintest. It’s all rather… beneath me to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that makes things… difficult. Okay. Let's try this. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. I'll check your ears, your eyes, reflexes, that sort of thing. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, must we? Honestly, I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon. And I need to approve the landscaping plans. But… very well. As quickly as possible, please. I haven't a moment to spare. And please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your ears. Just going to take a quick look inside… Both ears appear clear, no signs of infection or wax buildup. Tympanic membranes are normal in appearance. Now, let's check your eyes.
PATIENT: Oh, good. No unpleasant surprises, I trust? Honestly, doctor, I simply haven’t the patience for complications. Do get on with it. The sooner this is over, the better. And do be careful with the instruments. I have very sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Visual acuity… difficult to assess given your reported vision loss, but I'm detecting some diminished response to light in both eyes. Reflexes seem normal at first glance, but we'll need to do some more thorough testing.
PATIENT: Diminished response? Oh, dear. That doesn’t sound promising. Is it… serious? Honestly, I simply can’t afford to be ill. I have too many commitments. Can’t it just be… fixed? A little something to restore my vision? I pay a great deal for healthcare, you know.
DOCTOR: "Serious" is a strong word, Ms. Julie. We need to run some tests to determine the cause of the vision and hearing loss before we can talk about treatment. It could be a number of things. I'm going to order a CT scan of your brain and a comprehensive audiological evaluation. That will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh, honestly. All that… machinery. Is it terribly uncomfortable? And an audiological… whatever that is. I suppose I haven’t much choice, have I? Just… get it over with as quickly as possible. And please, make sure the results are expedited. I have a very important appointment next week, and I simply must be able to hear and see properly for it.
DOCTOR: The CT scan is relatively quick and painless, Ms. Julie. You’ll just lie on a table and a scanner will take some images. The audiological evaluation will involve some tests to assess your hearing sensitivity. I’ll have my nurse schedule those for you right away, and I’ll make sure the radiologists prioritize the scan results. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a short course of steroids. It won't fix the problem, but it may help reduce any inflammation that could be contributing to the vision and hearing loss. It's a precaution.
PATIENT: Steroids? Oh, dear. I’ve heard… things about steroids. Weight gain, mood swings… honestly, I simply haven’t the time for side effects. But… very well. If it's just a precaution, I suppose. Just… make sure they’re the lowest dose possible. And that they won’t interfere with my luncheon. Honestly, doctor, you understand. Some things are simply… non-negotiable.
DOCTOR: These are a low dose, Ms. Julie, and shouldn’t interfere with your luncheon. The nurse will explain any potential side effects. I want you to follow up with me in one week to discuss the results of the tests. If your vision or hearing worsen significantly before then, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, no, I think that will be all. Honestly, it’s been rather… disruptive. I trust everything will be expedited? And that my luncheon won’t be affected? Just… get me back to normal as quickly as possible. I have a life to live, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Everything will be expedited. The nurse will assist you with scheduling. Have a… pleasant day, Ms. Julie.
