DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me – and try to be concise – what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Look, I don’t wanna take up too much of your time. Just been gettin’ fevers, on and off. Happens maybe three, four times a month now. Nothin’ major, just feelin’ kinda crummy, y’know? Like a low-grade flu.
DOCTOR: “Crummy” is not a medical term, Mr. Brege. Can you quantify these fevers?
PATIENT: Quantify? Uh… okay. Well, I took my temperature a couple times. Highest it got was… 101.5, I think. Maybe 102 once. But mostly it’s just feelin’ warm. Not like I gotta rush to the hospital warm, just… not right. Does that make sense? I don't really keep a log or nothin'. My wife usually checks when I complain.
DOCTOR: And how long have these episodes been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started… around February, maybe March. So, six, seven months now? They weren’t constant at first, just now and then. But they’ve been pickin’ up a bit lately, that's why I figured I should come in. I just wanna make sure it's not somethin' serious, you know? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: And are these fevers associated with any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. Usually get a bit of a headache with ‘em. And feel tired, real tired. Not just normal tired, like… dragged tired. And my muscles ache a little, kinda like after a hard day of work, but I haven’t been doin’ much hard work lately, Doc. Just regular aches, nothin’ crippling. Sometimes I sweat a little too, even when I'm not hot.
DOCTOR: Sweating… and the headaches. Do you have any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. No throwin’ up, no… upset stomach. Bowels are regular, if you gotta know. Everything’s workin' like it should down there, thankfully. Just the fever, the headache and the tiredness, Doc. And the muscles achin'. That’s it. Honestly. I just don't like feelin’ run down, especially at my age.
DOCTOR: And do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’. My wife gives me stuff for my arthritis sometimes, over-the-counter stuff, and I’m fine with that. Ibuprofen, naproxen… somethin’ like that. But no, no serious allergies. I can eat anything, take anything, pretty much. Least, I haven’t run into nothin’ yet.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what medications are you currently taking, besides the over-the-counter pain relievers for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Just those, Doc. I try not to take too much of anything if I can help it. I figured I'd just ride it out. But like I said, it's been happenin' more often. I don’t need nothin' fancy, just wanna figure out what’s goin’ on and get it fixed. No high blood pressure pills, no diabetes meds… nothin'. Just the arthritis stuff when I need it. And sometimes a little somethin' for sleep, but that’s rare.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and perhaps take your temperature again, just to confirm. Then we can discuss possible courses of action. If you would please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you gotta do, Doc. Just try to be quick, alright? I got appointments later.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though slightly rapid. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Temperature is 100.8 Fahrenheit. Now, can you tell me about any recent travel, exposure to sick individuals, or changes in your diet or lifestyle?
PATIENT: Recent travel? No, nothin’ major. Just a weekend trip to see my daughter in Orlando back in June. But that was weeks ago. Exposure to sick people... well, you know, folks coughin’ and sneezin’ in the grocery store. Normal stuff. Lifestyle... not much change. Retired, mostly stay home, do a little gardening. Diet… my wife cooks, so pretty standard Puerto Rican food. Rice, beans, a little meat... nothin’ fancy or different. Honestly, Doc, I can’t think of anything unusual.
DOCTOR: Given your symptoms, and the lack of any significant findings on physical examination, it is likely you are experiencing a viral upper respiratory infection, potentially exacerbated by your arthritis. However, given the persistence of the fevers for six months, we must rule out other possibilities. I will order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a C-reactive protein test to assess for any underlying inflammation or infection. We may need to consider a chest X-ray if symptoms persist or worsen. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute, Doc. All that sounds… complicated. Look, I just got a little fever, okay? You’re talkin’ about blood tests and X-rays… Is that really necessary? I'm tellin' ya, it’s just a bug, probably. I just wanna feel normal again. And I don’t wanna get stuck with a huge bill, if you don’t mind. Can’t we just try somethin’ simple first? Like… an antibiotic? Or somethin' to lower the fever? I don't know. It just sounds like a lot for what I'm dealin' with.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, I understand your concerns. However, prescribing antibiotics without a confirmed bacterial infection is not advisable, and may contribute to antibiotic resistance. As for a simple fever reducer, that will only temporarily mask the symptoms. Given your age and the duration of your illness, it is prudent to investigate further. The tests I ordered are relatively standard and will help us determine the underlying cause of your fevers. I will also prescribe a symptomatic treatment, including acetaminophen or ibuprofen, for fever and headache. If the blood work shows nothing definitive, we can revisit the issue, but we cannot simply ignore the persistence of these symptoms. Do you have any further questions at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Fine. If you think it’s necessary. But please, try to keep the costs down, alright? And can you tell me what I gotta do for these tests? Where do I go? Do I need to fast? My wife drives me everywhere, so I need to know what to tell her. And… how long will it take to get the results? I really don't wanna be back and forth to the clinic all the time.
DOCTOR: Here is the requisition form. You will need to go to the lab at City General Hospital. No fasting is required. Just bring this form with you and they will take the necessary blood samples. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours. The lab will notify my office when they are available, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. I'm also going to provide a written list of instructions regarding medication dosage and potential side effects. If your symptoms worsen before your follow-up appointment – such as high fever, severe headache, shortness of breath, or chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Okay, City General… 24 to 48 hours… And if it gets worse, go to the emergency room. Got it. Thanks, Doc. I guess I’ll see you folks in a couple of days, then. Hopefully, it’s not somethin’ serious. And please, tell your staff to try and be gentle on the bill, alright? I’m retired, you know. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Brege. We will do our best.
