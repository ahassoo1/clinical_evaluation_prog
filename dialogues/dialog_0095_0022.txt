DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. I'm Dr. VanOchten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, my tummy… it feels big. And I don’t feel like eating much anymore. It’s just… not good. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A little bit at a time, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your stomach feels full, and you haven’t been very hungry lately. And you said this has been developing gradually, over some time?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Slowly. Not a sudden thing. Like… a balloon filling up, maybe? But not painful, not really. Just… uncomfortable. I mostly just feel tired, too. Old lady tired, you know? It could be nothing, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, "old lady tired" – I understand. And no significant pain with the fullness, just discomfort. Alright. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about what you've been eating lately?
PATIENT: Oh dear… what have I been eating? That’s a good question. Not much, like I said. Soup sometimes. And… toast? My neighbor, Mrs. Gable, brings me things. Nice lady. I don’t remember all of it. It’s… a little blurry. I used to love potatoes, but… even those don’t sound good now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily soup and toast, with some things from Mrs. Gable. And even foods you usually enjoy, like potatoes, aren’t appealing. Has anything changed with your appetite suddenly – like, was there a particular food that you ate that made you feel worse, or a specific time when your appetite really declined?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. I don’t think so. It wasn’t one thing. Just… less and less. Like the colors fading, you know? Everything just… became less interesting. Even food. I used to be a good cook, back in… well, a long time ago. I don’t even want to think about cooking now. Everything feels like too much effort.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Oh! Sometimes my ankles feel… puffy. Especially at night. And… I go to the bathroom more often, I think. But old ladies always go to the bathroom a lot, don’t they? It could just be that. I don't know. Everything feels… slow, you know? Like everything takes a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy ankles, especially at night, and more frequent urination. And a general feeling of slowness. Have you noticed any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… oh dear. Well, it’s… not as regular as it used to be. I have to… try sometimes. And it’s… harder. Sorry to be so… specific. It’s just… things don’t move as well as they once did. Like an old pipe, maybe? Everything’s getting old, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, less regular bowel movements and some difficulty. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your skin – like jaundice, or unusual itching?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. I haven’t thrown up. And my skin… I don’t think so. It feels… dry, maybe. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? I don't get much sun anymore. It’s hard to tell, really. I don’t look at myself much. Too much fuss. Is something… wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like we have a few things to consider. Just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, dear. That was a long time ago. I… I had a bad flu when I was young. Very bad. And… I think I had my gallbladder out, once? A long time ago. It might have been my appendix. I always get those things mixed up. I don’t remember much else, honestly. I went to doctors when I was younger, of course. But it’s all… blurry now. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. I just try to take things easy.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a history of a severe flu and possibly gallbladder or appendix removal. And you haven’t seen a doctor in quite some time. Do you know if you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I don’t take any medicines now. I used to take something for my… blood pressure, maybe? But it made me feel dizzy, so I stopped. A long time ago. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, though. I eat everything. Well, I used to eat everything. Now I don’t eat much of anything. It’s all very confusing, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies, and you previously took medication for blood pressure but stopped due to dizziness. Now, let's talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family who has had similar problems with appetite loss or weight loss, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… That was a long time ago too. My mother… she was a strong woman. Never sick a day in her life, I think. My father… he had a bad cough, towards the end. But nothing like this. And my brother… he moved away. A long time ago. I haven't seen him in… well, a very long time. I don’t think anyone in my family had problems like this, no. We were all… healthy, I think. Or at least, we didn't talk about being sick. It was a different time, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. No family history of similar problems. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Never smoked a day in my life. My mother wouldn’t allow it. She said it was a terrible habit. And my father… well, he didn’t need to. He had a strong cough without it. Always fresh air, that was my mother's rule. It’s a good rule, I think. I always liked the fresh air.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked. And finally, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not really. A little glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. A very little glass. But not anymore. Haven’t had a glass in… well, a long time. It didn’t agree with me. Made me feel… fuzzy. I don’t need it. I have enough fuzziness already, you know? Old age is fuzzy enough. It's all a little… blurry, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a very little wine occasionally in the past, but not currently. Thank you for answering all my questions, Ms. McConnon. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and feeling your ankles. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. It’s just… it’s all a bit overwhelming, you know? But I’ll try. Listening to my heart and lungs… and checking my tummy… and my ankles… yes, go ahead. Just be gentle, dear. Everything feels a bit… fragile these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are a little diminished, but regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, but there's some mild fullness in the lower abdomen. No significant tenderness. And your ankles do have some noticeable swelling, as you mentioned. I’m documenting these findings now. Based on what you've told me and the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. Your symptoms of decreased appetite, weight loss, fatigue, and abdominal fullness, along with the swelling in your ankles, could indicate several things. It could be related to a decrease in your overall nutritional intake, but we also need to rule out other potential causes, like problems with your kidneys or liver, or even a possible heart issue contributing to the swelling.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Kidneys and liver and heart… That’s a lot. What do we do now, Doctor? I don't want to be sick. I just want to… feel better. Is it… is it bad? Will I be alright?
DOCTOR: Now, let's not jump to conclusions just yet, Ms. McConnon. It's important to remember that these are just possibilities. We need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture. I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will help us check your kidney and liver function, look for any signs of anemia, and assess your overall nutritional status. We will also do a urine test to check your kidney function. I'd also like to order an EKG, which is a simple test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. And finally, I would recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any problems with your lungs or heart. These tests will give us a much better understanding of what’s going on and help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… so many tests. Blood and urine and… a picture of my chest? It sounds… a bit scary. But… if it will help, then yes. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Will they… will they hurt? And how long will it take? I just want it to be over quickly. It's all very… overwhelming, you see?
DOCTOR: The tests are quite simple and shouldn't cause any significant discomfort, Ms. McConnon. The blood draw will just be a quick pinch, and the urine test is just a simple sample. The EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest and arms, which might feel a little cool, and the chest X-ray is just a quick scan. The results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to eat small, frequent meals, even if you don't have much appetite. It's important to keep your strength up. And make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids. I'm going to have the nurse come in and draw your blood now, and then we'll get you scheduled for the other tests. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Small meals and lots of fluids… yes. Just… please let it not be anything too serious, Doctor. I'm an old lady, you see. I don’t have much energy left for… fighting. Thank you, Doctor. For everything.
DOCTOR: We'll do everything we can to figure out what's going on and get you feeling better, Ms. McConnon. We'll take things one step at a time. Let's get the nurse in to start the blood draw. I'll also have her provide you with a list of instructions for the tests and a phone number to call if you have any questions.
PATIENT: .
