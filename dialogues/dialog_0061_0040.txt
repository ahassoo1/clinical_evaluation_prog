DOCTOR: Bula Mr. Espinueva, and welcome. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Bula to you too, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, it’s this pain in my side that keeps coming back. And… these water infections. They’ve been happening quite a bit lately, if you don’t mind. It’s a bit bothersome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Recurring pain in your side and frequent water infections. That is bothersome, and we definitely want to figure out what's going on. Let's start with the pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Right. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, usually. It’s on my right side, lower down… around where my kidney is, I suppose. Sometimes it goes through to my back a bit. It comes and goes, but it’s been happening more often these last few months, I’d say. I don’t remember anything specific causing it, it just… starts.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache on your right side, lower down, sometimes radiating to your back, and it’s been increasing in frequency over the last few months. And you haven’t noticed anything specific that triggers it?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I try to think, but nothing comes to mind. I haven’t done anything different, not that I recall. I eat about the same things, same routine… It just seems to happen at random. It's a bit strange, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about the water infections?
PATIENT: Oh, those… they’re uncomfortable, of course. I get a burning feeling when I go to the toilet, and I have to go very often. And sometimes… a bit of blood, if I’m being honest. I’ve been to the chemist a few times for treatment, but they keep coming back, even after I finish the medicine. It’s getting a bit worrying, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, so burning with urination, frequent trips to the toilet, and you’ve noticed some blood in your urine. And the chemist's treatment isn't providing lasting relief. Have you been running a fever or feeling unwell with these infections, aside from the burning and frequent urination?
PATIENT: Hmm… not a high fever, no. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, a bit weak, but I thought that was just getting old! And maybe a little achy, but that could be the weather, you know? It's been a bit changeable lately. No shivering or anything like that, though. Just generally feeling… not myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no high fever, some tiredness, general aches, but nothing severe. Let's talk a bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, a doctor told me years ago, maybe ten, fifteen years back, that my kidneys weren’t working perfectly. Something about cysts, I think he said. He didn’t explain it very well, and I’ve just… lived with it. I don't remember the exact name of the condition, sorry. And no, no diabetes or high blood pressure, not that I know of. I've had the usual aches and pains of getting older, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of some kidney issues, specifically something about cysts, diagnosed about 10-15 years ago. We’ll definitely want to look into that further. And no history of diabetes or high blood pressure. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. I’ve been quite lucky, actually, never needed anything like that. Just the usual doctor’s visits for check-ups and colds, nothing more. I’m a bit scared of hospitals, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had problems with her waterworks when she got older, I remember that. Always going to the toilet. And my brother, he had some trouble with his kidneys as well, but I don’t know the details. It was a long time ago. We didn’t talk much about health problems, to be honest. It wasn't really our way.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of waterworks issues in your mother and kidney problems in your brother. Let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything regularly right now – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins, Doctor. A multi-vitamin, to keep me going. And sometimes I take paracetamol for aches and pains, but not very often. Nothing else, I promise. And as I said, the chemist sometimes gives me medicine for the water infections, but that’s not regular, just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin, occasional paracetamol, and antibiotics as needed for the water infections. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm a bit careful, though, and always tell the chemist if I've tried something before. I don't like to take risks.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let's just quickly cover a few things about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't smoke. Never have. And I very rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a small glass of wine at Christmas, but that's about it. I always thought it was best to stay away from those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and very minimal alcohol consumption. That's good. And finally, just one more question - what do you do for work, or how do you spend your days generally?
PATIENT: Well, I used to work as a receptionist, at a doctor’s surgery, funny enough! But I’ve retired now. I mostly stay home, do a bit of gardening, watch television, and visit with my neighbours sometimes. It’s a quiet life, but I enjoy it. Not much excitement, but that’s okay. I like peaceful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mr. Espinueva. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a good understanding of your situation. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your tummy, feel your sides, and maybe take your blood pressure. It won’t take long, and it will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just… please be gentle, if you don’t mind. My old bones aren't what they used to be! And please let me know if you find anything concerning, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Espinueva. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, deep breaths in and out for me… Hmm. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, just going to feel around a bit… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit on my right side, Doctor. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And maybe a little bit higher up, towards my back. It's hard to say exactly where, it's more of a general ache, like I said before. It’s not awful, but it’s definitely there. It’s better when I’m lying down, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting some tenderness in your right flank and upper back, which is consistent with what you’ve been describing. And the sounds are normal when I tap here. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Given your history of kidney issues, the recurring water infections, and this tenderness, I think it would be wise to order some tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Tests are fine. What kind of tests are we talking about, if you don’t mind me asking? I just like to know what's happening, if you understand. It makes me feel a little less anxious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Espinueva. I understand completely. I'm going to order a urine analysis and a urine culture to check for infection, and to see what kind of bacteria might be present. We'll also do a blood test to check your kidney function, and to look for any signs of inflammation. And finally, I'd like to order an ultrasound of your kidneys and bladder to get a better look at their structure and to see if there are any blockages or abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. And very sensible. All those tests sound fine to me. When will I be able to get them done? And how long will it take to get the results? I hope it's not too long, to be honest. It's a bit worrying, waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll write the requisitions for you now. You can get the blood test and urine analysis done at the lab just down the street, they take walk-ins. The ultrasound will need to be scheduled, I'll have my assistant call and book you an appointment for later this week, most likely Wednesday or Thursday. The results typically take a few days, so we should have them by early next week. I'll also have my assistant call you to confirm the ultrasound appointment time. In the meantime, if you experience a high fever, chills, severe back pain, or blood in your urine that doesn’t stop, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds very clear. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for taking this seriously. I feel much better knowing we’re getting things checked out. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It's my pleasure. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Just follow up with my assistant to schedule your ultrasound and get those tests done. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your next appointment. Alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I will. Thank you again for your kindness. Bula vinaka.
DOCTOR: Bula vinaka to you too, Mr. Espinueva. Take care, and I'll see you next week. .
