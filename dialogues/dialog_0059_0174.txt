DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, I haven’t been myself lately. Just… low. Very low. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I haven’t the energy for much these days. And frankly, I’d rather be doing anything else than sitting here explaining it, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I absolutely understand, Mrs. Derasmo. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. “Low” can mean a lot of different things, so let's try to pinpoint what you’re experiencing. Could you tell me a little more about this “low” feeling?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not sadness, not exactly. Though there’s some of that, I suppose. It’s more like… everything is gray. Nothing feels… worthwhile. I used to enjoy my work – lifeguarding, even ski patrol in the winter – keeps a woman active, you know? Now… it feels like a chore. And I don’t sleep well. Just… restless. Do you understand what I mean? It's difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand, Mrs. Derasmo. That sounds very disheartening – losing interest in things you once enjoyed, and having trouble with sleep. It’s good you’re able to articulate that, even if it's difficult. It helps me understand what's going on. When did you first start noticing these changes – this feeling of everything being "gray" and the sleep disturbance?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It started… maybe six months ago? Around the time of my grandson’s birthday, I think. Though it was gradual, you see? Not a sudden thing. Just… slowly, things felt less bright. Less… appealing. And the sleep… it’s been worse the last few months, definitely. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for dwelling on feelings. I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand wanting to feel like yourself again, Mrs. Derasmo. Six months is a significant amount of time to be experiencing these changes. It’s good we’re talking about it now. To help me get a better picture, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day… well, I wake up, usually because I have to, not because I’m rested. I have a light breakfast – toast, maybe. Then I try to do some gardening, keep myself busy. I volunteer at the community center a couple of times a week, but even that feels like an effort these days. Evenings are… mostly spent watching television. I eat dinner alone, usually. And then I try to sleep, but as I said, it’s difficult. It's very…routine. And rather lonely, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mrs. Derasmo. It sounds like you’re very active, despite how you’re feeling, and that routine is important to you. The loneliness you mentioned is also something we should consider. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite… isn’t what it used to be, no. I don’t not eat, but I don’t enjoy it, you see? I used to love cooking, trying new recipes… now it feels like a waste of effort. As for weight… I think I’ve lost a little. Nothing dramatic, but my clothes feel a bit looser. I haven't weighed myself recently, to be truthful. It's not something I pay much attention to.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, that was in the eighties, I believe. And I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Nothing major, really. And I take medication for my blood pressure, a small dose. That's about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Derasmo. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she struggled with nerves, always worrying. She didn’t like leaving the house much. And my brother, he… well, he had some problems. He wasn’t himself towards the end. I don’t know exactly what was wrong, truthfully. It wasn't something the family talked about openly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not always easy to discuss family history. That gives me some helpful information. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits… Well, as I said, I volunteer at the community center. I have a few friends, but… I haven’t seen them much lately. Truthfully, I don't feel much like socializing. It’s… tiring. I used to enjoy having people over for tea, but that’s been a while now. Mostly, I keep to myself. It's not that I don't want to see people, it's just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Derasmo. That helps me understand a lot. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can take most medications without issue. No, I don't have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mrs. Derasmo. That’s all the questions I have for now. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. It will just take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Get it over with, if you will. I’d rather just know what’s going on, one way or another. I don't like dwelling on things, you see. Just… do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Derasmo. Okay, your reflexes are normal, and your cranial nerves are intact. I'm noting slightly diminished heart sounds. I'd like to check your thyroid as well. Now, Mrs. Derasmo, based on what you've told me and my examination, you're experiencing symptoms suggestive of depression, possibly with some anxiety. The sleep disturbance, loss of interest in activities, feelings of loneliness, and diminished energy levels are all consistent with this. The slightly elevated blood pressure could be related to stress or anxiety. It's important to rule out any other underlying medical conditions, however. To do that, I'd like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. I also recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… an EKG… Honestly, Doctor, it sounds rather… serious. But if you think it’s necessary… yes, alright. Do what you think is best. I just want to feel like myself again. The sooner we figure this out, the better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mrs. Derasmo. It's not necessarily serious, but it's important to get a complete picture. These tests will help us rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Okay, I'll write up the orders for the lab work and EKG now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the EKG. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I want to assure you that you’re not alone, and there are many effective treatments available for depression. We can discuss options such as therapy and medication, if appropriate. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. I just… want to get this over with. Thank you for listening, and for taking this seriously. I suppose I'll wait for the results, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Derasmo. I’m glad I could listen. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly.
