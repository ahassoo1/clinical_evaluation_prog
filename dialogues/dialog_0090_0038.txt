DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… rather difficult to explain, truthfully. I believe I need some forms completed. Something about… what one wants, should things become… unclear. I was advised to seek an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I’m… not entirely certain which is correct, or even what they are, precisely. I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Advance Care Planning, alright. It's… commendable you're thinking ahead, though it's usually patients facing a specific illness who pursue this. Still. So, you've been advised to do this. By whom, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. It was… a solicitor, I believe. After the… divorce. He mentioned it as a matter of… completing loose ends. My ex-husband and I… we didn’t have much in the way of family, and he thought it prudent. I confess, my recollections of the specifics are… hazy. It was some time ago, and a rather stressful period. I simply remember him saying it was important to document my wishes. I don't recall why it was so important, beyond that.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a legal recommendation, not a medical one. That explains… some things. Look, Ms. Buoniconti, these forms are about your healthcare wishes if you're unable to speak for yourself. It's not something to be done lightly, or because a solicitor thought it might be a good idea. Do you have any specific concerns about your health that led you to even consider this?
PATIENT: Specific concerns? No, not… exactly. I feel quite well, actually. Perhaps that's the issue. It’s just… I've always been rather… alone. And the thought of… not being able to communicate what I want… it’s unsettling. It’s less about a fear of illness, and more a… practical concern. If something were to happen, and I couldn’t speak… who would know what I’d prefer? It’s probably foolish, but it’s been weighing on my mind. I apologize for taking up your time with such… abstract anxieties.
DOCTOR: It’s not foolish to consider these things, though it's... unusual for someone with no current medical issues to be so focused on end-of-life planning. But, alright. Let’s clarify something. A POLST form, which is what I suspect your solicitor mentioned, is specifically for patients with a serious illness or frailty, outlining their wishes for medical treatment now. An Advance Directive is broader – it names a healthcare proxy to make decisions if you become incapacitated, and can include instructions about future care. Given your circumstances, an Advance Directive, focusing on a healthcare proxy, would be the more appropriate route. Do you have anyone you trust implicitly to make those decisions for you?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… That is… a difficult question. I… I don't. Not anymore. My ex-husband… we weren't close, even during the marriage. And I haven’t maintained contact with my family since… well, a very long time ago. I suppose that was the solicitor's concern – who would know? I hadn't truly considered the implications. This is more complicated than I anticipated. Perhaps I shouldn't pursue this after all. If there’s no one… it seems rather pointless.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, it’s not pointless if you don’t have someone immediately available. You can designate a professional guardian, or the hospital can appoint one if necessary. It's not ideal, certainly, but it's better than having no voice at all. However, before we go down that road, let’s focus on your current health. You say you feel well. Any medical conditions at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Truly. I've always been… remarkably healthy, if a little solitary. No chronic conditions. No allergies, to my knowledge. I see a dentist regularly, of course, and had a routine check-up last year with no issues. Oh… I did have a rather nasty bout of influenza a few years ago, but that was… temporary. Nothing ongoing. I keep a fairly… simple life. I focus on my etching, mostly. It requires a great deal of concentration, and… doesn't require much social interaction. I realize this isn't terribly helpful.
DOCTOR: Etching, alright. And no medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None at all. I pride myself on… avoiding them, if possible. I believe in a natural approach to wellbeing. Mostly just… a great deal of rest, and a carefully considered diet. I know it sounds… unconventional, perhaps, but I've always been rather… self-sufficient. I've been fortunate, I suppose. My health has always allowed me that freedom.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your weight is… what is your current weight, Ms. Buoniconti?
PATIENT: That… is a sensitive subject, Doctor. I… struggle with maintaining a healthy weight. I’m quite tall, as you can see, and… rather slight. Around 123 pounds, I believe. Perhaps a little less, if I'm being honest. It’s been… a longstanding issue. I’ve never been particularly concerned about it, but I understand it’s relevant to your assessment. It's often difficult to eat, truthfully. I don't have much of an appetite.
DOCTOR: 123 pounds, at your height?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s… I am aware it’s below the average. I assure you, I’m otherwise healthy. I've had regular check-ups, and… no one has expressed serious concern. I simply… don’t require much sustenance. It’s a… family trait, perhaps. Although, I haven’t spoken to my family in many years, so I can’t say for certain. It’s been this way my entire life. I'm quite used to it. Perhaps it’s simply my constitution.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, with your height and weight, your BMI is significantly below the healthy range. While you say you feel well, that does not negate a potentially serious underlying issue. It's concerning you've never been adequately assessed for an eating disorder, or other medical conditions that may be contributing to this weight loss. We need to investigate this further. I'm ordering a complete blood panel, including a thyroid function test, and I want you to schedule an appointment with a registered dietitian for a nutritional assessment. We also need to rule out any psychological factors contributing to your lack of appetite.
PATIENT: An eating disorder…? Doctor, that’s… I assure you, that’s not the case. I simply… don’t enjoy food. I focus on my work. It's not a… deliberate restriction. It’s just… how I am. I… I don’t want to be referred to a dietitian, or… assessed psychologically. It sounds… intrusive. And quite frankly, unnecessary. I came here to discuss Advance Directives, not my weight. Perhaps I should have just remained at home. This is becoming… rather upsetting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buonicotti, I understand you're upset, but dismissing legitimate medical concerns is not productive. Your weight is dangerously low, and as your physician, it is my responsibility to investigate the cause. While you may not think it’s an eating disorder, that doesn't rule it out. It’s also possible there’s an underlying medical condition contributing to your lack of appetite. I am ordering the blood work regardless. As for the dietitian, I am strongly recommending it. If you refuse, I will document that in your chart. But I am not simply going to ignore a potentially life-threatening situation because it makes you uncomfortable. Now, let’s schedule that appointment.
PATIENT: I… I don’t understand why you’re being so insistent. I feel perfectly healthy. I'm a functioning adult. This is… humiliating. And frankly, rather offensive. I came to you seeking advice about planning for the future, and you’re… fixated on my weight. I… I suppose if you insist, I will schedule the blood work. But I refuse to see a dietitian. It's simply… not necessary. And I'm certainly not prepared to discuss… psychological factors. Perhaps… perhaps I should just leave. I don't think this is going to be a productive conversation. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Buonicotti. Fine. You are an adult, and I cannot force you to receive treatment you do not want. However, I strongly advise you reconsider. The blood work is scheduled for tomorrow morning. Please fast for 12 hours beforehand. I will review the results with you when they are available. As for the Advance Directive… Given your current state of distress, and the potential underlying medical issues we are investigating, I do not believe you are in a suitable frame of mind to make informed decisions about your healthcare wishes at this time. We will revisit this conversation once we have a clearer understanding of your overall health. I believe that is all for today. The nurse will provide you with the lab order.
