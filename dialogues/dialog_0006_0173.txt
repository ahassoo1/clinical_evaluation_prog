DOCTOR: Alright, Jailenne, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Gorga, nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been getting chills, and it’s been bothering me for a couple of days now. It’s not like a cold chill, you know? More…random, I guess.
DOCTOR: Random chills…okay. A couple of days, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, started…hmm, I think it was Tuesday? So, two days. It comes and goes, not constant. It’s just…weird. And I feel a little tired, but I don’t know if that’s from the chills or just…life, you know?
DOCTOR: Tuesday…right. And you said a little tired. Anything else happening at the same time?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No fever, I checked. No cough, no sore throat. I haven’t been eating much, actually, maybe that’s why I’m tired. Not a huge appetite lately. And…no, I think that’s it. Just the chills and feeling a bit run down.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no cough… appetite’s been off. Alright. Have you noticed anything with the chills?
PATIENT: With the chills…like, what do you mean? Do you mean before or after? I guess…sometimes I feel a little shaky when they start, but not always. And…no, nothing really with them, I don’t think. It just…happens. Sorry, I’m not very good at explaining this. It feels silly, even saying it out loud.
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s alright. It’s good you’re telling me. Shaky…okay. Hmm. Now, have you been around anyone who's been sick lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. My ex-husband has a kid, but I haven’t seen them in a while. And I work from home, mostly, so I’m not around a lot of people. So, no, I don't think so. I’ve been pretty careful.
DOCTOR: Alright…work from home, careful…Good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your general health. Do you have any medical problems that I should know about?
PATIENT: Hmm…not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And I get migraines sometimes, but I manage them with over-the-counter stuff. Other than that…no, I’m pretty healthy, usually. I try to eat well and I walk when I can. I'm divorced, so...less stress now, thankfully! Does that count?
DOCTOR: Less stress always counts. Okay, tonsils out, occasional migraines…and generally healthy. Any family history of…well, anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. My mom had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandma on my dad’s side had…something with her heart, I think. It was a long time ago, and no one really talked about it much. I’m not sure exactly what it was. Sorry, I’m not very good with family medical history. We weren’t really a “talking” family.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in your mother, something cardiac in your grandmother…okay, that’s helpful. And you manage the migraines with over-the-counter medication. What kind, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. I usually take ibuprofen, or sometimes acetaminophen. Just whatever’s on the shelf, really. Nothing prescribed. And I try to rest when I get them, stay in a dark room. They're not too bad, thankfully, they don't happen very often. It's the chills that are worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen, acetaminophen for migraines. Alright. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… No, not really. I tried taking a vitamin D supplement last winter, but I stopped. Just…nothing regular. I drink a lot of water, if that counts! And herbal tea, when I have a sore throat. That’s it. Honestly, I try to avoid taking too much medication.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medication. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things, haven't had a reaction yet! I've never had a problem with penicillin or anything like that. I don't have any skin allergies either. Nope, pretty clear on that front. It's just the chills, really. It’s just…strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies…Okay. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, maybe take your temperature. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Absolutely. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m ready. I just want to figure out what's going on with these chills. I'm a little cold, if that helps!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let's start with your temperature. 98.9. Not a fever. Now, if you'll just lie back for me… Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness… Alright. Everything seems normal so far. Now, can you tell me, have you noticed any swollen glands in your neck or under your arms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me feel. No, I don’t think so. Maybe a little bit tender under my jaw, but I always get that when I'm stressed. It's probably just muscle tension. I doubt it's anything. Honestly, I’m just a bit worried about these chills. They’re really unsettling. It’s not like a normal sickness feeling, you know?
DOCTOR: Tender under the jaw, possibly muscle tension…Alright. Now, one last thing. Have you experienced any recent weight loss, changes in your appetite, or any unusual fatigue beyond what you've already mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, I have lost a couple of pounds, maybe five, but I haven't been trying. And I told you about my appetite being off, so yeah, that's definitely changed. But I’m not really tired all the time, just…when the chills hit. I can usually get through my day, it’s just…I feel a little weak sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It’s just…something’s not right. I'm not usually a worrier, but this is just…different.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jailenne. So, no fever, normal heart and lungs, some tenderness under the jaw, slight weight loss, appetite loss and fatigue associated with the chills…This could be a few things. It could be a mild viral infection, even without a high fever. Sometimes those present differently. It could also be related to stress, even though you said you’re less stressed now. But, given the weight loss and fatigue… I’d like to order a few blood tests just to rule things out. Nothing major, just a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Blood tests sound…reasonable. I just want to know what’s going on, so yeah, let’s do the blood tests. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. Where do we go from here?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. It'll just be a quick pinprick. Once we have the results, which usually takes a few days, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and eat as well as you can. If you develop a fever, any new symptoms, or if the chills get significantly worse, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all makes sense. Rest, hydrate, eat… and call if it gets worse. Okay. Thank you, Doctor Gorga. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not dismiss it as just stress. I feel a little better just knowing we’re looking into it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. It’s always best to investigate. The nurse will be in shortly. Have a good day, and don’t hesitate to call if anything changes.
