DOCTOR: Hi Marquie, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s… it’s my breathing. It's been kinda short lately, you know? Like, I get winded really easily. Honestly, I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, but it’s been bothering me for a bit now.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath. That's definitely something we want to look into. “A bit now” is a little vague, so can you try to pinpoint when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that’s the thing… I really can’t say for sure. Maybe a few weeks? A month? It all kinda blurs together, honestly. Work’s been busy, things at home… I just haven’t been paying close attention, I guess. It wasn’t sudden, it just… gradually got worse. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Marquie. Life gets hectic, and it’s easy to miss things at first. Gradual onset is helpful to know. Okay, so over the past month or so, you’ve noticed increasing shortness of breath. Can you describe what activities are making you feel winded now that didn’t used to?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay, let me think. Well, I work at the water treatment plant, right? Lots of walking, checking things… that’s always been normal. But now, even just walking between things… it feels harder. And climbing stairs? Forget about it. I used to be able to run up those things, no problem. And even just… talking sometimes, if I get excited or something. It’s kinda embarrassing, actually.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be frustrating and a little worrying. It’s good you're noticing these changes and telling me about them. So, to clarify – walking at work, climbing stairs, and even talking when excited are all bringing on shortness of breath now, things that weren’t a problem before. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Other stuff… hmm. Sometimes my chest feels kinda tight, like a band around it. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. And I’ve been coughing a little bit more than usual, but it’s not a bad cough, you know? Just a little tickle in my throat mostly. I haven't had a fever or anything like that. Oh, and I feel tired, really tired, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days?
DOCTOR: Okay, chest tightness, a bit more coughing – not severe, just a tickle – and fatigue. Good to know you haven't had a fever, that's helpful. Let's talk a little bit more about this cough. Is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Uh… I think it’s dry. Yeah, definitely dry. Nothing… no phlegm or anything like that. Just a little tickle, and then a cough. It happens mostly at night, I think. Or when I lay down. It doesn’t keep me up all night, but it’s enough to bother me. Sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful. I just… don’t really remember details well.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Marquie. Don't worry about remembering every detail. Dry cough that’s worse when lying down is useful information. Okay, let's switch gears a bit. Do you have any past medical problems – anything you’ve been diagnosed with or treated for before?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I had the flu a few years back, but that’s it. I haven’t really been sick much. I try to stay healthy. No asthma, no allergies… I don’t think so, anyway. My wife usually handles all the doctor stuff, so I don’t always know. She'd probably know better.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant past medical history that you're aware of. And no known allergies. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital. No surgeries either. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just the usual bumps and bruises over the years. Nothing serious. I… I really don’t think I’ve ever needed to be hospitalized. Does that make sense? I'd probably remember something like that, right?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, and yes, you’d likely remember a hospitalization! No past surgeries or hospitalizations – that's helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – who has had lung problems, asthma, or heart issues?
PATIENT: Ugh, family… okay. My mom had… I think it was high blood pressure, but that's about it. And my dad… he had some trouble with his heart later in life, but I don’t know the details. He passed away a few years ago. My wife's family… I don’t really know. We haven’t talked about it much. Sorry, I’m not much help on that front either.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Marquie. You've given me what you know, and that's valuable. Some family history of heart issues is something to keep in mind. Okay, last few questions about your background, then we’ll do a quick exam. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never even tried it. My wife hates it, and it just… never appealed to me. Always seemed kinda gross, honestly. No smoking, ever.
DOCTOR: Okay, great - no smoking history. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, I have a beer sometimes. Maybe a couple on the weekend. Nothing crazy. Just to relax. Not every weekend, though. I don't drink every day or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol use. And lastly, do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, definitely not. Never have, never will. Sorry, is this a lot of questions? I just wanna get to the bottom of this breathing thing. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: No, it's not too many questions at all, Marquie. It’s important to get a good picture of everything. And I understand wanting to feel normal again. Okay, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, and take your blood pressure and oxygen level, just to see what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do. Just… let me know if it's gonna hurt or anything. I get a little nervous around doctors, honestly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It shouldn't hurt at all. I’ll explain everything as I go. If you could just sit up there for me, that would be great. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, I'm listening now… Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Hmm… I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, mostly on the left side. Your heart sounds regular, but your blood pressure is a little elevated – 140 over 90. And your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is within normal limits, but on the lower end of normal. I’m going to check your temperature and pulse now. Temperature is normal at 98.6, and pulse is 88 beats per minute. Everything seems relatively stable right now, but the wheezing and slightly elevated blood pressure are worth investigating further.
PATIENT: Okay… wheezing? That doesn't sound good. What does that mean? And what's wrong with my blood pressure? I don’t understand. Is it something serious? I just want to know… what’s going on?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's break it down. Wheezing is a whistling sound that happens when your airways are narrowed, making it harder for air to get through. It can be caused by a lot of things – allergies, a mild infection like a cold, or sometimes something more. It doesn't necessarily mean something serious, but it does need to be checked out. As for your blood pressure, 140 over 90 is slightly elevated. Normal is around 120 over 80. It could be a one-time thing, stress can raise it temporarily, but consistently high blood pressure can increase your risk of heart problems over time. Right now, based on what you've told me and what I'm hearing, I'm suspecting it might be a mild case of reactive airway disease, possibly triggered by something environmental, or perhaps a very early respiratory infection. However, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious, like pneumonia. We should also consider a simple blood test to check for inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… blood test… oh boy. Okay. I guess so. I just… I don't like being poked and prodded. Is it gonna be expensive? I don't have insurance, you see. And… will it take a long time? I got work tomorrow. I just… I don’t wanna get too behind.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Marquie. Being poked and prodded isn't fun, and the cost is definitely a worry, especially without insurance. Let’s talk about that. The chest X-ray will take just a few minutes, and the blood test will only be a few vials of blood. Regarding the cost, I’ll have the billing department give you a breakdown of the costs upfront, so you know what to expect. We can also see if there are any assistance programs available to help with the expense. There are often programs for uninsured patients. As for work, we can schedule the tests first thing in the morning so you can hopefully get back quickly. And depending on the results, we can discuss a plan that minimizes disruption to your schedule. I’ll write you a note for work explaining you have a medical appointment, if needed. I want to assure you, we’re going to figure this out together. Would you like me to go ahead and get the orders for the X-ray and blood test?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah. Let’s just get it over with. The sooner I know, the better, I guess. Please… please just make sure they’re gentle with the blood test. I faint easily, sometimes. Don’t want to cause a scene. And… thank you. For explaining things. It helps.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marquie. We'll make sure the phlebotomist knows you faint easily. They’re very experienced and will take extra care. I’ll also put a note on your chart about it, and we’ll have you lie down during the blood draw, just in case. I'll write the orders now and have the front desk schedule the tests for you. I'm ordering a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia or other lung abnormalities, and a complete blood count to check for signs of infection or inflammation. The front desk will let you know when and where to go for the tests. In the meantime, I recommend you try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. And if your symptoms get worse – if you have increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now, before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Just… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been really helpful. And… hopefully it’s nothing too bad. I just want to get back to work. And… back to normal.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marquie. I understand. We'll take it one step at a time. I'm hopeful it’s nothing too serious, and we'll do everything we can to get you back to feeling your best. The front desk will be happy to answer any questions you have about scheduling the tests and billing. Here's a summary of everything we discussed, and the orders for the tests. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your appointment. I’ll see you back here after you’ve had the tests done, so we can go over the results and discuss a plan. Get some rest, and take care of yourself. .
