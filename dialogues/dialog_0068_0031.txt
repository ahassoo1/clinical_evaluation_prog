DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Nixon. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. It’s been bothering me for a few days now. And, um, I have a heart thing… atrial… something? The other doctors told me about it.
DOCTOR: Atrial… fibrillation, yes, I see that noted here. And the leg swelling… a few days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a few days. Maybe four or five? It's not painful exactly, just… big. And a bit uncomfortable when I walk. It feels… heavy, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Heavy… alright. And is it just the left leg, or is there any swelling in the right leg as well?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. The right leg is perfectly fine. I checked both of them this morning, just to be sure. It’s only the left one that’s… well, puffed up.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific happened that you can think of that might have caused this?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of. I haven’t injured it, and I haven’t been doing anything particularly strenuous. I’ve been teaching my computer classes, but that’s mostly sitting, really. I haven’t travelled anywhere either. I'm a bit puzzled, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay…teaching, sitting… alright. And do you notice any redness or warmth to the leg?
PATIENT: Let me see… It doesn’t feel warm, no. And I don’t see any redness, not that I can tell. It’s just… bigger. Like I said, puffy. Is that a bad thing, Doctor? I get worried, with the heart thing and all.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re paying attention to it, and yes, it’s reasonable to be concerned, especially with your history. Let's have a quick look. Could you sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here we are. Do you need me to lift my leg up? Or anything else? I hope this isn't too much trouble.
DOCTOR: No trouble at all, Nixon. Just relax. I’m going to gently feel your leg and check for any tenderness, and I’ll also measure the circumference of both legs to see if there’s a significant difference. I'm also going to check your pulses. Your pulses are a little weak on the left, and there's some definite swelling compared to the right. And it is tender to the touch here... .
PATIENT: Oh. Tender, you say? I hadn't really noticed that, just the… bulkiness. Is that… a bad sign, Doctor? And weak pulses… that doesn’t sound good, does it? With the heart and all… I’m starting to get a bit anxious now, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, let's not jump to conclusions. Weak pulses and tenderness can be concerning, but there are several possible causes. Given your history of atrial fibrillation, we need to rule out a blood clot. I want to order a D-dimer test and a Doppler ultrasound of your leg. The D-dimer will help us determine if there's recent clot formation, and the ultrasound will visualize the blood flow in your leg. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A blood clot? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it very dangerous? And a Doppler… is that painful? I don't mind having tests, but I do get a bit nervous, you see. And what does a D-dimer actually do? I don’t understand all the medical terms, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be nervous, Nixon. A blood clot, if left untreated, can be serious, but we're being proactive by investigating it. The D-dimer is a blood test that looks for a protein fragment that’s released when a blood clot breaks down. It's not painful—just a standard blood draw. The Doppler ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the blood vessels in your leg. It shouldn't be painful either—a technician will apply gel and move a probe along your leg. It's like what they use when a mother is pregnant. We need to get this checked out promptly. Would you be able to go to the lab today, or would you prefer tomorrow?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… less frightening, when you explain it like that. Like the baby scan! Alright, I can go to the lab today, if that’s best. I’d rather get it sorted quickly. Where is the lab, Doctor? And will I need an appointment? I don't have a car, so I’ll have to take the bus. I hope it’s not too far.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just across the street, in the medical center. No appointment is necessary. I'll print out a requisition form for the D-dimer and the ultrasound. You'll need to take this to the lab technician. They’ll take it from there. Once you’ve had the tests done, they'll send the results back to me, and I'll give you a call with the findings. In the meantime, try to elevate your leg as much as possible and avoid strenuous activity. Any chest pain or shortness of breath, you go to the nearest emergency room immediately, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds… manageable. Across the street is good, I can walk that easily enough. Elevate my leg, and no rushing about. And chest pain or breathlessness… I understand. Thank you, Doctor Sham. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit, explaining everything so clearly. I’ll go to the lab straight away. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or anything I should avoid? I don’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. Just try to rest and avoid prolonged standing. And if you notice any increased pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, let me know immediately. I'll be in touch as soon as I receive the results. It may be a few hours, as the lab can be busy. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for seeing me so quickly. I appreciate your help. I’ll head to the lab now. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Nixon. Get that tested and I’ll be in touch. Goodbye.
