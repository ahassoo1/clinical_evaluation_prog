DOCTOR: "Bula vinaka, Mr. Baide. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doctor, I don't have all day. It's this…shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a bit now, and frankly, it's embarrassing. I was a producer, you know? Directors need steady hands. Not this…trembling. Just tell me what you need to know, quickly.
DOCTOR: "I understand, Mr. Baide. We'll get right to it. It's good you're getting it checked out. So, this shaking – when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I couldn’t tell ya exactly. A while back, I suppose. Everything's a bit…fuzzy these days. Maybe six months? A year? It comes and goes. More when I’m…trying to do something precise, I guess. Like signing a check. Or holding a glass. It's just…annoying. Don’t ask me for dates, I haven't got ‘em.
DOCTOR: "Okay, no problem at all. We can work with ‘around six months’. And it's worse with activities that need a steady hand. Does anything else seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... No, not really. Though... now that you mention it, sometimes when I get… agitated. Like when those youngsters are yelling on the TV. Always with the noise. Makes my hand worse, yeah. But mostly just when I’m trying to do something. And when I'm tired, I suppose. Old age, what can ya do? It’s all downhill.
DOCTOR: "I understand. So it seems to be worse with activity, when you're tired, and when you're feeling agitated. Have you noticed it happening at rest, meaning when you’re just sitting quietly, not trying to do anything?
PATIENT: Rest? Now that's a good question. Hmm... I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I mean, I mostly am resting these days. Used to be a busy man, always on the go. Now, it's just…sitting. So, no, I don’t think it happens then. But don't hold me to that. Memory's not what it used to be, you know. Everything’s a blur. Can we speed this up? I’ve got…things to do. Even if I can't remember what they are.
DOCTOR: "Certainly, Mr. Baide. We'll try to keep this efficient. Okay, so it's primarily with activity. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? Look, I'm just here about the hand. I don’t go around looking for other things to be wrong with me! No, no other symptoms. Just the…trembling. A little stiff sometimes, maybe. But that’s just old age creeping in. Honestly, Doctor, are you writing all this down? It’s a waste of time. Is there a test you can just do to fix it?
DOCTOR: "Yes, I am taking notes, Mr. Baide – it helps me remember everything and make sure we don't miss anything. And we will get to tests, but I need to ask a few more questions first to get a clearer picture. You mentioned a little stiffness. Where do you feel that stiffness, and is it in the same place as the shaking?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It's... in my hand too, mostly. And my arm, a little. Not terrible, just…not as flexible as it used to be. Everything's creaky these days. It’s all connected, I suppose. The shaking and the stiffness. Look, I used to be a strong man, a powerful man! Now I'm just…fragile. Are we getting anywhere with this? This is ridiculous. I haven’t got time for a whole medical history.
DOCTOR: "We are getting there, Mr. Baide. And I apologize if this feels slow, but it's important to understand the whole picture. Okay, so the stiffness is also in your hand and arm. Have you noticed any weakness in your hand or arm?
PATIENT: Weakness? Hmm…now that you mention it, maybe. Dropped a glass the other day. Thought it was just clumsy, but… maybe it's weakness. It’s hard to say. Things slip out of my grip easier than they used to. I don't lift heavy things anymore, so I haven't really tested my strength. Look, I’m a producer, not a weightlifter! Can we just skip all this and get to a solution? A pill, a shot…something?
DOCTOR: "Okay, we're getting a better idea. So you’ve noticed some difficulty with grip strength and dropping things. Now, have you noticed any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: Balance? What do you mean, changes? I haven't fallen or anything! I walk around fine. Though… sometimes I feel a little… unsteady. Like I'm going to stumble. But that happens to everyone, right? Old age! Everything’s going. Honestly, Doctor, you’re asking a lot of questions. I'm not a doctor, I don’t know all the details of my body. Just fix the hand! Can we please get to the fixing part? I have important things to do. Or… I think I do. I just can't remember what they are. This is a waste of time. A complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: "Okay, Mr. Baide. I understand your frustration, and we will get to the examination soon. Just a few more quick questions. Have you noticed any changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Speech? What are you getting at now? I talk just fine! Ask my wife… oh. Never mind. I talk normally! People understand me. No changes! No stammering, no slurring, nothing! Look, are you suspecting something terrible? Because if you are, you can just say it. I’m an old man, I’ve lived a long life. I’m not afraid of a little bad news. Just tell me what’s wrong with my hand, and let’s get it fixed! This is ridiculous. You're treating me like I'm some kind of… experiment! I was a producer, not a patient! Let's get to the tests, now!
DOCTOR: "Okay, Mr. Baide. I apologize if I’m making you feel uncomfortable. I'm not suspecting anything terrible, I’m simply gathering information to understand what might be causing the shaking. It’s important to rule out different possibilities. Let's move on to a physical examination. Could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Fine! Just get it over with. Hurry up! This is… embarrassing. Are you going to poke and prod? I don't like being poked and prodded. Just tell me what you see, and let's get this over with. I have… things to do. Although, as I said, I can't remember what they are. Honestly, I'm starting to think this whole visit is a waste of time. But, fine, poke and prod away. Get it over with. Quickly!
DOCTOR: "Alright, Mr. Baide. I'm just going to observe your hands at rest and then ask you to do a few simple movements. I notice a tremor in both of your hands, more pronounced in your right hand. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. There’s a slight hesitancy in your movements and a bit of inaccuracy. Finally, I'm going to check your gait, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. See? I can walk! It's just… not as smooth as it used to be. Everything’s going downhill, you know. This is probably just old age creeping in. Are you writing all this down? Honestly, you’re making me feel like I'm falling apart. Can we just skip to the part where you tell me what's wrong and give me something to fix it? This is ridiculous. A complete waste of time. I have… important things to do. Or… I think I do. Can we just get this over with? Please?
DOCTOR: "Alright, Mr. Baide. I’ve noted a slight shuffling gait and a reduced arm swing. Based on what you've told me and the examination findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with essential tremor. However, there are other possibilities we need to rule out. To be certain, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Also, I recommend a neurological consultation to get a specialist’s opinion. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? A neurologist? Now you’re just piling it on! Look, I don't want blood tests, I don't want a specialist, I just want something to fix my hand! Essential tremor… what does that even mean? Is it serious? Will I… fall apart? You're making me nervous! Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. I was better off just… dealing with it. This is a complete nightmare. Just… tell me what it is. And what I need to do to fix it. Quickly. And no more poking and prodding, please. Just tell me. Now.
DOCTOR: "Okay, Mr. Baide, I understand your anxiety, and I'll explain everything as clearly as I can. Essential tremor is a neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, usually in the hands. It’s not life-threatening, and it doesn’t usually cause any other serious health problems. It’s quite common, especially as people get older. It can be managed with medication, although it doesn’t always eliminate the shaking completely. Sometimes lifestyle changes, like reducing caffeine intake, can also help. As for falling apart, that is very unlikely. The blood tests will help rule out other potential causes of the tremor, like thyroid problems. And a neurological consultation will allow a specialist to confirm the diagnosis and recommend the best course of treatment for you. I want to be thorough and make sure we’re addressing the right issue. Would you be willing to consider these tests and consultation?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, fine, fine. Blood tests and a… neurologist. But no guarantees, right? No promises of a cure? Because honestly, I'm starting to think this is a waste of time. A complete waste of time. But… alright. Do the tests. Schedule the appointment. But if it's all just to tell me what I already know – that my hand is shaking – I'm going to be very unhappy. Very unhappy indeed. And hurry up, please. I don't have all day. Or… well, I have some time. But not much. Just get it over with. And no more questions, please. Just do the tests.
DOCTOR: "Okay, Mr. Baide. I understand your concerns. We’ll get the blood tests ordered right away, and I'll have my nurse schedule an appointment with a neurologist for you. I’ll also give you a prescription for propranolol, a medication that can help manage the tremor symptoms. We'll review the blood test results and the neurologist's recommendations at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if the tremor worsens or you develop any other symptoms, please don't hesitate to call my office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Propranolol… is that a strong pill? Will it make me… sleepy? Or dizzy? Look, I don't want any side effects. Honestly, I’m starting to regret this whole thing. But… alright. No, no questions. Just… get the tests done. And schedule the appointment. And… give me the prescription. And then… can I go? I have… things to do. Or… I think I do. Just let me go. Please. This has been… exhausting. A complete and utter waste of time. But… alright. Let's get it over with. .
DOCTOR: "Certainly, Mr. Baide. My nurse will be right with you to draw your blood and give you the prescription. Here's a summary of today’s discussion and the plan for follow-up. Please call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself. Have a good day, Mr. Baide." .
