DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this tingling, you see. In my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for… oh, I don’t know exactly how long now. A few weeks, maybe? It’s just… annoying. I need my hands for work, you know? Being a mail carrier... it's hard when you can't feel things properly.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. And is this tingling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Not all the time, thank goodness. It’s worse in the evenings, I think. After a long day on my route. When I sit down to rest, that's when I really notice it. Sometimes it feels like… pins and needles, you know? Other times it just feels numb. It’s hard to explain. And it’s in both hands and both feet, not just one side.
DOCTOR: Both hands and feet…evenings are worse. And you said it feels like pins and needles, or numbness… Any weakness associated with that tingling?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Not really. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I mean, I get tired after work, but that's just from walking so much! I carry a lot of mail, you know? Heavy bags. But I haven't dropped anything or… tripped or anything because of it. No, I don't think so. I hope not. It just feels… strange. That's why I came in. I didn't want it to get worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this tingling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No… not really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But honestly, with the heat we've been having, who isn’t tired? I haven’t had any aches or pains anywhere else. No dizziness or anything like that. Oh… now that you mention it, my balance feels a little off sometimes, but I just figured I was getting old! I’m 63, you know? Things start to go, right?
DOCTOR: Balance feels a little off… Alright. Let's move on to some medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… No, not diabetes. The doctor checked me a few years back, said I was fine. I had high blood pressure once, a long time ago, but they gave me some pills, and it went away. Other than that… no, I don't think so. Nothing serious. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, really. My husband, God rest his soul, he had a bad heart, but I don't have any of that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. And… oh, and a hysterectomy when I was younger. But that was… a long time ago. Everything went fine, no problems with those. No other surgeries, no. Nothing else. I'm not a fan of hospitals, you know?
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… oh, it’s a long story. My mother, she had arthritis something awful. In her hands and knees, you know? And my brother… he had some nerve problems in his legs, I think. Kept complaining about pain all the time. That’s why I’m worried about this tingling. I don’t want it to be like that. I need my hands for my job! It's the only thing keeping me going these days, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… vitamins, you know? A multivitamin, and sometimes fish oil. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, though. I try to eat healthy, mostly. And I don’t like taking pills unless I have to. They always make me feel sick. My husband always said I had a sensitive stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things. I mean, I'm Ukrainian, you know? We eat everything! No shellfish or anything fancy like that, but nothing I’m allergic to. No, I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Is that all the questions? I’m starting to get a little cold in here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Uzarski, given your history, and the symptoms you’ve described… I think we need to do a brief physical exam. It will involve checking your reflexes, sensation, and some basic strength testing. I also want to take your blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. It's standard procedure, and will help me narrow down the possibilities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on with my hands, you know? The sooner, the better. It's just… I worry about losing my job. It’s the only thing keeping me going, really. So yes, please. Let’s get it over with. I have a route to finish tomorrow, you see. It really is cold in here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit back and relax. I’m going to start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is… slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are… a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I’m going to test sensation in your hands and feet. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. A little diminished… what does that mean, Doctor? Is that bad? And go ahead, please. I’m ready. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sensation is… slightly reduced in both hands and feet, particularly distally—that means further away from your core. Not significantly, but noticeable. And now, strength testing. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There! Is that okay? It’s a little sore, actually, just from all the walking. I carry heavy bags, you know? Mail gets heavier every year, it seems. Is something wrong, Doctor? You keep frowning.
DOCTOR: Strength is… within normal limits, though you did mention some soreness. Ms. Uzarski, based on these preliminary findings—the reduced sensation, diminished reflexes, and tingling—there are several possibilities. It could be peripheral neuropathy—nerve damage—which can be caused by a variety of factors. However, given your age and symptoms, it’s also important to rule out other conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or even… circulatory problems. I am going to order some blood work—a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, vitamin B12 levels, and a thyroid panel—to get a clearer picture. We should also consider an electromyography—EMG—to assess the function of your nerves. It is also essential to manage your blood pressure. I will write you a prescription for a low-dose antihypertensive medication.
PATIENT: Nerve damage… a prescription… Oh, goodness. That sounds serious. Is it… from the walking? From carrying the mail? Will I have to stop working? I need my job, Doctor. I really do. And an electromyography… what is that? Does it hurt? And what about this blood work… will it take long to get the results? I have a route to finish tomorrow, you know. It's just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, let’s not jump to conclusions. It’s possible the walking contributes, but it’s too early to say definitively. The electromyography involves small needles inserted into your muscles to measure electrical activity. It’s uncomfortable, but generally not painful. The discomfort is brief. The blood work will take approximately 3-5 business days to return. In the meantime, I want you to make an appointment with a podiatrist—a foot specialist—to rule out any underlying foot problems that might be contributing to your symptoms. I will provide you with a referral. It is crucial that you adhere to these recommendations. Ignoring these symptoms could lead to further nerve damage, potentially impacting your ability to work. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the blood work results and the podiatrist's findings. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Small needles… a foot specialist… two weeks… Oh, goodness. That's a lot. It's just… everything is happening so fast. I’m 63, Doctor, not 30. I don't handle things well when they’re complicated. Okay, okay… a foot specialist. Small needles. Blood work. Two weeks. I can do that. I have to, I guess. But if I can’t work… I don’t know what I’ll do. Could this medication… make me tired? I need to be alert on my route. And are you sure it’s not just… old age?
DOCTOR: Ms. Uzarski, the medication is a low dose and generally well-tolerated. However, side effects are always possible. If you experience excessive fatigue, contact my office immediately. And while age does play a role in many health conditions, it does not explain all of your symptoms. We need to rule out other causes to ensure we provide you with the most appropriate treatment. Here are the referral and prescription. Please schedule the podiatrist appointment as soon as possible. Adherence to these recommendations is paramount. Do you have any further questions?
