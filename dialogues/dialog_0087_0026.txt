DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Doctor… Soodeen, was it? Yes, well, it’s this tiredness. Just… awful tiredness. Comes and goes, but when it’s here… I can barely lift a teacup. And the young man at the lab said something about my numbers being… off. Something about my muscles? Honestly, these things go in one ear and out the other. I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s frustrating when you’re not feeling your best and the explanations are confusing. “Numbers being off” can certainly be concerning. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this tiredness and figure out what’s going on. Could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m… weak all the time. I still do for my garden, you know? Though not as much as I used to. It just… hits me. Like a wave. One minute I’m fine, the next I feel like I’ve run a marathon. And it’s not just physical, mind you. It’s… draining. Makes me not want to do anything. And it’s been going on… oh, goodness, months now. Maybe six? I honestly lose track. My husband, he mostly just tells me I need to rest more. Men. They never understand.
DOCTOR: I see. So it comes and goes, and it affects your energy levels both physically and mentally. Six months is a significant amount of time to be dealing with this. It’s good you’re seeking answers. The lab results do show some abnormalities, specifically with your vitamin D levels and a slightly elevated CK – that's creatine kinase – which can indicate muscle issues, as the young man mentioned. Before we jump to conclusions, I'd like to get a more complete picture. Could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… That’s a long one, dear. Let’s see. I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be thirty years ago now. And my knees, they bother me something fierce when it rains. Arthritis, the doctor said. Mostly just take some pills for it. And I had a… a little trouble with my heart, years ago. Nothing serious, just a flutter now and then. They put me on some medicine for that, but I stopped taking it. Didn't seem to be doing much good. Honestly, I can’t remember all the names of the pills. And my husband handles all the appointments. He’s good with that sort of thing. I mostly just… feel things. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Oitker. It's perfectly alright if you don’t remember all the medication names. We can work through it. So, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, arthritis in the knees, and a history of atrial fibrillation – that’s the heart flutter you mentioned – previously treated with medication. Do you happen to know what medication you were on for the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I really don’t. Little white pills, I think. Or maybe they were pink? Honestly, they all look the same after a while. My husband, he'd know. He keeps all the bottles. He’s very organized, bless his heart. I just told the doctor it wasn't working and he gave me something else, then I just… stopped taking them. Too many pills, you know? I don't like feeling like a walking pharmacy. Besides, it hadn't bothered me in years, so I figured I was fine. It’s probably nothing important now.
DOCTOR: I understand your feeling about not wanting to take a lot of medications. However, stopping medication for atrial fibrillation, even if you haven’t experienced symptoms recently, can be risky. It’s important to know if you’re adequately protected. Let's switch gears for a moment. Aside from the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, don't I know it. My legs, they ache sometimes. Not all the time, but especially at night. And I’ve been falling a bit more. Not big falls, just… stumbling. And my hands… they feel clumsy. Dropping things, you know? I thought it was just old age, frankly. And I've been more… irritable, I suppose. Snapping at my husband. He says I’m no fun anymore. It's just… everything feels harder now. And sometimes, I feel a little… short of breath. Not when I’m exerting myself, just… randomly. It’s probably just my nerves. I worry a lot, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Leg aches, especially at night, some stumbling, clumsiness in your hands, increased irritability, and occasional shortness of breath. These are all important things to note. The leg aches and stumbling, combined with the hand clumsiness, could indicate a potential neurological issue, or a vitamin deficiency. The shortness of breath needs to be investigated further, even if it’s infrequent. Now, Ms. Oitker, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I've never really had trouble with anything. Maybe a little sniffle when the flowers bloom in the spring, but that's all. I eat everything. My husband always says I have a cast iron stomach. He tries to get me to eat healthier, you know, but I like my food. I like my sweets. He worries about my sugar, but honestly, a little chocolate never hurt anyone. Is that what you’re asking? Allergies to food? No. Nothing like that. I’m a pretty simple woman, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. Well, there's the pills for my knees. The arthritis, you see. They're… brown, I think. Small ones. And I take a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor put me on that a few years ago. And… oh, yes! I take a multivitamin. My daughter sends them to me. She says I need to keep my strength up. And… sometimes I take a little aspirin for a headache. That's it, I think. Unless my husband has added something else without telling me. He likes to sneak things into my tea. He says it's good for me, but I don't always know what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so medication for arthritis, medication for blood pressure, a multivitamin, and aspirin as needed. We’ll definitely clarify the names and dosages. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s fine. I don't mind. I've had plenty of those in my life. Just don't poke me too hard, alright? My bones are a bit… brittle these days. And try not to make a fuss. I don't like being the center of attention. Just get it over with quickly, if you don't mind. My husband will be wondering where I am. He gets worried, you see. He’s a good man, but he fusses too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Oitker. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And we'll keep it as quick and efficient as we can. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is 78 and regular. I do hear a slight murmur, which we’ve noted on previous evaluations. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though her breathing sounds a little shallow. Next, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/85. Pulse is 76. Now, I’m going to examine your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, but slightly diminished in the lower extremities. Finally, I’ll perform a brief neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. Her gait is slightly unsteady, and there’s some mild tremor in her hands. Coordination is slightly impaired. Alright, Ms. Oitker. Thank you for your patience. Based on the physical exam and your history, I’m concerned about several possibilities, including a vitamin deficiency, potential neurological issues, and the possibility of underlying heart problems.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That sounds… serious. Underlying heart problems? I thought that murmur was nothing to worry about. A vitamin deficiency? I do feel tired all the time. And my hands… well, they haven't been steady for a while now. What does this mean, Doctor? Am I very sick? Is this something I should be worried about? My husband won't be happy if I'm very sick. He just retired, you see, and he was hoping we'd have a nice, quiet life. Please tell me it's nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, it's understandable to be worried. I want to assure you that we haven't reached a definitive diagnosis yet. Several things could be causing your symptoms, and we need to do some further testing to narrow down the possibilities. The murmur hasn't changed significantly, but it's important to investigate further, given your recent symptoms. And fatigue, hand tremors, and unsteadiness can be caused by a number of things, including vitamin deficiencies, nerve problems, or even early signs of neurological conditions. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels – especially B12 and D – as well as your thyroid function, kidney function, and a complete blood count to rule out anemia. I’d also like to order an EKG to assess your heart rhythm in more detail, and possibly a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So many tests. It all sounds very… complicated. And expensive, probably. My Medicare… I don't know if it will cover all of that. But… alright. If you think it's necessary, I suppose I should do it. I just want to feel better. A CT scan of the brain? That sounds… frightening. Will it hurt? And will I have to lie still for a long time? I don't like being confined. And I get claustrophobic, you know. My daughter had to hold my hand when I had that mammogram last year. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon next week with my friends, and I promised to bring my famous pineapple upside-down cake. I wouldn't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Oitker. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about these tests, especially the CT scan. We’ll take everything one step at a time. Regarding the costs, we'll submit everything to Medicare, and we'll make sure you understand any potential out-of-pocket expenses beforehand. Our billing department is very helpful with navigating those things. As for the CT scan, it doesn’t hurt at all. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped machine. You will need to lie still for a few minutes while the pictures are taken. We can discuss options to help with your claustrophobia, such as a mild sedative, or even an open MRI, although those aren’t always as detailed. We can also schedule it for first thing in the morning, when things are less hectic, and I can be there with you to provide reassurance. And regarding your luncheon, we’ll do our best to get these tests completed as quickly as possible so it doesn’t interfere. It shouldn't take more than a few days to get the results back. Would you like me to have the nurse draw the blood tests now, or would you prefer to schedule them for another day?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it won't take long… I suppose we can get the blood tests done now. The sooner it's over, the better. But please tell the nurse to be gentle. I bruise easily, you know. And I don't like needles. Not one bit. And… yes, please tell them to use a small needle. A really small one. And maybe a bandage with a pretty flower on it? That might make it a little less scary. And… could you remind me when my luncheon is? I'm afraid I'm a bit forgetful these days. I wouldn't want to miss my famous pineapple upside-down cake. My friends are counting on me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Oitker. I’ll make sure to tell the nurse to be as gentle as possible and to use the smallest needle available. And I’ll ask her to find a bandage with a pretty flower on it. Your luncheon is next Wednesday, the 13th, at 1:00 PM. We’ll make sure these tests are completed well before then. Now, let me go and get the nurse, and we'll get started. I’ll be right back. Please let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Thank you. You're very kind. Just… don't take too long. And remind the nurse about the small needle, please. It really does make a difference. .
