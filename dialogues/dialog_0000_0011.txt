DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, Doctor…Batara, is it? Look, I ain’t got all day. Just need a paper signed, that’s all. Some…procedure. Cosmetic, they called it. Young lady on the phone said I needed clearance from a doctor. Don’t rightly recall the details, to be honest. Never been one for…fussin’ with my appearance. Just want this over with.
DOCTOR: A “clearance,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Some…place. A beauty place, I believe. They want a doctor to say it’s alright…to do somethin’. I told ya, my memory ain't what it used to be. Seems a waste of time, frankly. Never understood why folks bother with all that…makin’ themselves up. But my niece… Bernice, that is…she insisted. Said it would…lift my spirits. Bernice always was dramatic.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Honcoop, while I appreciate you wanting to be brief, I do need some information to provide this “clearance.” It’s not simply a matter of signing off on something without knowing what it is you're having done. What exactly did this beauty place tell you they were planning?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I told you! I don't know! They just called about a paper. Said somethin’ about…lines on my face? And…somethin' about gettin’ poked with needles? I don’t like needles! It was all very fast. They kept talkin’ about “volume” and…I think “fillers”? Honestly, it sounded like a whole lotta nonsense. I just wanna get it over with so Bernice will stop naggin’.
DOCTOR: Needles and “fillers,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s right. They said it’ll…plump things up. Make me look…younger, I suppose. But I’m 64 years old! What's done is done, if you ask me. I don’t see the point. But Bernice…she said it’s “self-care”. Seems mighty foolish, spendin’ good money on lookin’ different. And frankly, I don't trust these places. All flash and no substance, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Let’s try this another way. Do you recall the name of this “beauty place”?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Now you’re askin’ somethin’ I really don’t recall. It was…somethin’ fancy. Lots of vowels, I think. Sounded French or somethin’. Bernice made the appointment. She handles all this…modern technology. I just gave her my name and address. Honestly, Doctor, I got better things to worry about than the name of a beauty parlor.
DOCTOR: Let’s see if we can find anything in the system… name, date of birth?
PATIENT: Date of birth… August the 14th, 1961. There. Don’t ask me to remember much else, though. My niece handles all the important details, always has. Honestly, this whole situation is a bother. I just want this paper signed, so I can get back to my work. Towers don’t fix themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Honcoop, I’ve found a record of a consultation request…from “Élan Vital Aesthetics.” They’ve requested medical clearance for… a full facial rejuvenation package, including Botox injections and hyaluronic acid fillers. And they specifically noted a concern about your…recent weight loss.
PATIENT: Weight loss?! What in the world… Look, I’m a thin man, always have been. Workin’ on towers ain’t exactly a sittin’ job, you know. Makes a man shed a few pounds. But “concern”? They didn’t say nothin’ about my weight to me. This is gettin’ ridiculous. Full facial… What now? Botox and…filler? Sounds like somethin’ for a fish. I tell ya, these people are tryin’ to pull somethin’.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, weight loss can be a medical concern. And it's particularly relevant when considering cosmetic procedures. It can affect healing, the distribution of filler, and the overall aesthetic outcome. Furthermore, Botox and fillers do carry risks, which is why I require a proper medical history before signing off on this request. You’ve lost weight recently, and I need to know about any underlying causes. Have you noticed any other changes in your health?
PATIENT: Look, I ain’t sick! I work hard, that’s all! Maybe I haven't been eatin' as much steak lately, so what? Towers don't build themselves, I tell ya! And this… “healing” business… I get a few scratches now and then, but I slap a bandage on it and keep workin'. I don’t have time to be lyin' around waitin' to "heal." And frankly, Doctor, I don’t appreciate bein' interrogated about my steak consumption. This is absurd.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Let me be clear. I am not interrogating you about your steak consumption. I am attempting to determine if you are a suitable candidate for a potentially invasive cosmetic procedure. Recent weight loss can indicate an underlying medical condition—something that could impact the safety and efficacy of these injections. Now, have you experienced any fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I’m gettin’ tired of these questions! I eat when I'm hungry, sleep when I'm tired, and go to the bathroom when I need to. That's about the extent of it! I ain’t got time for fancy medical terms and long explanations. I’m a tower man, not a doctor. I climb, I fix, I go home. This whole thing is a waste of my time, and frankly, it’s makin’ me uncomfortable. Just sign the paper and let me be, will ya?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I cannot ethically sign off on this request without a basic understanding of your medical history. And frankly, your dismissive attitude is concerning. You've lost a significant amount of weight, you're undergoing a cosmetic procedure that carries risks, and you refuse to provide any information about your overall health. Now, I need to ask you this one last time: Do you have any underlying medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Look, alright, alright! There…there was a little trouble with my stomach, a few months back. Just…a bit of discomfort, now and then. But it passed! Went away on its own. I didn’t bother with a doctor, didn’t seem worth the fuss. I just…ate some bland food for a week, and I was fine. Satisfied now? Is that what you wanted to hear? Now please, can we just get this over with? Bernice is gonna have a fit if I'm much longer.
DOCTOR: “Trouble with your stomach”?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s right. A bit of…upset. Didn’t sleep well for a few nights. But it passed, I tell ya! Like a bad dream. No blood, no…serious pain. Just a bit of…queasiness. And it’s gone now! I’m perfectly fine. Look at me! I climbed a tower yesterday. Perfectly healthy, as you can see. Now, are you going to sign the paper, or are you going to keep grillin’ me about my stomach? Bernice is gonna kill me if I don't get this done today.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I’ve found a record from three months ago at an urgent care facility. It states you presented with… severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and unintentional weight loss. They performed a CT scan, which revealed… a small intestinal obstruction. You were admitted to the hospital for three days and treated with intravenous fluids and nasogastric tube decompression. This is not “a bit of upset,” Mr. Honcoop. This is a serious medical condition.
PATIENT: …Oh. Well… that was Bernice. She…she takes me to the doctor when I don’t feel like goin’. She worries too much. Always has. I…I didn’t really pay attention to what they said. Just wanted to get outta there. I told her it was just somethin’ I ate. She insisted on the tests and the…the hospital. She always makes a big deal outta nothin’.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, you presented with a small intestinal obstruction. That is not “nothin’.” And it significantly impacts my ability to ethically approve this cosmetic procedure. Undergoing facial injections with an untreated, potentially unstable bowel is… irresponsible and dangerous. I cannot sign off on this request. Furthermore, I strongly recommend you follow up with a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management of your condition. We need to determine if the obstruction is resolved, and why you experienced this in the first place.
PATIENT: …Oh. Bernice is gonna be furious. She already booked the appointment… and paid for it. Said it’ll lift my spirits. I… I just wanted to make her happy. ....
DOCTOR: I understand you want to make your niece happy, Mr. Honcoop. But your health is far more important. I can provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist in the area, and I suggest you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Perhaps once you’ve addressed the underlying medical issue, we can revisit this conversation. But right now, proceeding with this cosmetic procedure would be… unwise. I will also provide you with a written summary of our conversation, as well as the referral information. Do you have any questions?
