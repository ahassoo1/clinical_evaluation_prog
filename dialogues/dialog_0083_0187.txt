DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Chest… hurts. And… heart goes fast sometimes. Doctor, I no have time for long talk. Just fix it. Blood pressure, you say? Is high. Wife tell me. She worry too much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowicz. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Your wife is right to be concerned if you're experiencing chest pain and a fast heartbeat. It's good you came in to have it checked. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the chest pain?
PATIENT: More? What more you need? It hurts. Like… tight. Here. Sometimes when I walk. Sometimes just… sitting. Not always. It comes and goes. Is annoying. I take pills, but… they not seem to do much. Old pills. Doctor before… he retired.
DOCTOR: Okay, "tight" is helpful. And it happens both with activity, like walking, and even when you're resting?
PATIENT: Yes. Like you said. Walking, sitting… doesn't matter. Just… happens. Is bad luck, maybe? My mother, she have heart trouble too. Very bad. You think is same? Don't tell me long story about tests, okay? Just… what you going to do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I'll do my best to be concise. It's certainly possible that your symptoms are related to heart issues, especially given your mother’s history. We need to gather some more information to understand what's going on. Before we discuss any potential tests, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Started…? Long time ago. Maybe… six months? Maybe more. I forget. I busy. Wife keep asking about it. She always ask. I tell her, “Is nothing!” But she worry. I think she make it worse, always talking about my heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or longer. And it sounds like this has been causing some stress for both of you. Now, besides the chest pain and fast heartbeat, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what symptoms? I feel… old. I get tired. Everything make me tired. Walking upstairs is hard. Is normal for old people! I no understand why I have to tell you all this. Is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. It is important to understand what’s normal for you, and what might be a sign of something else going on. Feeling tired is common as we age, but it's still important to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, swelling in your ankles or feet, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… sometimes. When I stand up too fast. Old people get dizzy. Is blood pressure, maybe? Ankles… no. Wife would tell me if my ankles were big. She notices everything. Shortness of breath… not really. Unless I climb very steep hill. Then, yes. But I no climb steep hills anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, so dizziness when standing up quickly, and shortness of breath with exertion. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications…? Hmph. Let me think. The old pills… for the blood. Doctor before gave me. I think they red. Small pills. And… sometimes I take something for my knee. When it hurts. Wife gets them. I no remember the names. She handle all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so red pills for blood pressure and something for your knee. It’s good your wife helps with that. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam…? I no like doctors touching me. Is not necessary. Just tell me what is wrong and give me pills. I have appointments later today. Important appointments. No time for poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Sobkowicz. However, a quick exam will help me assess your overall health and ensure I'm making the best possible recommendations. It won't take long, and it's a crucial step in determining the cause of your symptoms. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and perhaps feel your ankles. It will give me a better picture than just talking. Would you allow me to do those basic checks?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick. And no poking around too much. Just listen. And check blood pressure. That is all. I have things to do, you know. Important things. Don't waste my time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I will be as efficient as possible. Your heart sounds a little… irregular. I’m hearing a slightly faster rate and an occasional skipped beat. Your blood pressure is elevated, 150/85. And your pulse is a bit weak. I’m also noting some mild swelling in your ankles, although it’s not significant. These findings suggest that we need to investigate further. I recommend an EKG to assess your heart rhythm and some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests! I don’t like tests! What will tests show? Is just old age, I tell you! My mother had heart trouble, is genetics! No need for machines and needles. Just give me something for the chest pain and be done with it. I have a golf game later!
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Sobkowicz. However, while genetics can play a role, it’s important to determine the exact cause of your symptoms to ensure you receive the most appropriate treatment. The tests will help us differentiate between age-related changes, genetic predisposition, and potential underlying issues. An EKG is a simple, painless procedure that records your heart’s electrical activity. The blood work will provide valuable information about your overall health. Without this information, it's difficult to provide the best care. If you are unwilling to undergo these tests at this time, I can prescribe something for your chest pain, but I strongly recommend reconsidering the tests for your long-term health. Are you certain you do not want to proceed with the EKG and blood work?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine! Do the tests. But make it quick! And no waiting around all day. I have a schedule, you know. Important things. Golf. And… other things. Just get it over with. But I’m telling you, is nothing. Just old age.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Sobkowicz. I’ll have the nurse prepare you for the EKG and blood work right away. We'll do our best to be as efficient as possible. The nurse will explain the procedures to you in detail. After the tests are completed, we'll review the results and discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I will write you a temporary prescription for a low dose of nitroglycerin to use if you experience chest pain. However, this is only a temporary measure, and we need the test results to determine the best long-term course of action. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Nitroglycerin… What is that? Is it strong? I don’t want anything that will make me dizzy. And… will the tests interfere with my golf game?
DOCTOR: Nitroglycerin is a medication that helps to relax the blood vessels and improve blood flow to the heart. It’s often used to relieve chest pain caused by angina. The dose I’m prescribing is low, and side effects are uncommon. The most common side effect is a mild headache, and it’s rare to experience dizziness. As for your golf game, the blood work requires a simple blood draw, and the EKG is a non-invasive procedure. You should be able to resume your normal activities shortly after the tests are completed, unless the nurse advises you otherwise. The nurse will explain the potential side effects and precautions in detail. Do you have any other concerns before we begin?
PATIENT: No. Just… hurry up. I have a tee time. And tell the nurse not to poke me too hard.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicz. I will let the nurse know your concerns. She will be in shortly to begin the tests. Thank you for your patience. .
