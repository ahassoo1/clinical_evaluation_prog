DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Bartock, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s this…patchiness, really. On my skin. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, I find it unseemly. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it hasn’t gotten any better on its own. I keep hoping it will just go away, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Patchiness…unseemly. Hmm. And where exactly are you noticing this…patchiness?
PATIENT: Well, mostly on my arms, you see. Both of them. And a little bit on my chest. Not all over, thankfully. It’s… lighter than the rest of my skin, sort of faded. Like someone took a very weak eraser to it. It’s not a rash, mind you. I know what a rash looks like, and this isn’t that. It’s just… uneven. Do you see what I mean? It’s very noticeable.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Uneven pigmentation. And how long precisely has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I’d say, around the middle of July. Perhaps the 15th? It was right after we got back from visiting my husband's family in Connecticut. We were outdoors quite a bit, but I always wear sunscreen. A very good one, I assure you. SPF 50, minimum. Though, truthfully, the sun is so strong these days, isn't it? I’m quite diligent, really. It’s just… this shouldn’t be happening.
DOCTOR: Connecticut in July…sunscreen…right. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… changed? Not really. We’ve been eating the same things, same routine. My husband, Dimitri, started a new sort of…hobby. Woodworking, in the garage. But I don't go near the garage when he's working, dust and all. Honestly, I can’t imagine why that would have anything to do with it. It’s rather…messy. Are you thinking that's it? Because that seems… unlikely.
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions. Just trying to gather information. Any new soaps, lotions, detergents?
PATIENT: Oh, well… now that you mention it, yes. I did switch laundry detergents. Dimitri thought we should try one of those… environmentally friendly kinds. All natural, supposedly. I didn't particularly like the smell, it wasn't very… robust. And perhaps it doesn’t clean quite as well as our old one. But he was quite insistent. It's called... "Evergreen Breeze," I think? A dreadful name, honestly. I suppose it could be that. Though, really, one would think they test these things.
DOCTOR: Evergreen Breeze… right. Let's have a look. Please roll up your sleeves, Ms. Bartock. I'd like to examine the affected areas.
PATIENT: There. As you can see, it's rather subtle. Not a dramatic change, but… noticeable. Especially to me. I do hope you can see it. And honestly, I’m rather particular about my skin. I've always taken very good care of it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see some hypopigmentation. The texture feels normal. No scaling or inflammation. It appears to be a mild case of… post-inflammatory hypopigmentation. Likely caused by a minor irritant.
PATIENT: Post…what now? An irritant? What sort of irritant? Is it… serious? Will it scar? Dimitri will be quite upset if it scars. He prefers a…flawless complexion, you see. And I certainly don't want anything permanent. What needs to be done?
DOCTOR: It’s not serious, Ms. Bartock. “Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation” simply means that the skin lost some pigment after a mild irritation. Likely from the new detergent. It’s usually temporary. As for scarring, that's unlikely, but complete restoration of pigment isn’t guaranteed. I recommend switching back to your previous detergent and applying a bland emollient twice daily. We can reassess in three months. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Three months? Just… wait and see? And apply a… emollient? Is that all? Dimitri always says these doctors just give vague advice. Well, I suppose I can try switching back to the old detergent. But honestly, this is rather unsatisfactory. What kind of emollient are we talking about? Something expensive, I hope? One wouldn’t want to use just anything on one’s skin. And if it doesn't improve, what then? I expect more than just "reassessing" in three months.
DOCTOR: A bland emollient, Ms. Bartock, meaning a simple, fragrance-free moisturizer. Something like Cetaphil or Eucerin. If it doesn’t improve after three months, we can discuss potential, more aggressive, treatments. Topical steroids, perhaps. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. For now, switch detergents, apply the moisturizer, and monitor the situation. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Topical steroids? That sounds… drastic. And Cetaphil? Honestly. Dimitri gets me much nicer things. But fine. I'll…try it. Though I doubt it will do much good. Very well. I suppose I haven't any other questions at the moment. Just… don’t expect me to be pleased if this doesn’t clear up. And three months is a long time to walk around looking… uneven.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Bartock. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in three months. Have a good day. .
