DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Rannells. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure, I suppose. Though I must say, this location...rather rustic, isn't it? But never mind that. I’m here about obtaining a certification for… medical marijuana. My daughter has been telling me about it for ages, and frankly, I’m at my wit’s end trying to get a decent night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you’re hoping to explore medical marijuana as a potential option for sleep difficulties. That's perfectly reasonable. We can certainly discuss that. Before we proceed with a certification, though, I need to gather some information to ensure it’s a safe and appropriate course of action for you. Could you tell me a bit more about these sleep difficulties?
PATIENT: Well, “difficulties” is putting it mildly, Doctor. I’ve always been a light sleeper, but it’s gotten progressively worse. I wake up several times a night, tossing and turning. And when I do manage to drift off, it’s not restful. I feel…drained, constantly. It’s quite disruptive, really. I used to be a very productive woman, you understand. I was a bailiff for… well, a long time. Still am, technically, but I can’t concentrate like I used to. It's embarrassing, honestly. And I certainly don’t need any more…complications.
DOCTOR: I see. So, this has been a progressive issue, impacting your sleep quality and subsequently, your daily functioning. And it’s affecting your concentration at work, which is understandably frustrating. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... It's been… at least a year, I’d say. Maybe longer. Time does seem to slip away when one isn’t properly rested, doesn't it? It really started to become a problem around the time my grandson started college. All the worry, I suppose. He's a good boy, but… boys will be boys. A lot of late nights and questionable decisions. That certainly didn’t help my peace of mind. And when I worry, everyone suffers. It's just… exhausting.
DOCTOR: It sounds like stress has been a significant factor. A year or more of disrupted sleep is certainly something we need to address. Now, to get a more complete understanding, I’d like to ask you a few more questions. This will help me determine if medical marijuana is a suitable option, and also rule out any other potential causes for your sleep issues. Do you experience any difficulties falling asleep, or is it mainly staying asleep that’s the problem?
PATIENT: It’s… both, really. Sometimes I lie in bed for ages, just staring at the ceiling. And then, when I finally do drift off, I wake up after only a few hours. It's a vicious cycle. Honestly, Doctor, I've tried everything. Warm milk, chamomile tea, those… lavender pillow sprays. Nothing seems to make a lasting difference. And I refuse to take those sleeping pills. Horrible things, I hear. Mess with your head, they do. I have enough… complications as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to try sleeping pills. It's good you're being cautious. Now, besides the stress with your grandson, have you experienced any other significant life stressors lately?
PATIENT: Well… my husband, Harold, isn’t as… vigorous as he used to be. He’s quite set in his ways, you understand, and lately he’s been… demanding. It's not anything major, mind you. Just little things. Complaining about the temperature, the food, the television volume. It's exhausting, constantly catering to his whims. And he always has to be right, you see. Always. It’s a very… draining situation. It’s not suffering, precisely, but it certainly doesn’t help my peace of mind. And when I’m not at peace, no one is.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like there are some ongoing challenges in your personal life that are contributing to your stress levels. To get a better overall picture of your health, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... I had a touch of arthritis in my knees a few years back, but it’s mostly manageable with a bit of walking and some… herbal remedies. Nothing serious, really. And I had my gallbladder removed when I was younger, but that was decades ago. Otherwise… nothing major. I’ve always been a relatively healthy woman, you understand. Good genes, I suppose. Although, truthfully, I do worry about Harold’s cholesterol. He refuses to watch his diet. It's just… frustrating. But my health has always been quite good, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No significant past medical history besides the arthritis and gallbladder removal. And you mentioned Harold's cholesterol; that's something to be aware of. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of potassium for my legs, sometimes. They cramp up if I walk too much, you see. And I take a daily multivitamin, of course. Can’t hurt, I always say. Otherwise, no. I prefer to avoid those… chemicals, if I can. They never seem to do what they promise, and they always have such dreadful side effects. I’d rather rely on… natural remedies, if possible. A bit of ginger for my stomach, chamomile for my nerves. That sort of thing. I’m a sensible woman, Doctor. I know what’s good for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so potassium supplement, daily multivitamin, and primarily natural remedies. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, thank goodness. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. No allergies whatsoever. I can eat anything, take anything… well, almost anything. I’m a very… robust woman, you understand. Good constitution. Although, I do find that certain cheeses give me indigestion, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? Just a bit of… discomfort. Nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very healthy woman. I just need a little help… getting a decent night’s sleep. And I’m hoping this… medical marijuana might be the answer.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. Now, just a few final questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! Absolutely not! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were dreadful for your health, and I listened to her. Harold tried them once, many years ago, but I put a stop to that immediately. A sensible woman doesn't smoke, Doctor. It's simply… unladylike. And bad for your lungs, of course. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea, thank you very much. Far more civilized.
DOCTOR: Alright, no history of smoking. That's good to know. And, just to clarify, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. A nice Chardonnay, perhaps. Nothing excessive, Doctor. I’m not a… heavy drinker. Harold enjoys a bit of scotch after supper, but I find it… rather strong. I prefer something a bit more… delicate. Just a small glass of wine, to relax. Nothing more. A sensible woman knows her limits, you understand. And I certainly wouldn’t dream of… overindulging.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a small glass of wine occasionally. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Now, Ms. Rannells, before we discuss the possibility of a certification for medical marijuana, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just to get a baseline and ensure there aren’t any other underlying issues contributing to your sleep difficulties. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, well, alright. I suppose that makes sense. A sensible woman doesn’t object to a bit of… due diligence. Though I do hope it won’t take too long. I have bridge club this afternoon, you see. And Mildred gets terribly cross if one is late. Honestly, the women at that club… they can be quite… particular. But yes, go ahead. Just try to be quick, if you would be so kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please sit back and take some deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, Doctor, I have a perfectly good stethoscope at home. Harold bought it years ago, for… reasons I've never quite understood. But yes, go ahead. Deep breaths, you say? inhales deeply There. Is that sufficient? I do hope you have a clean earpiece. One never knows where those things have been… exhales slowly.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds clear on both sides. Good breath sounds. Now, I'm just going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Within normal limits. Now, I'll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears look clear, and your throat is a bit dry but otherwise normal. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, Doctor, my Harold used to be a rather skilled physician himself, you know. He always insisted on a thorough examination. Reflexes, you say? I’ve always prided myself on my… responsiveness. Though truthfully, I haven’t been feeling quite as… nimble lately. The lack of sleep, I suppose. Go ahead, Doctor. Do your… work. But please be gentle. These bones aren’t getting any younger, you understand. I tap my foot impatiently.
DOCTOR: Alright, your reflexes are slightly diminished, but within an acceptable range for your age. That could be related to the lack of sleep, as you mentioned. Finally, I’ll just do a brief neurological exam – check your balance and coordination. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, Doctor, I’ve always prided myself on my… poise. Walking, you say? I’ve walked many a mile in my time, you understand. Bailiff work is rather demanding, physically. One must maintain a… presence, you see. I continue walking, with a slightly exaggerated gait, carefully avoiding any sudden movements. Though truthfully, I haven’t been feeling quite as… steady lately. The lack of sleep, I suppose. I come to a stop, regaining my composure. There. Is that sufficient? Do be careful with your assessment, Doctor. I’m a sensible woman, but even sensible women can lose their balance.
DOCTOR: Alright, your gait is slightly slower and more deliberate than expected, but your balance appears stable. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal any significant abnormalities that would contraindicate a medical marijuana certification. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it seems like sleep disturbance, likely related to stress, is the primary issue. Given your preference for natural remedies and your age, and considering the potential risks of traditional sleep aids, medical marijuana could be a reasonable option to explore. However, I want to be thorough. Do you have any concerns about trying medical marijuana?
PATIENT: Well… Mildred has been telling me about all sorts of… side effects. Drowsiness, paranoia, forgetting things. Honestly, the stories she tells… it's quite alarming. And I certainly don't want to become… unhinged. I have bridge club, you see. And one must maintain a… certain level of decorum. Though truthfully, I'm desperate. I haven't had a decent night’s sleep in months. And if it means a little drowsiness, well… perhaps it's a price I’m willing to pay. But I certainly don’t want to become… unreliable. And I certainly don’t want to forget my bidding conventions. I look at Dr. Rakosky expectantly. What sort of… safeguards are in place? And what if I become… Mildred?
DOCTOR: Those are all valid concerns, Ms. Rannells. It's good you're thinking about potential risks. The side effects you mentioned – drowsiness, paranoia, memory impairment – are possible, but not everyone experiences them, and they're often dose-dependent. We would start with a very low dose and gradually increase it, monitoring your response closely. There are a few safeguards in place. First, we can start with a product that has a low THC content – THC is the psychoactive component that causes the "high." We can also consider a product that has a higher CBD content – CBD is non-psychoactive and has calming effects. And, we'll regularly check in with you to assess your response and adjust the dosage as needed. Regarding becoming “Mildred,” we’ll work with you to find a dosage and strain that minimizes any unwanted side effects. And, if you experience any significant side effects, we can always reduce the dosage or discontinue the medication altogether. Are you comfortable with proceeding with a medical marijuana certification, keeping those safeguards in mind?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, Doctor, I’m still somewhat apprehensive. Mildred, you see, has become… quite insistent about her bridge club strategy. And I certainly don’t want to become… competitive. But truthfully, I’m desperate. I haven't had a decent night’s sleep in months. And if it means a little drowsiness, and as long as I don't become… Mildred, well… perhaps it’s a risk I’m willing to take. But I want a guarantee, Doctor. A guarantee. That I won’t become… unreliable. And that I won’t forget my bidding conventions. And that I won't suddenly develop a penchant for… aggressive tactics. Is that possible? I look at Dr. Rakosky expectantly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Rannells, I understand your apprehension, and I appreciate you voicing your concerns so clearly. Unfortunately, I can’t offer you a guarantee. Medicine is rarely absolute, and everyone responds differently. However, I can assure you that we will work closely together to minimize any potential risks and maximize the benefits. We will start with a very conservative dose, monitor your response carefully, and adjust the medication as needed. We’ll also discuss potential interactions with any other medications you’re taking, and provide you with clear instructions on how to use the medication safely and effectively. And, if you experience any unwanted side effects, we can always reduce the dosage or discontinue the medication altogether. If you’re willing to proceed with that understanding, I can complete the necessary paperwork for a medical marijuana certification. It will require a brief form and a small fee. Would you like me to proceed?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, you’re a remarkably persuasive physician. And truthfully, I’m at my wit’s end. The bridge club, you see… it’s quite competitive. And I certainly don’t want to lose my edge. Yes, proceed with the paperwork. But I expect a thorough explanation of any potential side effects, Doctor. And I want a clear understanding of how to… discontinue the medication, should it become… necessary. And I want your direct line, in case Mildred suddenly appears. I look at Dr. Rakosky expectantly. Let’s get this over with. Before I become… unreliable.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Rannells. I will provide you with a detailed information sheet outlining the potential side effects, drug interactions, and instructions on how to discontinue the medication safely. I will also provide you with my direct line, and encourage you to contact me immediately if you experience any concerns. Here is the form. It asks for some basic information, your medical history, and your preferred method of administration. I will review it with you once you've completed it. Take your time, and please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions. After we complete the paperwork, I’ll provide you with a certification that you can take to a licensed dispensary.
