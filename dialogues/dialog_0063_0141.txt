DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s just… this itching. Everywhere, really. It started a few weeks back, maybe a month, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not terrible pain, just… constant. It’s really annoying when I’m trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Itching, you say. And it’s been… approximately a month?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly a month. Hard to pinpoint exactly, you know? Things blur together these days. But definitely not longer than six weeks, I'd say. It’s pretty consistent, all over. Arms, legs, back… even my scalp sometimes. Not everywhere all at once, but it moves around. Like a restless spirit, ha.
DOCTOR: A restless spirit. Right. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I haven’t changed soaps or detergents, nothing like that. Food’s the same… well, as much as it can be, living out here. It’s pretty limited, you know? No new pets, haven’t been on any trips… Oh! Wait a minute. I did start taking a new vitamin supplement. About the same time the itching started. It’s one of those all-in-one things, for older folks… memory and energy, that sort of thing. I can't recall the name, though. My daughter picked it out.
DOCTOR: An all-in-one supplement. And your daughter purchased it… I see. Do you recall the color of the bottle, or perhaps anything else about the packaging?
PATIENT: Let me see… the bottle was… a dark blue, I think. A really dark, almost navy blue. And it had a picture of, oh gosh, this is hard… a tree on it? A big, old oak tree, maybe. And some writing about antioxidants, I remember that much. It wasn’t a huge bottle, fairly standard size, I’d say. It's on the kitchen counter, if that helps. My memory's not what it used to be, but I think it was a mail order thing. She gets me all sorts of things from those catalogs.
DOCTOR: A dark blue bottle with a tree… very well. And is this itching constant throughout the day, or does it worsen at certain times?
PATIENT: It's pretty consistent, honestly. But… it is worse at night. Definitely. That’s when it really keeps me up. I toss and turn, trying to scratch without waking myself completely. And then I just feel… restless, you know? Like a buzzing energy I can’t get rid of. It makes it hard to fall asleep even before the itching starts.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to examine your skin. Please, if you would, lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your back, if you don't mind.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything. It’s a bit of a climb for an old fella, ha. I haven't been this undressed in front of a doctor in years.
DOCTOR: Hmm. I observe some mild excoriations, consistent with scratching. No obvious rash or lesions present. Skin appears otherwise normal in texture. Similar findings on the arms. Some scattered areas of redness, but nothing particularly alarming. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or fatigue accompanying this itching?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. I feel… tired, maybe? But that’s just normal old age catching up with me, I reckon. I sleep poorly because of the itching, so I’m usually a bit sluggish in the mornings. But I haven’t had a temperature or anything like that. No other symptoms, just the relentless itch. It's driving me mad, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given the timeline and your recent introduction of this supplement, I suspect it may be the culprit. These “all-in-one” vitamins often contain ingredients that can trigger allergic reactions or sensitivities in some individuals. We will need to rule out other possibilities, of course. I will order a complete blood count and a liver function panel to assess your overall health and identify any potential underlying issues. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to discontinue use of the supplement immediately. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Stop the supplement, understood. Sounds reasonable to me. I was hoping it wouldn’t be something serious, and if it’s just that vitamin thing, that's a relief. How long before I'd know the results of those tests? And… will stopping the vitamin immediately fix the itching, do you think? Or will it take a while for my body to recover?
DOCTOR: The lab results should be available within approximately three business days. As for the itching, discontinuing the supplement should alleviate the symptoms, but it may take some time for your body to fully recover – potentially a week or two. If the itching persists beyond that timeframe, or if it worsens, you will need to return for further evaluation. I will send the lab order to the front desk. They will schedule you for a blood draw. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. Three days for the results, stop the vitamin… I can handle that. Thank you for listening to me and taking it seriously. It’s just… it’s been a while since I’ve felt this bothered by something. I appreciate you looking into it.
DOCTOR: Very well. I shall send the discharge instructions to the front desk as well. And please, if anything changes, do not hesitate to contact the clinic. That will be all. You may get dressed now. Do try to get some rest. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you again, Doctor. I will. Have a good day.
