DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Steines, let’s get straight to it. You’re ninety years old, which, frankly, is… remarkable. But that also means a lot can happen over the years. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you kindly. Doctor... Dech-ene, is it? My blood pressure's been a little high, that's what the nurse said when she took it. Been feelin' a bit tired too, but at my age, who isn't? I just want to get it checked and make sure it's nothin' too serious. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: “Dech-ene,” yes, that’s correct. And you’re not being a bother, though I do have other patients waiting. “A little high,” you say. That’s… vague. Do you have any idea what the numbers were?
PATIENT: Numbers? Oh dear, no. I don't pay much attention to numbers. The nurse just said it was up a bit and I needed to see you. I mostly just feel a little… worn out, like I've been walkin' uphill all day, even when I haven't. Is that makin' any sense? I don't really understand all that blood pressure business.
DOCTOR: It’s…unhelpful when patients don’t recall basic information. “Walkin’ uphill,” right. And how long has this “worn out” feeling been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Probably… a few weeks now. Maybe a month? It comes and goes, you see. Some days I feel alright, and others… well, others I just need to sit a spell. It's hard to say exactly. Time kinda…blurs together after a while, don't it? I’m sorry I can’t be more precise.
DOCTOR: “Blurs together,” yes, I suppose it does. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my head feels a little…fuzzy. Not a bad headache, just kinda…light. And my ankles… they get a bit swollen if I’ve been on my feet too long. But I figured that was just old age settlin' in. I do a lot of bakin', you see. Standing a lot. Is that important?
DOCTOR: “Old age settling in” is rarely a diagnosis, Ms. Steines. Swollen ankles could be relevant. And baking… standing for prolonged periods isn't ideal. Do you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Pal…what now? No, nothin' like that. My chest feels alright, and I can breathe just fine. Though sometimes I get a little winded climbin' the stairs, but that’s been happenin’ for years. Just gotta take things slow, that’s all. I’m a baker, remember? Gotta get those pies in the oven! I mostly worry about my hands, to be honest. Arthritis is a real bother.
DOCTOR: Right. I see here you have a history of osteoarthritis. And no chest pain or shortness of breath. Let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just try to be gentle with my hands, if you would. They're how I make a livin', you see.
DOCTOR: Your hands do show significant arthritis. Heart sounds are… within normal limits, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear. As expected, there’s some edema in your ankles, bilateral. Blood pressure is currently 148/92. Not ideal, but not critically high. I’d like to order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Oh my. All that sounds…serious. Is that bad? 148…whatever that is. I just want to keep bakin' pies, Doctor. Is that gonna be alright? Will these tests tell you if I can still do that?
DOCTOR: “Serious” is a relative term, Ms. Steines. It means we need to investigate. The tests will help rule out underlying causes for your fatigue and elevated blood pressure. It doesn’t automatically mean you’ll have to stop baking. We need data first. The lab technician will draw blood now. I'll review the results when they come in and we can discuss a plan then. For now, try to elevate your feet when you can, and limit your salt intake. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Salt… that’ll be hard. My pies need salt! But I can try. I always used to say a pinch of salt makes everything better. I'll try my best, Doctor. Thank you for lookin' after me. I just hope I can keep bakin'. It's all I've got, really.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab technician is ready for you now. We’ll take it one step at a time, Ms. Steines. Please let me know if you experience any chest pain or significant shortness of breath before your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: Alright then. Thank you, Doctor. I'll be careful. And I'll try to lay off the salt… for the pies' sake, if not my own. .
