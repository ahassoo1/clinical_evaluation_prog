DOCTOR: Hi Teah, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Maskal, nice to meet you too! It’s good to be here. I’m just in for a check-up, you know, the usual shots to keep everything ticking. Routine immunization visit, I think the lady on the phone called it. I try to stay on top of things, but sometimes I forget what I’ve had already!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Teah! Staying up-to-date on your immunizations is really important. And don't worry about forgetting – it happens to the best of us. Let’s take a look at your records here. I see this is scheduled as a preventative visit, and we can definitely go over what vaccines you might need. To start, have you had a flu shot this year, or in the last six months?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... I think I got one last fall, maybe around November? It was at a community thing, down at the tribal center. But honestly, my memory’s a little fuzzy. It feels like a long time ago now. I can't be 100% sure though. Would that be in my records?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s see... ah, yes, it looks like you did receive a flu vaccine on November 15th of last year. Good! That’s one less thing to worry about. Now, besides the flu shot, are you up-to-date on your tetanus booster?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know! I always worry I’m forgetting something important. Tetanus… let me see. I think I had one… maybe ten years ago? I was helping my husband build a fence, and I remember getting poked with a nail, so I went to get it checked and probably boosted then. But again, that was a long time ago! Is there a way to tell for sure?
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s take a look… Okay, it looks like your last tetanus booster was actually… February 12th, 2018. So, it has been a while! It’s recommended to get a booster every ten years, and sometimes sooner if you have a wound like you mentioned. Now, to get a better picture of everything, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or if you’ve had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, wow, 2018! See, this is why I come! My memory is terrible. Okay, medical conditions… Well, I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, just from getting older and doing a lot of work. Nothing too bad, just a bit creaky sometimes. No surgeries though, thankfully. Never had to go under the knife! I'm pretty healthy otherwise, I think. I try to eat good and stay active.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re staying active! And it’s common to have some joint stiffness as we age. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... Just some ibuprofen sometimes for my knees when they're really bothering me. And I take a daily vitamin D, especially in the winter since we don't get a lot of sunshine here. Other than that, no, nothing regular. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Is vitamin D something I need to tell you about specifically? It's pretty common, I thought.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re mindful of what you’re taking. And yes, it’s good to know about the vitamin D – even though it's common, it can sometimes interact with other medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of! I've been pretty lucky that way. My husband's got a shellfish allergy, so we're careful when we eat out, but I can eat anything. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I always tell people that's one thing I don't worry about.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My mom smoked, and it wasn't pretty, so I stayed far away from it. My husband used to, but he quit about twenty years ago. He's much healthier now. I'm glad he kicked that habit. Anything else?
DOCTOR: That’s great to hear! Avoiding smoking is one of the best things you can do for your health. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing heavy, just a little something to relax. Maybe a couple of times a week, if that. It's not a regular thing, though. Mostly just on the weekends, or when we're having company. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It’s helpful to have a general idea. Now, before we talk about which vaccines you might need, are there any other concerns you have today?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really, not at the moment. Just trying to stay on top of things and make sure I'm not missing anything. You've been very thorough, Dr. Maskal, and I appreciate that. I guess… just tell me what you think I need, and we'll get it done. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Teah. Okay, looking at everything, it looks like you are due for a Tdap booster – that protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis . Even though you had a Tetanus booster in 2018, the recommendation is to get a Tdap once as an adult, and then a Td booster every ten years after that. And since you are over 50, I recommend the shingles vaccine. It’s a two-dose series, and it’s very effective at preventing shingles, which can be quite painful. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. Shingles… I’ve heard stories about that, and it doesn’t sound fun. I'd definitely want to avoid that. And the Tdap… I guess I haven't had that one as an adult. If you think I need those, then let’s do it. I trust you. What does the process look like? And is there any paperwork involved?
DOCTOR: Great! I'm glad you agree. The process is very straightforward. Both vaccines are given as a single injection in your upper arm. You might feel a little soreness at the injection site for a day or two, but it’s usually mild. There’s a consent form for each vaccine that explains the potential side effects and risks, which we'll go over together. I'll also give you information sheets about each vaccine. Let me get those forms for you now. Do you have any questions before we start?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… is there a cost to these vaccines? I don't have insurance, so I’m a little worried about the price. I didn’t really think about that when I scheduled the appointment. I should have asked, I guess. Sorry to bring it up now.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and you shouldn’t apologize at all! It’s important to know the costs upfront. Since you don't have insurance, the cost for the Tdap vaccine is $85, and the shingles vaccine is $170 per dose – so $340 total for the series. However, we do have a program that offers reduced rates for patients without insurance. Let me see if you qualify. It looks like you do qualify for a significant discount! The Tdap will be $30, and each dose of the shingles vaccine will be $70 – so $170 total for both. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Oh, wow! That's a huge relief! $170 is much more manageable. Yes, that works perfectly, thank you so much! You’re a lifesaver, Dr. Maskal. I really appreciate you checking for that program. Okay, let’s get started then. Where do I sign?
DOCTOR: Wonderful! Here are the consent forms. Just read through them, initial each section, and sign at the bottom. Take your time, and please let me know if you have any questions as you go through them. I'll be right here if you need anything. After you've signed those, we can get you scheduled for the second dose of the shingles vaccine. It needs to be given two to six months after the first dose.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Alright, all signed! This looks pretty straightforward. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. You’ve made this really easy. So, two to six months for the second shot… I should probably put a reminder in my phone, right? My memory is just terrible!
DOCTOR: Perfect! And yes, a reminder in your phone is an excellent idea! I’ll also give you a printout with the dates and details of your vaccinations, and our office will send you a reminder card as well. Let me get you scheduled for your second shingles vaccine now… How about August 15th?
