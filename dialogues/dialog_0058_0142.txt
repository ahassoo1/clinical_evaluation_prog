DOCTOR: Alright, Jaxston. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. It's… my head. It’s been giving me trouble again. Really bad headaches. And I get all sweaty when they happen, and my heart races, you know? It’s… happened a few times now. I can’t really remember exactly when though, to be honest. It just… comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Headaches.” Right. And you say they come and go… so, not constant?
PATIENT: No, definitely not constant. It’s not like a… a dull ache all the time. It’s more like… BAM. Sudden. Really intense for a bit, then it fades. It’s hard to explain. I wish I could remember what sets them off, but I really don’t know. I just… feel awful when they hit.
DOCTOR: "Sudden." Okay. And when you say "intense," on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, where would you put it?
PATIENT: Ten… hmm. Wow, that’s a tough one. Probably an eight, I’d say. Maybe even a nine sometimes. It's hard to think straight when it’s happening, so it feels worse than it probably is. Like… everything just spins, and I have to lie down. And then the sweating… and my heart feels like it’s gonna jump outta my chest. It scares me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Sweating and a racing heart… Right. Well, those can be concerning. Have you ever had anything like this checked out before?
PATIENT: To be honest? I… don’t really remember. I mean, I’ve been to the doctor before, obviously, but I can't say I specifically remember getting checked for this. I was… married a while back, and my ex-wife usually handled all that stuff. I'm divorced now, and things are a bit… hazy, you know? I just figured it was stress or something. But it keeps happening, so I thought I should probably get it looked at.
DOCTOR: "Stress." Right. Well, sometimes headaches are just that. But given the sweating and racing heart, we need to rule some things out. Do you have any other symptoms with the headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… not really, I don't think. Maybe a little bit of nausea sometimes, right before it really hits. But not always. And… sometimes I feel a bit dizzy afterwards. But that could just be from lying down, you know? It’s hard to separate things out. I wish I was better at remembering details. Honestly, I'm not even sure if that's helpful information.
DOCTOR: "Nausea." Okay. Have you noticed anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers… that's a good question. I really haven’t. I mean, I’ve tried to think about it, but I just… can’t put my finger on anything. It doesn’t seem to be related to food, or… being tired, or anything like that. It just comes on randomly. Which is kinda scary, if you ask me. I don’t like not knowing what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll do a basic neurological exam. It's probably nothing, but we need to be thorough.
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? That's fine with me. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m not great with medical stuff, so… bear with me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table face up, that’d be great. I’m going to start with your blood pressure. Okay. Blood pressure is… 130 over 85. Pulse is 78. Not terrible. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Reflexes… alright. Just tell me what to do. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. Is it bad if my pulse is a little high? I get anxious at the doctor's office sometimes.
DOCTOR: It can be slightly elevated due to anxiety, yes. But we'll keep an eye on it. Now, just relax your legs. I’m going to tap your knees with this little hammer. It’s perfectly normal. Okay. Reflexes are… 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Now, I'm going to check your cranial nerves… look straight ahead. Do you see this pen?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, I see the pen. It’s… blue. Is that good? I’m trying to relax, I promise. I just… don’t like being poked and prodded, you know? It makes me tense up. I hope that doesn’t mess up the results. Is a 2+… good? I’m sorry for being a pain.
DOCTOR: A 2+ is normal. It means your reflexes are within the expected range. It’s… fine. Now, follow my pen with your eyes without moving your head. Okay. Eye movements are… intact. Now, I want you to squeeze your eyes shut tightly, and don’t let me open them.
PATIENT: Okay, squeezing my eyes shut… Don’t let you open them… I’m trying! It’s… kinda hard to keep them closed. I don’t think I’m very strong. I’m sorry, I think you can open them now. Is everything okay? I’m really trying to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay. Grip strength is… slightly diminished, but not significantly concerning at this point. Alright. That’s enough for now. Based on this brief exam, it could be tension headaches, or possibly migraines. But the sweating and racing heart make me want to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order a basic blood panel and a CT scan of your head, just to be safe.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh. Wow. That sounds… serious. Is it something really bad? Is there anything wrong with my head? I thought it was just… headaches. A blood panel I understand, but a scan… Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Lawther. We’re just being thorough. It doesn’t necessarily mean there's anything wrong. It’s to rule out things like… structural abnormalities or anything that could be causing the headaches. The blood panel will check for infection or electrolyte imbalances. We need a baseline to work from. Honestly, you're young and otherwise appear healthy, so it's probably nothing. But we need to rule things out. I'll send the orders to the lab and radiology. You’ll need to schedule the CT scan. The lab can take your blood today. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they come in. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, alright. Scheduling a scan… I guess so. I’m not good with hospitals. Or… medical stuff in general. Will it take long? And… is it expensive? I don’t… I don’t have insurance right now. That’s kinda why I waited so long to come in, to be honest. I didn’t want a huge bill.
DOCTOR: The CT scan shouldn’t take long, maybe 15-20 minutes. As for the cost… I don’t have access to the billing information. You’ll need to speak with the billing department. Honestly, Mr. Lawther, I can order the tests, but I can’t control the cost. There might be financial assistance programs available at the hospital, you should ask about those. Here are the orders for the lab and radiology. I’ll also give you the hospital’s contact information. I suggest you call them immediately to schedule the scan and inquire about payment options. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Financial assistance… I’ll have to look into that. Um… no, I think that’s it. Just… try not to worry too much, right? It’s probably nothing, like you said. Thank you… for ordering the tests. I appreciate it. I guess I’ll go call the hospital now.
