DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, it's... unpleasant, alright? Been throwing up blood. Not a ton, but enough to worry a fella. It started a couple days ago, just felt sick to my stomach, then... well, you get the picture. It's not something you ignore, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it certainly isn't. Vomiting blood is… concerning, as you said. Okay. Let’s get some details. When you say a couple of days ago, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm. Let me think. It was... Tuesday, I reckon. Yeah, Tuesday morning. Woke up feeling kinda queasy, thought it was just something I ate. Had a bit of a spicy lamb dish the night before, figured that was it. But then it didn't go away, and then... that started happening. It's been on and off since, mostly after I eat something. Not a huge amount each time, but enough to... make a mess, let's put it that way. Is that specific enough for ya? I don't carry a diary, doc.
DOCTOR: Tuesday morning… alright. And you said it happens mostly after you eat?
PATIENT: Yeah, usually after. Doesn't seem to matter what I eat, really. Toast, soup, even just a cracker. Though, like I said, that lamb dish the night before... that's when it all started. Maybe it was bad? I got it from that new place downtown, "Spice Paradise" or something. Fancy name for what? A stomach ache and this whole mess. Not a good sign, is it? I haven't been feeling right at all since then.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the vomiting, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Well, I've been feeling pretty weak, I suppose. Tired, mostly. And a little lightheaded when I stand up too fast. Nothing too dramatic, but definitely not my usual self. Oh, and my stomach's been cramping a bit, on and off. It feels... empty, kinda. Even when I have eaten something. It’s a weird feeling. Like something’s gnawing at me, if you get what I mean. Been a bit thirsty too, but that could be the weather. It's been hotter than blazes lately. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright. Weakness, lightheadedness, cramping, thirst… and the vomiting, of course. Have you had any fever, chills, or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. Definitely no diarrhea. Just… this. And the weakness. Honestly, doc, I'm starting to get a little worried. I've never had anything like this before. I'm a pretty simple man, eat my lamb, watch a bit of TV, you know? This is throwing me for a loop. I don’t even know what a 'chills' even feels like, to be honest. I live in California, for crying out loud. It's rarely cold enough for chills. But no, nothing like that. Just… this.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Not much to tell ya, doc. I had the chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else. Broke my arm once falling off a roof when I was younger, but that healed up fine. Other than that… nothing. I’ve been lucky, I guess. I don’t go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to. And honestly, this whole thing… it feels ridiculous. A grown man getting sick over a bit of lamb. Makes me feel like a weakling. But I figured throwing up blood was worth a visit, even for someone like me. Never been sick like this before, though. I’m telling ya.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant past medical history. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Not to anything. I can eat anything, pretty much. Never had a reaction to anything in my life. Peanuts, shellfish, penicillin… nothing bothers me. I’ve even tried those really spicy peppers, just to see, and I was fine. My wife… bless her soul… she was the one with all the allergies. Pollen, cats, dust… everything made her sneeze. I just… eat. That’s all. And now I’m throwing up blood. It’s just… doesn’t make any sense. It’s like my body's decided to rebel for no good reason.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? Nah. I don’t take anything. Never have. Don’t believe in loading up on pills if I can avoid it. Maybe some aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. And I haven’t taken anything for a headache in months. I just… tough it out. Like my wife used to say, "A little pain builds character." She was always a tough one. Now I'm here, throwing up blood and building… what exactly? A bad medical bill? It doesn’t seem worth it. I don't understand why I need medication, I just need to stop throwing up blood.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll need to palpate your abdomen. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Palpate my… what now? Look, I’m not a doctor, doc. You gotta speak English. Just tell me what you wanna do. Lie down? Yeah, alright. Fine. But don't go poking around too much, alright? I've got a sensitive stomach, as you can tell. Just be gentle, okay? And hurry it up, would ya? This is making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, Mr. Gentz. I'm just checking to see if anything feels particularly tender. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is… mildly tender in the upper quadrants. No guarding or rigidity. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Mildly tender? That’s a nice way of putting it. It feels… uncomfortable, alright? Like someone’s squeezing my insides. And yeah, it hurts when you press there. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like a bruise, maybe. But on the inside. And it’s making me nauseous just lying here, to be honest. Is something wrong? You're making a face. What is it? Is it bad? Tell me straight, doc. I don't like being left in the dark. Is it the lamb? Is it something serious? My wife always said I should've gone to the doctor more often…
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s too early to say definitively, Mr. Gentz. The tenderness is concerning, and the vomiting blood is, of course, the primary issue we need to address. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, I'm going to order some blood work to check your liver function, kidney function, and complete blood count. I also want to rule out any potential infection. I’m also going to order a stool test to check for any blood or parasites. It's possible this could be a gastrointestinal issue, but we need more information to determine the cause. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work? Stool test? Are you serious? This is getting ridiculous. I came in here with a bit of a stomach ache and now I gotta give you blood and… well, you know. Look, I’m not a fan of doctors, alright? I don’t like needles, I don’t like giving samples, and I especially don’t like being poked and prodded. Can’t you just give me something for the nausea? Something to stop the throwing up? Is it definitely something serious? Because if it is, I don't want a whole battery of tests. I don’t have insurance, doc. This is gonna cost me a fortune. What are we even looking for? Just tell me straight. Is it cancer? Is it something I need to worry about? Don't sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your concerns about the cost and the tests. However, I cannot provide a diagnosis without further investigation. Vomiting blood is always a serious symptom, and it could be caused by a number of things, ranging from a simple ulcer to something more concerning. The blood work and stool test will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of treatment. As for whether it’s cancer, it's impossible to say at this point. We need the test results to rule that out, or confirm it. I'm aware you don’t have insurance, and we can discuss payment options with the billing department. But delaying treatment or refusing tests will only make the situation worse. I need to rule out the serious possibilities before I can tell you what’s going on and how to fix it. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, alright. Do the tests. Just… get it over with. But I swear, doc, if it turns out to be something simple, like a bad lamb chop, I’m sending you the bill for my therapy. This whole thing has been a nightmare. Where do I go to get this… blood drawn? And where do I… collect the sample? This is humiliating. I can’t believe my life has come to this. Just… tell me where to go. And hurry it up, would ya? The sooner this is over, the sooner I can go home and try to forget this ever happened. Do I need to fast or anything? Because I haven't eaten anything since… well, since the bad lamb.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab is just down the hall, third door on the left. You’ll need to tell them Dr. Todorovich sent you. As for fasting, yes, you’ll need to fast for eight hours before the blood draw. Since you haven’t eaten anything since the lamb, that should cover it. The nurse at the front desk can provide you with a collection cup and instructions for the stool sample. She'll also answer any questions you have. I understand this is unpleasant, Mr. Gentz, and I apologize for the inconvenience. But getting these tests done is the best way to get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No other questions. Just… get it over with. Eight hours, huh? That’s… great. Just what I needed. Another thing to worry about. Look, doc… you really think it’s something bad? Be honest. You can tell me straight. I can handle it. Or… maybe I can’t. But I need to know. Before I go and… and spend the next eight hours worrying myself sick. Just… give it to me straight. Is it serious? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your anxiety. It’s impossible to say definitively without the test results. Vomiting blood can be caused by serious conditions, but it can also be caused by less serious ones. It's too early to jump to conclusions. What I can tell you is that we are taking this seriously, and we’re doing everything we can to find out what’s going on. I’m not going to sugarcoat it: it’s something we need to investigate thoroughly. But worrying yourself sick won’t help. Let’s get the tests done, and then we can discuss the results and create a plan. Focus on that. And please, if you experience any further vomiting or feel weak or dizzy, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. .
