DOCTOR: Right. Avril Benites, 57 years old. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor… Todoro-vich, is it? Yes, that is correct, my name is Avril. I am here for… the talk on the telephone, yes? The one the nice lady scheduled for me. My back… it is not so good lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. The back pain. Okay. And when did this back pain start?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I think… maybe two, three months ago? It started slow, you know? Just a little ache after I work. I am a mechanic, so I… I lift many things. It gets worse when I bend. Not all the time, but… often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been gradual onset, two to three months, and it’s related to your work as a mechanic, specifically lifting and bending. Is it constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Most days, I can work through it. But some days… some days it is very bad. When I try to sleep, that is when it is worst. I toss and turn. And sometimes… sometimes it goes down my leg a little. Not always, but when it does… it is not nice. It feels… like pins and needles.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, the pain radiates down your leg sometimes, with a pins and needles sensation. Do you feel that in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. Always the left. And it is not… all the way down to my foot, usually. It stops around my knee. Sometimes my hip hurts too, on the same side. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Left leg radiating to the knee, and hip pain on the same side. Okay. And when you say "not nice," can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to say… it is not a sharp pain. More like… a heavy ache. And sometimes… it feels like something is stuck. Like a muscle is pulled too tight. And when I sit for too long, it gets worse. Standing is better, usually. But after a long day at work… everything hurts.
DOCTOR: So, a heavy ache, sometimes a feeling of tightness, worse with sitting, better with standing, but overall worse at the end of the day. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain, besides standing?
PATIENT: Well… when I take a warm bath, that helps a little. And if I lie down with a warm pack on my back… that is good. But it does not last long. And… if I take some of the pills my friend gave me, they help too. But I do not like taking pills, you know? I do not know what they are, and I do not want to become… dependent.
DOCTOR: Okay, warm bath and warm packs provide some temporary relief. And you've been taking pills from a friend. Can you tell me anything about those pills?
PATIENT: I… I do not know the name, Doctor. My friend, she has the same problem with her back. She said they are for pain. They are small, white pills. I only take them when it is very bad, maybe two or three times a week. I do not like it, but… it is hard to work when I hurt so much. They make me… sleepy, sometimes. And a little… dizzy.
DOCTOR: Taking medication you haven’t been prescribed is… not ideal, Avril. We need to know what you're taking. Do you still have any of the pills?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Here. I do not take many, I promise. Just when I cannot stand it anymore. I know it is not good, but… I did not know what else to do. My friend said they help her, and she is a nurse. But… I understand you need to know.
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll send these to the lab to identify them. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but the doctor gave me some pills, and it is better now. I do not remember the name of the pills. And… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. That is all, I think. I have been generally healthy, until my back started hurting. I do not smoke, and I only drink a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of mild hypertension, managed with medication, and a cholecystectomy in the past. No other significant medical history. What about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had arthritis in her hands, very bad. She could barely use them in the end. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. He passed away when I was young. And my brother, he has trouble with his back too, now that he is older. He has seen many doctors, but it does not seem to help much. That is… all I know, really. My family is not very good at talking about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis, cardiac issues, and back problems. Alright. And lastly, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I have never had a bad reaction to any pills before. But… I do not take many, so I do not have much experience. I get a little itchy sometimes, but I do not know if that is an allergy. And… I am allergic to cats, but that is not a pill!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just need to check your range of motion and reflexes. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. This way? I hope you do not mind, my knees are not what they used to be. I will try to be careful.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. Take your time. I’ll need you to lie flat on your back. First, I'm going to palpate your spine to feel for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful.
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead, Doctor. I will tell you if it hurts. Just… be gentle, please. My back is very sensitive today.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, right there. That is… tender. Not a sharp pain, but… a deep ache. Like a bruise. And… a little sore. It feels… tight there too. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Tenderness and muscle spasm noted at L4-L5 on the left side. Alright. Now, can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I cannot go very far, Doctor. It hurts too much. I can reach my knees, but that is all. And… it feels like something is pulling in my lower back when I bend. I am not as flexible as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. Limited range of motion and pain with forward flexion. Now, can you try to bend backwards a little?
PATIENT: I… I can do this a little better. But it still hurts. A dull ache, more in my hips. And… a little uncomfortable. Not as bad as bending forward, but… not good. Is this… normal, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Pain with extension as well. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This will just involve tapping on your knees and ankles with a small hammer. Just relax your legs. I'll start with your right knee.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Go ahead. I do not like hammers very much… but I will try to be still. Just… be gentle, please. My nerves are a little sensitive today.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now your left knee. Diminished reflexes bilaterally, more pronounced on the left. Now, let’s check your ankle reflexes. Just relax your feet.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go ahead. My feet are a little numb sometimes, so… I do not know if you will get much of a response. I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now your left Achilles tendon. Absent reflex on the left Achilles. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Based on the physical exam, you have tenderness and muscle spasm in your lower back, limited range of motion, and diminished reflexes bilaterally, with a concerning absence of reflex on your left side.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… bad, Doctor. What does that mean? Is it serious? What is wrong with my back? Will I need surgery? I do not want surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, Avril. It's too early to say definitively what's wrong, but your symptoms and exam findings are concerning for nerve compression, possibly due to a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. The diminished reflexes, especially the absent reflex on the left, suggest that a nerve is being significantly affected. The good news is that most cases of nerve compression do not require surgery. However, we need to get some imaging – an MRI of your lumbar spine – to get a clear picture of what’s going on. This will help us determine the exact cause of your symptoms and the best course of treatment. Before we order the MRI, I’d like to get a complete blood count and a vitamin D level just to rule out any other contributing factors. And it's important to know exactly what medication you were taking from your friend, so we can assess any potential interactions or side effects. Can you bring the packaging or bottle with you when you come back?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… expensive. And nerve compression… is that painful? Will I be able to work? I am a mechanic, you see. I need to work. I will try to find the pills, Doctor. My friend gave me quite a few. I do not know if I still have the packaging. But I will look. What about the blood tests? How long will that take?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Avril. The cost of the MRI can be significant, but our billing department can work with your Medicare insurance to determine your out-of-pocket expenses. We’ll do everything we can to make it affordable. Nerve compression can be painful, yes, but the level of pain varies greatly. Many people experience relief with conservative treatment – physical therapy, pain medication, and injections. We’ll work together to manage your pain and get you back to functioning as well as possible. As for your work, it's difficult to say definitively at this point. It will depend on the severity of the nerve compression and how you respond to treatment. We may need to temporarily modify your work duties to avoid activities that exacerbate your symptoms. The blood tests will only take a few minutes to draw, and the results should be back within 24-48 hours. Once we have those results, we can schedule the MRI and discuss a comprehensive treatment plan. For now, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or bending, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage your pain. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all for now, Doctor. But… how long will I have to wait for the MRI? And what if it is… bad? What if I need surgery? I am afraid of surgery. And… will I still be able to drive? I need to drive to work. I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s address those concerns one by one. The wait time for the MRI can vary depending on the scheduling availability at the imaging center, but our office will do everything we can to get you scheduled as quickly as possible – typically within a week. As for what if it is bad… it's important to remember that most cases of nerve compression do not require surgery. If surgery is necessary, it’s usually a last resort, and it’s often very successful in relieving pain and restoring function. We would discuss all of your options thoroughly before making any decisions. As for driving, that depends on the severity of your symptoms and any medications you are taking. If you are experiencing significant pain or dizziness, or if you are taking medications that impair your ability to drive safely, you should avoid driving until you are cleared by a doctor. We’ll assess your condition carefully before giving you the green light. For now, let's focus on getting the MRI scheduled and getting those blood tests done. Once we have those results, we’ll have a better understanding of what’s going on and can develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your needs. I’ll have the nurse give you a lab requisition form and instructions for scheduling the MRI. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. The nurse will give me the forms. And… will I be able to get a copy of the MRI results? I like to… know what is going on with my body. And… if I need to see a specialist, will my Medicare cover that? I do not want to have to pay a lot of money.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You are entitled to a copy of your MRI results, and we’ll make sure you receive them promptly. We’ll also go over the results with you in detail, explaining everything in plain language. As for seeing a specialist, if we determine that you would benefit from a consultation with a neurosurgeon or orthopedic spine specialist, your Medicare insurance will likely cover it, as long as you meet the necessary criteria. Our office will assist you with obtaining any necessary referrals and authorizations. We’ll do everything we can to ensure that you receive the best possible care without incurring excessive financial burdens. Alright. I'll have the nurse come in and provide you with the necessary forms and instructions. Is there anything else I can address before she comes in?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything. You have been very helpful. I was very worried, but I feel a little better now. I hope the MRI does not show anything too bad.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Avril. I understand your anxiety, and I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll work together to develop a treatment plan that's right for you. Try to stay positive, and remember that most cases of back pain resolve with conservative treatment. The nurse will be in shortly to provide you with the necessary forms and instructions. Please don't hesitate to contact our office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, Avril. .
PATIENT: .
