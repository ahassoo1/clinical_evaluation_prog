DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder, yes… 76. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it's… it's my stomach, I suppose. I just haven't been feeling right. Everything seems to make me feel full so fast, even if it's just a little bit of food. And then... well, then I feel sick to my stomach. It's been going on for a little while now, I think. It’s hard to say exactly how long, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right, “not feeling right” and early satiety… and nausea. A little vague, but we’ll get there. “A little while now”… can you give me a ballpark?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A ballpark… hmm. Let me think. It started… after Harold passed, maybe? No, no, that wasn’t it. Before that, I think. It feels like… several months, at least. Maybe six? It’s just been slowly getting worse, not all at once. I wish I could be more precise. Everything is a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Six months. Okay. And has anything changed in those six months?
PATIENT: Changed… well, my appetite certainly has. I used to love a good meal, and now… now I just don’t feel hungry much. And I've lost a little weight, I reckon. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t actually stepped on the scale. I mostly just eat what I can keep down, which isn't very much. Oh, and I get tired easier, too. But I figured that was just getting older.
DOCTOR: Right. Reduced appetite, weight loss, fatigue… Anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Sometimes I feel a bit… bloated, especially after I do manage to eat something. And it’s not like a painful bloating, just… uncomfortable. It feels like there’s a lot of air in there. And, now that I think about it, I've been a bit more… constipated than usual, too. It’s all just a mess, really. I apologize for not being very helpful. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Bloating, constipation… look, these are all… nonspecific symptoms. Alright. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh yes, the nausea. That’s the worst part, really. It’s not every day, but it happens a few times a week, usually after I eat. And… well, sometimes I do throw up. Not a lot, just a little bit. Mostly it's just… bile, I think. Yellow stuff. It doesn’t hurt or anything, it just… comes up. It's awful. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be graphic.
DOCTOR: Right, nausea and occasional non-bilious emesis. Okay. Now, any heartburn, indigestion, or trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Heartburn… hmm. Not really. Maybe a little bit sometimes, a sort of… warmth in my chest, but nothing bad enough to take anything for. Indigestion… I do feel a bit full a lot, if that counts. And trouble swallowing… no, no, everything goes down alright. It's just staying down that's the problem. Everything feels… heavy, though, like a weight in my stomach. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Alright, look… This could be a number of things. We'll need to rule some things out. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes in my… you mean… going to the bathroom? Yes. As I mentioned, I’ve been a bit constipated. It’s not like it always happens, but it’s more frequent than it used to be. And when I do go, it’s… not as much as before. It’s… thinner, sometimes. But not diarrhea, exactly. Just… not solid. I don’t know if that makes sense. It's a bit embarrassing to talk about. I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Right. So, constipation alternating with loose stools… Look, Ms. Kelder, this is likely some sort of functional gastrointestinal issue, possibly related to diet or stress. But to be safe, we should do some basic tests. We'll start with a CBC and a metabolic panel. And I’ll order a stool sample to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… sensible. Tests are good. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. A stool sample… …Well, alright then. What do I need to do? And…will these tests tell us what's wrong? I just want to feel like myself again. I miss being able to enjoy a good meal.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This requisition is for the bloodwork, and this pamphlet has detailed instructions for the stool sample collection. You'll need to bring the sample to the lab within 24 hours of collection. As for whether it will tell us what's wrong… it will rule things out. We need to eliminate possibilities. Look, it's probably just something minor, but we have to be thorough. And if it is something more serious, we’ll know sooner rather than later. Now, any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you. I’ll try to get the stool sample done right away. I just… I worry, you know? Harold… he wasn’t well for very long, and… . As for allergies… no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. But my doctor back home… Dr. Peterson… she always asked about penicillin. Is that important? I can't remember why. It’s so hard to keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Penicillin… right, yes, it’s good to be aware. No known allergies for now. Look, Ms. Kelder, I'm going to order these tests, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. I understand you're worried, but let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll take it one step at a time. The lab is just down the hall. Can you manage that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I can manage. Just down the hall, you said? That's good. I'm not very good with directions, but if it's close, that's alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me and my… rambling. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I just hope… I just hope it's nothing too serious. I think I’ll go do that stool sample now. I'd like to get it over with. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Take your time. Let's just get these tests done and see what we're dealing with. Another vague complaint. Honestly.
