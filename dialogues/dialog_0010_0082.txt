DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. I'm Dr. Annesley. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… travel, I think. My wife… she wanted to go somewhere. Somewhere warm. I don’t… remember exactly where now. It was… before. Before everything. I just need… what I need for travel, yeah? So I don't get sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Travel-related concerns, wanting to stay healthy while you're away. Before we get into specifics, could you tell me a little more about this trip?
PATIENT: Specifics? Like… what kind of shoes to pack? I don’t… I really didn't plan this. She did. All of it. It’s… not important, really. Just… somewhere warm. With beaches, I think. She liked beaches. It was… a long time ago now. I just… need the shots, yeah? To not get sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed, and that's perfectly alright. We can definitely figure out what you might need for travel health. I see here you're 22 years old, and your height and weight are listed as 155 centimeters and 104 pounds. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… not that I know of. I don’t… take much. Never really needed to. She always took care of… everything. Medicine, doctors… I just… went along. I don’t remember being allergic to anything. Does… dust count? I sneeze sometimes. But everyone does, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies. Dust allergies aren’t usually a concern for travel vaccinations. And are you currently taking any medications at all – even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Not since… well. Not since she… passed. She had some stuff. For her blood pressure, I think. But I don’t… I don’t take anything. I don’t need anything. Just… what I need for the trip. Please. I just want to… get this done.
DOCTOR: I understand. You're feeling anxious to get this taken care of, and I want to assure you we will. Before we discuss vaccinations, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Like… if I broke a bone? I… I don't think so. Nothing serious, anyway. I was… mostly healthy. She always said I was too skinny. Needed to eat more. She made me soup a lot. I… I don't go to the doctor. Never have. Not unless she made me. I don't… know anything about medical history. What does that even mean?
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright, we’ll take it slowly. By medical history, I mean have you had any serious illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No… no surgeries. No… hospitals. I had a fever once, when I was a kid. A really bad one. But she took care of it. She gave me… something. Syrup, I think. And… I think I had the chickenpox, when I was little. But that was… a long time ago. That's all I remember. Really. She… handled everything. I just… got better.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major illnesses or hospitalizations that you recall. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family…? She was my family. I… didn't have… much else. Parents passed a long time ago. I don’t remember them very well. Didn’t see them often. She… she had brothers, sisters. But I didn't… I didn't really know them. We didn't… visit much. She did all the family stuff. So… no, I don’t know anything about family… medical stuff. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright, it's perfectly okay. We can proceed without that information for now. Now, let’s talk about the trip itself. Do you happen to know what countries you'll be visiting?
PATIENT: Countries…? I… honestly, no. She booked everything online. I just… packed. And went. I think… it was somewhere in… Asia. Maybe? With temples. And… lots of people. She liked busy places. I don’t… I really don't know the name of the country. Or countries. She just handed me the tickets. I just want to go, and… not get sick. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. It sounds like you’re relying on information she provided, and that’s understandable. Knowing the destination is important for recommending the appropriate vaccinations and preventative medications. Do you have any travel documents with you – a plane ticket, itinerary, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Uh… maybe. Let me see… Here. She… always kept everything. It's all in there, I think. I don't… I don't read well. She did all the reading. I just… signed where she told me to. I hope that's enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's see… it looks like you're traveling to Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. You've been there for about two weeks already. That’s helpful. Now, have you experienced any symptoms of illness since you started your trip – fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, cough?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? No. Not really. I… I’ve been tired. But I’m always tired. She said I needed to eat more iron. And… a little bit of stomach trouble. But that happens. The food is… different. Spicy. I… I don't think it's anything serious. Just… adjusting. No fever. No… rash. Just tired. And… a bit of a funny stomach. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Okay. Tiredness and some minor stomach upset. Have you had any insect bites while traveling?
PATIENT: Insect bites…? Oh, yeah. Lots of them. They're everywhere! Mosquitoes mostly. Tiny little ones. They itch. I… I put some cream on them. She bought me cream before we left. It… helps a little. I try not to scratch. They're… just part of being there, I think. Everywhere you go, they're there. Buzzing around. Little red bumps. Is that… bad? I didn't think it was bad. Everyone gets bitten, right?
DOCTOR: Okay. Mosquito bites. Given your itinerary, and the mosquito bites, it’s important to consider the risk of diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus. Do you know if you were taking any preventative medications for malaria before or during your trip?
PATIENT: Malaria…? She… gave me pills. Every day. Little white pills. I took them with my breakfast. She… made sure I took them. She was very careful. She… always read the instructions. I didn't… I didn't know what they were for, exactly. Just… pills. To keep me safe. I… stopped taking them a few days ago. Is that… wrong? I thought the trip was safe enough now.
DOCTOR: Okay. You were taking malaria preventative medication, but stopped a few days ago. That is something we should discuss. Stopping the medication prematurely can leave you vulnerable. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, frequency, or any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: Urine…? No. Not that I’ve noticed. It… looks the same. Normal, I think. I don’t… really pay attention to that. I just… go when I need to go. No pain. No… different color. Just normal. I haven’t… I haven’t been paying attention to much, to be honest. I’m just tired. And… missing her. Does that… count as a symptom? I just want to get home. Safely.
DOCTOR: Okay. No changes in your urine. I understand you're tired and missing your wife, and that makes everything harder. We're going to make sure you get home safely. Given your travel history, the mosquito bites, and the fact that you stopped your malaria medication a few days ago, I'd like to run some blood tests to check for any potential infections. Also, it's important we review your current symptoms and plan for your return home. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests…? Oh. That… sounds scary. But… if it will make me safe. Then, yes. Okay. If you think it’s necessary. But… will it hurt? I don’t… I don’t like needles. She always… held my hand. But she’s not here. So… if it will help me get home, then… yes. Please. Just… be quick. And… tell me what’s going to happen. I don’t… I don’t do well with surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course. We will take it slow, and I will explain everything as we go. The blood test is fairly quick. A nurse will just take a small sample of blood from your arm. There will be a brief pinch, but it shouldn't hurt for long. We'll send the sample to the lab, and the results will usually be available within a few days. While we wait for the results, it’s important we focus on managing your current symptoms. Are you experiencing any fever, chills, or muscle aches?
PATIENT: No. No fever. Not… right now. I feel… warm sometimes, but that's the weather, I think. No chills. And my muscles… a little sore, maybe? But I’ve been walking a lot. Sightseeing, you know. She liked to see everything. So… no, not really muscle aches. Just… tired. And a bit of a funny stomach. Still. But… it’s getting better, I think. Slowly. I just want to be sure. That's all. Sure that I'm not… sick. That I can get home.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, chills or significant muscle aches. Mild stomach upset that’s improving. Before we proceed, is there anything else you feel I should know?
PATIENT: Uh… no. I don't think so. Everything… everything I’ve already said, I think. She… she always told me what was important. What to tell the doctor. But she’s not here. So… I’m just trying to remember. Just… tired. And missing her. And… wanting to get home. Safely. Is that enough? I… I don't think I can remember anything else right now. My head… feels a bit fuzzy. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. You’ve told me everything I need to know for now. We'll proceed with the blood tests, and I’ll arrange for a nurse to come in and take a sample. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for something to help with your stomach upset, and some over-the-counter pain relievers, just in case. And please, don't hesitate to let me know if anything changes, or if you start to feel worse. We’re here to help. .
PATIENT: .
