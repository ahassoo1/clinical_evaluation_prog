DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been having some… discomfort with my bladder, a feeling of pressure, really. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Discomfort and pressure with your bladder. That's certainly something we should investigate. Could you tell me a little more about this discomfort?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it’s not exactly painful, more like a constant fullness, even after I’ve just gone to the bathroom. It feels like there's still a lot in there, you know? And sometimes, I get this urge to go immediately, even if I don’t really need to. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest. It doesn’t happen all the time, but frequently enough that it’s become a worry.
DOCTOR: I see. A constant feeling of fullness even after voiding, and a frequent, urgent need to urinate… That does sound concerning, and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention. To help me get a better understanding, could you tell me about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, about two months now, maybe a little longer. At first, I thought it was just something I ate, or maybe I was drinking too much water. But it hasn’t gone away, and if anything, it feels like it’s… subtly worsening. I remember noticing it specifically after a trip to visit my mother, but I’m not sure if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately two months, starting around the beginning of June. And you've noticed it potentially worsening, even with no clear trigger, though you mention it may have started after a trip. Now, besides the fullness and urgency, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I haven’t had any pain, like a burning sensation, when I urinate. No fever or chills. I have noticed that I seem to be going to the bathroom more often during the night, which is a little disruptive. Maybe once or twice a night, which isn’t terrible, but it's new. And… I think my stomach feels a little bloated sometimes, but that could just be… well, I do enjoy my food. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain with urination, no fever or chills, increased nighttime urination – nocturia – once or twice per night, and some occasional bloating. We’ll keep all of that in mind. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, if that's alright. Have you had any previous medical problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Let me think… I had a pretty standard childhood illness, chickenpox and things like that, but nothing major. When I was about twenty, I had my appendix removed, but that was years ago and I recovered fully. Other than that, I haven’t really been sick. I do have slightly high blood pressure, which I manage with medication. My doctor prescribed it about five years ago. And… oh, I had a C-section with my son, about eight years ago. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is all relevant, thank you for sharing. So, childhood illnesses, appendectomy years ago, current high blood pressure managed with medication, and a C-section eight years ago. Could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's Lisinopril. I take 20 milligrams every morning. I’ve been on the same dosage for the past five years, and my blood pressure readings have been stable, according to my regular check-ups. I haven't had any side effects that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20 milligrams daily, stable readings, no reported side effects. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I don’t have any food allergies. My husband sometimes teases me that I’ll eat anything! I haven't had any issues with pollen or animals either, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No known allergies. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Does anyone in your family have a history of bladder problems, kidney disease, or any other urinary issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My mother had diabetes, and my father had heart disease, but neither of them ever mentioned anything about bladder problems or kidney issues. My grandmother on my mother’s side had arthritis, and my father’s brother had prostate problems later in life, but that's the closest thing I can think of. It's not something that's ever been discussed in our family, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no family history of bladder or kidney issues, diabetes in your mother, heart disease in your father, arthritis in your grandmother, and prostate problems in your father’s brother. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week, but I don't drink regularly. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. I prefer a good book and a cup of tea, if that makes sense! I try to live a fairly healthy lifestyle.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear. So, no smoking, occasional wine, no recreational drug use, and generally a healthy lifestyle. Now, finally, let’s talk a little about your social history. What is your occupation, and could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. I am a graphic designer. I work from home, mostly, which is very convenient. A typical day involves a lot of sitting at my computer – designing logos, brochures, websites, that sort of thing. I try to take breaks to stretch and walk around, but it's still mostly sedentary. I usually eat lunch at my desk, and my husband handles most of the cooking in the evenings. I also try to get some exercise a few times a week, usually a walk or a yoga class. It's a fairly routine life, but I enjoy it. I’m married, and my son is in high school now.
DOCTOR: Okay, graphic designer working from home, mostly sedentary lifestyle, married with a son in high school. Alright, Ms. Creagh, thank you for that thorough history. Based on what you’ve told me – the constant fullness, urgency, nocturia, and the lack of pain – it's important to rule out a few possibilities. We need to consider a urinary tract infection, although the lack of pain makes that less likely. We also need to consider overactive bladder, and less common possibilities like interstitial cystitis. I’d like to perform a physical exam, including an abdominal exam and a pelvic exam, if you’re comfortable with that. After the exam, I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection and other abnormalities. Depending on the results, we may need to consider further testing, such as a post-void residual measurement to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Dr. Giganti. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. A physical exam and the urinalysis seem reasonable. I am comfortable with the exam. I would like to know the results as soon as possible, if that’s alright? I’ve been a little anxious about this, and I'd like to get to the bottom of it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Creagh. I understand your anxiety, and we’ll do our best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. Usually, the urinalysis results are available within a few hours, and I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. Alright, let's start with the abdominal exam. I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. I’ll start here… Do you feel any pain or tenderness in this area?
PATIENT: No, that's alright so far, Dr. Giganti. A little pressure, perhaps, but no pain. It feels… normal, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Just continuing… Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, still nothing. A little bit of pressure, but not painful. It feels… normal. I suppose it’s been a while since anyone has poked around in there, so it’s a little unusual, but not uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No tenderness or masses detected. Now, I will need to perform a pelvic exam to assess your bladder and other pelvic organs. I’ll explain each step as I go, and please feel free to let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. We'll use a speculum to gently visualize the vaginal canal and cervix, and I’ll also perform a bimanual exam to assess the uterus and ovaries. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright, Dr. Giganti. Please explain everything as you go, and I will let you know if I feel any discomfort. I am a little nervous, but I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Creagh. I’m going to start by having you lie on the examination table with your feet in the stirrups. I'll gently insert a speculum into your vagina to visualize your cervix. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. I will let you know when I'm inserting the speculum. Take a deep breath and relax your muscles as much as possible. Do you feel any discomfort at this point?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit of pressure, Dr. Giganti. It’s… not painful, just a little uncomfortable. Like something is… taking up space. It’s not too bad, but I can definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Just a little pressure. I'm just gently widening the speculum to get a better look at your cervix. Everything looks normal visually. Your cervix is pink and healthy, and there’s no evidence of infection or inflammation. Now, I’m going to perform a bimanual exam. I’ll gently insert two gloved fingers into your vagina while placing my other hand on your abdomen. This allows me to assess the size and position of your uterus and ovaries. You may feel some pressure during this part of the exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright, Dr. Giganti. Just let me know what you are doing. Pressure is fine, as long as it's not painful.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m gently pressing on your abdomen and feeling for any abnormalities in your uterus and ovaries… Your uterus feels normal in size and position. Your ovaries also feel normal, no tenderness or masses detected. Everything feels within normal limits. Okay, Ms. Creagh, the physical exam is complete. Everything feels normal to palpation. Now, I’ll have my nurse draw a sample of your urine for analysis. This will help us determine if you have a urinary tract infection. I will need you to collect a midstream clean catch sample. Do you know how to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, I do, Dr. Giganti. I’ve done it before. I remember to clean with the wipes first, and then start and stop to get the midstream sample, right?
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Ms. Creagh. You remember exactly right. My nurse will give you the appropriate supplies and instructions. Once the results are back – usually within a few hours – we’ll discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Dr. Giganti. I appreciate your patience and your explanations. I’ll wait for the nurse and the results. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Creagh. I'm glad I could help. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better soon. My nurse will be with you shortly. Please let me know if you need anything at all.
