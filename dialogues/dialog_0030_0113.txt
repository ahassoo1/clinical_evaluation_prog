DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Quicksey, you say? Hmm. Well, it's this… this business with the waterworks, really. I seem to be going to the bathroom… a lot. More than a fella should, if you ask me. It's a nuisance, mostly. Wakes me up at night, too. Old man problems, I suppose. Though my wife says I shouldn't complain… she's always saying something.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're experiencing increased urinary frequency – needing to urinate more often than usual, and that’s disrupting your sleep as well. That is disruptive, and it's certainly worth looking into, regardless of whether it's an "old man problem" or not. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? Well… it just happens. I drink a normal amount, I think. Maybe a bit more coffee than I should, truth be told. Always did like a good strong cup. But it’s not like I’m guzzling water all day. It’s just… frequent. And sometimes… sometimes I have to really try to get it all out. Does that make any sense? It's hard to explain. It’s not painful, exactly… just… effortful. And, like I said, it's been waking up my poor wife. She needs her sleep, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Segretto. So, increased frequency, a sense of effort when urinating, and it’s impacting your sleep and your wife’s. You mentioned coffee – how many cups would you say you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, coffee… let me think. It varies. Depends on the day. If I'm working out in the garden, maybe three or four. If it's raining and I'm inside, perhaps just one or two. It’s a good, strong brew, mind you. Not that weak stuff. My wife tries to get me to switch to tea… says it’s better for the bladder. But tea is just… water with leaves, isn't it? Doesn’t have the same kick. I don't keep precise track, Doctor. Old habits, you know? I've been drinking coffee since I was a young man.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you have a fairly consistent coffee intake, perhaps around three or four cups on busier days. That's helpful to know. Now, aside from the frequency and effort, have you noticed any other changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Changes…? Now there's a question. Let me think… Is color a change? It seems… normal colored, I suppose. Yellow. Sometimes a bit darker if I haven't had enough to drink. And… no, I don't think so. No blood, no burning, nothing like that. Just… more of it, more often. It's not like it’s a raging stream, you understand. Just… a steady drip, really. A nuisance, that’s what it is. My wife says I worry too much. She’s a practical woman, that one. Always has been.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in color, no blood, no burning sensation. Just increased volume and frequency, without a strong stream. That's good information, Mr. Segretto. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… That’s a long story. Let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure years ago, the doctor put me on some pills for a while. Stopped taking them after a bit, though. Didn't like the way they made me feel. As for diabetes… I don't think so. The doctor checked me for it once, a long time ago. Said I was fine. Prostate… hmm. Now that I vaguely remember something about. The doctor… back in the old country, he did something… a check, maybe? I don't recall the specifics. It was a long time ago, Doctor. A very long time ago. Things weren’t as fancy then, you know. And my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. It sounds like you had a history of blood pressure that was managed with medication, and a prostate check-up in the past, though you don't recall many details. That's alright, we can try to gather more information if needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I've always been a pretty hardy sort. I eat most things, and I don’t get stung by bees any more than the next fella. My wife says I’m stubborn, not allergic. She once tried to get me to stop eating pickles… said they were bad for my stomach. I ate a whole jar anyway. Didn't bother me a bit. Maybe a little heartburn, but that’s just a bit of spice, you know? I don’t fuss much over allergies. Always thought it was a bit of a modern invention, to be honest. People used to just… get on with things.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I take a little something for my joints, when they're acting up. Can't remember the name of it… it comes in a little bottle. My wife orders it for me, from the internet, I think. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take one of those… those sleep aids. The ones you can get at the drugstore. Just a little one. Doesn’t always work, mind you. Mostly just makes me feel a bit groggy in the morning. Apart from that… no, I don't take much. I prefer to let nature take its course, you know? Pills are for folks who are weak. And I’m not weak. Not yet, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, a joint supplement and occasional sleep aid. We’ll try to get the names of those later, if possible. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam…? Well, I suppose so. I haven't had one in a while. What does it involve? I'm not afraid of needles, mind you. Had plenty of those in my life. But I don't like being poked and prodded unnecessarily. I'm an old man, Doctor, not a guinea pig. Just try to be gentle, alright? And tell me what you're doing before you do it. I like to know what's going on. I don't like surprises. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Segretto. That's a perfectly reasonable request. I’ll explain everything as I go, and we'll take it slow. We'll start with your vital signs – checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also palpate your abdomen, and finally, I'll do a quick neurological exam. And yes, I'll need to examine your prostate, which involves a digital rectal exam. I understand that can be uncomfortable, and I’ll explain that thoroughly before we proceed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Digital… digital what now? You mean… there? Oh, goodness. I don't know about that, Doctor. I really don't. I'm an old man. My… my parts aren't what they used to be. And I'm not keen on having them… examined. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't you tell something just by… looking at me? I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I think I'd know if something was seriously wrong. Honestly, I'm not sure I want to go through all of that. Perhaps we can skip that part? I’m feeling a bit faint just thinking about it. And my wife would be furious if I came home upset.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto. It's a sensitive exam, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel apprehensive. The digital rectal exam is the most reliable way to assess the size, shape, and texture of the prostate gland. It helps us rule out any abnormalities, like enlargement or tenderness, which can indicate conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia or, less commonly, prostate cancer. However, I respect your wishes. We can proceed without it for now, but I want to be upfront about the fact that it will limit my ability to fully assess the cause of your urinary symptoms. We can still gather a lot of information through other means, like a urine sample and potentially some blood tests. Would you prefer to proceed without the exam today, and then we can discuss the pros and cons of it again later?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds much better. Let's skip the… the poking. I'm sure it's a very important test, Doctor, but I'd rather not. A urine sample and blood tests sound perfectly reasonable. Less invasive, you know? And perhaps we can see if the symptoms improve on their own. My wife says I just need to drink less coffee. She’s probably right, to be honest. Always is. So, let's start with the sample and the blood work. And then… then we can see what happens. I appreciate you understanding, Doctor. You're a good listener. Not like some of those other doctors I've seen. They just rush you through, without even bothering to ask how you feel.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. It’s my priority to make you feel comfortable and to work with you, not against you. Alright, let's start with the urine sample. I'll give you a cup and instructions, and then we can move on to drawing some blood. It will involve a standard blood draw from your arm. We’ll be checking your kidney function, prostate-specific antigen levels, and a complete blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine. As long as it doesn't involve… that part. Just the arm, alright? And don't take too much blood, please. I get lightheaded easily. And tell me what you're looking for, Doctor. I like to know what's going on. Don't want any surprises, remember? And if I start feeling faint, just let me know. I'm a sturdy old man, but even sturdy men have their limits. Now, where’s this cup? And how much… do I need to provide? I had a bit of coffee this morning, so… it should be enough, shouldn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, just the arm, I promise. And I will absolutely explain everything as we go. We're looking for signs of infection, blood in the urine, and to get a baseline reading of your kidney function. The PSA test will give us an idea of your prostate health, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. You'll need to provide about two to three ounces – about half a cup should be sufficient. Try to collect a midstream sample – that means start urinating for a few seconds, then collect the sample in the cup, and finish urinating afterward. This helps to get a cleaner sample. I’ll give you a little privacy to collect the sample, and I’ll be right outside if you need anything. Here's the cup, and there’s a lid to close it. Take your time, and let me know when you're finished. There’s a restroom just down the hall.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Half a cup. Midstream. No surprises. I can manage that, I think. Just… give me a moment, alright? Old men need a bit of time to… adjust. And don’t rush me. Honestly, this is all a bit much. But I appreciate you explaining it, Doctor. You’re a good egg. A very good egg. Now, where’s that restroom…? And try not to listen too closely, alright? It’s not a pleasant sound.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Segretto. No rush at all. And you have my complete discretion. .
