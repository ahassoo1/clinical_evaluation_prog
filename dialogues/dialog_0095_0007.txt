DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Reihner. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is… painful. My back. I wish to be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you want to be quick, and we’ll do our best. Back pain… can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It started… three weeks ago, I believe. August 8th, perhaps? Working with the fence posts. Lifting them. Heavy ones. It’s… low, in my back. Not high up. Constant ache, mostly. Sometimes sharp, if I move wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three weeks ago, lifting fence posts…low back pain. Constant ache with occasional sharp pains when you move. And you said it's in your lower back specifically?
PATIENT: Yes. Lower back. Right side, mostly. Though sometimes… it feels it goes around. Not all the way around, but… both sides. It makes it hard to bend over, you understand? And sleep is… difficult.
DOCTOR: Right side mostly, but sometimes radiates around. Makes bending difficult and affects sleep. Alright. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Yes. Sitting. Surprisingly. When I am sitting, it eases. And… heat. A warm bath helps, for a short time. Not a long time, but… some relief.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting and heat provide some relief. Have you tried any pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen?
PATIENT: I… I do not take medicines, if I can avoid it. My husband… he always handled that. I have some aspirin, but it does not… seem to touch it much. Just a little. Medicare does cover some things, does it not?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare does cover many things. We can certainly look at options for you. And I understand wanting to avoid medication if possible. Before we discuss those, let's get a little more information. Have you had any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No. No tingling. No numbness. Just… the pain. It’s in my back. Mostly. Sometimes… a little in my hip. But no… nothing going down my legs. I make sure to walk, even when it hurts. My mother always said… keep moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or tingling in the legs. Pain mainly in the lower back, sometimes radiating to the hip. Good that you’re keeping active. Has this ever happened before?
PATIENT: No. Never like this. I have had aches after a long day of work, of course. But this… this is different. Constant. And sharp. It does not go away. I worry… is it my age?
DOCTOR: Okay, this is a new type of pain, not just the usual aches. We can certainly investigate that. And it's good you’re thinking about potential causes. Let me ask a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. Just… arthritis, the doctor said. Years ago. In my hands. Not in my back. And… high blood pressure, sometimes. But I do not take medicine for that either. Just try to eat right, you understand? It’s… controlled, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the hands and occasional high blood pressure that you manage with diet. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. My husband always asked, of course, when he gave me things. But I have not had much reason to take… anything. I am careful. Do you wish to examine my back, Doctor? Perhaps that would be quicker.
DOCTOR: Yes, let's do a quick exam. If you could lie down on your stomach for me, please. I’ll start by palpating your lower back to check for tenderness and muscle spasm. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful.
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. I will tell you if it hurts. Though I suspect it will. It mostly does.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing… on your right side, it's definitely tender to the touch. <verbalizes for documentation>Tenderness present over the lumbar spine, right side. Some muscle guarding noted. <continues palpating>And a little bit on the left, but much less. <verbalizes for documentation>Mild muscle guarding on the left side. Any pain when I move your leg like this?
PATIENT: Yes. A little. Not… severe. But I feel it in my back. Down the right side. Not all the way down, but… along the side. It's… uncomfortable. Like pulling. Is something wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. That’s helpful. We're likely dealing with a muscle strain or sprain, possibly with some nerve irritation given the discomfort you feel down the side. <verbalizes for documentation>Positive straight leg raise on the right side, reproducing lower back pain. <continues examination, checking range of motion>Let me check your reflexes now, just to be sure. <taps patellar tendon on both sides> Reflexes are normal bilaterally. <verbalizes for documentation>Reflexes 2+ bilaterally. So, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like a musculoskeletal issue. I’d like to get an X-ray just to rule out anything more serious, like a fracture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. An X-ray sounds… sensible. If it would rule things out, then yes. Please. I wish to be sure. I have things to do, you understand? Fences to repair. And winter is coming.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll get that ordered right away. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief – ibuprofen or naproxen, if you can tolerate them. And I’ll have the nurse give you a handout on back stretches and proper lifting techniques. We’ll review the results of the X-ray when they come back and adjust the plan accordingly. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. Pain relief and stretches… acceptable. I will try them. I appreciate your help, Doctor. If you would excuse me… I have a fence waiting. And the sun does not last forever, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay. Absolutely. The nurse will be in shortly with the handout and to discuss the pain relief options. We’ll call you with the X-ray results as soon as we have them. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening pain, numbness, or weakness in your legs. Get well soon, Ms. Reihner.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And thank you again.
