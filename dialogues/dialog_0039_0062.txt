DOCTOR: Hello, Rayshun. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here today regarding a matter with my workplace. It concerns the requirement to wear masks, and… well, I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption. I have some difficulty with them.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. A mask exemption for work… I understand. That's perfectly reasonable to discuss. Let me pull up your chart here… Okay, Rayshun Knabenshue, age 47. Just to be clear, is the difficulty with the masks causing you any physical discomfort, or is it more… a feeling of unease, perhaps?
PATIENT: It’s… both, actually. There’s a physical element. I find it difficult to breathe properly when I have one on for extended periods. But also, it brings on a feeling of… confinement. It’s hard to explain, Doctor. It stirs up some… memories, I suppose. It’s not comfortable, not at all. I’ve tried different kinds, but none seem to alleviate the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Physical discomfort and some emotional response… that’s helpful to know. So, difficulty breathing and a feeling of confinement triggered by the masks. Can you tell me a little more about these memories?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to speak of. My ancestors… they were forced to wear things they didn’t want to. As a Lakota man, there’s a history there. Being covered, restricted… it doesn’t sit well. It brings up feelings of… loss of dignity, of being controlled. It’s not something I experienced directly, of course, but it’s a weight passed down through generations. It's a hard feeling to shake, Doctor. It’s not a logical fear, I understand that, but it’s very real.
DOCTOR: That makes a great deal of sense, Rayshun. Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s important to understand the why behind these feelings, and your ancestral history certainly provides valuable context. It’s not illogical at all. We'll document that thoroughly. Now, let me ask a few medical questions, if you don't mind. Has anyone formally diagnosed you with anxiety or claustrophobia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything. I’ve never sought medical attention for… feelings like this before. I mostly try to manage on my own. I just thought I could… try to work through it. But the workplace requirement is making that increasingly difficult. It’s not just a personal discomfort anymore, it’s affecting my ability to do my job, and I don’t want to cause problems for anyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no formal diagnosis. And it's impacting your work now, which is understandably concerning. Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms when you’re wearing a mask?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes, actually. Sometimes my heart races a little. Not severely, but I can feel it beating faster. And I get a bit lightheaded, especially if I’m moving around. It’s not every time, but it’s happened on more than one occasion. Also, I get a bit… shaky. My hands, mostly. It doesn't last long, but it’s noticeable. It’s not a comfortable experience, Doctor. And it worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so racing heart, lightheadedness, and shakiness… those are all things we need to consider. We'll document those as well. Do you have any history of heart problems or blood pressure issues?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As far as I know, I don’t have any history of heart problems. I’ve had a physical every year for the past ten years due to my work, and nothing like that has ever been flagged. My blood pressure has always been within the normal range. My doctor always said I was in good health, aside from the usual aches and pains of getting older. I’m quite active, you see. I spend a lot of time outdoors.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – a history of regular check-ups and good overall health is very helpful. Okay, Rayshun, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. Can we check your heart rate and blood pressure now?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds sensible. Please, proceed. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgment. I just want to find a solution that allows me to continue working without jeopardizing my well-being.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Rayshun. I appreciate that. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. It could be a little anxiety-related right now. Heart rate is 88, a little fast, but regular rhythm. Pulse is strong and regular. Lungs sound clear. Overall, everything seems within normal limits for a quick assessment. I'm thinking we could explore a few options. Given your history and the emotional component, I'd like to rule out any underlying anxiety disorder. Would you be open to a referral to a mental health professional?
PATIENT: A referral to a mental health professional… Yes, I believe that would be wise, Doctor. I’ve been hesitant to seek that kind of help in the past, but if it could help me understand these feelings better, and ultimately resolve this issue at work, then I am certainly willing to consider it. I trust your assessment. I want to be thorough, and I don’t want to dismiss anything out of hand. Perhaps understanding the root cause of these anxieties would be beneficial, even if it’s simply to confirm that it’s connected to my ancestral history.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Rayshun. It’s good to explore all possibilities. I’ll go ahead and write a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, she’s an excellent therapist specializing in trauma-informed care and has experience working with cultural sensitivities. In the meantime, while we wait for that appointment, and until you have a clearer understanding of what’s going on, I’m going to provide you with a note outlining your situation for your workplace. It will state that you are under medical evaluation for potential anxiety related to mask-wearing, and that we are exploring options for accommodation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be immensely helpful. A note for my workplace… that would alleviate a great deal of stress. It’s been difficult explaining the situation to them, and they’ve been… understanding, but I sense their patience is wearing thin. Knowing I have documentation from a medical professional would be a significant comfort. Thank you for taking this seriously. It means a great deal to me. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any paperwork I need to complete at this time?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshun. I’m glad I could help. Here’s the note for your workplace. It also includes contact information for Dr. Vance’s office. As for paperwork, I’ll have my assistant provide you with a release form authorizing us to share your medical information with Dr. Vance, should you choose to do so. And I’ll also give you a list of resources for managing anxiety and stress, just in case. It’s important to remember that you’re not alone in this, and there are people who can help. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today's consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and understanding. You’ve put my mind at ease, and I feel much more hopeful about finding a resolution. I am grateful for your kindness. Thank you again for your time, Dr. Kamahele. I will schedule an appointment with Dr. Vance as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshun. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I wish you all the best, and I’m confident you’ll find a solution that works for you. Take care, and have a good day.
