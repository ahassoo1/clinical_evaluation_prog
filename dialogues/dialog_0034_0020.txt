DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is Seil, yes? Nice to meet you too. Well, I am here for… the talking to the machine visit. My… how you say… the lady on the phone, she say it is a check-up. I feel mostly okay, but I want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, that’s correct – Seil. And you’re right, this is your annual wellness check-up, as scheduled. That’s a great idea to come in and make sure everything is as it should be, even if you’re feeling well. Just to confirm, your name is Avril Benites, and today is August 2nd, 2025. I see here you're 57 years old. Is that all correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Avril Benites. August second… yes. And fifty-seven. It feels… longer sometimes, if you know what I mean. But yes, fifty-seven. Is good you have it all written down. I sometimes forget things, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely, Ms. Benites. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way, and we’ll take our time today. That’s what we’re here for. To get started, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Hmm. Overall health… Well, I work. I fix cars. It is… physical. My hands, they are strong. I have been doing it a long time. I used to have a husband, he helped, but now it is just me. I try to eat okay, not too much sugar. I walk the dog every day. He is a small one, a terrier. That is… mostly it. I do not get sick often.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Benites. Staying active with your work and walking the dog is excellent. It sounds like you’re very independent and keep yourself busy. You mentioned you used to have a husband. I’m sorry to hear that. Is it alright if I ask a few questions about your past medical history, and perhaps your family history as well?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. My husband… he passed five years ago. It was… a long illness. The heart. Yes, the heart. You can ask. I try to remember. My mother… she had problems with her blood sugar. Diabetes, I think it was called. And my father… he was strong, but he had trouble breathing when he got older. Something with his lungs. I do not know much about it. I was young then.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Benites. Losing someone is never easy. Thank you for sharing that with me. And thank you for telling me about your mother and father’s health. So, your mother had diabetes, and your father had breathing problems later in life. That's helpful information. Have you yourself been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. The doctors, they always check when I go for my… the regular check-ups. They say my pressure is okay. Sometimes a little high if I am nervous, but mostly okay. Cholesterol… I do not know. They do not tell me much, usually. Just say “everything looks fine.” I think. It has been a long time since they told me anything different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known medical diagnoses, and your blood pressure has generally been okay, occasionally a bit elevated when you're nervous. And they haven’t mentioned anything about high cholesterol. That’s good. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter medications like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take a vitamin D pill sometimes, in the winter. The lady at the store, she say it is good for the bones. And… oh! Yes. I take something for my hands. They ache sometimes, after working on the cars. It is a cream, you rub it on. Not every day, just when they hurt. It is… ibuprofen, I think it is called. Or something like that. It is the blue box.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Vitamin D in the winter, and a topical ibuprofen cream for your hands as needed. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I have never had a… how you say… a bad reaction to anything. Maybe I am lucky. My husband, he was allergic to bees. Very bad. But me, no. Never. I do not wear much perfume, either. Some people are allergic to that, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Benites. No known allergies are good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmm. I work. A lot. Six days a week, usually. I like fixing cars. It keeps me busy. I drink tea. Not coffee. Too much… jittering. And I do not smoke. Never have. I drink a glass of wine sometimes, with my dinner. Not every night. Maybe two or three times a week. And I try to sleep… eight hours. But sometimes it is hard. The shop… it is noisy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work six days a week, enjoy fixing cars, drink tea, and don't smoke. You have a glass of wine a few times a week, and try to get eight hours of sleep. It sounds like you're a very hardworking person. Now, Ms. Benites, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That is okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle with my hands, please? They are important for my work. And… tell me if you see anything wrong. I do not want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Benites. I will be as gentle as possible with your hands. They are very important, and I understand that. And I will definitely let you know if I see anything of concern. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Your blood pressure is 138/82. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. And your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that can be due to being in the office. We can monitor that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breath… like this? I try to relax. It is… difficult. The noises, they always make me nervous. But I am trying. Just tell me if something is wrong.
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Benites. You're doing great. Your heart sounds regular, and your lung sounds are clear bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Now, I'm going to examine your abdomen. Please lie back, and I'll gently palpate your stomach. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness.
PATIENT: Okay. No pain… not yet. It is… a little uncomfortable, but not painful. I do not like anyone touching my stomach. It feels… strange. But I am trying to be still. Just tell me if you find something.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I do not feel any masses or organomegaly. Everything feels normal. Now, I’m going to take a look at your hands. You mentioned they ache sometimes. Let me examine your joints and range of motion. Could you please make a fist for me?
PATIENT: Like this? It… it hurts a little. Especially this one… It aches when I bend it. It is worse after a long day at the shop. The metal… it is hard on my hands.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a slight swelling and tenderness at the base of your index finger. It looks like you may have some mild osteoarthritis, also known as wear and tear arthritis. It’s common in people who do a lot of manual work. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh! That… that startled me. My leg… it jumped. Is that good? I do not understand about reflexes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly normal, Ms. Benites. Your reflexes are present and normal. It means your nerves are functioning as they should. Alright, Ms. Benites, that completes the physical exam. Everything looks generally good. As we discussed, you have some mild osteoarthritis in your index finger knuckle. We can discuss treatment options for that, such as over-the-counter pain relievers, hand exercises, or a splint. Do you have any questions about anything we've done so far?
PATIENT: Osteo… what-itis? Is that bad? Will I not be able to fix cars anymore? And what about the wine? Does that make it worse? I do not want to stop working. And I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner…
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Benites, osteoarthritis is not immediately dangerous. It’s a progressive condition, meaning it can get worse over time, but we can manage it effectively to minimize your symptoms. It's very unlikely you'll be unable to fix cars, but we want to prevent it from getting to that point. As for the wine, moderate alcohol consumption isn't generally considered harmful for osteoarthritis. However, excessive alcohol can worsen inflammation, so limiting yourself to one glass per night is a good idea. To summarize, we'll focus on managing the osteoarthritis in your hand with over-the-counter pain relief as needed, and I recommend some gentle hand exercises to maintain range of motion. We can also discuss a splint if the pain becomes more persistent. We’ll monitor your blood pressure at future appointments, and I advise limiting your alcohol consumption to one glass of wine per night. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… okay. One glass of wine, I can do that. And the hand exercises… I will try. But I am afraid of making it worse. I do not want to stop working. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any special creams or… vitamins? And… how often should I come back for a check-up?
DOCTOR: It's completely normal to be concerned about making it worse, Ms. Benites. I'll show you some gentle exercises and make sure you're doing them correctly. We'll start slowly and gradually increase the intensity as you feel comfortable. As for other creams, there are topical NSAIDs available over the counter that can help with pain and inflammation. We can discuss those at your next visit. There's some evidence that glucosamine and chondroitin supplements can help with osteoarthritis, but the results are mixed. It's something you can consider, but it’s not a guaranteed solution. I recommend a follow-up appointment in six months to monitor your blood pressure and assess the effectiveness of the hand exercises. If the pain becomes significantly worse before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office and schedule an appointment sooner. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: Six months… that sounds good. I can remember that. And I will call if it gets worse. No… I think that is all for now. Thank you, Doctor Seil. You were very kind. And… gentle with my hands. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse print out a summary of our discussion and instructions for the hand exercises. Please read through it carefully. Take care, Ms. Benites. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: .
