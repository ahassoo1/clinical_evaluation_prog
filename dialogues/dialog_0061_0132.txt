DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Sammie! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you, Doctor. It's about this heat, see. Can't take it anymore. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, building things, painting... now? I'm wiped out after a couple of hours. Makes a man feel useless, it does. And it's not like I'm old old, you know? Still got plenty of good years left in me, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds really frustrating to feel limited by the heat when you're used to being active. It's good you're getting it checked out. So, just to clarify, you're saying this is a relatively new thing – feeling wiped out quickly in the heat?
PATIENT: Relatively new? Yes. Started maybe… last summer, a bit. Thought it was just a bad year, you know? Hotter than usual. But this year’s worse. And it's not just feeling tired, Doctor. I get… lightheaded. A bit shaky. My wife – well, used to be my wife – she always said I got red in the face too, but she noticed everything, that woman. Always fussing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started last summer, and it's definitely worse this year. Lightheadedness and shakiness along with feeling wiped out, and your wife noticed you getting red in the face. That’s helpful information. When you say lightheaded, is that when you’re actively out in the heat, or does it happen after you’ve been resting for a while too?
PATIENT: Mostly when I’m in it, Doctor. Working, you know? Sun beating down. But sometimes, even just thinking about going out there… I get a bit queasy. Like I'm gonna faint. And it's not like I'm doing anything strenuous, not anymore. Mostly light work. Touch-ups, fixing fences… things a younger fella would laugh at. This heat… it's just… different now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be triggered by being in the heat, and even thinking about it can make you feel unwell. And it’s not related to particularly heavy work. That’s good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms – like a headache, nausea, muscle cramps, or excessive thirst?
PATIENT: Thirst, yeah. Always thirsty. More than usual. And sometimes my head… it feels a bit fuzzy. Not a proper headache, just… not right. Like there's cotton wool in it. Muscle cramps, no. Never been much for those. I eat alright, mostly. Not fancy, but plenty of dal bhat. Good, solid food. Keeps a man going, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased thirst and a fuzzy feeling in your head, but no muscle cramps and you're eating well. That’s good. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or any changes in your bathroom habits – like needing to urinate more or less often?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. Bathroom… no, nothing different there. Regular as clockwork, always have been. Look, Doctor, is this… serious? I got a roof to fix, you know? A paying job. Can't be lying around. And this heat... I just want to be able to work again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sammie. It's good you're being proactive about this. It's definitely worth investigating to get you back to feeling your best and able to work. Let's take a look at your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something years ago, told me to watch the salt. I mostly do. Diabetes? No. Never been told that. Heart… well, I get a bit breathless sometimes climbing the stairs, but who doesn't, at my age? Mostly, I've always been a pretty healthy man. Tough as nails, my wife used to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure that you manage with salt restriction, but no diabetes. And some breathlessness with exertion. That's helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… not really. Broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a mango tree. They set it, sent me home. And I had my appendix out when I was younger, but that was years and years ago. Nothing serious. Mostly just bumps and bruises from working.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child and an appendectomy years ago. Nothing major recently. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't believe in all those pills. Mess with your system, they do. I take a bit of turmeric in my dal sometimes, that's all. Good for inflammation, my mother used to say. Actually… sometimes, when my joints are acting up, I use a bit of that balam balm. The stuff with the wintergreen. But that's just for the aches and pains, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just turmeric in your food and balam balm for aches and pains. That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any trouble with anything. I eat everything. Dal, bhat, momos, everything. Pollen... well, sometimes I sneeze a bit in the spring, but that's just the season, you know? Nothing serious enough to worry about. I've lived in this country a long time, Doctor. Built up an immunity to most things, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's very helpful, Sammie. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look at your overall condition. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Go ahead, Doctor. Just get on with it. I got things to do, you know? Roof isn't gonna fix itself. But alright, check whatever you need to check. Just be quick about it, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sammie. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 160 over 90. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Your lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft. Your pulses feel normal. I’m also noting a bit of redness in your face. Does this feel warm to you?
PATIENT: Warm? Yes, it feels a bit flushed, always does when I'm working hard. Like I said, Doctor, I get red in the face. It's just how I am. But that number… 160? Is that bad? My wife used to fuss about numbers all the time… never understood what all the fuss was about. And a murmur, you say? What does that mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. A blood pressure of 160 over 90 is higher than we'd like to see, and it's something we need to address. It can increase your risk of heart problems and stroke if left untreated. As for the murmur, it’s an extra sound your heart makes. It doesn't always mean something is seriously wrong, but it's something we should investigate further. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to order a few blood tests and an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart’s electrical activity. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Seems like all you doctors do is order tests. Fine. Go ahead. But I expect you to tell me what all these tests are for, Doctor. No fancy medical jargon. And I want to know what you’re looking for. I don’t want to be poked and prodded without knowing what’s going on. And frankly, if it's gonna take all day, I'm not sure I have the time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Sammie. You're right to want clear explanations. I'll explain everything in plain language, I promise. The blood tests will help us check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any underlying infections. It will also give us a baseline for your cholesterol levels. The EKG is a quick, painless test that records your heart's electrical activity. It can help us identify any irregular heartbeats or signs of heart damage. It takes just a few minutes. Based on the results of these tests, we can determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… less bad than I thought, I suppose. Kidneys, cholesterol… heart electricity. Still don't like being poked and prodded, but if it gets me back to work, then alright. But no waiting around all day, Doctor. I got a roof to fix, remember? Can we get these tests done quickly? And can you tell me… realistically… how long before I get the results? I need to know if I can schedule work or not.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sammie. I’ll make sure the lab knows you need quick results. We can usually get the blood test results back within 24-48 hours, and the EKG results are available almost immediately. I'll also have the nurse draw up a requisition for both tests, and we’ll get you scheduled with the lab right away. They are just down the hall, and it shouldn't take long. In the meantime, to help us understand the situation better, try to keep a log of when you experience these symptoms – what you were doing, how long it lasted, and anything that makes it better or worse. That can be really helpful when we review the results. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A log, huh? Like a diary? Never been much for writing things down. But alright, I can try. Write down when I feel like I'm gonna faint… what I was doing… fine. But don't expect fancy details. Just the basics. And this… log… it won't affect how quickly I get back to work, will it?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not, Sammie. The log is just to help us understand what’s going on, and it won't affect the timeline for getting you back to work. It’s simply extra information that can help us with your diagnosis and treatment. Let's get you scheduled with the lab, and then we can discuss some things you can do in the meantime to manage your symptoms, like staying hydrated and avoiding strenuous activity in the heat. Here’s the requisition form. The lab is just down the hall, Room 203. The nurse will walk you over if you'd like. And please, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Emergency room… Alright, alright. I got it. No strenuous activity, stay hydrated, and don't faint. Chest pain… well, let's hope it doesn't come to that. I think I understand. Just get this done, Doctor. Let's get these tests done and find out what's going on. No need to walk me to the lab, I can find it. I built this country, remember? And Doctor… one last thing. If all these tests cost a lot of money… will Medicare cover it? I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sammie. Yes, Medicare should cover the blood tests and the EKG, as long as they are deemed medically necessary. Our billing department will handle the paperwork, and they’ll let you know if there are any costs involved. They're located near the front desk, and they can answer any specific questions you have about your coverage. Please don't hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. Go ahead and get the tests done when you’re ready. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Take care, and please, if your symptoms worsen, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention immediately. We’ll get this figured out.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Thank you, Doctor. I'll go get these tests done. And I'll remember about the billing department. Hopefully, it won't be too much fuss. I'll see you when I see you. Take care.
