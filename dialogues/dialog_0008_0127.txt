DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker lately, and my eyelids… they’ve been drooping. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, and it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weakness and drooping eyelids… getting worse over months. Can you tell me a bit more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It started in my arms, I think. Just feeling tired after doing things, like… carrying groceries, or even just holding something for a while. Now it’s… it’s in my legs too. It’s not painful, just… difficult. Like it takes a lot of effort to lift them, or to walk for any length of time. It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Alright, so weakness in your arms and legs, progressively getting worse over a few months, no pain. And you mentioned the drooping eyelids – is that happening on both sides, or just one?
PATIENT: It’s… both sides, yes. But it's definitely worse on my left side, I think. It’s noticeable, people have actually commented on it. It makes me look… very tired, I suppose. I’ve been trying to rest more, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, drooping on both sides, worse on the left. And resting hasn’t been effective. Have you noticed any changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… hmm. That’s a good question. Not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. Everything seems clear enough. But sometimes… when I’m reading for a long time, my eyes feel strained, and maybe a bit blurry? But I wear glasses, so I always assumed it was just my prescription needing adjusting. I haven't been to the optician in a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, so possibly some eye strain and blurry vision, which you attribute to your glasses. Do you have any difficulty swallowing, or changes in your voice?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing. And my voice feels… normal, I think. No one has mentioned anything, and I haven't noticed a difference myself. It's just… the weakness and the eyelids. Those are the main things bothering me. It makes me a bit anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. No swallowing or voice changes. And you're understandably anxious. Let's go through some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your weight, either gaining or losing?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I think I’ve lost a little bit of weight. Not a lot, maybe a few kilos. I haven't been eating much, I suppose. Not because I don’t want to, just… not very hungry. It’s hard to keep track, really. I don’t weigh myself regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss, and decreased appetite. Do you have any family history of any muscle diseases, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she had some health problems, but I wasn’t very close to her. I don’t really know what they were, to be honest. Something with her nerves, maybe? My father… he was healthy, as far as I know. He worked very hard all his life. I don't really have much information about either of their medical histories. It’s… not something we talked about much in my family.
DOCTOR: Alright, limited family history available. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any medications regularly. And I don’t have any known allergies, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything in the past. I try to avoid taking anything unless I absolutely need to, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or known allergies. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. I just… hope you find something out. It's been worrying me quite a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit up on the examination table for me, please. Okay, so I'm checking your reflexes and strength. Your facial symmetry is slightly reduced on the left side, which is consistent with your reported drooping. Your reflexes are a little diminished in all limbs, and your strength is… noticeably weaker in your arms and legs, particularly on your left side. I’m also noting some mild difficulty with eye movements. Overall, your exam findings are concerning for possible neuromuscular weakness. I’m going to document these findings.
PATIENT: That… doesn't sound good, does it? Neuromuscular weakness… what does that mean, exactly? Is it something serious? I… I feel a bit anxious now, if I’m honest. What sort of tests do you think I might need?
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, and it’s okay to feel anxious. "Neuromuscular weakness" simply means there’s a problem with the nerves and muscles working together. It can be serious, but it also has a number of potential causes, some more manageable than others. We need to investigate further to determine the specific cause. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I'd like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or anemia. Second, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Third, and most importantly, I'd like to order an electromyography and nerve conduction study to evaluate the function of your nerves and muscles. We’ll also need a creatine kinase level to look for muscle damage. I also think a referral to a neurologist is a good idea. They are specialists in these types of conditions and can provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. All of those tests. It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest, but I suppose it’s necessary. A neurologist… yes, that makes sense. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Will I need a referral letter for the neurologist? And how long will it take to get the results from these tests? I… I have a bit of a busy schedule, so I'd like to know what to expect. Also, are these tests covered by… well, I don’t really have insurance, so… how expensive are they likely to be? I apologize for asking, but it’s a bit of a worry.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about costs, especially without insurance. It is a worry, and we can discuss options. I’ll write a referral letter for a neurologist, and I can recommend a few specialists who offer financial assistance programs or sliding scale fees. As for the tests, the CBC and metabolic panel are relatively inexpensive, typically under \$100 each. The EMG and nerve conduction study is more costly, potentially \$300-\$500 depending on the facility. I can provide you with a detailed cost estimate before scheduling them, and we can prioritize which tests are most crucial to start with. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have those results, I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you and coordinate your referral to the neurologist. To summarize, I’ll prepare the referral, get you the cost estimates for the tests, and we’ll go from there. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. Getting the cost estimates is a huge relief, and knowing roughly how long it will take is good. I appreciate you being so thorough and explaining everything so clearly. I suppose I should ask… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid, or any symptoms I should be particularly watchful for? I… I don't want things to get any worse before I can get these tests done.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity that exacerbates your weakness. Listen to your body, and rest when you need to. It's also important to stay hydrated and maintain a healthy diet, even if your appetite is low. Specifically, be watchful for any new symptoms such as difficulty breathing, changes in your vision , difficulty swallowing, or any slurred speech. If you experience any of these symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. I'll also provide you with a written list of these precautions, and the neurologist will likely have further recommendations once they review your test results. Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate your patience and understanding. I’ll wait for the referral and the cost estimates, and I’ll contact you if anything changes. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get this sorted out. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
