DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Lindra Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Lindra. My… my family want me to go to a… a place for old people. A nice place. They say I need to… check if I can go? I don’t know… they say doctor check, yes?
DOCTOR: Of course, Lindra. It sounds like your family is concerned about your well-being and wants to ensure you have the support you need. And yes, that’s exactly what we're here to do – to assess your current health and see what level of care might be most appropriate for you. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a little more about why your family is suggesting this?
PATIENT: They say… I forget things. Small things. Like… where I put my glasses. Or… what I eat for breakfast. Sometimes I… wander a little, they say. Not far! Just… in the garden. My husband, he worry. He is getting old too. It is hard for him to… watch me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Lindra. It sounds like you're experiencing some changes in your memory and orientation, and your husband is understandably concerned. These are important things to discuss. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask you some more detailed questions, if you don't mind. We'll start with when you first noticed these changes. About how long ago did you begin to feel like you were forgetting things or becoming disoriented?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Maybe… six months? No, more. Maybe… one year? It started slow. Very slow. I thought it was just… getting old. You know? Everyone forget things when they get old. But then… it happen more and more. My daughter, she noticed first. She say, "Mama, you ask the same question three times!" And then my husband… he start to worry. He always worry.
DOCTOR: It’s good that your daughter and husband are observant and are looking out for you. It’s very common to experience some memory changes as we age, but it's also important to understand what's happening. Now, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day… Okay. I wake up, usually with my husband. He make the coffee. I eat… usually fruit and toast. Then I… I help him in the garden. He grow tomatoes and peppers. Very good peppers! Sometimes I cook lunch. We eat lunch with my daughter, she come almost every day. In the afternoon… I read. Or I watch television. Sometimes I take a nap. In the evening… we eat dinner and watch the news. Then we go to bed. Is that good enough? I don’t do much else now.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Lindra, thank you. It sounds like you have a lovely routine. And it’s good you have your daughter visiting often. Now, you mentioned occasionally feeling “lost” in the garden. Could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It is not… really lost. More like… confused. I know the garden. I help my husband grow everything! But sometimes… I walk one way, and then… I don’t remember how to get back to the house. Not far! Maybe… ten steps. Then I see my husband, and he show me. He doesn’t like it when I wander. He say, “Lindra, you must pay attention!” But I… I just forget. It is silly, yes?
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Lindra. It’s important that we investigate what’s going on. Experiencing confusion, even for a short time, is something we need to take seriously. Now, I'd like to ask about any other symptoms you may be experiencing. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, appetite, or sleep?
PATIENT: My sleep… is not very good. I wake up many times in the night. I go to the bathroom, maybe two or three times. Then I… I think about things. Old things. Sometimes I feel sad, but not all the time. My appetite is… okay. I don’t eat as much as before, but I still like my fruit. And my husband make very good soup. I do not feel… angry or anything. Just… tired, sometimes. Very tired.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lindra. This is all very helpful information. Now, have you been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Yes. I take a little pill for my blood pressure. The doctor give it to me, a long time ago. And sometimes, when my knee hurt, I take a little pill for the pain. But not every day. Only when it hurt very bad. The red one, I think. My daughter, she help me with the pills. She make sure I take the right ones. I forget sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as food or pollen?
PATIENT: No. I do not think so. I eat everything. My husband, he is allergic to… cats. But I am not. I like cats! We don’t have one, though. My daughter is allergic to pollen, sometimes. She sneeze a lot in the spring. But me? No allergies. I am a strong woman!
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Lindra. Now, to get a clearer picture of your overall health, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a simple neurological assessment – just to check your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. I trust you, Doctor. My husband always say I worry too much. Maybe you can tell me what is wrong, yes? Or… if everything is okay. I just want to know. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's begin by checking your vital signs. If you could please have a seat here on the table, that would be wonderful. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/86. A little elevated, but not significantly concerning at this point. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Very good. And finally, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please sit on the edge of the table and let your arms fall to your sides?
PATIENT: Okay, I am sitting. My arms are down. My knee is a little sore today. It happens sometimes. The weather, maybe? Or… too much gardening. What do I do now?
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know about your knee. It’s helpful to know. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which can be normal for someone your age, but it's something we'll note. Now, could you please stand up, feet together, and close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Okay… I am standing. My eyes are closed. Oh… I feel a little dizzy. Maybe I should sit down.
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy there. Yes, let's sit down. That’s perfectly alright. It's important to be careful. That slight unsteadiness and the dizziness you experienced are something we need to investigate further. It's possible it's simply age-related, or it could be related to other factors. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the brief examination, I’d like to order some blood tests and a brain scan to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The blood tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions, and the scan will give us a look at your brain structure and function. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: A brain scan? Oh my… That sounds… serious. What will it show? Will it hurt? I don't like… being poked and prodded. Is something very wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lindra, and it's perfectly natural to feel anxious about a brain scan. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is very wrong. It's simply a tool to help us gather more information and rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. The scan itself is completely painless. It’s like a very sophisticated X-ray, and you’ll just lie still for a little while. There are no needles or poking involved. It’s also very safe. The scan will allow us to visualize your brain and look for any signs of changes or abnormalities. It's the best way to understand what's going on and develop the right plan of care. Do you want me to explain the specific types of blood tests I’m ordering?
PATIENT: Yes… please. I don’t understand all these things. What will the blood tests tell you? And… who will tell me the results? My daughter is very good with these things, maybe she can come with me?
DOCTOR: Of course, Lindra. I'm happy to explain everything, and it’s wonderful that your daughter is involved. We can absolutely include her in the discussion. The blood tests will give us a comprehensive look at your overall health. We'll be checking things like your complete blood count – that tells us about your red and white blood cells – as well as your electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and thyroid levels. We’ll also check your vitamin B12 levels, as a deficiency can sometimes cause memory problems. And we’ll do a test to rule out any infections. Essentially, these tests will help us identify any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. And once we have the results, we can discuss them with you and your daughter, and develop a plan of care that's tailored to your needs. I can schedule the tests for you right now. Would tomorrow morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that is okay. But… will it take long? I don't want to be all day at the… the place. And who will do the tests? A nice nurse? I don’t like… mean people. And… what happens after the tests? How long until we know the results? My daughter, she is very busy, so we need to plan carefully.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Lindra. I'll do my best to make the process as smooth and comfortable as possible for you. The tests shouldn't take more than a couple of hours. You’ll be at the lab for blood draws and a brief wait while the samples are processed. The lab technicians are all very friendly and experienced. I’ll make a note on your chart requesting a kind and gentle technician for you. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back from the lab. Once they are available, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss them with you and your daughter. We can plan that appointment around your daughter’s schedule. I'm scheduling the blood work for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. The imaging center is just down the street, so you can go there right after. They'll call you to confirm the appointment time. And I'll make a note to have my nurse contact your daughter to coordinate the follow-up. Does that sound alright, Lindra?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. You are very kind. I feel a little better now, knowing what to expect. Maybe… maybe everything will be okay. Do I need to… do anything before the tests? Like… not eat breakfast? Or… drink lots of water? My daughter always tells me things like that. I forget!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindra. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. And yes, you do have a couple of things to keep in mind. Please do not eat or drink anything for 8 hours before the blood tests, except for water. And it’s a good idea to drink plenty of water the day before and the morning of the tests – that makes it easier for the technicians to draw the blood. You can take your regular medications, unless I’ve specifically told you otherwise. Here's a list of instructions for you to take home. And if you have any questions or concerns before the tests, please don’t hesitate to call my office. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very patient with me. And you listened. That is very important. I hope… I hope everything will be okay. For my family. For me. I think… I think I will go home now. It was… a long morning. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindra. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could help. Please, don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. We'll get to the bottom of this. Drive safely, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
