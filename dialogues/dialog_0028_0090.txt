DOCTOR: Right. Mackenzi Brightful, 29 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Memmolo, is it? Yes. Um, well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I need to get cleared for it, I believe. It’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely why I need the clearance, truthfully. My memory… isn’t what it used to be. I just know my doctor suggested I come here first.
DOCTOR: Yes, Memmolo. And a clearance for surgery… right. Well, we’ll figure it out. It’s always something. So, this other doctor… what kind of surgery are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. It was… something to do with… how I look, I think? It’s… cosmetic, definitely. Something about… improving things. I truly apologize, Doctor. It feels awful to not be able to recall more details. It was recommended by Doctor Alvarez, I believe… in the city. He’s… very good.
DOCTOR: Cosmetic surgery. Right. And you're having trouble remembering what specifically Doctor Alvarez is planning?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It’s… terribly frustrating. I remember the appointments, and I remember discussing… options, and feeling hopeful. But the specifics… they’re just… hazy. I think it involved… my face? Perhaps my nose? Or… cheeks? Oh dear. I feel so silly. It wasn’t a major reconstruction, if that helps. More… refinements, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up Doctor Alvarez’s notes… one moment. Hmm. It says here… rhinoplasty consultation and possible buccal fat removal. Does that ring any bells?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes… yes, that sounds… familiar. Rhinoplasty… that’s the nose, isn’t it? And… buccal… is that the cheeks? Yes, that’s it! That feels right. Doctor Alvarez said something about… balancing my features, I think. And… removing a little fullness. It is coming back to me, slowly. Thank goodness you had his notes. I was starting to feel quite foolish.
DOCTOR: Good. Well, that’s a start. Now, before we clear you for surgery – and frankly, any surgery carries risk, even cosmetic – I need a thorough medical history. Let's start with this: do you have any medical problems at all?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. I want to be as forthcoming as possible. Let me think… I don’t believe so, not really. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. And… well, my husband passed away a few years ago, and that was… difficult. But as far as ongoing medical conditions… no. I do take a daily vitamin, if that matters. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… something. “Fairly healthy” isn’t a diagnosis, Ms. Brightful. Any high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not that I know of. I’ve never been told I have high blood pressure. I… I don’t really go to the doctor much, unless I have to. My husband… he always took care of those things. After… well, after he passed, I haven’t really gotten back into a good routine. But I assure you, I feel fine. Do you… do you want me to list any medications I've taken recently? Perhaps that will be more helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Any medications, even over-the-counter, or supplements. And for the record, simply feeling fine isn't sufficient for surgical clearance. We need to know what's going on internally. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Medications… Let me see. Just the daily multivitamin, as I mentioned. And… occasionally, ibuprofen for headaches. Very rarely, though. As for allergies… hmm. I think I’m allergic to penicillin, yes. I had a bad reaction to it as a child. My skin came out in hives. And… I think I’m a little sensitive to pollen, during the springtime. It makes me sneeze a lot. Is that all you need to know at this time, Doctor? I apologize for being so… vague. I truly am trying to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. Ibuprofen, multivitamin. Right. Now, any family history of… anything?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… that’s a difficult one. My mother… she had some heart trouble, I believe. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the specifics. She passed away when I was quite young. And my father… he was a very healthy man, thankfully. He lived to a good age. No… I don’t recall any other significant medical problems in the family, no. We weren’t a particularly close family, if I’m being honest. Would it be helpful if I contacted a relative? Perhaps they would know more.
DOCTOR: No, that won't be necessary. We'll proceed. Now, Ms. Brightful, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I've never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he smoked, unfortunately. But I always detested it. I find it very unpleasant. And I… I don't drink much alcohol either. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's it. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. It's important to me, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. And your weight has been stable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, relatively. I mean, I… I’ve gained a little weight since my husband passed away, I suppose. It’s difficult to maintain a good appetite when you’re… grieving. But it’s been fairly stable for the past year, I think. Around… 150 pounds, perhaps? Give or take a few. I'm five foot tall, if that helps. Does that answer your question, Doctor? I worry I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: Five foot and 150 pounds. We'll note that. Now, one last thing. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just… just one. Years ago. When I was a teenager, I had my appendix removed. It was… quite sudden. A very common procedure, I believe. Other than that… no, nothing else. No cosmetic procedures, no major illnesses. I really do think that’s everything, Doctor. Unless… is there anything else I should be telling you? I want to be perfectly transparent, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Standard procedure. It’s 140 over 90. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78. Heart sounds normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, open your mouth. Throat looks fine. Overall, you seem reasonably healthy, but the blood pressure warrants a follow-up with your primary care physician. But I suppose we can proceed with the surgery, with the understanding that any complications could be more serious given your slightly elevated blood pressure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s… reassuring to hear, I suppose. Slightly elevated blood pressure… that doesn’t sound good. But I do understand. I'll certainly schedule an appointment with a doctor to get that checked out. And yes, I fully understand about the complications. I… I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I really want this surgery to go well. And if proceeding comes with risks, I accept them. I’ll schedule that doctor’s appointment right away. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll write a surgical clearance, contingent on follow-up with your primary care physician regarding the blood pressure. I'll also include a note recommending a cardiology consult if it remains elevated. Here you go. Make sure you inform Doctor Alvarez of everything we’ve discussed. Any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, thank you so much, Doctor. I will certainly inform Doctor Alvarez immediately. And I… I appreciate your thoroughness, even if it wasn't entirely good news about my blood pressure. I'll make that appointment first thing tomorrow. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at this time. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Good. Have a… satisfactory recovery. .
