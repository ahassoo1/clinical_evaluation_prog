DOCTOR: Hi Marija, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s…Chilla, actually. Marija Chilla. And frankly, I’m not entirely certain why I’m here, beyond what my husband insisted. He’s become rather… preoccupied with end-of-life planning lately. Something about forms? He said I need to fill out something in case… well, you can imagine. It all seems rather morbid, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Chilla, got it. And it sounds like your husband is being proactive, though I can definitely see how it feels a bit unsettling. It’s good he’s thinking ahead, but it’s also completely valid to feel like it's coming out of left field. So, just to clarify, he brought you in specifically to discuss advance directives – things like a living will or durable power of attorney for healthcare?
PATIENT: A…durable power of attorney? Is that something to do with finances? Because if it is, I assure you, my husband handles all of that. He always has. I simply want to be clear – I am here because he believes I need to designate someone to make… medical decisions, should I become incapable. But honestly, I’m quite healthy, Doctor. I’ve never had any serious ailments. I don’t understand why this is even necessary. Perhaps you could explain it to me in… simpler terms?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It can involve finances, but a durable power of attorney for healthcare is specifically about medical decisions. Think of it this way: if something were to happen where you couldn't communicate your wishes – maybe an accident, a sudden illness – this document allows someone you trust to make those decisions for you. It’s about ensuring your healthcare aligns with what you would want, even if you can’t tell us yourself. It sounds like your husband is wanting to be prepared for any scenario. That being said, it’s completely your decision whether or not to pursue this. Before we go further, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, as I said, I'm generally very well. I exercise regularly – I enjoy brisk walks – and I maintain a balanced diet, though I do allow myself the occasional pastry. My husband insists I need to watch my sugar, naturally. I’ve never been hospitalized, and I haven’t had any major surgeries. Just the usual colds, but nothing… concerning. I suppose I’m quite fortunate. But this whole idea… it’s just rather… defeatist, isn’t it? Focusing on what could happen, instead of enjoying what is. I've always believed in living in the present.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It does feel a bit morbid to think about these things when you're feeling healthy. And you're right, focusing on the present is important. But it’s also about having a safety net in place, just in case. It doesn't mean you're anticipating anything bad happening, it just means you're being responsible. Okay, so no hospitalizations, no surgeries. Have you had any significant illnesses – things like pneumonia, a serious infection, or even a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Nothing of that nature. I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years ago, but that was it. And honestly, I recovered quite quickly. I have a very strong constitution. My mother always said so. Look, Doctor, with all due respect, I’m beginning to feel as though you’re trying to find something wrong with me. I came here at my husband’s insistence, not because I believe I require medical attention. Perhaps I should simply tell him I’ve had enough and we can drop this whole… exercise.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to say that. I apologize if I’m coming across that way – that’s not my intention at all. I'm simply trying to get a complete picture of your health history, as I would with any patient. It's standard practice, and it doesn't mean I think there's anything wrong with you. It sounds like your husband is very concerned about your well-being, and he's trying to be proactive. Perhaps we can approach this from a different angle. Before we discuss the legal aspects of advance directives, would you be open to a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your current health?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor. I assure you, it’s quite unnecessary. I feel perfectly well. And frankly, I find it rather insulting that you would suggest it after I’ve repeatedly stated my good health. It's as though you don't believe me. Look, I came here to inquire about a form, not to be subjected to a medical examination. If you’re unwilling to simply explain the process and allow me to decide if I wish to proceed, I think I’ll take my leave. I have other commitments, you see. Perhaps my husband can find another doctor who is more… accommodating.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to stand your ground, and I sincerely apologize for pushing the issue. It was inappropriate of me, and I was not respecting your wishes. I was operating on a routine assumption and should have listened more attentively to your concerns. I can certainly explain the advance directive process to you without any further examination. It's completely your decision, and I will respect that. Let's talk about what a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare actually entail. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be… acceptable. Though I still maintain this is all rather unnecessary. But if my husband will be satisfied knowing I’ve at least heard an explanation, then I suppose it’s worth my time. Please, proceed. And try to use language a… a normal person can understand, if you don't mind. None of that… medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No jargon, I promise. Okay, so think of it this way: a living will – sometimes called an advance directive – is a document where you outline your wishes for medical care if you become unable to communicate them yourself. Things like whether you want life-sustaining treatment, if you want pain management, that sort of thing. It's about your preferences. A durable power of attorney for healthcare is a little different. This is where you appoint someone – a trusted friend or family member – to make medical decisions on your behalf if you can’t. They’ll be the person to talk to the doctors, review your medical information, and ensure your wishes are followed. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Hmm. So, the living will states what I want, and the power of attorney designates who decides if I can’t? That’s… marginally clearer, I suppose. But it all seems rather… drastic. What if I change my mind? And who is to say this person I appoint will even know what I would want? My husband, for example, believes I would want everything done, regardless of the quality of life. Which is… not necessarily true. I prefer a certain… dignity, shall we say. Is it a complicated process to fill out these forms? And if I decide against it, is there any… pressure to continue?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. You’re right to be concerned about those aspects. Yes, you’ve summarized it perfectly – the living will outlines what you want, and the power of attorney designates who makes the decisions. And yes, you can absolutely change your mind at any time. These documents aren’t set in stone. You can revise them, update them, or revoke them completely. It’s your right. As for knowing your wishes, that's why it's so important to have a thorough conversation with the person you appoint. You need to be clear about your values, your preferences, and what you would – and wouldn’t – want in different scenarios. The forms themselves aren't overly complicated, but it's best to take your time and be thoughtful. The hospital has resources available to help you fill them out, and I can provide you with some information as well. There is absolutely no pressure to continue if you decide against it. It’s entirely your choice. Would you like me to provide you with some informational pamphlets, and perhaps a list of resources available at the hospital?
PATIENT: Yes, the pamphlets would be… appreciated. And the list of resources, if it's not too much trouble. I suppose it’s worth having the information, even if I ultimately decide against this whole… endeavor. Perhaps my husband will be satisfied knowing I've at least considered it. Though I still maintain it’s all rather morbid and unnecessary. But one must appease one’s spouse, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. That will be all for now. I believe I’ve absorbed enough information to… contemplate the matter.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marija. And you’re right – it’s perfectly okay to take your time and consider all your options. I'm glad I could provide some clarity. I’ll have the pamphlets and resource list brought to you momentarily. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions, even after you've had a chance to review them. And please, do remember – it’s your decision, and I will respect whatever you choose. Have a good day, Marija.
PATIENT: .
