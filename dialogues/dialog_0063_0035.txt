DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise, if you would. My schedule is rather…full.
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Concisely, you say? Right. Well, it's these hiccups. Been going on for… oh, goodness, nearly a week now. Just won't stop. It's not painful, just… annoying, really. And tiring. They come and go, but mostly come these days.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a week as of yesterday, I believe. Tuesday, August 2nd, 2025. I keep track of things, you see. It started right after I had a particularly lovely lunch with my granddaughter, Leilani. Wonderful girl, she is. Though, I don’t imagine the lunch had anything to do with it… unless she slipped something funny into my mango sorbet!
DOCTOR: I seriously doubt your granddaughter tampered with your sorbet, Ms. Sucich. Let’s focus on the hiccups. Have you tried anything to alleviate them?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, of course! Silly of me to even mention Leilani. She’d never! Let me see… I tried holding my breath, like my mother always did. Didn't work. Then I drank a glass of water upside down, that’s what old Man Hemmings swore by. No luck there either. And I even had a spoonful of sugar. Absolutely nothing! Honestly, Doctor, I’m running out of ideas. It's just… hic… there.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, I’ve been a bit… tired, I suppose. But I am 86, Doctor! A bit of tiredness is to be expected, isn’t it? No fever, no cough, no pain anywhere. My appetite is good, thankfully. And… oh! Now that you mention it, I have had a little bit of indigestion after meals. Nothing major, just a little… burbles… you know? Like something’s moving around in there.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Just a few things. I take Lisinopril for my blood pressure – 10 milligrams, once a day. And Vitamin D, because the doctor said my levels were low. Oh, and a baby aspirin every other day, just to be safe. And… that’s it, I believe. Though, I did take some antacids last night for the indigestion, but that wasn’t a regular thing.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all, thankfully. Never had one in my life! My mother always said it was because I spent so much time outdoors as a child. Fresh air, she said, was the best medicine. Though, I do get a bit itchy if I wear wool, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? Just a sensitivity, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen. It’s likely just some irritation causing the hiccups, but we’ll rule out anything more serious. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I always trust your judgment. Examination table, you say? Right this way. It's a bit high, but I manage. Just let me know if you need to help me up.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though a bit faint. Lungs are clear. Are you experiencing any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness at all, Doctor. Not here, not anywhere. It just feels… normal, I suppose. Like my usual tummy. Though, sometimes it gurgles, you know? But that’s nothing new. I eat a lot of fiber, so… well, things move around a bit. Is everything alright? You seem… serious.
DOCTOR: It's probably just a bit of gas and some esophageal irritation, Ms. Sucich. It’s not uncommon at your age. But to be certain, I’m going to order a chest X-ray to rule out anything unusual. And a blood test to check your electrolyte levels. We need to ensure everything is within normal limits.
PATIENT: Oh, an X-ray and a blood test? Goodness. Is it serious, Doctor? Is something really wrong? I mean, I understand you want to be thorough, but… it’s just hiccups, isn’t it? I thought you said gas and irritation. I do hope it's not too much trouble. I don’t like hospitals much, you know. Too many beeps and… well, it's depressing.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard precaution, Ms. Sucich. Routine. It's highly unlikely there's anything serious, but we must rule out all possibilities. The tests will take just a few minutes. And I assure you, it's not a hospital – just a quick visit to the lab downstairs. I'll write the orders now.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Routine, you say? Yes, I understand. Always best to be safe. A quick visit to the lab downstairs… that sounds manageable. Though, I do hope they have a comfortable chair. My bones aren’t what they used to be, you know. And… would the results take long? I have lunch with Leilani again next week, and I wouldn't want to miss it.
DOCTOR: The lab should be able to process the results within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse call you with the findings. In the meantime, try avoiding carbonated beverages and large meals. And if the hiccups persist or worsen, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. No carbonated drinks, large meals… alright. I can manage that. 24-48 hours… that’s not too bad. And contact the office if they worsen. Yes, I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I suppose I’ll go downstairs now and get these tests done. Hopefully, it’s just gas. Thank you again. And tell your nurse to call me… Leilani’s lunch is very important, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sucich. I'll make a note of that. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
