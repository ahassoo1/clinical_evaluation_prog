DOCTOR: Good morning, Lacreasha. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, my nails. They just… look funny. Not good funny, just… different. I don’t really do doctor stuff much, so I don’t know what to tell you. They changed, okay? I noticed it a couple weeks ago, maybe? Something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, “changed” is a good start. Can you describe what you mean by different?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… they’re kinda… bumpy now? And the color… it's not the normal pink, ya know? More… yellowish. And one of 'em feels kinda thick. Not painful, just… there. I don't paint 'em or nothin', so it's not like a polish thing. Just… nails. I don't understand why nails would change, honestly. It’s silly.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Lacreasha. Nails can change, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Bumpy and yellowish discoloration, with thickening in one nail… okay. Let’s take a closer look. Could you please extend your hands, palms up?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Honestly, it’s probably nothing. I just… I don’t like things being different. Makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do see what you mean. There is some discoloration and some texture changes, particularly on this nail here. Does pressing on this nail cause any pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn't hurt hurt. Just… feels a little… firm. Like it’s not as bendy as the others. I dunno. I don't poke at my nails much, so I don't really know what bendy is. Is this something bad? I really don’t want to lose a nail. My auntie… she had a problem with her toes once and had to… well, it wasn’t pretty.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know it's not painful. And we'll certainly work to avoid anything like your auntie experienced. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but the changes you’re describing could be a few different things. It could be a fungal infection, something called nail psoriasis, or less commonly, other conditions. To get a better idea, I’d like to take a small sample from under the nail to send to the lab for testing. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: A… sample? Like, cut it? Oh, no. No, I don’t like that. That sounds… awful. I don’t do needles or cutting. I just want to know if it’s serious. Can't you just… tell me? Is it gonna fall off? Because I really need my nails. I… I do some things. Doesn’t matter what things, but I need them.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Lacreasha. It's perfectly reasonable to be anxious about that. The sample we'd take is very small – just a tiny scraping from under the nail. It doesn’t usually cause any pain, and it's the best way to determine the cause of the changes. However, if you’re absolutely not comfortable with that, we can explore other options. We could try a topical antifungal medication as a first step, and see if that helps. It won’t give us a definitive diagnosis, but it might resolve the issue if it is a fungal infection. But without knowing for sure, it could take a long time to work, and might not be effective if it’s something else. Would you prefer to try the medication first?
PATIENT: Medication sounds… better. Less poking. Is it like a polish? I hope it doesn’t smell bad. My neighbor… she uses something for her feet and the whole house smells like… vinegar. It’s awful. And does it take a long time? I got things to do, ya know? I can’t be sitting around waiting for nails.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a topical medication, usually a polish-like solution that you apply to the affected nail. And thankfully, it doesn't smell like vinegar! Most of them are odorless, or have a very faint smell that dissipates quickly. It typically takes several months to see significant improvement – usually around six to twelve months, as nails grow slowly. You'll need to apply it consistently, as directed on the packaging, and sometimes we’ll need to trim the nail to help the medication penetrate. We can also discuss some preventative measures to avoid spreading any potential infection, like keeping your nails dry and avoiding artificial nails. How does that sound as a plan?
PATIENT: Okay. Months… that’s a long time. But better than cutting. So… just paint it on? Like a regular nail polish? And keep it dry. I can do dry. I don’t really wear those fake nails anyway. They look silly. And no vinegar smell? Good. Okay, I guess that’s a plan. What kind of polish is it? And where do I get it? Is it expensive? I’m on Medicare, ya know.
DOCTOR: Yes, you apply it like a regular nail polish, once or twice a week as directed. It's called ciclopirox, and it's an antifungal medication. Let me see… Fortunately, Medicare does cover ciclopirox for onychomycosis when prescribed by a doctor. I'll write you a prescription for it, and you can get it filled at your local pharmacy. There is usually a copay, depending on your specific Medicare plan, but it shouldn’t be too expensive. I’ll also give you a handout with instructions on how to apply it and what to expect. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Copay… okay. I think I can manage a copay. Pharmacy… yes, I know the pharmacy. It's down the street. Handout… good. I like handouts. Less remembering. Will it… change the color of my nail? I don’t want a weird color. I don't really do colors. And does it… hurt? When you put it on? I don’t like pain. Especially not on my nails. They're important, remember?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Ciclopirox can sometimes cause a slight discoloration of the nail, but it’s usually temporary and fades as the new, healthy nail grows in. It’s typically a yellowish or brownish tint, but it's not usually very noticeable. As for pain, no, it shouldn't cause any pain. Some people may experience mild irritation or dryness around the nail, but it's usually minimal. I recommend applying a moisturizing cream after each application to help prevent that. Here’s the prescription and the handout. It has all the information you need, including instructions on application, potential side effects, and what to expect. If you experience any significant irritation or discomfort, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Okay. No pain is good. And not too noticeable… I can probably handle yellowish. I don't like anything bright. I think that’s all. I just wanted to get it checked out. You know, make sure it wasn’t something terrible. My auntie… well, nevermind. Thanks. You were… helpful. Not scary at all. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lacreasha. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all as you're using the medication. Have a good day, and please take care.
