DOCTOR: Talofa lava, Deloris. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, hello Doctor... Kimm, was it? Right. Well, it's about a letter. A letter I need for… a pet, you see. Honestly, all this paperwork these days. It’s just… a bit much, don’t you think? I just need something saying I’m allowed to have one. Is that what you do here? Write letters? Because I really don’t remember what the lady on the phone said exactly. Everything is a blur.
DOCTOR: Yes, Deloris, Kimm is correct. And it sounds like you need a letter verifying your fitness to own a pet – sometimes called an emotional support animal letter, or something similar?
PATIENT: Emotional... what now? Look, I just want to be able to keep my dog. A lovely little thing, really. Very well-behaved, mostly. I don't need all these fancy names for it. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do, you know? And honestly, I can't say I remember why I needed a letter in the first place. My ex-husband probably. He always made things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, Deloris, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like this letter might be related to housing or travel restrictions with your dog. We can certainly figure that out. It's common to need documentation for those situations. To help me understand what’s required, and to make sure I can write the appropriate letter, let’s talk a little bit about why you think you need it. And perhaps, tell me about your dog?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Well, I think it’s for the apartment building. They suddenly started being very strict about pets, after I moved in. Honestly, it's ridiculous. I had Buster before they even thought about changing the rules. He's a terrier mix, small, fluffy, doesn't shed much. Very sweet, unless the postman comes. Then he gets… enthusiastic. I don't know. I just want them to leave me alone. My ex-husband probably complained to them, he always did. Does that make any sense? It’s all so frustrating. I wish I could just remember what the rules are exactly. They sent a notice, I think. Or maybe it was an email. Honestly, I'm terrible with paperwork.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Deloris. It sounds like the apartment building changed their pet policy and you’re trying to ensure Buster is still allowed to stay with you. And it's understandably frustrating when policies change after you've already settled in. To make sure I have a clear picture, and to write a letter that’s helpful, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. It's standard practice when considering an emotional support animal, to ensure it's appropriate for you. We'll just cover a few things. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – physical or mental health?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that's… a bit personal, isn't it? Look, I’ve been a bit stressed lately, okay? Dealing with the apartment, and everything with… him. But “diagnosed”? I don't know. I went to a therapist for a little while, years ago, after the divorce. But it was just talking, really. Nothing serious. My blood pressure is a bit high, sometimes. And my knees ache. Is that what you mean? Honestly, I don’t like doctors much. They always poke and prod. And they never seem to listen. Is this going to affect Buster? Because if it is, that's just… unkind.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Deloris, and you’re right to ask. We only need to cover what's relevant. I promise, we won’t poke and prod unless absolutely necessary. Knowing you saw a therapist previously is helpful, and your blood pressure and knees are good to know for overall health, but not necessarily related to this letter. When you saw the therapist, were they treating you for anxiety, depression, or anything else specific?
PATIENT: Oh… Honestly, I can’t really remember. It was a long time ago. It was just after… everything. He was very controlling, my ex-husband. Always criticizing, making me feel… inadequate. So, I went to talk to someone. She was nice enough, but I don't recall the specifics. We talked about… life, I suppose. And him. A lot about him. I mostly remember feeling exhausted all the time. And then the bills started piling up, and I just… stopped going. It didn’t seem to help much anyway. Truly, I haven’t thought about it in years. Are you sure this is necessary? Is Buster in trouble? I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Deloris, it sounds like you went through a very difficult time, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It's perfectly alright if you don't recall the specific diagnosis or treatment details. To be certain, and to write the most helpful letter for you and Buster, let me ask a few questions about how you're feeling now. Do you currently experience feelings of anxiety or depression?
PATIENT: Oh… Well, now that you mention it… I do get a bit… restless. Especially at night. I toss and turn, worrying about things. Bills, mostly. And the apartment building. And whether the postman will try to deliver a package when Buster is outside. It's silly, I know. And I get… irritated easily. Very easily. Small things set me off. Like when the grocery store is out of my favorite tea. Or when the television remote is missing. My ex-husband used to… well, never mind. It’s just… life. Does that count as “anxiety”? Honestly, everyone feels like that sometimes, don't they? I just don’t want to lose Buster. He’s the only one who doesn’t complain.
DOCTOR: Yes, Deloris, those feelings – restlessness, worry, and irritability – can certainly be signs of anxiety. And it’s perfectly normal to experience anxiety, especially when dealing with stressful situations. One more question, if you don’t mind. Do you feel like Buster provides you with comfort or support when you’re feeling anxious or stressed?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely! He's a lifesaver, that dog. When I'm feeling particularly low, or worried about something, I just sit with him and… stroke his fur. It calms me down immediately. He doesn’t judge, you know? He just looks at me with those big, brown eyes, and everything feels a little bit better. Honestly, I don’t know what I’d do without him. He follows me everywhere. Even to the bathroom! It’s rather embarrassing, actually. But he gets anxious if I leave him alone for too long. We’re very attached, you see? He’s more than just a pet, he’s… a companion. A very fluffy, enthusiastic companion. So, yes, he provides a great deal of comfort. I really need to keep him. Please. Is that enough? Will that help get this letter?
DOCTOR: Yes, Deloris, that is more than enough. It sounds like Buster provides you with significant emotional support, and that's very important. Based on what you’ve shared, I am comfortable writing a letter stating that you benefit from having Buster as a companion animal, and that he provides you with emotional support. To be thorough, and to ensure everything is accurate, I would like to do a quick physical exam – just to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Another exam? Really? I suppose… if you have to. But please be quick, okay? And don’t poke too much. My knees are acting up already, and I really dislike those cold instruments. Is there anything I need to do? Should I… take off my shoes? I always feel so vulnerable at the doctor's. Honestly, I just want this over with. And to get this letter. Is it going to be a long letter? Will it have lots of fancy medical words? I just want them to leave Buster alone.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Deloris. We’ll keep it quick and as comfortable as possible. No need to take off your shoes. And I'll use a warm stethoscope if that helps. I promise I will keep the medical language to a minimum. I’ll write it in plain terms, focusing on the support Buster provides. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your blood pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Fine. Just… hurry, okay? And try not to startle Buster. He’s over there, by the chair. He gets nervous around strangers. Honestly, all this fuss over a little dog. But he means a lot to me. Go ahead, I suppose. But gently, please. And no poking! I really, really don't like being poked.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear, Deloris. And your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which is common when feeling stressed, but nothing to be overly concerned about at the moment. Now, let me just write this letter for you. It should take about 10-15 minutes. Would you like a glass of water while I work?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… good, I suppose. Clear lungs are good, right? A glass of water would be lovely, actually. My throat is a bit dry from all the talking. Honestly, I never thought getting a letter would be so complicated. It's ridiculous! And all because of that apartment building. Honestly. But thank you, Doctor. For not poking too much. And for listening. And hopefully, this letter will finally get them to leave Buster alone. Please, make it sound convincing, okay? They’re very strict.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Deloris. I’ve written a letter detailing the emotional support that Buster provides, and emphasizing how he helps manage your stress and anxiety. I've kept the language plain and focused on your experiences. Please read it over to make sure it accurately reflects everything we discussed. Do you have any questions, or is there anything you’d like me to change before you take it?
PATIENT: Oh! Let me see… “Provides significant emotional support… alleviates symptoms of stress and anxiety… improves overall well-being…” Hmm. Yes, that sounds about right. Yes, very good. It does mention Buster's… enthusiasm, doesn’t it? That’s good. They need to know he's a spirited little dog. No, I don’t think I need any changes. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Truly. And surprisingly… kind. I really appreciate it. I hope this works. I really, really hope this works. Please… send me the bill, okay? And thank you again. For everything. I think… I think I’ll go home now, and give Buster a big hug.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Deloris. I'm glad I could help. And please do give Buster a big hug for me. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a lovely day, and take care.
