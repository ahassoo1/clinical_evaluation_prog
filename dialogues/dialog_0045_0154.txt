DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease, welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Billman, is it? Yes, well, it’s… a problem. A little problem with… going to the bathroom. It keeps happening, you see. Comes back. Again and again. I don’t… I don’t really know what it is, but it’s bothersome. Very bothersome. Can we… can we get this over with quickly?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wease, we’ll get to the bottom of it. “A problem with going to the bathroom,” you say, and it’s recurring. Okay. To help me understand, can you tell me exactly what’s happening when you go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Exactly… well, it burns. When I try to go, it… stings. And I feel like I have to go all the time, even when I just went. It’s… unpleasant. Very unpleasant. I don’t… I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A while ago. Is that… helpful? I truly don't recall much detail, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination, and frequent urges… right. And you said it’s been going on for “a while.” Okay, let’s try to narrow that down. Has this been a gradual worsening, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh… suddenly? Gradual? I… honestly, I don't know. It just is. One day, it was there. One day, it wasn’t so bad. Now it’s… back again. I truly can’t pinpoint a time, Doctor. My memory… it's not what it used to be, you see. Is there a question I can answer easily? Perhaps something simpler?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, no need to worry about pinpointing exact dates. We'll work with what we have. Let’s try this: Is there any pain between bathroom trips?
PATIENT: Pain… between? Oh. Hmm. No, not really. Just… the burning when I go. Sometimes a little ache… low down. But not constant. It's not a… sharp pain. More like… a dull feeling. A bothersome dull feeling. I do hope this isn’t taking too long, Doctor. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain between trips, just burning during and a dull ache sometimes. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh dear. I… I don’t think so. I haven’t… looked, exactly. I try not to. It’s… unpleasant. Is that a sign of something serious, Doctor? You’re making me nervous. I just want this to be over with, truly. I'm not one for dwelling on… bodily things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease. It's alright. We need to rule things out. Since you haven't specifically seen blood, that's good. Now, have you had a fever, chills, or any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Fever…? No, I don’t think so. I haven't felt warm, not that I recall. Chills… perhaps a little cold sometimes, but it’s been warm lately, you see. And back pain… well, my back always aches a little. Old age, Doctor. It just does. I'm not sure that's related. Is there a test you can do? A quick test? Please?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick urinalysis. It will help us determine if there's an infection, and if so, what kind. It's a simple test, we just need a sample of your urine. I'll have my assistant, Maria, come in and show you how to collect it. It's best if you can provide a “clean catch” midstream sample, which means you start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream, and finish urinating. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh. A sample. Yes, I suppose. A “clean catch”? Midstream… you mean… not the first part, and not the last part? Just the middle? That sounds… awkward. Very awkward. Is there really no other way? I’m not… comfortable with this, Doctor. Honestly. But… if it gets me out of here quicker… yes. Maria, you say? Very well. Just… please be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wease, just the midstream portion. Maria will guide you. It’s standard procedure. It will take just a few minutes. I'll step out and let you collect the sample in privacy. Maria will bring it to me when she’s ready. Let me know if you have any trouble. I'll be right outside.
PATIENT: Very well. Quickly, please. I trust Maria is… efficient. Yes. Just… hurry. .
