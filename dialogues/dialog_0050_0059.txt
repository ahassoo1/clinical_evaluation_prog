DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what fully brings me here. My husband, he says my speech has been… off. Slurred, he called it. I haven’t really noticed it myself, but he insisted I come get it checked. It’s all a bit vague, truthfully.
DOCTOR: I see. It's often difficult to self-detect subtle changes in one's own speech. It's good that your husband brought this to your attention. “Off,” as you say, can mean many things. Could you elaborate on what he specifically noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. He said… words are getting muddled, sometimes. Like I’m not finishing them properly. Or… like I’m speaking very slowly, even when I don’t feel like I am. It’s hard to explain. He mentioned it happening more often when I’m tired, I think, but honestly, I’ve been quite busy with work lately, so I am often tired. I’m a construction manager, you see, so it's a demanding job. I don’t really recall when it started, specifically. Just… gradually, he noticed.
DOCTOR: Construction management, a physically and mentally strenuous profession indeed. And this has been ongoing for… how long, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear… approximately? That’s a difficult one. Perhaps… a few months, maybe? It's really hard to say. Everything feels a bit of a blur lately with the projects I’m overseeing. I’m sorry, I truly wish I could be more precise. I don't keep track of things like that very well. It hasn’t interfered with my work too much, thankfully. I just… get a little more frustrated when I have to repeat myself sometimes.
DOCTOR: Very well. Frustration is a significant symptom in and of itself. Now, let’s move on to other areas. Have you noticed any difficulty with other aspects of communication – understanding what people say, reading, or writing?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can understand people perfectly fine, I think. And reading and writing… I do reports for work all the time, and haven’t had any trouble with those. Actually… now that you mention it, sometimes I do have a bit of trouble finding the right word when I’m writing. Not often, though. It’s like it’s on the tip of my tongue, but I just can’t quite grasp it. But I always manage to get it sorted out eventually. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: It could be. A subtle difficulty with word finding, even if infrequent, is worth noting. Now, Ms. Swaby, to rule out any other potential contributing factors, let’s review your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a bit of a tough question. I haven’t been to the doctor much over the years, truthfully. I'm generally quite healthy. Let me think… I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. Nothing major. And… I broke my wrist once, years ago, when I was younger, but it healed perfectly fine. I had a surgery for it, of course. Other than that… I’m really drawing a blank, Doctor. I don’t really remember anything significant. I'm married, and I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Medicare is helpful information. A broken wrist with surgery… that was how long ago, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… goodness, it must have been… twenty years ago, maybe more? When I was in my early twenties. It was a silly thing, really. I was riding a bicycle and fell off. It wasn’t a serious fall, but I fractured it and needed an operation to set it properly. It’s all very hazy, Doctor. I was much younger then, and frankly, I don’t dwell on things like that. It healed well, and I have full use of my hand now.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she’s still alive, thankfully, but she's quite elderly now, living back in Jamaica. She's generally healthy, though, for her age. I don’t see her often. My father… he passed away several years ago. He… had some heart problems, I believe. And… my brother, he lives in America, but I haven’t spoken to him in quite some time. He had… some issues with his memory, a few years back, but I’m not sure of the details. It wasn’t anything major, as far as I know. I’m sorry, I'm not very good with details about my family. It’s been a long time since I’ve been in close contact with them.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, Ms. Swaby, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. I find it quite unpleasant, actually. And… my husband doesn’t smoke either. We both try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as our jobs allow. Though, with construction management, there’s not a lot of opportunity for… well, for much of anything, really. It's demanding work.
DOCTOR: I understand. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, um… occasionally. We might have a glass of wine with dinner on a weekend, perhaps. Nothing excessive, Doctor. Just… a social drink, you know? My husband and I, we don’t really drink very often at all. It’s not really something we enjoy, to be honest. We prefer… tea, usually. A nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Swaby, before I proceed to a brief physical examination, are you currently taking any medications, either prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Not at all. I don't take any medications. I try to avoid them if possible. I believe in letting my body heal naturally, you see. Apart from the occasional pain reliever for a headache, perhaps. But nothing regularly. Just… when needed. I'm quite fortunate, I think, in that I don't often need anything.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Swaby, I'd like to perform a brief neurological examination. This will involve assessing your reflexes, coordination, and strength. It's a standard procedure, and should not be uncomfortable. May I proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, of course. That sounds… perfectly fine. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I'm a bit nervous, I suppose, but I’ll do my best to cooperate. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific. I’m a bit clumsy, sometimes, so please bear with me.
DOCTOR: Now, Ms. Swaby, please focus on this point. Findings are within normal limits. Now, I'm going to assess your pupillary response to light. Please continue to focus straight ahead. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Now, I will test your extraocular movements. Please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Movements are full and smooth. No nystagmus noted. Now, I will assess your facial strength. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright, Doctor? It feels a bit… stiff, perhaps. I haven't really noticed it before, but now that you ask… it does feel a bit uneven, doesn’t it? I'm not sure what that means. I've just always smiled like this, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, a slight asymmetry is noted. Not alarming, but worth documenting. Now, can you raise your eyebrows, close your eyes tightly, and puff out your cheeks?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that right? It’s a bit… difficult, actually. My cheeks feel… tight. I haven't really paid much attention to how my cheeks work before, I suppose. It’s a bit strange, being examined like this.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is sufficient. Now, let's assess your tongue. Please stick out your tongue for me. The tongue is midline, no fasciculations noted. Now, open your mouth and say "ah." Vocal cord function appears normal. Now, I will test your strength in your arms and legs. Please extend your arms straight out in front of you. Now, push down against my hands. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Now, please extend your legs straight out in front of you. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Now, I will test your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, I will test your gait. Please stand up and walk a few steps for me. Gait is steady, no significant abnormalities noted. Now, please sit back down.
PATIENT: Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem… very focused. I hope there's nothing serious wrong. I haven't been feeling particularly unwell, just a bit tired, as I mentioned. It’s just the speech, my husband says… Is it something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Ms. Swaby, the neurological examination revealed some minor asymmetries, specifically with facial strength and cheek inflation. However, these are subtle findings, and do not necessarily indicate a serious underlying condition. Strength and reflexes are within normal limits. Now, the slight asymmetry in facial strength, coupled with your husband’s report of slurred speech, warrants further investigation. Given the gradual onset and the lack of other significant neurological deficits, my initial concern is a possible cranial nerve involvement, perhaps related to early-stage demyelination, or, less likely, a focal muscular weakness. To rule out more serious possibilities, such as stroke or a central nervous system lesion, I would like to order an MRI of the brain with and without contrast. This will provide a detailed view of your brain structure and identify any potential abnormalities. I will also order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying metabolic disorders. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: MRI… and blood tests? Oh dear. That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Demyelination… what does that even mean? And what about… stroke? You said stroke. I haven't been feeling unwell, just tired. Is it possible it’s… nothing? Perhaps just stress from work? I’m a construction manager, you see, and it’s a very demanding job. I don’t want to go through all these tests if it’s just something minor. But… if you think it’s necessary… then I suppose I will. What will these tests involve, exactly? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Ms. Swaby, I understand your concerns. It is important to emphasize that these tests are being ordered to rule out more serious conditions, not necessarily to confirm them. Demyelination refers to the breakdown of the protective covering around the nerve fibers, which can disrupt nerve signals. In many cases, it is benign and treatable. Stroke, while a possibility, is less likely given the gradual onset of your symptoms and the absence of other neurological deficits, such as weakness or numbness. The MRI involves lying still inside a large magnet for approximately 30-45 minutes. It is painless, but some patients experience mild claustrophobia. The blood tests are relatively simple and involve drawing a small sample of blood from your arm. The results typically take 2-3 business days to return. I will write you a referral for the MRI and blood tests. The receptionist will schedule the appointments for you. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activities and getting adequate rest. I also suggest avoiding alcohol and caffeine, as these can exacerbate neurological symptoms. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for one week after you have had the tests completed to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… 30-45 minutes in a magnet… that sounds… unsettling. I’ve never had an MRI before. And no alcohol or caffeine… that will be difficult. I suppose I understand the need for caution, Doctor. It’s just… all these tests seem rather overwhelming. Is it possible to get a second opinion? Perhaps from another neurologist? I just want to be absolutely certain that we’re doing the right thing. I don't want to waste any time, but I also want to be sure I’m getting the best possible care.
DOCTOR: Ms. Swaby, a second opinion is always your prerogative. While I am confident in my assessment and recommendations, I understand your desire for reassurance. I can certainly provide you with a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected neurologist at City General Hospital. However, please be aware that scheduling an appointment with a specialist may take several weeks, and may delay the diagnostic process. I will also provide you with a detailed summary of your medical history and examination findings to share with Dr. Vance. In the meantime, I still recommend proceeding with the MRI and blood tests as scheduled. These tests will provide valuable information that can aid in the diagnostic process, regardless of whether you choose to seek a second opinion. The results will be available for Dr. Vance to review as well. Would you like me to write a referral for Dr. Vance now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. A referral to Dr. Vance would be very much appreciated. It puts my mind at ease, knowing I have another opinion available. And… yes, let’s proceed with the MRI and blood tests as well. It’s better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with my concerns. I appreciate your understanding. I suppose I should go and speak to the receptionist now, to schedule those appointments.
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist is prepared to assist you. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns. We will schedule a follow-up appointment once the test results are available. Good day, Ms. Swaby.
