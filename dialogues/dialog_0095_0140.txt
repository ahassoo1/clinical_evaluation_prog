DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… rather embarrassing. It’s a soreness in my mouth. A white coating, you see. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it's not going away. I haven't much time, so if we could be quick, that would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. A soreness in your mouth with a white coating… Alright. Can you tell me a little more about the soreness?
PATIENT: It’s… uncomfortable. Not terribly painful, mind you. More of a burning sensation, especially after I eat. And it makes it difficult to… well, to enjoy my food. I eat a proper diet, Doctor. Very proper. Not like some people I know. It’s just… irritating. I've been rinsing with mouthwash, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Burning sensation, worse with eating, and doesn’t improve with mouthwash. Is this coating all over your mouth, or is it localized to specific areas?
PATIENT: It’s mostly on my tongue, Doctor. And the insides of my cheeks, a little. Not on the roof of my mouth, thankfully. And… well, it’s rather unsightly. I certainly don’t want my wife to notice. She worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily on the tongue and inner cheeks. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it something new?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… a few weeks now, I suppose. At first, I thought it was just something I ate. Perhaps a bit of spice, you know? But it hasn’t gone away. And I assure you, Doctor, I don’t indulge in anything too spicy. My stomach wouldn’t allow it. I’ve tried a few things, but nothing seems to be working. Honestly, I’m quite disappointed in the lack of… improvement.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few weeks. And no improvement with any home remedies. Do you notice any changes in your taste?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Everything tastes… dull. Bland, even. I had a perfectly good steak the other night, and it had almost no flavor. Which is ridiculous, of course. It was a prime cut. A very expensive prime cut. I can’t imagine what my wife would say if I told her it tasted like nothing. She has a discerning palate, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, loss of taste along with the soreness and white coating. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Perfectly normal temperature, I assure you. I take good care of myself. No other symptoms, just this… unpleasantness in my mouth. It’s rather inconvenient, if I’m honest. I have several important meetings next week, and I certainly don’t want to be distracted by a sore mouth.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or other symptoms. Let's take a quick look in your mouth, if you don’t mind. Just need you to open wide and say "ah."
PATIENT: Very well. But please be quick about it, Doctor. I have a schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some white patches on your tongue and the insides of your cheeks. They don't look deeply embedded, but they are definitely present. No obvious signs of trauma or open sores. Your gums look healthy, and your tongue doesn't appear swollen. Let me feel your neck glands… No significant swelling there either. Alright. It could be a few things. It sounds like it might be oral thrush – a fungal infection – or possibly some irritation from something. Have you used any new mouthwashes, toothpastes, or other oral hygiene products recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve used the same products for years. A reliable brand, you understand. I wouldn't risk experimenting with new things. My wife handles the shopping, and she knows what I like. She's very particular about these things. So, is it serious? I’d like a straight answer, Doctor. And quickly, if you please. I have clients waiting.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound like anything immediately life-threatening, Mr. Schieber, but we need to figure out what's causing it to rule out anything more serious. Given your history and the appearance, thrush is a strong possibility. To confirm, I'd like to do a quick swab of the affected area. It's a painless test – just a little cotton swab. We send it to the lab, and they can tell us for sure if it's a fungal infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Honestly, Doctor. Is that really necessary? It sounds… undignified. And I haven’t the time for lab tests and waiting for results. Can’t you just tell me what it is? It sounds like thrush, you said so yourself. Perhaps a strong mouthwash will suffice? I really must get back to my office.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Schieber. However, to prescribe the right treatment, we need a definitive diagnosis. Thrush and other oral conditions can look similar, and using the wrong medication could actually worsen the problem. A swab takes just a few seconds. As for waiting, the results usually come back within 48 hours. In the meantime, to be cautious, I can prescribe an antifungal mouthwash. But it's important to understand that this is just a temporary measure until we have the lab results. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well. A temporary measure. But I expect quick results, Doctor. Forty-eight hours, no longer. And I trust this mouthwash won't interfere with my schedule. What are the instructions? And please be brief.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write you a prescription for nystatin oral suspension. You’ll swish 10 milliliters around in your mouth for 15 minutes, four times a day, after meals, then spit it out. Do not swallow it. Continue this for seven days, even if your symptoms improve. I'll also give you a note for the lab, and we’ll call you with the results as soon as we have them. If your symptoms worsen significantly – if you develop a fever, difficulty swallowing, or severe pain – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None whatsoever. I’ve always been quite healthy, you see. So, just the mouthwash for seven days, and await your call. Very well. I suppose that will have to do. Thank you, Doctor. I trust I won’t be kept waiting long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. I’ve printed out the prescription and the lab order for you. The lab is just down the hall. Feel free to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor.
