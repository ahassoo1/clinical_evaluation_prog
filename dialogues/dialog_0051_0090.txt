DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, as I understand it, I’m here for a… clearance? Before a surgery. It’s all a little hazy, to be honest. My husband… he handled most of the arrangements. I’m hoping to get everything sorted, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A pre-operative evaluation is a good precaution. It’s common for things to feel a little confusing when arrangements are made by others. Don't worry, we’ll take our time and get everything clarified. To start, could you tell me a little about the surgery you're scheduled for?
PATIENT: You know, that’s… difficult. It has to do with… appearances. With how I look. My husband felt it would be… beneficial. It was a gift, he said. I believe it involves… adjustments. To my face, perhaps? I’m terribly sorry, I truly wish I could be more specific. It was discussed at length, but the details… they just aren’t staying with me.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Mackenzi. It's not uncommon to feel overwhelmed or anxious before a procedure, and details can easily be forgotten. We don’t need to dwell on specifics if you're uncomfortable. Perhaps we can focus on your overall health. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I… I did have a bout of the flu last winter, a rather nasty one, but I recovered fully. My husband always made sure I went to the doctor for check-ups, regular ones. He was very conscientious. I’m not currently taking any medications, either. Though, I do occasionally take something for… sleep. Just when I’m having trouble resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And when you say a sleep aid, do you remember the name of that medication, or roughly how often you use it?
PATIENT: It… it comes in a little purple box, I think. And the pills themselves are white, small and round. I only take it when I absolutely need to. Perhaps once or twice a month? When my mind just won’t quiet down. Honestly, it’s been less frequent since… well, since my husband passed. He always helped me calm my nerves. I can’t recall the name, though. I’m so sorry. It’s right there, on the tip of my tongue…
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. Don't apologize. It's understandable to have trouble recalling details during a difficult time. We can look up any medications you might have filled locally if that would be helpful. Let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I’ve always been very fortunate in that regard. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication I’ve been given. My husband always double-checked before I took anything new, of course. He was incredibly careful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history? I… I suppose I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses. Measles, mumps… things like that. Nothing serious. And as I mentioned before, I had the flu last winter. Other than that… I don't think I’ve ever been hospitalized, or had any major surgeries before this one. I’ve always been quite lucky with my health, to be honest. I really haven't spent much time in a doctor's office.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. I wasn't particularly close to my family, and I don’t know much about their medical history. My mother… she passed away when I was quite young. And I haven’t had contact with my father or siblings since… well, a very long time ago. I truly wish I could be more helpful, Doctor, but I simply don't have that information.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mackenzi. It's not a problem at all. We can proceed without that information for now. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I enjoy a quiet life. I spend a lot of time outdoors, tending to gardens. I find it very therapeutic. My husband and I… we always enjoyed working with plants. Now, I mostly do it on my own. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. I don’t do much strenuous exercise, just light gardening. And I get plenty of rest, when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s very good to know, Mackenzi. Now, to help me get a clearer picture of your current health, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I’ll do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80, your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Ears are clear, nose is unremarkable, throat is clear. Everything seems within normal limits so far, Mackenzi. Do you have any specific concerns or anything you'd like me to pay particular attention to?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing specific. As I said, I haven’t really had much experience with doctors. If you think everything looks alright, then I trust your assessment. Though, now that you mention it… sometimes I feel a little… lightheaded. Just occasionally. It doesn’t last long, and it doesn’t happen very often. I just thought it was… stress, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay. Intermittent lightheadedness is good to know. And how would you describe this lightheadedness?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain. It’s not like I’m going to faint, or anything. It’s just a sort of… wooziness. A feeling like everything is spinning just slightly. And it usually happens when I stand up quickly, I think. Or when I’ve been out in the sun for too long. It passes quickly, as I said. Maybe a minute or two. Is that… something to worry about, Doctor? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being a bother at all, Mackenzi. It's important to share all of your concerns with me. Intermittent lightheadedness, especially when it happens with quick changes in position or after sun exposure, can be caused by a number of things. It could be something as simple as dehydration, or it could be related to your blood pressure. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a few blood tests to check your electrolytes, blood count, and thyroid function. And I’d also like to check your blood pressure while you’re standing up, to see if it drops when you change positions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Blood tests and checking my blood pressure… that’s fine with me. I just want to make sure everything is alright. Perhaps this lightheadedness is just from… everything. The grief, the surgery… it’s all a bit overwhelming. But it’s good to rule things out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Yes, those things can certainly contribute. It’s good to be thorough. Alright, I’ll write the orders for the blood tests now. The lab is just down the hall. And the nurse will check your blood pressure while you’re here. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and figure out the best course of action. In the meantime, I want to mention that given your vague recollection of details regarding the upcoming surgery, and the recent loss of your husband, it might be helpful to speak with a grief counselor or therapist. They can provide support and help you process your feelings. Would you be interested in a referral?
PATIENT: A grief counselor… That’s… a kind thought, Doctor. And perhaps I do need it. It’s just… difficult to think about. It feels strange to talk about it, to delve into everything. My husband always handled things like that. But… yes. If you think it would be helpful, I suppose I could try it. A referral would be… appreciated. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's perfectly alright to feel hesitant. It takes courage to ask for help, and there’s no shame in seeking support. I'll write a referral for you. The nurse will give you the information before you leave. So, to summarize, we’ve discussed your history, conducted a physical exam, and ordered some blood tests. We’re also getting a referral for grief counseling. Once the lab results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your kindness. I trust your judgment, and I’ll wait for the results. Thank you again for your time and attention. I think I’ll just go and have the blood tests done now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mackenzi. The nurse will be right with you to guide you to the lab. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was nice meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
