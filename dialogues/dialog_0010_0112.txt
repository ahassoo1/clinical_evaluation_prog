DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve just been… going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, and it’s quite disruptive, to be frank. I’m not entirely sure when it started, honestly. It feels like it’s been creeping up on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's perfectly alright to discuss these things; it’s what I’m here for. “A lot” can mean different things to different people. Could you give me a rough estimate of how many times you’re going to the bathroom in a typical day, compared to, say, a month ago?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. A month ago? I suppose… normally, perhaps four or five times a day? Now… it feels like every couple of hours. Maybe six, seven… even eight times, I think. It’s hard to keep track, truthfully. I mostly notice it’s interfering with… well, everything, really. It's quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Eight times a day is definitely a significant change. And I appreciate you being so open about how it’s impacting your daily life. To help me understand what might be going on, can you describe what happens when you need to go?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… pain, exactly. More of an urgent feeling. Like I have to go, and quickly. It comes on rather suddenly, sometimes. Other times, it’s a slow build-up, but it still feels… insistent. It doesn't really hurt during, just… a strong need to empty my bladder. And sometimes, even after I do go, I feel like I haven’t emptied it completely, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. That feeling of incomplete emptying is important information. Do you notice any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, not pain, no. And definitely no burning. It’s… just the urgency, and that lingering feeling afterwards. It's not a comfortable feeling, but it’s not painful, if that clarifies anything. I haven’t noticed any blood either, thankfully. It’s just… a lot of trips. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no burning, no blood – that’s good. Has there been any change in your fluid intake lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not intentionally. I usually drink a couple of glasses of water throughout the day, perhaps a cup of tea in the afternoon. I haven't been drinking more than usual, I don’t believe. Now that you mention it… perhaps I’ve been a little more stressed lately, with… things. Could that have something to do with it? I really don't know.
DOCTOR: Stress can absolutely play a role. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like a urinary tract infection, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a bit difficult to recall, truthfully. I’ve… not been very good at keeping track of those things. I had a bout of… something, years ago, with my kidneys, I think? I was quite young. It required a stay in hospital, but I don’t recall the specifics. As for diabetes… I don’t believe so. My doctor… well, my previous doctor, never mentioned anything. I was divorced a few years back, and everything sort of… became a blur after that. I'm terribly sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can work with what you remember. A previous kidney issue is helpful information. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t taken much in the way of medication in recent years. A pain reliever now and then, for a headache, perhaps. But nothing regularly, and nothing that I recall having an adverse reaction to. I’m generally quite healthy, or at least, I thought I was. Before this, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just… water and tea, as I mentioned. No vitamins, no supplements, no anything. I prefer to… avoid medication if I can, honestly. I’m not very good with those sorts of things. I tend to… forget to take them. It’s a terrible habit, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do any of your close family members—parents, siblings—have a history of kidney problems, bladder issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… tricky. My mother passed away when I was quite young, and I wasn’t very close to my father. I don't recall him ever mentioning any health issues, but honestly, we didn't discuss those sorts of things much. I have an older brother, but we’ve lost touch. It’s been years since I’ve spoken to him. I have no idea what his medical history looks like. I'm terribly sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I'm just not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. MacVittie. You've given me a lot of helpful information already. Finally, just a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine at a special occasion, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I lead a very… quiet life, truthfully. Not much excitement, I’m afraid. I prefer a good book and a cup of tea, if you don't mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for being so honest with me. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll need to check your abdomen, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd also like to do a quick urine sample. This will help us rule out any infections or other issues. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A urine sample… yes, of course. I suppose I should have anticipated that. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement completely. Just… tell me if anything feels… unusual. I'm a bit nervous, if you don't mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll excuse me for just a moment, I'll prepare the lab slip for the urine sample. Please use the bathroom when you are ready and collect a sample in the cup provided. Once you’ve collected it, just bring it back to me, and we’ll proceed with the abdominal exam. I will try to make it as comfortable as possible.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. I'll be right back.
