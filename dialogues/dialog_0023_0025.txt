DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Laury is good. I… I want to know more about where my family come from. I hear you can do a test with spit, to find out? About… ancestors, yeah? I’m Marshallese, but I want to know where before that, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. You're interested in genetic ancestry testing. While I am a physician specializing in family medicine, and can discuss your overall health concerns, providing ancestry testing isn’t precisely within my scope of practice. It's more… recreational, shall we say. However, I can order the test for you if you wish, and we can discuss the results in the context of your health – if any genetic predispositions are revealed. Before we proceed, though, are you experiencing any health issues that prompted this request?
PATIENT: Recreational? Not really health, no. Just… curious. Always been curious. My grandpa, he tell stories. Stories about boats, and islands… but he gone now, and I forget some. I just want to know… for sure. No problems, really. Little achy sometimes, old age, you know? But nothing to worry you about. Just… the family. Would the test tell me about family?
DOCTOR: “Family,” as in genealogical history, or potential genetic predispositions to certain conditions?
PATIENT: Both, I think. I want to know who my family was, long ago. And… maybe if there’s something I should know, for my health. Like… if there’s a sickness that runs in the family, maybe? I don’t know much about these things. Just… information, Doctor. Information is good.
DOCTOR: Very well. We can order a genetic ancestry test that includes a health component. It will analyze your DNA for origins and potential risks for certain diseases. However, I must caution you that these tests are not foolproof. They provide probabilities, not certainties. And the health information is limited; it won’t screen for everything. First, let's review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Doctor says my blood pressure is good when I go for check-up. Just… old. I have Medicare, is that okay? For the test, I mean. Will it pay?
DOCTOR: Medicare may cover a portion of the test if it's deemed medically necessary – specifically, if we are looking for genetic markers that would influence treatment decisions. The ancestry portion, however, is unlikely to be covered. We'll need to submit a pre-authorization request. Before we proceed with that, and to properly document everything, let’s go over your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No medicines, Doctor. Not regularly. Sometimes I take something for the achy, but just when it’s bad. From the store, you know? Not a doctor’s medicine. And… sometimes a vitamin D, in the winter. But not always. I mostly just eat fish and try to sleep. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had one. I eat everything. Fish, fruit, bread… everything. My wife, she was the one with allergies. Poor thing. But I'm okay. Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let's briefly discuss your family history. Besides your wife, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… My grandpa, he had trouble breathing. Old age, I think. And my auntie, she got sick… a long time ago. I think it was the sugar sickness, diabetes? But she lived far away, on another island. I don’t know much. Everyone gone now, mostly. It’s hard to remember, Doctor. It was a long time ago. My wife’s family, they had… heart trouble. But that was her side. I don't know about my family, really. Just the breathing trouble with my grandpa.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of breathing trouble in your grandfather and heart trouble on your wife’s side. We'll document that. Now, have you ever had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had one. And no hospital, not really. Just when my wife… when she was sick, towards the end. But that wasn’t me being sick. Just visiting. I’ve been lucky, I think. Mostly healthy. Just… old. A little achy sometimes. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. So, to summarize: 85 years old, Marshallese, no known allergies or chronic medical conditions, no surgeries, family history of breathing trouble in your grandfather and heart trouble on your wife’s side. You are interested in pursuing genetic ancestry testing with a health component, understanding that Medicare may not cover the ancestry portion. Before we order the test, I want to perform a brief physical exam – just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s good, Doctor. Sounds good. A check-up is good. I’m ready when you are. Just… take it easy, okay? Old bones.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Please have a seat here. And yes, we will be gentle. Just relax your arm, please. This will just take a moment. 130 over 80… not bad for your age. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and another one… good. Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, slight murmur, likely benign given your age. Now, I'll just take a look at your throat and ears. Open your mouth for me… say "ahhh." Everything looks clear there as well. Any issues with your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: A little trouble with the hearing, Doctor. Especially the high sounds. My wife, she used to tell me to turn the TV down. But it's okay. I get by. And the eyes… not so good for reading small things anymore. But I can see well enough to get around. Everything okay? Did you find anything wrong?
DOCTOR: Mild hearing loss, consistent with age-related changes. Vision also showing some expected decline. Nothing concerning at this time. I'll note that in your chart. Now, let's just check your reflexes and range of motion. Can you squeeze my hand… good. And now, can you lift both your arms above your head?
PATIENT: A little stiff, Doctor. Old age, you know? Not as easy as it used to be. But I can do it. Just… takes a little effort. Everything okay? No need to worry?
DOCTOR: Mild stiffness, consistent with age-related changes and expected wear and tear. No signs of inflammation or acute injury. Everything appears within normal limits for your age. Alright, Mr. Scobie. Physical exam complete. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, you appear to be in relatively good health for your age. We'll proceed with ordering the genetic ancestry test as requested. It will take approximately two weeks to receive the results. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they are available. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Two weeks… I can wait. And a follow-up… yes, please. I want to know what you think. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Now… will the test really tell me where my family came from? Before the Marshall Islands?
DOCTOR: The test can provide insights into your ancestral origins, tracing your lineage back through various populations. However, it's important to remember that these are estimates based on current data, and the further back we go, the less precise the information becomes. It won’t provide a complete historical narrative, but it can offer clues about your family's migration patterns and potential connections to different regions. Now, before you leave, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very well, Doctor. Just… thank you. I’ve been curious about this for a long time. I hope… I hope it tells me something good. I guess I’ll see you in two weeks then?
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Scobie. I hope the test provides you with some interesting insights. Have a good day.
