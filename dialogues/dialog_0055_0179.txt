DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it is… difficult to explain. The words… they don’t come so easy now. It’s like they are… stuck. I forget what I want to say, you know? It’s been happening for a little while now, and it worries me.
DOCTOR: I see. A difficulty with finding the right words, and some forgetfulness…occurring over a period of time. Hmm. Could you elaborate a little on how long this has been happening, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… that is a good question. Not… not a very long time, I don’t think. Maybe… six months? Or was it eight? It is hard to say, truthfully. Things… blur. It started slowly, I recall. Just little things. Forgetting names, mostly. But now… it’s more often, and more… frustrating. I do apologize. I am not good with dates, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. It’s understandable that remembering precise timelines can be difficult. Six to eight months…that is a reasonable timeframe to investigate. And it’s progressed from occasional forgetfulness to…a more consistent struggle with word-finding and recall, you say. To help me better understand, can you give me an example of when this difficulty with words occurs?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… a good way to put it. A “consistent struggle.” It happens… often when I am talking to people. Like now, for example! I know what I want to say, but the word… it hides. Or sometimes, I know the word, but it doesn't feel…right. I’ll say something, and then have to stop and correct myself. Just yesterday, I was trying to tell my neighbor about the flowers in my garden – the… the red ones. And I couldn’t say “roses.” I kept saying… “the prickly bushes.” He looked very confused!
DOCTOR: "Prickly bushes," yes. That is… illustrative. And this occurs frequently in conversation?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Quite frequently. It is… embarrassing, truthfully. I used to be very precise with my language. I worked with… with compensation, benefits… job analysis. Very important to be clear, you know? Now… now I have to think very carefully before I speak. And even then… sometimes the words fail me. It’s not just names, either. It’s everyday things. Table. Chair. You know? Basic words.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anyone noticed this change in your speech or memory, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: Um… well, my neighbor, certainly. He asked if I was feeling alright. And… and the lady at the grocery store. I was trying to pay for my milk, and I couldn’t remember my… my card number. She was very patient, but I could tell she was concerned. I haven’t told my… my family. I don’t want to worry them. My wife… she passed away last year. It's just me now.
DOCTOR: I understand. And to clarify, this difficulty with word retrieval and recall is not associated with any recent head trauma, stroke, or other neurological event that you are aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. No head injuries. No strokes. I… I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. A little arthritis in my knees, but that is all. I do take some… some pills for my blood pressure, but I’ve been on those for years. No… no changes to my medication recently.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you experience any other symptoms alongside this difficulty with language?
PATIENT: Let me think… Um… Sometimes, I feel… a little confused. Not all the time, but sometimes. Like I am… lost in my thoughts. And I’ve been… sleeping more. A lot more, actually. Even during the day. I used to enjoy gardening, reading… now, I just feel tired. And… and a little sad, I suppose. It’s difficult.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, increased sleepiness, occasional confusion…and sadness. Do you have any difficulty with tasks that require concentration or problem-solving?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… a good question. It is getting harder to… to manage things. Paying bills, for example. I used to be very organized. Now, I have to check everything twice, and sometimes even three times. And… and I forget things easily. Like where I put my glasses. Or my keys. It's frustrating, and I worry that it will get worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi. I’d like to perform a brief neurological examination, and a cognitive screening test. This will help me assess your memory, attention, and language skills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I want to understand what is happening, you see. And… and I trust your judgment. Yes, please. Let’s do the… the examination.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please, have a seat here. I will begin with some basic questions, then we will proceed with some physical tests. Please walk for me, Mr. Gyamfi. And try to maintain a normal pace. I will be observing your stride and stability.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. Now, could you please sit back down?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Follow my penlight with your eyes, please. Don't move your head. And now look to the left. And to the right. Very good. Now, could you smile for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. Can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: Um… the current date? Oh, goodness. Let me think. It is… August… …August the… the second? I believe it is August the second. 2025?
DOCTOR: Correct. And can you tell me where we are today, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. We are… in your office, Doctor. At the… the clinic? I believe this is a clinic. A doctor’s office. It’s… suburban, isn't it? I seem to recall it being a rather quiet neighborhood.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. I will say them slowly, and then I will ask you to recall them later. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat them back to me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Apple… Table… Penny. Yes. Apple, Table, Penny.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you spell the word "World" backwards?
PATIENT: Um… backwards? Oh, goodness. That is… challenging. …D-L-R-O-W? No… That doesn’t sound right. Is that correct, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, that is not quite correct. It is W-O-R-L-D. Now, let's move on. You mentioned you take medication for blood pressure. Can you tell me the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My… my blood pressure medicine. Oh, this is difficult. It is… a small, white pill. I believe it starts with an “A”? Or maybe a “B”? I apologize, Doctor. My memory is… not what it used to be. I can’t seem to recall the name.
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on the brief examination and your reported symptoms, I suspect we need to investigate potential cognitive impairment further. It could be a variety of factors, and we will need to rule out other causes. I would like to order some blood work to assess your overall health, thyroid function and vitamin levels. Also, I'd like to schedule an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture. And I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: MRI? A neurologist? Oh, goodness. That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Is it… is it something very bad? I just… I just want to understand what is happening. If you think it’s necessary, of course. Yes, please. Whatever you think is best. But… please, explain everything to me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It is prudent to investigate thoroughly, Mr. Gyamfi. An MRI will help us to rule out any structural issues, and the neurologist will be able to assess your cognitive function in more detail. It does not necessarily mean there is anything severely wrong, but it’s important to determine the cause of your symptoms. I will write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly-respected neurologist in the area. She will contact you to schedule an appointment. And I will order the blood work today. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any mentally strenuous activities, and ask a family member or friend to assist you with tasks that require concentration. We will discuss the results of the tests once they are available, and formulate a treatment plan accordingly. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Mentally strenuous activities… yes. That is… difficult, as I enjoy reading. And I worry about… about managing my finances. Dr. Sharma… is she… good? Will she explain things clearly? And… will this be very expensive? My wife… she handled all the finances. I am… not very good with those things. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very… helpful. But I am… rather worried.
DOCTOR: Dr. Sharma is an excellent neurologist, Mr. Gyamfi. She is known for her thoroughness and clear explanations. I would not recommend her otherwise. As for the cost, you should check with your insurance provider to determine your coverage. The clinic's billing department can also assist you with any financial concerns. It’s understandable that you are worried, but we are taking the necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms, and formulate an appropriate plan. I will also provide you with resources for memory care support, if needed. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Resources for memory care… yes, that sounds… helpful, actually. No, Doctor. I believe that is all for now. Thank you for your time, and for… explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience. I will… I will schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma, and I will check with my insurance.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gyamfi. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And remember to prioritize rest and avoid overexertion. I will see you again once we have the results of your tests.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you.
