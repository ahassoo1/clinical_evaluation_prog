DOCTOR: Hi Jinnie, welcome. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you, Doctor. It's…adequate to meet you as well. I suppose I’m here about…a rather unpleasant matter. It’s about my…companion. He's not been himself lately, and frankly, it’s quite distressing. There's…discharge. Yes, discharge. It's not a topic one enjoys discussing, but it is happening.
DOCTOR: Oh dear, that does sound distressing, Jinnie. I understand it’s not easy to talk about these things. You said your companion – is this a pet, or another person?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, not a pet. Really. A person, of course. Though sometimes I wonder…He's a bit of a mess, frankly. A bit…unrefined. But yes, a man. We've been…seeing each other for some time now. It's just…this discharge is new. And rather unsightly, I must say. It's not something one wants to deal with, especially at our age.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s good you’re seeking help, and it takes courage to talk about these things, especially when it involves someone you care for. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Well, it's…difficult to describe delicately. It's not like water, certainly. More…thick. And yellowish. Sometimes there's a bit of…odor. Not a pleasant odor, mind you. He tries to be discreet, but it's…noticeable. He’s been attempting to…clean up after himself, but it doesn’t seem to be helping much. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to worry it might be…something catching.
DOCTOR: Okay, thick, yellowish discharge with an odor…and you’re concerned it might be something contagious. That’s very reasonable to be worried about. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me where exactly this discharge is coming from?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Must I be so…graphic? Very well. It's…from him, Doctor. From…down there. From his…private parts. I don't know the proper terminology, you understand. I’m a woman of a certain age and…discretion. But yes, that is where it’s originating. It’s quite embarrassing to even admit, honestly. He’s mortified, naturally.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jinnie, and you don't need to feel embarrassed at all. It's important to be able to discuss these things openly so I can help. So, the discharge is coming from his urethra—that's the tube that urine comes out of—or is it elsewhere?
PATIENT: Urethra? Goodness, I haven't the faintest idea what a urethra is. Is that…internal? He hasn’t mentioned anything about internal examinations. It's…coming from the end, if that makes any sense. The very tip. Where…well, where the urine comes out, yes. I’m hardly a medical professional, Doctor. I just know it's unpleasant and worrisome. Honestly, you're asking a great many detailed questions. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask, Jinnie. I apologize if I’m being too detailed. It is necessary to understand exactly where the discharge is coming from to figure out what might be causing it. Okay, so it's coming from the opening where he urinates. That helps. Now, has he had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, now that you mention it. He has been…complaining. A bit of a grumbler, he is. He says it burns when he…goes to the bathroom. And he’s been a bit more…irritable than usual. Snapping, mostly. And sleeping poorly. He gets up several times during the night. He blames it on the heat, but I suspect it's related to this…issue. And…he's had a bit of a fever, now that I think of it. Nothing terribly high, but noticeable. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all very important, Jinnie, thank you for sharing that. Burning with urination, irritability, trouble sleeping, and a fever… those symptoms, along with the discharge, are definitely concerning. I'm thinking this could be an infection, possibly a sexually transmitted infection , or something else. To be sure, we'll need to do a physical exam and likely some lab tests. Would he be willing to come in for an appointment so I can examine him?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An examination? He…detests doctors. Utterly loathes them. He’s a very private man, you see. And rather…self-conscious. I doubt he'd agree. He'd much prefer I just tell you what's happening and you prescribe something based on my description. Is that not possible, Doctor? I'm quite a good observer, you know. I’m sure I can relay all the necessary information. He’d be much more comfortable, and frankly, so would I. The thought of him subjected to a medical examination…it’s rather distressing.
DOCTOR: I understand his reluctance, Jinnie, and I truly appreciate you being so concerned for his comfort. However, to give him the best possible care and ensure we get an accurate diagnosis – and therefore the right treatment – a physical examination is really important. Without one, I'm risking missing something important or prescribing the wrong medication, which could make things worse. I can assure you I'm very respectful and discreet. I can explain everything beforehand, and we can go slowly. But I really do need to see him. Would you be willing to talk to him about it, perhaps emphasizing that it’s for his health and well-being?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you're asking the impossible. He's a…stubborn man. Very set in his ways. And he has a…complicated relationship with authority figures. Trying to convince him to undergo a medical examination? It’s like trying to reason with a bull. He’ll simply refuse. And I’m not about to start a domestic dispute over this. Perhaps…perhaps there’s some sort of medication you can prescribe based solely on my description? Something broad-spectrum, just in case? I know it’s not ideal, but it’s better than nothing. Honestly, Doctor, I think you're making this far more difficult than it needs to be.
DOCTOR: Jinnie, I understand your concerns and his reluctance, truly. However, prescribing medication without a proper examination is not responsible medical care. It could be the wrong medication, it could mask symptoms, and it could even be harmful. Because I cannot, in good conscience, treat him without seeing him, and he’s unwilling to come in for an exam, I recommend he see a specialist. A urologist specializes in the urinary tract and male reproductive health. They would be best equipped to diagnose and treat his condition. I can give you a referral. Would you like that?
PATIENT: A specialist? Goodness. That sounds…expensive. And time-consuming. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to regret even bringing him in here. This is turning into a rather elaborate ordeal over something that surely has a simple solution. Very well. A referral, I suppose. But I’m warning you, if he refuses, I don’t know what I’ll do. He’s a very difficult man, you see. Very difficult indeed. And I’m not about to spend a fortune on specialists if he won't even cooperate. Just…give me the referral information. And perhaps a strong cup of tea. This has been terribly stressful. .
