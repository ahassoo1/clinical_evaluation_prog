DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s probably nothing, but my husband insisted. It’s…well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Like…really black. And I take those pills, you know, for my arthritis. The red ones. Every day. Been taking ‘em for years. He read something online and got all worked up. Men. Always worrying.
DOCTOR: Black stool is something we need to investigate, even if your husband is…prone to online research. It's good he's paying attention, honestly. And yes, the red pills…you mean your arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Yes, the arthritis pills! They’re the only thing that keeps me moving. Honestly, if I didn’t have those, I’d be stuck in bed all day. It's ibuprofen, I think. Or…naproxen? Something like that. They come in a big bottle. And yes, black stool. It started a couple of days ago. Not every time, just…sometimes. It's probably just the pills, right? They mess with your stomach, don't they?
DOCTOR: It can be the medication, yes. Both ibuprofen and naproxen can sometimes cause stomach upset and even…affect stool color. However, black stool can also indicate something more serious, like bleeding in the digestive tract. We need to rule that out. Now, tell me, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Oh, dear. Well, I haven’t seen any blood. Not that I know of. And I haven’t felt…weak, or anything. Though I do get tired easily, but that's just old age, isn't it? Honestly, I just want to get this over with. It's a long drive to get here, you know. Rural, you said? That’s putting it mildly.
DOCTOR: Yes, rural. We'll try to be efficient. Feeling tired can be a lot of things, Dawnetta, age included. But it's important to consider everything. Now, have you had any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No pain, no. Though sometimes my stomach feels a bit…grumbly after the pills, but nothing major. And I eat just fine, thank you very much. I like my dumplings, you know. And I haven't thrown up in…well, I can't remember the last time. Honestly, I think my husband is making a mountain out of a molehill. It’s probably just indigestion.
DOCTOR: Dumplings are good. But even with a good appetite, we need to be thorough. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Do I have to? It's just a stool color, not a broken leg. But…fine. Get it over with. Though I’m not a fan of doctors poking around. Honestly, I’ve never been one for medical exams. It’s all so…unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Dawnetta. But a quick exam can give us valuable information. It's standard procedure, and frankly, necessary to rule out anything serious. If everything checks out, we’ll both be relieved. Please, have a seat here. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll do a quick rectal exam – just to check for any…abnormalities. It won't be pleasant, but it's important.
PATIENT: Rectal exam?! Oh, no. Absolutely not. Honestly, you’re just trying to get me now. I came in here because of a stool color, not for a…that. I’m not doing that. No way. I’m leaving. Honestly, I’ve wasted enough time already.
DOCTOR: Dawnetta, with all due respect, a rectal exam is a standard component of investigating black stool. It’s not a matter of preference, it’s a medical necessity. We need to rule out bleeding, and that’s the most reliable way to do it. I understand it’s unpleasant, but it takes less than a minute. Are you refusing a medically indicated examination?
PATIENT: Yes! I am refusing. Absolutely refusing. Honestly, you’re making a fuss over nothing. I've been taking those pills for years, and I've never had any problems. My husband is a hypochondriac, and you're letting him influence you. It's ridiculous! I'm leaving now. And I want a refund for the gas money. Honestly, this is the worst doctor’s visit I’ve ever had.
DOCTOR: Very well, Dawnetta. I respect your decision, though I strongly advise you to reconsider. Ignoring potential signs of bleeding is not in your best interest. However, I will document your refusal of the examination. I'm also going to recommend you follow up with a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. And, honestly, perhaps a discussion with your husband about the dangers of self-diagnosing based on internet searches. Here’s a referral slip. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I will have the receptionist prepare a summary of today’s visit for you. I wish you all the best, Dawnetta. .
