DOCTOR: Well, hello Nykisha. I'm Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Havird, nice to meet you. Well, it's kind of hard to explain... my skin has been getting darker, and I'm just so tired all the time. It's not just a little tired, like after a long day, it's…deeper than that.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Darker skin and fatigue. Okay. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the skin changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started maybe… six months ago? At first, I didn’t really pay attention. I thought it was just the sun, you know? I do like to garden. But it hasn’t gotten lighter, even with sunscreen, and it’s… everywhere, not just where the sun hits. It's on my arms and face mostly, I think. It's hard to tell sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right, everywhere, not just sun-exposed areas. And has it been a gradual darkening, or did it happen suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. It wasn’t like waking up one morning and noticing a huge change. It's been…slow. Like a tan that just won't fade, but it's not from the sun, I don't think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. And this fatigue… is it constant?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty constant. It's not like I have good days and bad days, it's just... always there. Even when I get enough sleep – and I try to, believe me – I still feel wiped out. It's hard to get through my shift at the plant, honestly. It's not just sleepy, it's like… my body is heavy, all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy feeling, constant fatigue, even with sleep. Let’s talk a little bit about other things you’ve noticed. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Hmm… my appetite hasn’t really changed, I guess. I still eat pretty much the same. And my weight… I think I’ve maybe lost a little, but nothing dramatic. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, if that makes sense. It’s just… clothes feel a little looser, maybe? I'm not sure. I haven't been thinking about it much, to be honest, with feeling so tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Now that you mention it, sometimes I feel a little… dizzy, especially when I stand up quickly. It doesn’t happen every time, but it's been happening more lately. And my legs… they ache sometimes. Not like a pulled muscle, just… a dull ache. I thought it was from being on my feet so much at work, but now that you ask… maybe not?
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness upon standing and leg aches. Have you noticed any fevers, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fevers, chills, or night sweats. I haven’t felt sick like that at all. It’s just… this tiredness and the skin and…well, you know. It's just wearing me down. I haven't had a proper good night's sleep in months.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, do you have any other medical problems that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but I take medication for it now and it’s been under control. Other than that… I've been pretty healthy, honestly. I try to eat well when I can, and I like to stay active. It's just…this is worrying me. I've never felt like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension. Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I think it’s…Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril, I’m pretty sure. I take one pill every morning. And I get it refilled at the pharmacy every month, so they must know. I don’t really pay attention to the name, just that I need to take it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to take allergy pills during the spring, but that was years ago and I don’t need them anymore. I'm usually pretty good with medications.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any family history of medical problems—things that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. And my grandfather… he had some kind of heart trouble. But other than that, not really. We don’t really talk about health much in my family. It’s… considered bad luck, maybe? I don’t know. It's not something we share easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I used to drink a little wine sometimes with dinner, but I stopped a long time ago. And definitely no drugs. I work around chemicals all day, that’s enough for me! I try to be very careful about what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that’s a good start. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. Then we can talk about what might be going on and what tests we should do. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I’m just… I’m hoping we can figure out what’s wrong. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Okay, first your blood pressure is 130/80, which is good. Now let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and again… Good. Sounds clear. Now, let's take a look at your skin. Hmm. Yes, I do see some darkening here, as you mentioned. It’s not a typical sun tan. It’s a bit… uneven. I also notice some slight bruising on your arms…do you recall injuring these areas?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I definitely didn’t bump into anything. I’m careful, you know? I work with machinery all day, I have to be careful. It’s just… there. It’s been happening slowly, like everything else. It’s worrying me a little bit now that you point it out. I thought it was just clumsiness, but… It’s a bit more than I thought.
DOCTOR: Okay. And I'm also noticing some dryness on your hands and a slight pallor to your skin overall. Your pulse is a little weak. Given your symptoms - the fatigue, the darkening skin, the bruising, the dizziness, and now these findings - I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be related to your blood pressure medication, though that's less likely. It could be something related to your blood counts, like anemia. Or, it could be a sign of something more systemic. To get a clearer picture, I want to order some blood work. We’ll check a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, iron studies, and a thyroid panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is necessary. The more tests, the better, I guess, if it means finding out what’s wrong. I'm just… relieved you're taking it seriously. I was worried I was just imagining things. Blood work sounds good. Will I need to fast for any of it?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks except water. I'll give you a lab slip with specific instructions. It’s important to follow those instructions carefully to ensure accurate results. We can schedule those tests for tomorrow morning. And in the meantime, I want you to continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. We'll get these results back within a few days, and then we'll discuss them and figure out a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… when will I know the results? A few days… is that like two days? Three? I just want to have some idea.
DOCTOR: Typically, it takes about two to three business days for the lab to get the results back to us. I will have my nurse call you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. We'll discuss them in detail then. It’s important to remember that these tests are just a starting point, and we may need to do further investigation depending on what they show. But for now, let's focus on getting these results back. Here's the slip with all the instructions. Do you have any trouble getting to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. It’s not far, about ten minutes down the road. I can drive myself. I appreciate you asking, though. It's just…everything is a little overwhelming right now, you know? But I'll get the tests done tomorrow morning, first thing. Thank you, Dr. Havird.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nykisha. I understand it can be overwhelming. We'll take it one step at a time. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. In the meantime, try to get some rest and avoid any strenuous activity. And remember, we’re here to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for listening and taking me seriously. I really appreciate it. I’ll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: Alright. You have a good day, Nykisha, and get some rest. We’ll be in touch soon. .
