DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, Doctor, let's not waste time. I’m 51, perfectly healthy – always have been – and I want to have a baby. I want to make sure… everything works properly, you understand? I don’t want any surprises. And frankly, I haven’t got all day for this.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shteynberg. Planning for a pregnancy at any age is wise, and I appreciate you being so direct. “Perfectly healthy” is good to hear, but we’ll want to confirm that with some questions and a check-up. To start, have you been trying to conceive already, or are we just starting the planning process?
PATIENT: Trying? No, Doctor. I haven’t just decided on a whim to… try. I’m planning. Big difference. I’ve been… considering it for a few months now, getting my affairs in order, so to speak. But before I actually begin, I want to be certain I'm not… deficient in any way. Honestly, at my age, one expects things to… diminish. It’s just sensible to be proactive.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible, Ms. Shteynberg. Proactive is always good. Alright, let’s gather some information to get a good baseline. First, can you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history? Really? I just told you I’m perfectly healthy. A few colds, perhaps. The usual. Nothing serious. I haven’t been hospitalized since… well, never. I don’t do illness. Is this standard procedure? It feels… rather intrusive to ask someone who clearly maintains excellent health about nonexistent ailments.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg, and I apologize if it seems intrusive. It’s standard procedure, but it’s not to imply anything is wrong. We’re looking for anything that could potentially impact a pregnancy – even things you might consider minor. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. No. Absolutely not. I exercise regularly – I cycle, obviously – eat a sensible diet, don’t smoke, don't drink excessively. I’m not some delicate flower, Doctor. My ex-husband was the unhealthy one, always complaining. Honestly, asking me about health problems is a waste of both our time. But if you must… I had my tonsils removed as a child. And I broke my arm once, skiing. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shteynberg. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're digging into my relatives? Really? My mother lived to 85, perfectly functional, although a bit… opinionated. My father died of a heart attack, but he smoked like a chimney and drank heavily. Hardly a relevant example of genetic predisposition. My aunt had high blood pressure, but she was… large. Honestly, Doctor, are you actually looking for something to find, or just filling out paperwork? I’m starting to feel quite impatient.
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Ms. Shteynberg. I assure you I'm not trying to be difficult. Family history can be relevant, even if the circumstances aren’t ideal. Alright, let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don’t poison my body with chemicals. Perhaps a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but that's hardly significant. I believe in a healthy lifestyle, not relying on pills for everything. Is this truly necessary, Doctor? We’ve established I’m in excellent condition. Can we not just… proceed with a few tests and be done with this? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. We can proceed with tests. Before we do, just a few more quick questions to get a complete picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I eat everything. I’ve travelled extensively, tried all sorts of cuisines. I'm not a delicate flower, I told you. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming tedious. Are we finished yet? I can feel my time slipping away.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. No known allergies, no current medications, no significant medical history… Just a childhood tonsillectomy and a fractured arm. And a vitamin D supplement seasonally. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can discuss some potential tests to assess your reproductive health and hormone levels. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And no unnecessary probing, if you please. I trust you understand my boundaries. Just… get on with it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I will be as efficient and respectful as possible. First, I'll take your blood pressure. 128/76. That’s excellent. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Do you have any shortness of breath or wheezing?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I cycle, remember? I have excellent lung capacity. This is all very… perfunctory. Are you actually gaining any useful information, or just going through the motions? Honestly, I could probably self-assess better than this. But, fine. Proceed with whatever tests you deem necessary. Just… don't take all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. Based on your history and initial exam, I'd like to order a few blood tests to check your hormone levels – specifically FSH, estradiol, and AMH – to assess your ovarian reserve. We'll also do a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to get a baseline of your overall health. I’d also like to do a pelvic exam and Pap smear, if you're comfortable with that, to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Really, Doctor? At my age? Honestly, I find that… insulting. I’ve lived a perfectly respectable life. I hardly think a pelvic exam is necessary. The blood tests are fine, I suppose, but I refuse the exam. Absolutely not. You're wasting my time. I think I've had enough of this. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteynberg. Your comfort is my priority. We can proceed with just the blood tests, if you prefer. I will write the orders now. The results should be available in approximately three to five business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual bleeding, pain, or fever, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions before we finish?
