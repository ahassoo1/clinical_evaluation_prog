DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Well… I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come see someone. Not a lot of blood, but… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. That certainly sounds concerning, Ms. Weichers, and you did the right thing by coming in to be checked. Can you tell me a little more about the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… a week ago? Just a little cough, not bad. But then, yesterday and again this morning, there was blood when I coughed. It’s… reddish, of course. And it’s not with every cough, just some of them. I don't have a fever, and I don't feel sick, other than being a little worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough for about a week, with blood noted yesterday and this morning. Not with every cough, and no fever or other symptoms of illness besides your worry, which is perfectly understandable. To help me get a better picture, could you describe the blood a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, um… how to describe it… It’s not… bright red, like if you cut yourself. It’s… darker. More like… rusty colored, maybe? And not a huge amount, really. Just… streaks in the mucus when I cough. It’s hard to explain. I don’t… I haven’t had this happen before. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Weichers. Rusty-colored streaks, not a large amount, and you haven't experienced this before. That gives me some important information. Now, have you noticed anything else accompanying the cough?
PATIENT: Accompanying…? Hmm. Let me think… I have been a little more tired than usual, but I thought that was just because of the summer heat. And… maybe a little short of breath when I walk up the stairs, but I live on the tenth floor, so that's not completely unusual. Nothing else, I don’t think. Oh! I did lose my appetite a little, but I haven't been eating very well since… well, since my husband passed. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s important, Ms. Weichers. Thank you for sharing that. Loss of appetite following your husband’s passing is certainly understandable, and can contribute to other symptoms. Fatigue and shortness of breath are also good things to note. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Of course. Well, I… I don’t really have much of a medical history. I was always very healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses when I was young, but nothing serious. I did have pneumonia once, many years ago, but I recovered fully. And… I had a surgery to fix a broken wrist when I was a teenager, playing volleyball. Other than that, I haven’t been to the doctor much. I don't smoke, and I don't drink alcohol very often. Do you need to know about… medications? I just take a vitamin D supplement.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Weichers. That’s good to know. No significant medical history, pneumonia in the past, a broken wrist surgery, and you don’t smoke or drink much alcohol, only a vitamin D supplement. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh… my family. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some heart problems when he was older. Nothing too serious, I don’t think. And my brother… he’s healthy, as far as I know. We don’t talk very often. I don't really know if anyone else in my family had… anything like this, like coughing up blood. I don’t recall. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly okay, Ms. Weichers. A family history of high blood pressure and heart problems is good to know. And it's understandable that you don't have detailed knowledge of everyone's medical history. To finish up with the background questions, could you tell me a little about your current living situation and what you do day-to-day?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I live in an apartment building, as I said. On the tenth floor. It’s… quiet. I live alone now, of course. I work as a physical therapist. I have a small clinic, mostly helping people with injuries and… older people with balance problems. I walk to work, it's not far. I spend a lot of time with my patients, and… I try to keep busy. I like gardening, when I have time. And… I read a lot. Just trying to… keep things normal.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Weichers. That gives me a good sense of your life. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to listen to your lungs and check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’m a little nervous, but… I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Weichers. I appreciate your trust. I’ll do my best to be thorough and gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out. Okay, your heart sounds normal. Lungs… I do hear some mild wheezing in the lower lobes, on both sides. And some slightly diminished breath sounds in the bases as well. I'm going to listen again while you cough. Please cough when you're ready.
PATIENT: Okay… like that? It feels… strange to cough on command. I don’t usually cough much. Is something wrong? I’m a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Weichers. You did great. Hearing you cough does help me get a better assessment. The wheezing is still present, and I hear some crackles now, particularly on the right side. Your lymph nodes feel normal; no swelling or tenderness. Your oxygen saturation is 96% which is good. Given your history of coughing up blood, the wheezing and crackles in your lungs, and your recent fatigue, I think it's important to investigate this further. I would like to order a chest X-ray and a sputum culture. The X-ray will help us visualize your lungs, and the sputum culture will check for any infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it's necessary, then I trust you, Doctor. An X-ray and a… sputum culture? Is that painful? I’m a little scared of needles, if that’s involved. But… if it will help find out what’s wrong, then yes, please. I want to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: That's very good of you, Ms. Weichers. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that the sputum culture doesn’t involve a needle. You simply cough up a sample of mucus into a sterile container. The technician will guide you on how to do that effectively. As for the X-ray, it’s completely painless. You’ll just stand or lie down while the machine takes a picture. I'll also order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. While we wait for the results, I recommend you avoid strenuous activity and stay well-hydrated. If the coughing worsens, or if you develop a fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very thorough. No needles, that’s good. And I will try to rest and drink more water. And I will be very careful, and if anything gets worse, I will go to the emergency room. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind and patient with me. I feel a little better knowing we are doing something to find out what’s wrong. When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I'm glad I could ease some of your anxiety. It's my job to ensure you receive the best possible care. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours. My office will call you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild cough suppressant to help manage your symptoms. It's not a cure, but it should provide some relief. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A cough suppressant… that sounds good. Thank you. No, I don't think so. You have answered all my questions, and you have explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your kindness and patience. Thank you again, Doctor Reisig. I will wait for the phone call. And I will try to stay positive.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. I'll have the nurse come in to review the discharge instructions with you and give you the prescription. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
