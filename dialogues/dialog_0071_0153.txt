DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Galena. It’s… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, uh… something about a check-up? For… a performance, I think. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. Something about needing to be cleared to… act? Or maybe usher? Honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy. I just want to get it over with if that's alright. It's August, isn't it? The heat… makes it harder to think.
DOCTOR: August it is. And yes, the heat… certainly doesn’t help. A check-up for a performance… right. We can definitely do that. Just to clarify, you said you're not entirely sure what the performance is, or your role in it?
PATIENT: That’s… about right, yes. Something with tickets, or showing people to their seats… maybe? I used to do that a lot, years ago. Lobby work, mostly. It’s all a blur now, honestly. I just got a notice… or someone told me I needed this clearance. I don't remember who, or exactly what they said. I apologize for the confusion. Is this going to be a long process?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Krahn. Memory can be… tricky. We’ll keep it as brief as possible. Let's start with a general overview, then. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well… hmm. As well as an old man can be, I suppose. A little stiff in the mornings, but nothing I haven’t gotten used to. No… major complaints. I get tired easily, but that could just be my age. No fevers, no coughs… just… old. Does that make sense? I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. Is there a questionnaire I should fill out? Perhaps that would jog my memory.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Krahn. "Old" is a perfectly valid symptom. And yes, a questionnaire would be helpful. We have a standard form covering medical history, allergies, medications… things like that. If you’re comfortable, we can do it electronically. It might be easier than handwriting, and it'll hopefully help us fill in some of the blanks. It doesn't need to be perfect, just do your best.
PATIENT: Oh, electronic, you say? Yes, that sounds… much better. My hands aren't as steady as they used to be. Alright, let’s see… where do I begin? Allergies… hmm. I don’t think I have any major ones, but my daughter always said I reacted to… dust? Or was that just her being overly cautious? This is… difficult. I hope I don't take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mr. Krahn. Just answer to the best of your recollection. If you're unsure, you can mark “unknown.” Dust is good to note, even if it's uncertain. We can always clarify later. Let's start with any current medications you're taking. Anything at all, even over-the-counter remedies, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. Nothing regularly, no. Not anymore. I used to take something for my… blood pressure, I believe. Years ago. But the doctor took me off of it. I think. It was a small white pill… or maybe it was blue? I really can't recall the name. I haven't needed it for… well, a very long time. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, when I remember. But that's it, I promise. Is this… going anywhere? I just want to be sure I’m not wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, former blood pressure medication, multivitamin as needed. That’s helpful. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… that’s a big word. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long, long time ago. And… I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. Does that count? Oh, and I had a bad case of the flu, maybe ten years ago. I was bedridden for a week. But other than that… not really. I've been… fairly lucky, I suppose. Except for the memory, of course. Is this enough? Are we getting closer to being finished?
DOCTOR: Appendix, broken wrist, flu… that's good. Now, let’s talk about your family. Any history of heart disease, diabetes, cancer… anything like that in your parents, siblings, or children?
PATIENT: Family… That's… difficult. My parents are both gone now, a long time ago. My sister… she lived in another state. We didn't see each other much. I don't really know about their medical history. I think my mother had… high blood pressure? But I’m not sure. And my sister… she was always very private about those things. I have a daughter, but we haven't spoken in a while. She probably knows, but… I don't want to bother her. This is… a mess, isn't it? I'm so sorry for being so unhelpful. Is there a quicker way to do this? Perhaps a blood test?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Krahn. Don't apologize. We're gathering information, and it's perfectly fine if you don't have all the answers. A blood test is a good idea, and we'll order one shortly. But first, let's just finish up with a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no. Not at all. Never smoked a day in my life. My father always said it was a terrible habit. And… I used to have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I haven't done that in years. Not since… well, never mind. And drugs? Heavens no. I’m an old man, Doctor, not a… a troublemaker. I lead a very quiet life. Just me and my… well, just me. Can we please get this over with? I'm starting to feel a bit… anxious.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krahn. Just a few more quick things, then we'll proceed with the exam. Are you currently experiencing any pain, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or any other unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: No… no, not really. I get a little stiff in the mornings, like I said. And sometimes my knees ache, but that's just… old age, I suppose. No chest pain, no trouble breathing. Just… tired. Always tired. And a little forgetful. But that's it, really. No… nothing major. Can we do the blood test now? I feel a bit… overwhelmed. I just want to get this over with and go home.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. We’ll get that blood test ordered right away. And then we’ll do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Nothing extensive, I promise. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes… the usual. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… much better. The blood test and a quick look-over. That’s all I ask. I just want to be sure I’m fit enough for… whatever it is I'm supposed to be doing. And then I can go home and… relax. Thank you, Doctor. Let's get it over with. Where do we begin?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just follow me over here, and we’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me…
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Blood pressure… right. It tends to be a little high when I'm nervous, you know. Always has been. I get anxious at doctors, I'm afraid. Just get it over with quickly, please?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krahn. We’ll take it slowly. 148 over 92… a little elevated, as you suspected. Take a deep breath for me… and again… Your lungs sound clear. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little bit… there. On the left side. Not much, though. It’s been like that for a while. I figured it was just… old age. Or gas, maybe? I eat a lot of beans, you know. Don’t worry about it, though. It's not painful, just… noticeable. Can we move on to the blood test now? I'm starting to feel a bit lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get you seated. Feeling lightheaded is good to note. We’ll order that blood test right away and get you a glass of water. And then we can discuss the results when they come back. We’ll check your blood sugar too, just to be safe. I’ve asked Sarah here to draw a little blood for the tests. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s… that’s fine. Sarah, you say? I’ve always been a bit squeamish around needles, to be honest. But I suppose it’s necessary. Just… be quick, please? And try not to hurt me too much. I just want this to be over with.
DOCTOR: Just a little pinch, Mr. Krahn… you’re doing great. Almost done… there we are. All finished. Excellent work, Sarah. Thank you. Now, we’ll send this off to the lab. It should take a few days to get the results. We’ll call you as soon as they’re in. In the meantime, if you experience any dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Dizziness, shortness of breath… emergency room. Got it. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you, Sarah. You were both very kind. I just want to go home and rest now. Is there anything else I need to do? Any paperwork, or anything? I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: No, no paperwork needed at this time, Mr. Krahn. We’ll call you with the results, and we can discuss a plan then. I’ve also sent a note to your primary care physician letting them know about our consultation. Now, let me escort you to the front desk to schedule a follow-up appointment. Just to check in and see how you’re feeling once we have the results. It's best to be cautious. Take it easy, Mr. Krahn. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then.
