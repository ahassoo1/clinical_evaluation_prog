DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm Dr. Sink. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the time for this. It’s… the university. The students. It’s all rather… taxing. A complete lack of respect for knowledge these days, I tell you. Just… burnout, I suppose. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Burnout. Right. And what specifically is causing this… burnout, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s a multitude of things, really. They don’t read anymore, Doctor. They expect everything handed to them. And the questions… the sheer lack of intellectual curiosity! It's… demoralizing. Honestly, it’s probably a waste of your time listening to me complain about the failings of the younger generation.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… perspective, Mr. Schlatterer, it’s important to understand how this is affecting you physically. Are you experiencing any difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleeping? Well… I suppose I do wake up rather frequently. Not that it's a problem, precisely. It's more… I find myself thinking. About the state of things, you understand. The library… it’s just not what it used to be. The noise… even in the quiet room! It’s all very… distracting. Though, I wouldn’t say it’s a difficulty, no. A slight… inconvenience, perhaps?
DOCTOR: And has this been a recent change, or something you’ve been dealing with for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. Time… it all blends together, you see. I believe… yes, it’s been worsening over the last… year, perhaps? Though, it’s hard to say. I retired from full teaching duties some time ago. Now, I mostly oversee the… digital archives. A dreadful waste of a perfectly good library, if you ask me. But it keeps the administration happy, apparently. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Schlatterer. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, my appetite isn't what it used to be, I suppose. Though, I never was one for… excessive eating. And I tire rather easily. But that's to be expected at my age, wouldn’t you agree? Honestly, I fail to see how any of this is particularly… noteworthy. I’m an academic, Doctor, not a… a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you experiencing any weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? I haven't weighed myself recently. Probably a little. My wife… well, my ex-wife, she always insisted I eat more. A dreadful woman, always fussing. Probably a few pounds, but nothing significant. I assure you, Doctor, I’m perfectly… functional. I still manage my work, don’t I? Though, it’s becoming increasingly… irritating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: I beg your pardon? Doctor, are you quite serious? I fail to see how my… digestive processes are relevant to my workplace stress. This is… rather inappropriate, wouldn't you agree? I came to you because I feel overwhelmed, not to discuss… that. Really. I think I’ve answered quite enough personal questions for one day. Perhaps we should focus on the students. They're the root of the problem, you know. Absolutely dreadful.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your frustration. However, a complete medical assessment requires these questions. If you are unwilling to provide this information, I'm afraid I can't be of much help. Perhaps you should consider a… counselor. It seems you're primarily experiencing stress. .
PATIENT: A counselor? Preposterous! I'm a highly educated man, Doctor. I don't need a counselor. This has been a complete waste of my time. Good day. .
