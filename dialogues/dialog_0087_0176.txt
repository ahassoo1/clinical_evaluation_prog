DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, I think… maybe Tuesday? And they’re still going. It’s really getting annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can certainly be disruptive. Tuesday… alright. And are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, but mostly come. Like, I’ll get maybe ten minutes of peace, then hic hic hic for a bit, then stop again. It’s not a regular pattern, though. It’s just… random. And they’re pretty strong, actually. Not tiny little ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent, but more frequent than not, and fairly strong. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. I was making a big pot of lentil soup on Tuesday, maybe that? But I’ve had lentil soup a million times before. I was also a bit stressed, trying to finalize the bookings for the summer festival. It's a lot of work, you know? But I’m usually pretty good at handling stress. I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, potential triggers of lentil soup and stress, although neither are consistently associated. And to clarify, when you say stress, can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, the festival is… it’s a big deal for the town. Lots of people depend on it going well. I’m responsible for all the performers, the stage setup, the food vendors… everything really. There’s a lot of phone calls, emails, coordinating schedules. It’s not panic stressful, more like… constant worry that something will fall through. It’s mostly paperwork and making sure everyone is happy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A lot of responsibility can certainly be… taxing. And you mentioned it started around the time you were finalizing these bookings. Have you experienced anything else unusual alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven’t felt sick, no fever or anything. No heartburn, no stomach pain. I’m eating normally, sleeping normally… I’m just… hiccuping. It’s just annoying, really. I can barely get through a phone call without sounding ridiculous! It’s been a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I had a meeting with the mayor yesterday and… well, you can imagine.
DOCTOR: I understand. And no changes in any medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no medications. I don’t take anything regularly. I had some ibuprofen a couple of weeks ago for a headache, but that was it. Nothing since then. Really, I’m a pretty healthy person, usually. This is just… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay. And to confirm, no allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. I eat everything. I'm Egyptian, you know, we have a pretty varied diet! No problems there. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Redeye, it sounds like you’re experiencing persistent hiccups without any other associated symptoms, no medication changes, and no known allergies. To get a better understanding, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and just feel your abdomen. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want these hiccups to stop! They’re really starting to get on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, please. I’ll wash my hands first. Okay, Ms. Redeye, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, then I’ll palpate your abdomen. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly detected. Everything seems normal on physical exam, which is reassuring.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, I suppose. Though it doesn’t explain the hiccups! What do you think is causing them, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Most cases of persistent hiccups are benign and resolve on their own. However, since yours have been ongoing for a couple of days, and we haven’t identified an obvious cause, we should rule out a few possibilities. It's unlikely to be something serious, but it's always best to be thorough. Given your history, and the exam findings, I’d like to order a basic blood work panel – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel – to check for any underlying electrolyte imbalances or other issues that could be contributing. It’s a pretty routine test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, please. I just want to stop hiccuping! How long will it take to get the results? And will I need a special order or something?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall. It shouldn’t take long – usually a few hours, but let’s say 24-48 hours to be safe. They’ll likely have the results sent directly to me. You don't need a special order; I’m sending the request electronically now. In the meantime, I’d like you to continue to stay hydrated, and try to avoid carbonated beverages, as those can sometimes worsen hiccups. If the hiccups continue to be bothersome, you can try over-the-counter remedies like sipping ice water, or sucking on a lemon wedge. But if they become severe, or you develop any other symptoms – like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain – please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Stay hydrated, no fizzy drinks, try some home remedies, and come back if anything gets worse. I can do all that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I understand it’s frustrating. We’ll get to the bottom of it. I’ll review the blood work results as soon as they come in and contact you with the findings. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s a printout of the lab order and some information about hiccups. Have a good day, and I hope they subside soon.
