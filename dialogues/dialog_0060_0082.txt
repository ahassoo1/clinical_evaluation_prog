DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. Have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… travel, yeah. Need… something for travel. My wife… she always took care of this. Before. I don’t really… know what I need.
DOCTOR: Right. Travel. Well, that’s… vague. Are you planning a long trip?
PATIENT: Long? I guess so. Nepal, you know? To visit family. It's… where I’m from. Not like… vacation long. More like… need to be there long. Does that make sense? It’s… complicated.
DOCTOR: Complicated is fine. Nepal… alright. And what exactly are you needing for this trip?
PATIENT: Uh… shots? Pills? My wife, she always got everything. Little cards, everything organized. I… don't remember what she took. Just… stuff to not get sick. Things you need when you go there. It’s… different there. Different germs, I think she said.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need to figure out what vaccinations you’ve had, and what you might be exposed to in Nepal. Do you have any records of previous immunizations?
PATIENT: Records? No. Not… with me. She kept all that. In the… box. After… everything, I mostly just… took what I needed. Didn’t really look at the papers. Is it… bad to not have them?
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal. We’ll have to assume you're not up-to-date on everything, which means more shots. Do you know if you've had measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, hepatitis A or B?
PATIENT: Whoa, slow down. Those are… a lot of words. I… I don’t know. I got sick as a kid, maybe? Like, normal kid stuff. But I don’t remember what sicknesses. She took me to the doctor… a long time ago. Did they poke me? Probably. I remember… something with a needle. But what for? No idea.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll need to do some bloodwork to see what you're immune to. And we’ll definitely want to get you updated on routine vaccinations. Have you ever had a tuberculosis test?
PATIENT: Tuber… what now? Sounds… bad. Is that something you get in Nepal? She never said anything about that. I worked with… a lot of people. Building planes, you know? Maybe… maybe I had that test before? I don’t know. It all… blurs together.
DOCTOR: It's a routine test, especially if you've traveled or been exposed to different populations. And it's important to rule out latent tuberculosis before you travel back to Nepal. Let’s just get it done. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm… I think… maybe to something red? A pill, when I was little. Made my face… itchy. But I don’t remember what it was for. And it was a long time ago. She always knew what I could take and what I couldn’t. This is… a lot, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s necessary. We need to establish a baseline, Odell. It's not ideal that you don't have any records, but we'll work with what we have. Alright. Let’s start with a quick physical exam, and then we’ll order some bloodwork and a TB test. Sound good?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… hurry, okay? I got things to do. Family waiting. Nepal isn't getting any closer by sitting here.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's begin. Please step onto the scale for me. And then we'll check your blood pressure, pulse and temperature.
PATIENT: This… isn't going to take all day, is it? My family… they expect me soon. I don’t want to worry them more than I already have.
DOCTOR: 104 pounds. And 155 centimeters. Okay. Blood pressure is 118 over 76. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale.
PATIENT: Feels… fine. Always been a little… tight in the chest. From the… the air. Building planes, you know? Lots of dust. Nothing to worry about, though. Probably.
DOCTOR: I hear some mild wheezing in your lower lobes. It could be related to your history of dust exposure, but we should rule out anything more serious. Any history of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Asthma… no. Bron… what was that again? I got sick once, a long time ago. Very sick. Couldn’t breathe. She took me to the hospital. Lots of… tubes. But I don’t remember what she said it was. Just… very sick. Is that… pneumonia? Maybe?
DOCTOR: It could have been pneumonia. We'll need a chest X-ray to be certain. Right. Let's get those orders in. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a tuberculosis test, and a chest X-ray. You’ll need to go to the lab down the hall for the bloodwork and the TB test, and then to the imaging center across the street for the X-ray. Do you have any questions before I give you the paperwork?
PATIENT: Paperwork… Will this… take long? I really need to get going. My family… they’re expecting me. And the X-ray… is it… dangerous? She always said… less is better. And the paperwork… can you just… tell me what they need? I don’t… I don’t like filling things out.
DOCTOR: The X-ray is a very low dose of radiation, perfectly safe. It's necessary to rule out any underlying lung issues. And yes, the paperwork is standard. It’s just your insurance information and a consent form. Look, I understand you're anxious, but this is important. The lab will draw some blood, the imaging center will take the X-ray, and then we'll review the results and discuss a plan. Here are the forms. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes to fill out. Just your name, date of birth, insurance information… and sign here. Do you need help reading anything?
PATIENT: Insurance… what number is that again? And… date of birth? I… I think it’s October something? She always remembered. This is too much. Can you… can you just fill it out for me? Please? I just… I need to go. My family…
DOCTOR: Fine. But this is the last time I’m doing this for you. You need to be more proactive about your health. It's your responsibility. Here. Go to the lab, then the imaging center. The results will be sent to me electronically. I'll call you when I have them. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… where is the lab? And the… imaging center? And… how long will it take to get the results? My family… they’ll worry if I’m gone too long.
DOCTOR: The lab is at the end of the hallway, second door on the left. The imaging center is across the street – you'll see the sign. As for the results… it usually takes a few hours, but it could be longer depending on their workload. I'll call you as soon as I have them. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you.
