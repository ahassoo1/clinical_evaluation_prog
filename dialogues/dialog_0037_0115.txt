DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, my... it is good to meet you as well. Let me see... well, it’s about my jaundice. It’s… quite noticeable, I believe. It’s been… a while since I was feeling well. I seem to have some trouble with my liver, or so they told me. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I apologize for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Annelle, no need to apologize at all. It’s perfectly alright if things are a bit blurry. We’ll take our time and sort through everything. You mentioned jaundice and some trouble with your liver. To start, can you tell me more about when you first noticed the jaundice – the yellowing of your skin or eyes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I first notice…? It was… some time after I started feeling unwell, certainly. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It sort of… crept up on me. I really can't pinpoint a date, I’m afraid. Perhaps a few months ago? It’s very frustrating, this memory… I apologize again. Is… is it important to know exactly when?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Annelle, we'll do the best we can with what you remember. Knowing roughly when it started helps us piece things together, but it’s not the end of the world if it’s not precise. So, a few months ago you started noticing yellowing of your skin or eyes, after you began feeling unwell. Can you describe what "feeling unwell" means for you?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it was a general tiredness, I suppose. A lack of energy… and a bit of an ache, all over. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull discomfort. And… my appetite wasn't very good. Everything tasted… bland, I think. It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid. I haven't been feeling myself for some time now. Do you… do you need me to be more specific? I wish I could recall more details for you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful, Annelle. Fatigue, a general ache, and loss of appetite. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Changes in… my urine and stool? Oh dear… I hadn’t really paid much attention, to be honest. Now that you mention it… perhaps my urine was a bit darker than usual? It’s… difficult to say for certain. And my stool… I believe it was paler. But I truly can’t be certain, Doctor. I apologize for being so unhelpful. Is this… is this important?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Annelle. It's perfectly okay. You're not being unhelpful at all. These details can be important clues, so thank you for trying to recall. Darker urine and paler stools – that’s good information. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… my medical history. Well, I believe I had… some trouble with my gallbladder, many years ago. It was quite a long time ago now, perhaps twenty years or more. They removed it, I believe. And… I had some issues with my blood pressure, but it was well-controlled with medication for a while. I… I can’t recall the details of the medication anymore. It’s all so very long ago. Honestly, I hope this isn’t too frustrating for you, Doctor. I wish I could be of more assistance.
DOCTOR: No, not frustrating at all, Annelle. That’s helpful information. Twenty years ago you had your gallbladder removed, and you were previously treated for high blood pressure. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but I haven’t been taking it… for a while now. I believe the doctor… discontinued it. I’m not sure why. I… I haven’t been to a doctor regularly for some time. I truly can’t recall any other medications. Perhaps a small pain reliever from time to time? But nothing consistently. It’s all a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. Is there anything else I should be thinking about? I apologize for being so… disorganized.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. It’s perfectly alright. You used to take medication for blood pressure, but it was discontinued, and you occasionally take a pain reliever. Now, have you ever had any surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Surgeries… other than the gallbladder? Oh… I believe I had… a small procedure on my knee, many years ago. It wasn’t a major surgery, just a… a scope, I think. They said it was to clean up some cartilage. It was quite a long time ago, and I don’t recall many details. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is just not what it used to be. Is this information helpful at all? I apologize for being so… vague. It’s very frustrating for both of us, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Annelle, thank you. A scope on your knee, many years ago. Now, thinking about your family... are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family medical conditions… Oh dear. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart, I believe. And my brother… he had diabetes, I think. But it was quite a long time ago, and I’m not entirely certain. My family is… scattered, you see. I haven’t seen them in many years. It’s difficult to recall details. Honestly, I apologize for being so unhelpful, Doctor. It’s very frustrating for both of us, I’m sure. Are there any specific conditions you’re looking for? Perhaps I can recall more if I know what to focus on.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being unhelpful at all, Annelle. Heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your brother – that’s good information. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Oh dear… what does that entail, exactly? I… I live alone. I’ve never been married. I… I don't really have any close friends or family nearby. I keep to myself mostly. I don't drink alcohol or smoke, never have. I… I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven't been able to do that for some time now. It's not a very exciting history, I'm afraid. Honestly, I apologize for being so… dull. Is this the sort of information you were looking for? I hope this isn't too tedious for you, Doctor. Perhaps we can move on to… to something else?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Annelle. It’s helpful to have a complete picture. You live alone, have never been married, don't drink or smoke, and used to enjoy gardening. That gives me a better understanding. Alright, Annelle. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. We’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs and examine your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor… that sounds alright. I suppose it’s necessary. I… I do feel a bit anxious, if I’m being honest. But… I trust your judgment. Please… be gentle. And if it becomes too uncomfortable, please let me know. Honestly, I apologize for being so… timid. I haven’t been to a doctor in a very long time. I truly hope this doesn’t take too long. Perhaps we could… conclude the examination as quickly as possible?
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. We’ll take it slow and easy, and I’ll explain everything as we go. If anything feels uncomfortable, please tell me immediately. And we'll move as quickly as comfortably possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on that. Pulse and temperature are normal. Your heart and lungs sound good. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but your liver feels a bit enlarged. I don’t feel any other areas of tenderness. Your spleen feels normal. I will now check your reflexes and coordination.
PATIENT: Enlarged liver… oh dear. Is that… serious, Doctor? I… I don't understand. Is it connected to the jaundice? Please… try to explain it to me in simple terms. I… I do feel a bit overwhelmed. Honestly, I apologize for being so… anxious. I wish I could be of more assistance, but my memory is just… so poor. Perhaps it would be best to… to focus on a treatment plan, if that’s possible? I truly hope this doesn't require any… invasive procedures.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Annelle, we'll take it one step at a time. An enlarged liver, called hepatomegaly, can have many causes, and it doesn't automatically mean something serious. It can be connected to the jaundice, as the liver is responsible for processing bilirubin, which causes the yellowing of the skin. However, it can also be caused by other things, like certain medications, infections, or even fatty liver disease. We’ll need to do some further testing to determine the exact cause. The tests will help us understand what’s happening with your liver and decide on the best course of treatment. Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination is only slightly impaired. Okay, Annelle, that completes the physical exam. Now, I would like to order some blood tests, including a liver function panel, a complete blood count, and a bilirubin level. We should also perform an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver and gallbladder. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… ultrasound… oh dear. It sounds… rather extensive. But… I suppose it's necessary, if you think it's best. I do trust your judgment, Doctor. But… will these tests be… painful? And… how long will I have to wait for the results? I… I do worry about being kept waiting for too long. Honestly, I apologize for being such a… a worrywart. Perhaps we could expedite the process, if that’s possible? I truly hope this doesn’t take too long. And… will I need to fast before the blood tests? I do find fasting quite difficult.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Annelle, no need to apologize. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests. The blood tests are not painful, just a quick pinch. We'll draw a small amount of blood from your arm. The ultrasound is also painless; it uses sound waves to create an image of your organs. You will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or drinks except water. I understand fasting can be difficult, but it's important for accurate results. We can schedule the tests for first thing in the morning, so you only need to fast overnight. We can get you scheduled for blood tests and an ultrasound tomorrow morning. The results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… overnight fast… yes, I suppose that’s as good as it will get. A few days for the results… oh dear. That feels like a very long time. But… I trust your judgment, Doctor. Very well. Please… schedule the tests for tomorrow morning. And… can you please send me a reminder, just in case I forget? Honestly, my memory is just… so poor. And… can you explain the treatment plan in simple terms, when we discuss the results? I do worry about understanding all the medical jargon. Perhaps a… a written summary would be helpful? I truly hope this doesn’t involve any… invasive procedures. Thank you, Doctor. I believe that's all for now. I truly hope I haven’t been too much trouble.
DOCTOR: You haven’t been any trouble at all, Annelle. It's perfectly alright to ask questions and express your concerns. I've scheduled your tests for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. Here’s a reminder with the instructions. We’ll definitely discuss the results in simple terms, and I can absolutely provide a written summary for you. And we will cross that bridge when we come to it, but if invasive procedures are needed, we will discuss all the details. For now, try to get some rest and stay hydrated. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before your appointment. Have a good day, Annelle.
