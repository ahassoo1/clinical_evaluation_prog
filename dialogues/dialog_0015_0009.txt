DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… my eyesight, you see. It’s not what it used to be. Frankly, I suspected this was coming, but it’s progressing faster than I’d hoped. It’s a nuisance, really. I’ve always prided myself on having sharp eyes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long have you been noticing this change in your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s been… gradual, you understand. Probably… six months, maybe? But the last month, it’s become… noticeable. More than just needing a stronger prescription for reading, if you follow me. Things are… blurry. And it’s not just up close. Distance is… affected as well. Though, I suppose I haven't been doing much long-distance viewing lately.
DOCTOR: "Not just needing a stronger prescription…" So, you've had glasses or contacts before?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I was quite nearsighted as a boy. Had glasses all through school, then switched to contacts when I was older. Haven’t needed a change in years, though. Until now, apparently. It’s just… frustrating. I always took care of my eyes. Didn’t stare at screens all day like these youngsters do, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. And what do you mean by blurry?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, what do you mean? It's… indistinct. Like looking through a smudged window. Everything lacks…crispness. It's hard to explain. Shapes are there, but the details… they’re just… soft. And sometimes, it’s like there’s a… film over everything. Not a constant thing, mind you. More intermittent. It's particularly bothersome when I'm driving, although I’ve been avoiding that as much as possible recently. One has to be sensible, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… let me consider. No pain, thankfully. No flashing lights or anything dramatic like that. I suppose… sometimes my eyes feel… strained. Especially after reading. Though, that could just be from… concentration, you know. I do a fair amount of paperwork for my work. Human Resources, it is. It requires focus. And… oh. Now that you mention it, I've noticed a bit of… dryness. Not severe, but enough to require the occasional eye drops. Nothing fancy, over-the-counter sort.
DOCTOR: Do you have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, nothing serious. High blood pressure, managed with medication. And… arthritis, getting on in years, you understand. Mostly in my hands. Doesn’t affect my vision, as far as I’m aware. And… I had a bout of the flu last winter, quite nasty it was. But I recovered fully. Though, I do sometimes forget if I’ve taken my blood pressure pills… it happens. Old age, you know. I suppose it's to be expected.
DOCTOR: Any family history of eye problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she wore glasses, yes. Nothing major, just age-related macular degeneration, I believe. And my grandfather… he lost some vision later in life, but I don’t recall the specifics. It was a long time ago. Honestly, my family wasn’t much for talking about these things. Stoic folk, you see. Preferred to suffer in silence. It’s… a generational thing. So, I suppose there could be a history. But nothing definitive, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see… for my blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily. And for the arthritis, I take Ibuprofen, as needed. Usually 800 milligrams, but I try not to take it too often. It upsets my stomach, you see. And… occasionally, I'll take an antacid. For heartburn. Nothing regular, mind you. Just when I eat something… rich. That’s about it, I believe. Though, I do take a multivitamin. For general health.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to perform a basic eye exam now. We'll check your visual acuity, peripheral vision, and look at the health of your eyes. Please follow my instructions carefully. First, can you read the smallest line on this chart with your glasses?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Though I suspect it won't be very good. Let's see… it's… rather blurry, as expected. E… F… P… T… I'm afraid that’s about all I can make out. It's… worse than I thought.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s try without your glasses. Can you read the top line for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… quite difficult. Um… is that an E? Yes, I believe so. Just the one letter, though. The rest is… a blur. A complete and utter blur, Doctor. It seems my eyesight has deteriorated considerably. This is most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I'm going to check your peripheral vision. I need you to focus on this point here, and tell me when you can see my finger in your side vision.
PATIENT: Yes, I’m focused. Now… I… I think I see something… a flicker, perhaps? Over there… on the left. Is that your finger, Doctor? It’s rather faint. It’s… difficult to pinpoint, I must confess. Not as clear as it should be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to use an ophthalmoscope to look at the back of your eyes. This won’t be comfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. …Hmm. I’m seeing some mild drusen in both retinas, and a slight pallor of the optic discs. It could indicate early signs of macular degeneration, and possible glaucoma. This requires further investigation.
PATIENT: Drusen? Pallor? My goodness. Those don’t sound… pleasant. Are you saying I’m going blind, Doctor? I knew I should have taken better care of myself. Though, frankly, I’ve always been quite careful. Is it serious? What needs to be done? And… will I be able to drive? This is most concerning. I have appointments to keep, you know. And a reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, please try to remain calm. I'm not saying you’re going blind. However, these findings do warrant a thorough evaluation by an ophthalmologist. The drusen suggest early age-related macular degeneration, which can affect central vision. The pallor of the optic discs could indicate glaucoma, which affects peripheral vision. It’s important to determine the extent of these conditions, and whether they are progressing. I'm going to order some visual field testing, and an optical coherence tomography scan. These tests will provide a more detailed assessment of your retina and optic nerve. And I will refer you to Dr. Emily Carter, a specialist in retinal diseases. She can discuss treatment options with you, which may include medication, injections, or laser therapy. As for driving, I advise against it until Dr. Carter has evaluated your vision and given you clearance. It’s simply not worth the risk. We need to prioritize your safety, and the safety of others. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Injections? Laser therapy? My goodness. This is… rather more serious than I anticipated. I suppose I understand, Doctor, though I’m hardly pleased about it. I dislike medical procedures of any kind. And the thought of relying on others for transportation… it’s simply… unacceptable. Though, I suppose I have no choice. Visual field testing… and this Dr. Carter… very well. I’ll make the appointments. But I trust this specialist is… competent? I expect a thorough examination, and a clear explanation of my options. And I’d like a second opinion, if you don’t mind. One can never be too careful, you see. This is my eyesight we’re talking about. A rather important asset, I assure you. Please send me the information, Doctor. And make sure it’s a reputable practice.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. This sheet contains the contact information for the imaging center for the visual field testing, and Dr. Carter’s practice. Dr. Carter is highly regarded in the field of retinal diseases. As for a second opinion, that is your right, and I encourage it. I’ll provide you with a list of other specialists in the area. I’ve also included a note detailing the results of today’s examination, and a summary of my concerns. We’ve identified potential issues, but we haven’t reached a definitive diagnosis yet. These tests will provide more information, and guide our treatment plan. Please follow up with these appointments promptly. And do refrain from driving until you’ve been evaluated. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose that will be all for now, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me, though I must confess, the news is… unsettling. I shall schedule the appointments as soon as possible. And I’ll consider the second opinion. I trust this isn’t anything… contagious? I have a rather active social life, you see. And I wouldn’t want to… burden anyone with my ailments. Thank you again, Doctor. I shall be in touch. And please, do send my chart to Dr. Carter’s office. I wouldn’t want there to be any… delays. .
DOCTOR: Not contagious, Mr. Alcorta. I’ve already initiated the chart transfer to Dr. Carter’s office. Please schedule the appointments at your earliest convenience. And do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further concerns. .
