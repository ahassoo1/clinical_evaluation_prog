DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… Beinborn, right? Yes. Well, it’s about this letter. For a pet, you see. A… a certain establishment requires it. Honestly, the fuss people make these days. It’s just a little… companion.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, Dr. Beinborn. And you're right, it is a little unusual for me to be involved with this. So, to clarify, you've received a request – perhaps from a landlord or property management company – requiring documentation for an emotional support animal?
PATIENT: Oh, is that what it's called? Emotional… support? Landlord, yes, that’s it. A very… particular man. Thinks the rules apply to everyone but himself. He just wants a piece of paper, you know? Said he needed proof. Honestly, I don't even know why they need proof. It’s… common sense, really. A person needs a companion.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when requirements seem… unnecessary. So, just to be clear, this animal is providing you with emotional support – helping with your overall well-being?
PATIENT: Well, yes. Of course. Doesn’t everyone need something? It’s… a dog. A lovely dog, actually. Very… well-behaved. Most of the time. Though, truthfully, I can’t recall exactly how it helps. It just… is. A comforting presence, you know? It keeps me… occupied. That’s a good thing, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. It sounds like your dog is a valued companion. To help me complete this evaluation, could you tell me a little more about… what specifically brings you stress or anxiety that your dog helps to alleviate?
PATIENT: Oh, stress. Anxiety. Life, Doctor. Life is stressful. All of it. People, bills, the news… it’s all quite… overwhelming, you know? Honestly, I don't think about it too much. I just… get through it. The dog… distracts me. From everything. I suppose. It’s hard to explain, really. It's not like there's a specific thing. Just… everything.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint the source of stress. Can you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day? Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I wake up… eventually. I have someone who… assists me. She does most things, really. The cooking, the cleaning. I do… things. Appointments. Social engagements. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I try to stay busy. It keeps my mind off things. The dog is usually there. Wandering around. Being… a dog. It's all very routine, you see. Not terribly exciting.
DOCTOR: And when you're feeling particularly stressed or overwhelmed, how does your dog respond?
PATIENT: Respond? Oh, it… exists. That's what it does. It's a comforting presence, you know? It sits there. Sometimes it… wags its tail. Or it… sleeps. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention. It’s just… there. It's not like it performs any tricks or anything. It's just a dog, Doctor. A perfectly normal dog. It doesn't do anything special, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes simply having a companion can be very beneficial. Have you ever spoken with a therapist or counselor about managing stress or anxiety?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Therapists? Counselors? That’s for… other people. I manage perfectly well on my own. Always have. Besides, who has the time for all of that? I have a very busy schedule, you know. Social engagements, appointments… And honestly, I don't particularly enjoy talking about my… feelings. It’s all a bit… undignified, wouldn’t you agree? I prefer to keep things… private.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, sometimes stress and anxiety can manifest physically. Have you been experiencing any headaches, difficulty sleeping, or changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Physical symptoms… Well, I suppose I’m a bit… tired sometimes. But that’s just from all the social engagements, you know? And… my digestion isn’t what it used to be. But that’s probably the food. Honestly, at my age, things just… start to go wrong. It’s perfectly normal. And… My head does… ache occasionally. But it’s just a little thing. Nothing to worry about. It’s all very… minor, really. Nothing that a little rest and a good meal wouldn’t fix.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to do a quick check of your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs, if that’s alright. And perhaps a quick neurological check, just to be thorough. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Really? Is that necessary? I haven't been feeling particularly unwell. Honestly, I don't see the point of all this… poking and prodding. But… If you insist. Just try to be gentle, alright? I have… sensitive skin. And don't take too long. I have a luncheon to attend later.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't like doctors. Too much… touching. Is this going to hurt? And please, don’t wrap it on too tightly. It’s already quite difficult to circulate as it is.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a bit elevated. It's 148 over 92. We can check it again later to see if it’s a one-time reading. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? Is something wrong? I haven’t been feeling unwell. And please, don't use any cold instruments. My chest is rather… sensitive. Are you sure this is necessary? I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Elevated blood pressure means your heart is working a little harder than it should. It doesn't necessarily mean there's something seriously wrong, but it’s something we should investigate further. It could be related to stress, diet, or other factors. Listening to your heart and lungs will help me get a better picture of your overall health. And I assure you, the stethoscope is at room temperature. It won’t be cold.
PATIENT: Crackles? What kind of crackles? Are you saying I have something… bad? I knew I shouldn’t have come here. Is it contagious? I have a luncheon to attend, you know. Very important people will be there. And I certainly don’t want to infect them. This is all very upsetting.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t worry. Crackles can be caused by many things, and they don't always indicate a serious problem. It could be a sign of fluid in the lungs, which can be caused by things like a mild cold or even allergies. It’s too early to say definitively what's going on. To get a clearer picture of what's happening, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. This will help us rule out any potential infections or other underlying conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray?! Blood work?! Absolutely not! I do not like hospitals. Or doctors. Or anything to do with… poking and prodding! I am perfectly healthy! I told you! This is all a waste of time. I think I’ve had enough of this… interrogation. I’m leaving now. And I do not want any letters, or X-rays, or blood work! I just need a letter for my dog. That’s all! .
DOCTOR: Alright, Deloris. I understand your concerns. I won’t force you to undergo any tests you’re not comfortable with. However, without further information, I’m limited in what I can do to provide the documentation you need. I can write a letter stating that you’ve been evaluated, and that you report having a companion animal providing emotional support, but I must include a disclaimer stating that a comprehensive evaluation was not completed due to your concerns about further testing. Would that be acceptable?
