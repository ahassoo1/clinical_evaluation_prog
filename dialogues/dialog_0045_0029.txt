DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Billman. It’s…it's been botherin' me for a bit now. I just don’t seem to be able to eat much before feelin' full. Like, a few bites and I’m stuffed. It’s not a comfortable feelin', and it’s makin' it hard to keep my strength up, you know? Especially at my age.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A few bites and you’re full, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. It’s…hard to explain. It’s not pain, exactly. More like…a pressure, I guess? And it happens pretty quick. Used to be able to put away a good plate of salmon and rice, but now…not so much. It’s worryin’ me a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been goin’ on for, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started, oh, maybe six, eight weeks ago? It wasn't sudden, it just sort of crept up on me. At first I thought it was just ‘cause I was gettin’ old, but it hasn’t gotten any better. If anything, it's a little worse now. My wife, Elsie, she's been makin' me smaller portions, bless her heart. But I still don’t finish ‘em.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the early fullness, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Not really…I’ve been a bit tired lately, but that’s just part of gettin’ older, isn’t it? And maybe a little…gassy, but I always was a bit prone to that. Nothing major, though. No pain, no trouble swallowin', no…well, you know. Just the fullness, really. It’s mostly just worryin’ me, if I’m bein’ honest. I like my food!
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… Elsie keeps sayin’ my pants are gettin’ a little loose. I figured it was just me shrinkin’ with age, but maybe…maybe I have lost a bit of weight. Not a lot, but noticeable, I suppose. I haven’t been weighin’ myself regularly, though. I don't really pay much attention to that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, um… they're…regular enough, I suppose. Not as… solid as they used to be, if I'm bein' truthful. More… loose. And maybe a little less frequent than they used to be. I haven't really thought much about it, to be honest. It's not somethin' I usually talk about, you know? Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be, Mr. Obarr. It’s good you’re tellin’ me all of this. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I had a touch of the flu when I was a boy, and I broke my arm fallin' out of a tree when I was young, but nothin’ serious. I've always been a pretty healthy fella, all things considered. Elsie takes me to the doctor for my check-ups every year, and he always says I’m doin’ alright. Mostly just high blood pressure, he says, but it's under control with the pills he gives me. Nothing else, though. Really. I've been lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Let me think…just those pills, I believe. Elsie manages all my medication. She puts 'em in those little boxes with the days of the week on 'em, so I don't have to worry about it. I just take what she gives me, when she tells me to. Sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis when my joints are achin’ especially bad, but that's just over-the-counter stuff, you know? The kind you can buy at the drugstore. Nothing prescribed, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we get to an exam, I need to ask about your family history. Has anyone in your family had stomach problems, like ulcers or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Um… my mother’s side of the family… now, she had a sister, my aunt Margaret, who was sick for a long time. Elsie says it was somethin’ with her stomach, but I don’t know the details. She passed away a long time ago. And my father, he had a bit of trouble with heartburn, but nothin' serious. Other than that, I don't really know much about my family’s medical history. My family wasn't big on talkin' about that sort of thing. They preferred to keep to themselves. Is that helpful, Doctor? I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's move on to a physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and feel around a bit. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. It's probably nothing, but it's best to check. Please lie back on the exam table.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good, Doctor. Just tell me what you want me to do. I’ll just lie here and try not to wiggle, is that right? Elsie always says I’m a fidgeter. Hopefully I won’t be too much trouble. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Just breathe normally. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. …Okay. A little tenderness here on the left side… not particularly alarming, but we'll note it. And it feels… slightly distended. Still not overly concerning, but…
PATIENT: Okay... yes, that’s a little…sensitive there, on the left side. Not painful exactly, just…uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, maybe? And…distended? I don’t know what that means, Doctor. Does that mean I’m gettin’ fat? Elsie's been makin' me smaller portions, like I said. I feel like I’m full of air sometimes, if that makes sense. .
DOCTOR: “Distended” just means your abdomen is a little swollen, Mr. Obarr. It doesn’t necessarily mean you're gaining weight. It can be caused by a number of things. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline. …Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear… Now, could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Alright, sittin' up now. . Oh, my back’s a little stiff. Old age, I suppose. Everything creaks a bit these days. Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem a little…worried.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to need to order some tests, Mr. Obarr. I want a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool analysis. And, frankly, given your symptoms and the tenderness I’m finding, I’m going to recommend a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. It's the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Now, I know it’s a lot, but it's better to be thorough. We need to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan… that sounds serious, Doctor. What are you lookin’ for, exactly? Is it somethin’ bad? I don’t like the sound of this at all. I’ve never had a CT scan before. And a stool analysis… well, that’s a bit embarrassing, isn’t it? Elsie’s gonna laugh at me. . I just want to know what’s wrong, and I want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, I understand your concern. A CT scan allows us to visualize the organs in your abdomen and pelvis to identify any abnormalities. We're looking for things like tumors, blockages, or inflammation. The stool analysis will help us rule out infections or other digestive issues. It's standard procedure, given your symptoms, and doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. I'm not going to jump to conclusions, but your early fullness, the unintentional weight loss, and the tenderness in your abdomen warrant further investigation. We need to be proactive. I’m going to refer you to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Nakamura. She's an excellent specialist and will be able to interpret the test results and determine the best course of treatment. The CT scan will require a contrast dye, so you'll need to fast for several hours beforehand, and we'll need to check your kidney function first. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay... a gastroenterologist, and a CT scan with dye… Fastin’ for hours… my kidney function… It’s a lot to take in, Doctor. Elsie’s gonna have to take me to all these appointments, I suppose. She’s the strong one, always lookin’ after me. So, you think it could be somethin’ serious? I don’t want to scare Elsie, she worries enough as it is. And what if it is serious? What happens then? I just want to know what I’m dealin’ with. Even if it’s bad news, I’d rather know, you know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, it’s too early to say definitively whether it's serious. We need the test results to get a clearer picture. I understand your anxiety, and it’s natural to be worried. However, catastrophizing won’t help. We're going to take things one step at a time. The gastroenterologist will review your medical history, perform a physical exam, and interpret the test results. She will then discuss your options with you, and we will develop a treatment plan together. I'm going to be frank: your symptoms could indicate a number of possibilities, ranging from relatively benign conditions to something more serious. I’m not going to speculate until we have more information. The purpose of these tests is to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide you with the best possible care. Here is the referral to Dr. Nakamura, and the order for the blood work and CT scan. You’ll need to schedule the appointments. The lab results usually come back in a few days, and the CT scan will take a little longer. Dr. Nakamura’s office will contact you to schedule an appointment once the results are available. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Um… I guess… what if it is cancer, Doctor? Elsie’s mother died of cancer. I don’t want to put Elsie through that again. And… what’s the treatment like? Is it painful? Will I lose my hair? I…I don’t know if I’m strong enough to go through all that. It’s just… it’s all so much. I wish I’d never come to the doctor. Maybe it’s just old age, and I’m just bein’ silly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, let’s not jump to conclusions. As I said, we don't know what's going on yet. Worrying about possibilities won't help. We need to get the tests done first, and then we can discuss a treatment plan if necessary. If it is cancer, there are many different treatment options available, ranging from surgery to chemotherapy to radiation therapy. The side effects vary depending on the type of cancer and the treatment used, but modern medicine has made significant advances in managing these side effects. And frankly, you seem quite resilient. You've lived a long life, and you're here today, seeking care. That takes strength. I'm not going to sugarcoat things, treatment can be challenging, but it's also possible to live a full and meaningful life with cancer. Let’s focus on getting the tests done first. Dr. Nakamura will explain everything in detail and answer all of your questions. She's an excellent doctor, and I'm confident she'll provide you with the best possible care. Here’s a brochure on coping with medical anxiety, and the number for a support group. Take a deep breath, Mr. Obarr. We’re going to take this one step at a time. .
