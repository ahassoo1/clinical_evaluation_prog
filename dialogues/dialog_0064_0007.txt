DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because I am… having pain. It’s been quite bothersome, truthfully. I would like to get it sorted if possible, and quickly if we could.
DOCTOR: Of course. Pain is never pleasant. “Quite bothersome” is a good way to put it. Can you tell me more about this pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… in my back. Lower back, mostly. It started about a week ago, I think. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little ache after I’d been working. But it’s gotten worse each day. Now, even sitting is difficult. I do fence work, you see. It’s… physical. Perhaps that is the cause.
DOCTOR: Fencing, that is physical! Alright, lower back pain that's worsening over the past week, especially with sitting, and you suspect it might be related to your fencing. That's helpful information. Could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. But sometimes it shoots. Like a… a sharp stab. Not constant, thankfully. And it feels… tight. Like the muscles are all knotted up. It’s hard to explain. And it’s worse when I bend over, or try to lift anything. It doesn't really go away, even when I'm resting, but it's less intense then, naturally.
DOCTOR: A dull ache with sharp shooting pains, tightness, and worsened with bending or lifting… that gives me a better picture. Does the pain radiate anywhere – go down your legs, for instance, or into your buttocks?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. It goes down my left leg, mostly. Not all the way to my foot, thankfully. Just… the back of my thigh and into my calf. And yes, also into my… seat. My buttocks, I suppose you would say. It feels like a… a cramping sensation there, sometimes. It isn’t constant, but it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, radiating pain down the left leg, into the thigh and calf, and also cramping sensation in the buttocks. That's important to know. Now, have you noticed anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. Resting helps, a little. Lying down flat. And… warm baths. They ease it temporarily. But it always comes back. I've also tried… rubbing it. Massaging it myself. That doesn't seem to do much good, truthfully. I've tried several times. It just… doesn't change it.
DOCTOR: Rest and warm baths offer some temporary relief, but it returns. Self-massage hasn't been helpful. Alright. To get a clearer understanding, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: I… don't have much of a medical history, thankfully. I’ve been quite healthy, all my life. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course. Measles, mumps… things like that. But nothing serious. I had a broken arm when I was a child, but it healed properly. And… my husband, he passed away five years ago. But that wasn't an injury, of course. Just… old age. I do have Medicare, if that is important. I don't recall any specific conditions, doctor. Never been to a specialist before, as far as I remember.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Reihner. It's good to know you've generally been healthy, and I'm sorry to hear about your husband. Medicare is helpful to have, of course. No specialist visits, that's good to know as well. And no other medical problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else comes to mind. I don't take any regular medications. Just… occasional pain relievers, when the pain gets too bad. Over-the-counter things. Ibuprofen, that sort of thing. Nothing prescribed. I don’t have any allergies that I am aware of. I eat fairly well, mostly. And I don’t smoke or drink. I try to stay active, naturally, with my work, but… this pain is making that difficult. Is there anything else you need to know? I would like to be finished soon, if possible.
DOCTOR: No regular medications, no allergies, healthy lifestyle… that’s all very good to know, Ms. Reihner. And I understand your desire to finish soon. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. It will help me to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. That sounds… sensible. I suppose that is necessary. Please proceed. I would appreciate it if you could be quick, if possible. I have things to attend to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please lie down on the examination table for me. Okay, can you point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: It's… right here. And it radiates… down my left leg, as I mentioned. If you press here… …yes, that’s quite tender. It feels… tight. Like a knot. And when I bend over, like this… …it really aches. It's a sharp pain, then. Do you need me to do anything else?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting tenderness upon palpation in the lower lumbar region, left side. And pain with forward flexion. Let's check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Strength is 5/5 in both legs, also normal. I’m also noting some mild spasm in the lower lumbar muscles on the left side. Can you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes. I can feel it. A… tightening. Like a pulling sensation. It’s most noticeable on the left side, as you said. It's not constant, but… I can feel it now that you mention it. And yes, it feels like it's… tightening up. It's unpleasant. Is that… bad? I would like to know what you think is wrong, doctor. If you have an idea.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination findings – the tenderness, pain with forward flexion, mild spasm, and radiating pain down your leg – it’s likely you have a lumbar strain, possibly with some nerve irritation. It sounds like you may have aggravated it with your fencing. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. To be certain, an X-ray would be helpful to rule out any fracture or other bony abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… I hadn’t anticipated that. Is it… necessary? I would prefer to avoid it, if possible. I don’t like… radiation. But… if you truly think it's necessary to know what's wrong, then… yes, I suppose. But I would like it to be quick, and… the least amount of radiation possible, if that is at all feasible. And do you think… is it serious? I need to know if I need to stop working, doctor. My livelihood depends on it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Reihner. It’s reasonable to be hesitant about radiation. The amount of radiation from a lumbar X-ray is very low, and the benefits of ruling out a fracture outweigh the risks in this case, especially given the radiating pain. Based on the examination, I don’t suspect anything serious. However, the radiating pain is a red flag that warrants further investigation. We need to be certain it's not something more than just a strain. If it is a simple strain, we can develop a plan to get you back to work as soon as possible. Let me get an order for the X-ray, and we can get it done right away. After we review the results, we’ll discuss a plan of treatment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity that aggravates the pain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. I suppose… an X-ray is the sensible thing to do. If you think it is necessary, then I trust your judgment, doctor. I would like to get this sorted quickly, as you know. Yes, avoiding heavy lifting… I can do that. It will be difficult, but I can manage. I’ll rest as much as possible. Please, let me know as soon as you have the results. I am… anxious to know what’s wrong. .
