DOCTOR: Hi Delano, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Delano Alcorta. It’s… well, it’s my sight. It’s not what it used to be, and frankly, it’s becoming rather inconvenient. I suppose that’s putting it mildly.
DOCTOR: Okay, inconvenient… I understand. Can you tell me a little more about what's been going on with your sight?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sudden thing, you understand. It’s been… gradual. Things just aren’t as sharp as they once were. And it’s more noticeable in low light. I used to be able to drive at night without a second thought, now… now I avoid it if at all possible. It's like looking through a haze, sometimes. Though, it's not always there. Is that… helpful? I don’t know much about what causes these things.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, yes. Gradual onset is important to know. And the worsening in low light… that gives us a clue. So, it's not a sudden blurriness, more of a decreasing sharpness, especially when it’s darker?
PATIENT: Precisely. Decreasing sharpness. That’s a good way to put it. And it’s not like both eyes are affected equally, either. My left eye seems… worse, if I’m being honest. Though I can’t rightly say how much worse. I just… notice it more. I suppose I should have paid more attention, but I assumed it was just… age. Or stress. It’s been a trying year.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the left eye is more affected than the right. And you thought it might be age or stress… that’s reasonable. Have you noticed any other changes with your vision at all?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Not… blurriness, exactly. But sometimes, when I look at something, there are… little floaters. Specks, really. They drift around. I’ve always had a few, I think. But they seem more numerous lately. They don’t bother me much, but I’ve noticed them. And, now that you mention it, perhaps colors aren’t as vibrant as they used to be. But I chalked that up to needing new glasses.
DOCTOR: Okay, floaters and a possible decrease in color vibrancy. We’ll definitely check those out. Have you had your eyes checked recently?
PATIENT: That’s a… difficult question. Honestly, no. Not for a good many years. I suppose I should have, but I’ve always been rather… reluctant to go to doctors. I find most of them don’t listen properly, if you understand. And frankly, the expense… it adds up. I haven’t been insured in quite some time, you see. It's just... a bother.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good you're here now. No insurance can make things difficult. Let's take a look at your eyes. I’ll do a basic exam, check your visual acuity, and look at the back of your eyes. It shouldn't take too long. Have you had any other medical problems lately?
PATIENT: Well, my blood pressure has been a bit high, the nurse told me so at the last check-up. But I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything, if that makes sense. Just… a tendency, she said. And my knees ache something awful, especially in cold weather. But again, I haven't bothered with a doctor for that either. Old age, I tell myself. It's all just part of getting older. Is this going to involve… dilation? Because I have a rather important meeting tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and aching knees… noted. And yes, that's a very good question about dilation. I think it's best if we do a quick check without dilation first, just to get a general idea of what’s going on. If I need to get a better look, then we can talk about dilation, and figure out a way to reschedule your meeting if needed. Let's start with checking your vision in each eye, one at a time. Could you read the letters on this chart for me, starting with your right eye?
PATIENT: Very well. That sounds… reasonable. I appreciate you asking first. Alright, let's get on with it. E… uh… F… P… T… Oh, and… L. Is that correct? It’s a bit blurry, I must confess.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct, you got FPTL. It is a bit blurry, you're right. Okay, let's do your left eye now. Again, just read the letters from top to bottom as best you can. Don't worry if you struggle, we're just getting a baseline.
PATIENT: Hmm. This is… considerably worse. Uh… E… and… F… I can’t quite make out the others. They’re just… smudges, really. I can see shapes, but not the letters themselves. It’s quite frustrating. Honestly, Doctor, it’s a bit of a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information. So, significantly reduced vision in the left eye compared to the right. Now, I'm going to shine a light into your eyes and look at the front part of your eye, and then through your pupils to look at the back of your eyes. It won’t hurt, but it might be a little bright. Just look straight ahead and try to relax.
PATIENT: Very well. I’ll attempt to relax. Though I must confess, I’ve always been rather sensitive to bright lights. Just… try not to shine it directly into my soul, if you would. It's a rather unpleasant experience, I assure you.
DOCTOR: I’ll do my best, Mr. Alcorta. Just focus on a spot on the wall. Okay… everything looks clear in the front part of your eyes. Now looking at the back of your eyes… Hmm. I see some mild drusen in both eyes, more prominent in the left. And some slight pigment changes. It doesn’t look like anything acutely concerning, but I do see some evidence of early age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, in both eyes. It’s more advanced in your left eye, which explains the greater vision loss.
PATIENT: AMD? Age-related… macular… degeneration? Is that… serious? I've never heard of it. Is there anything… anything that can be done? I suppose, considering my lack of insurance, that's the most important question. Is it going to leave me completely blind? I need to be able to… well, I need to be able to see.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths, Mr. Alcorta. AMD is very common as people get older – it’s a leading cause of vision loss. It affects the macula, which is the central part of your retina, and that's why you’re noticing difficulty with sharpness and details. The good news is, it doesn't usually cause complete blindness. Vision loss tends to be gradual, and there are things we can do to help slow down the progression. Because you have early AMD in both eyes, but it's more advanced in the left, I recommend a couple of things. First, a high-dose multivitamin with specific formulations for AMD – specifically containing lutein and zeaxanthin. And second, lifestyle modifications – a healthy diet rich in leafy greens, quitting smoking if you smoke, and protecting your eyes from sunlight. Since your insurance situation is limited, we can start with those. I can provide you with some resources on dietary recommendations and affordable sources for the vitamins. We'll want to monitor your vision regularly to see if it's progressing. I would recommend follow-up appointments every six months. Now, to be sure, I'd like to get a more detailed look at your macula with some imaging tests. An optical coherence tomography, or OCT, scan would be very helpful. It's a non-invasive scan that can show us the layers of your retina. Unfortunately, that test is more expensive, and may be difficult to access without insurance. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: OCT scan… more expensive… non-invasive… It sounds… complicated. And expensive, as you say. Lutein and zeaxanthin… I suppose I can manage a multivitamin. I do enjoy a good salad. And I haven’t touched a cigarette in twenty years, thank goodness. But this monitoring… every six months… That’s another expense. And if the test is too costly, what then? Will the AMD simply… worsen unchecked? Is there… anything else I should be aware of? Any warning signs? Is there a point where it becomes… untreatable? I understand you likely can't predict the future, but… a general idea would be appreciated. And are those vitamins… effective? Or is it just a… hope and a prayer?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Alcorta. You're right to ask. Let’s address them one by one. The OCT scan is the best way to monitor the progression of AMD, but it's not strictly necessary if it’s financially prohibitive. We can monitor your vision with regular visual acuity tests, which we can do here at the clinic. It's not as detailed, but it will give us a good indication of any changes. As for warning signs, if you notice any sudden changes in your vision – new floaters, flashes of light, or a dark spot in the center of your vision – you need to seek medical attention immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious problem. Regarding the vitamins, they’ve been shown in several studies to slow the progression of intermediate to advanced AMD. They don't cure AMD, and they won't restore lost vision, but they can help preserve what you have. For early AMD, like yours, the benefit is less certain, but they're generally considered safe and worth trying, especially given the potential benefits. As for a point of untreatability… AMD doesn't typically have a sudden “untreatable” point. It’s a progressive condition, and eventually, vision loss will occur. However, there are treatments available for certain types of AMD – specifically, injections into the eye to stop the growth of abnormal blood vessels. These treatments are expensive and require regular follow-up, but they can significantly improve vision in some cases. Right now, you don't appear to be a candidate for those treatments, but that could change if your AMD progresses. Given your lack of insurance, I can connect you with some resources that may offer financial assistance for the vitamins and potentially for the OCT scan. There are also some non-profit organizations that provide support for people with AMD. Would you like me to provide you with those resources?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Any assistance you can offer would be greatly appreciated. I… I suppose I should have been more proactive about my health years ago. But one puts these things off, doesn’t one? Resources for the vitamins and the scan… and any information on financial assistance… that would be wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. Perhaps… perhaps there is still some hope. I'll need a moment to gather my thoughts, and perhaps write down some questions.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here's some information on the AREDS2 vitamins, which are the specific formulation recommended for AMD. This website has a list of resources for financial assistance with eye care. And this phone number is for a local organization that may be able to help. Take your time, Mr. Alcorta. And don’t hesitate to write down any questions you have. We can go over them together. I’ll also make a note to schedule a follow-up appointment for six months from today, just to check your vision. We can reassess then and decide if the OCT scan is necessary. Do you have any other concerns or questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all for now. Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. You’ve been… surprisingly helpful. And patient, considering. I’ll review these materials and… and hopefully, remain optimistic. I suppose it's best to be prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. I appreciate your time. And your honesty.
