DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and I’ll be your physician today. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me this morning?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s this tiredness. It just won’t go away. And… well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to be concerning, I guess. My daughter insisted I come. Honestly, I don’t see what the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good of your daughter to encourage you to seek medical attention. Persistent tiredness, and this… unusual craving, are certainly things we should investigate. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it's just… all the time. It doesn’t matter if I sleep eight hours, ten hours, it doesn’t help. I wake up feeling like I ran a marathon. And it's not just physical, you know? Like… my brain feels foggy. It's hard to concentrate, hard to remember things… though, I do remember perfectly well when my late husband proposed, 1968, spring, lovely day. But… things lately. Forget what I had for breakfast. It’s irritating.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly frustrating, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I appreciate you describing it so clearly. It's important to differentiate between these types of memory issues. Remembering a significant event like your husband's proposal is excellent – that speaks to long-term memory being intact. The difficulty recalling recent events is what we need to explore further. And regarding this tiredness… has it come on gradually, or was there a specific point when you noticed it starting?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. It wasn’t like bam, suddenly exhausted. More like… slowly getting worse over the last few months. I just thought I was getting old. Which, obviously, I am. Seventy-nine years will do that to a person. I’ve always been active, though. Gardening, volunteering at the church… I haven't stopped doing things, just… everything feels harder now. And I need more naps. Which is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: It's good you've remained active, Ms. Hardenburgh. That's very important. It’s not necessarily ridiculous to need more rest as we age, but a significant increase in fatigue, coupled with the difficulty concentrating and this… craving, warrants a closer look. Could you tell me a bit more about this craving?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s embarrassing, truly. It started with just… a little bit of clay from the garden. I was repotting some flowers and… well, I just put a tiny piece in my mouth. Then another. It just felt… good. Now, I find myself… seeking it out. I know it's strange. And I’ve tried to stop, but it’s… hard to explain. It’s not like I want to eat dirt, it just… feels like something’s missing if I don’t. I mostly get it from the flowerbeds, but a few times I’ve… well, I’ve dug a little bit from the yard. Don’t look at me like that!
DOCTOR: Please, don’t worry, Ms. Hardenburgh. I am not judging you at all. It takes courage to share something so personal. We are here to understand what’s happening and to help you. This craving is quite unusual and a key piece of the puzzle. To help me understand the context, have you experienced any other unusual cravings lately, or any changes in your appetite generally?
PATIENT: No, just the dirt. My appetite’s been… normal, I think. Maybe a little less than usual, but I haven’t been hungry, exactly. I haven’t been wanting sweets or anything like that. And no nausea, no vomiting. Just tired, foggy, and… craving clay. Honestly, I don’t understand what’s going on. I’ve never felt like this before. And I don’t need you to tell me it’s “all in my head” because I know something is wrong.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Ms. Hardenburgh. I would never suggest it’s “all in your head.” You are right to trust your instincts, and I believe you when you say something is wrong. We will investigate this thoroughly. This craving for clay, which we call geophagy, can sometimes be associated with certain nutritional deficiencies. Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Oh, lord. My diet? It’s… boring. I mostly eat what my daughter brings over. She worries about me. She makes casseroles, soups, things like that. I have a little bit of toast with jam for breakfast. Lunch is usually a sandwich, maybe some fruit. Dinner is whatever she brings. I don’t really cook for myself anymore. I used to be a wonderful cook, but… it’s just easier this way. I drink tea, lots of tea. And water. I don’t drink soda or alcohol. Never have. Really, it’s a very plain existence. I don’t eat much red meat. Mostly chicken or fish.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hardenburgh. That gives me a good starting point. I see here that you haven't had a complete blood count in several years. And there are no recent records of iron or vitamin levels being checked. Given your symptoms – the fatigue, fogginess, and this unusual craving – I think it’s important to run some blood tests to check for potential deficiencies. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Honestly, all this fuss over a little tiredness and a bit of dirt? But… fine. Do what you have to do. Just get it over with quickly, please. My daughter will be frantic if I’m gone too long. And I have church on Sunday. I don't want this to interfere with that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hardenburgh. We will make this as quick and efficient as possible. The blood tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure we are providing you with the best possible care. It’s better to rule things out and have a clear understanding of what’s happening. I’ll order a complete blood count, iron studies, vitamin D level, and a thyroid panel. We’ll also check your B12 levels. It will take a few minutes to draw the blood. Afterwards, we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get on with it. I’m ready when you are. And please tell me how long this will take. I really don’t have all day. Stop talking and let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hardenburgh. I apologize if I’ve kept you waiting or seem to be talking too much. We’ll be quick. The phlebotomist will be right in to draw your blood. It should only take about 10-15 minutes for the draw itself, and then we'll need a little bit of time for the blood to process. We should have preliminary results within a couple of business days. I’ll step out to let them know you’re ready. Please just sit comfortably and let me know if you feel unwell at any time.
PATIENT: Finally. .
