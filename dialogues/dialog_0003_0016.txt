DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I'm Dr. Yackey. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary, but this bruising… it's getting ridiculous. My wife, God rest her soul, always said I bruise like a peach, but this is beyond normal. I'm on that blood thinner, you know, the one they gave me after the… well, never mind. It's just… a lot more than usual, even for me.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we’ll get to the bottom of it. You mentioned a blood thinner… which one, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? I have no idea what it’s called. They just give me the little orange bottle every month at the pharmacy. It's… Warfarin, maybe? Something like that. My wife always handled the medications. I just take the pills. Is it really that important what name it is? Shouldn't you know that already if you’re my doctor?
DOCTOR: It is rather important, Mr. Farson. There are several blood thinners, and they interact differently. Knowing the specific medication allows us to assess the dosage and potential complications accurately. Do you happen to recall the pharmacy's name?
PATIENT: Honestly, I go to the one in town. You know, the big one, next to the grocery store? Ramirez Pharmacy, I think? It’s… it’s a small town. There’s only one decent grocery store and one pharmacy. I doubt they keep track of which blood thinner I get, exactly. They just hand me a bag. This is… frankly, a bit much. I came in because I'm bruising, not to play twenty questions about pill bottles.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. The record does indicate a Warfarin prescription, filled monthly at Ramirez Pharmacy. Dosage is… 5 milligrams. And you’ve been taking this dosage consistently?
PATIENT: Look, I take one pill every day, like they told me. Every. Single. Day. I haven't changed a thing! Maybe it's a bad batch? Or maybe I'm just getting older. Though, frankly, I was bruising less before I started coming here. No offense. But I haven't altered my routine, and I assure you, I'm not secretly enjoying a hobby of self-inflicted injuries. It’s the bruising, Doctor. It's getting out of hand.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Farson, simply taking the medication isn’t enough. There are factors beyond that. Diet, other medications, even supplements can interfere. Let’s have a look at these bruises. Multiple ecchymoses noted on bilateral forearms and lower legs, varying in size and color, consistent with varying stages of healing. No acute signs of trauma or swelling. Skin is warm and dry to the touch. Do you experience any pain or tenderness with these bruises?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little achy sometimes, like a… a dull throb, but nothing you’d write home about. And look, I eat a normal diet. Steak, potatoes, the occasional salad. I don’t take any supplements. I stopped with all that nonsense years ago. My wife was always into that stuff, but I found it… well, a waste of money. I really don’t understand why we're going through all this. Are you suggesting I'm lying about the steak? Or that I'm secretly a fruitarian? Honestly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I am not suggesting you are being untruthful. I am simply attempting to gather a comprehensive history. Have you noticed any other unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: Unusual symptoms? What do you mean? I’m an old man, Doctor. Everything aches. But… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit more tired lately. Just… generally run down. And my gums… they bleed a little when I brush my teeth. It’s nothing major, just a spot of red in the sink. But it's been happening more frequently. Is that… important? Frankly, it all seems connected to this Warfarin business. It's never been this bad before.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and gingival bleeding… those are relevant. It sounds as though your INR may be elevated. Do you have any idea what an INR is?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I'm a pathologist, not a hematologist. I look at tissues under a microscope, I don't memorize acronyms. I know it has something to do with blood clotting, but that's about it. I expect you to know what it is, not me. I came here because I’m bruising like a ripe plum, and now I'm tired and my gums are bleeding. I’m not here for a medical quiz. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Perhaps a simple blood test would be more productive than questioning my dietary habits and my understanding of obscure medical terms.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Farson. We will run a complete blood count and an INR. However, I must advise you that unexplained bruising and bleeding require a thorough investigation. We need to rule out other potential causes. Do you have any family history of bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. My mother lived to be 92, perfectly healthy. My father… well, he died of a heart attack. Nothing like this. We're a sturdy Guatemalan stock, Doctor. We don't bleed easily. This all started after I started seeing you. I’m telling you, something’s not right with that medication, or… well, I don't know. But it's definitely not a family trait. And honestly, I'm starting to get quite annoyed with this line of questioning. Can we please just run the test and get some answers? I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: Fine, Mr. Farson. We’ll order the tests. The lab results should be available within 24-48 hours. I will also refer you to a hematologist for further evaluation. They will be able to provide a more comprehensive assessment and determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. Schedule the appointment, and please bring a list of all medications you are currently taking. That includes anything over the counter. .
