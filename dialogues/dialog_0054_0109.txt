DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head... back of my head... it hurts. Been hurting for... maybe three days now? Not real bad all the time, but it's there. Like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache at the back of your head for about three days. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. It doesn’t… throb. It’s not a sharp pain. Just… heavy. And sometimes, when I move my neck, it feels… worse for a second. Not a lot, but I notice it. I been trying to take some… pills. The white ones. From the store. They help a little, but not much.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s a heavy ache, not throbbing or sharp, and it’s aggravated by neck movement. You’ve been trying over-the-counter pain relievers – the white ones, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, the white ones. Like… for headache, you know? From the… Walgreens. I forget the name. I take two, maybe three times a day. Like the box says. They don't really fix it. Just… take the edge off, a little bit. I used to work with the trains, you see. Lots of bending and looking around. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, you've been taking over-the-counter pain relievers as directed, but they're not providing much relief. And you mentioned a history of work with the trains, involving a lot of bending and looking around. That's helpful information. Before we go any further, can you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm. Other symptoms… Let me think. No… no blurry vision. No dizziness. Not sick to my stomach. Just… tired. I'm always tired, but maybe more so these past few days. And… sometimes my hands feel a little… numb. Not all the time, just… when I’m sitting for a long time. Like when I’m eating. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. So, no blurry vision, no dizziness, no nausea. Increased fatigue and some numbness in your hands when sitting for prolonged periods. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, the doctor back home… a long time ago… he said my blood pressure was a little high. I think. He gave me some pills, but… I didn’t like them. Made me feel funny. So I stopped taking them. And… I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. That's about it, I think. Nothing else. Not really a sick man, you know? I just… get old. Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: Getting older is a condition, Mr. Brum, in the sense that it brings changes with it! It’s good you told me about the high blood pressure and that you stopped taking the medication. Do you remember what the doctor told you about why your blood pressure was high?
PATIENT: No… I don’t remember the why. Just… he said it was too high. He told me to… watch my salt. And… get more exercise. But working with the trains… didn’t leave much time for exercise. Lots of lifting and… walking, but not the kind he meant, I think. It was a different kind of tired. And… I haven’t seen a doctor in… a long, long time. Maybe twenty years? More?
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past, with advice about diet and exercise, but you haven’t seen a doctor regularly for quite some time. Let's talk about your family. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had similar headaches, or any other medical conditions like high blood pressure, heart problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family… My wife, God rest her soul, she got headaches sometimes. Real bad ones. She used to lay down in a dark room. Never went to the doctor for them, though. She said they just… went away. My brother… he had a heart problem. I think. He lived in the city. I didn't see him much. And… I had a son. He lives in America. I don't hear from him often. Don't know much about his health.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of headaches in your wife and a heart condition in your brother. And limited information about your son’s health. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I live alone now. I mostly stay at home. I like to listen to the radio. And… I try to walk a little bit. Just around the block. Not much further. I eat… simple food. Soup, bread, rice. I don't drink much alcohol. Maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes. And… I don't smoke. Never did. I try to be good.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Brum. You live a relatively quiet lifestyle, eat a simple diet, and don't smoke or drink heavily. Finally, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the white pills for the headache, like I said. Sometimes, I take a little something for my… stomach. It's an old medicine. From Mexico. My wife brought it back. But I don’t take it often. Just when my stomach really bothers me. It's… brown, I think. Small little pill. That’s all. I don’t like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the headache pills and an occasional stomach remedy from Mexico. Alright, Mr. Brum, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, okay? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your blood pressure. After that, I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I’ll do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Your heart sounds are a little…distant, but no immediate concerns. Your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is elevated: 160/95. That confirms what the doctor told you a long time ago. Now, I’ll take a look at your ears, nose and throat... Your ears look clear. Your nose is slightly congested, but nothing significant. Your throat looks a little dry. Now for the neurological exam. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. I can follow your finger. It’s a little hard… my eyes get tired easily, you know? But I’m trying.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It is a little slow, but understandable. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Like this? Is that okay? It feels a little… stiff, you know? My hands aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. A little weaker than expected, but not alarming. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes. I’m going to touch your feet with this… And… now the other foot. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Alright, Mr. Brum, thank you for your cooperation. That was helpful. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, several things could be going on. The headache, the fatigue, the numbness in your hands, and the elevated blood pressure all point to a few possibilities. It could be related to tension, age-related changes, or potentially something more. Given your long history of untreated high blood pressure, and the diminished reflexes, I’m concerned about possible early signs of vascular issues. It's important to rule those out.
PATIENT: Vascular issues? What does that… mean? Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: It means there may be some narrowing of the blood vessels, possibly affecting blood flow to your brain and extremities. It can be serious, but we don’t know that’s what’s going on yet. That’s why we need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture. It's important to be proactive and rule things out. To start, I'd like to order a complete blood count to check your overall health and rule out any underlying infection. I also want to do a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Most importantly, I’d like to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm and rule out any cardiac issues. And finally, I think a CT scan of your brain would be prudent to rule out any structural problems or signs of stroke. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: CT scan…? That sounds… complicated. And expensive, maybe? I don’t have much money, Doctor. And… what if it is bad? What if it’s something… serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brum. You're right, a CT scan is a more involved test. As for the cost, we can discuss options with the hospital financial assistance program. They often have programs to help patients who are uninsured or have limited income. We’ll work with them to find a solution. And regarding what if it is something serious… We’ll address it together, one step at a time. If there is an issue, the earlier we detect it, the better the chances of successful treatment. The scan will give us valuable information, and then we can formulate a plan. It doesn’t necessarily mean it is something serious, but we need to know for sure. I also want to emphasize that I’m here to support you through this process. We won’t rush into anything, and I’ll explain everything clearly along the way. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a medication to help manage your blood pressure. It’s a low dose, and we’ll monitor it closely. I'm also going to recommend you start taking a daily aspirin, if you're not allergic, which can help prevent blood clots. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Aspirin…? I think my wife used to take aspirin… But I don’t know if I’m allergic… And… the blood pressure medicine… Will it make me feel… funny? Like when I took the pills the doctor gave me a long time ago?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. It's important to address your concerns about allergies and side effects. Before we start you on the aspirin, I'll ask you a few questions to assess your risk of allergic reaction. Have you ever had any reactions to other medications before?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, not that I remember. Except for those blood pressure pills. They made me feel… dizzy. And kind of sick to my stomach. Like a weight on my chest. And… I don’t think I’ve ever been allergic to anything else. Not food, not plants, not… anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Given your previous reaction to the blood pressure medication, we will be very cautious with the new medication. The one I’m going to prescribe is a different type, and we’ll start with a very low dose. We’ll monitor your blood pressure closely, and if you experience any dizziness, nausea, or any other concerning symptoms, you should stop taking it immediately and contact me. To be safe, I will also recommend you avoid taking aspirin until we can get a more detailed medical history. Now, I want to schedule a follow-up appointment with you in one week to check your blood pressure and discuss the results of the blood tests. How does that sound?
PATIENT: One week…? Okay. That sounds alright. I hope it’s not… bad news. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for being patient with an old man.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It’s my job. And please, don’t worry. We’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll write you a prescription for the blood pressure medication, and I'll give you a list of instructions. I’ll also schedule that follow-up appointment for you now. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your appointment. And remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week.
