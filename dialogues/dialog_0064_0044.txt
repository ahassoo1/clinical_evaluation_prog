DOCTOR: Good morning, Calin. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Smetak. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I'm hoping to find out if I qualify for some home health assistance. Or, maybe hospice care, if that’s what’s needed. It’s a bit…complicated, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Complicated is alright. We’ll take it one step at a time. Home health or hospice… that sounds like something we should definitely explore. To understand what might be best for you, could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Well… it’s my mother, mostly. She’s been getting… weaker. She’s 87, and she’s always been very independent, but lately she’s needing a lot more help with everything. Just getting out of bed, bathing… things like that. And she’s been a bit confused sometimes, forgetting where she is, or who I am. It’s really worrying me, you see. I’m trying to manage, but I work full time pressing clothes, and it’s… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy load, trying to balance work and care for your mother. It’s good you came in. Let’s start with your mother. Has this weakness and confusion come on suddenly, or has it been a gradual process?
PATIENT: It’s definitely been gradual, Doctor. Over the last… maybe six months or so? At first, it was just little things – misplacing her glasses, forgetting a name here or there. But it’s gotten steadily worse. Now, some days she doesn't even recognise me when I first arrive at her house. It’s… heartbreaking. And she falls easily, even with help sometimes. That's what really scared me into calling for this appointment. I’m so afraid she’ll have a serious injury.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of gradual decline, with increasing confusion and falls. That’s important information. And the falls are certainly concerning. Has she seen a doctor recently for these issues?
PATIENT: Yes, she did. About three months ago, she saw Dr. Ramdial. He ran some tests, and he said… well, he said it was likely age-related decline, and maybe a little bit of dementia. He prescribed something for her memory, but it hasn’t really seemed to help much, you know? It made her a bit drowsy, mostly. And she didn’t want to keep taking it because of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so she was seen by Dr. Ramdial three months ago, diagnosed with possible dementia, and tried a medication that didn't agree with her. Do you happen to know the name of the medication she was prescribed?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, no I don't. She handles all her own appointments and paperwork, always has. I just drove her there and back. She would have told me if she remembered the name, but… well, with her memory being what it is, it’s hard to say. She did mention something about a little white pill, that’s all I recall. Sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Calin. It’s perfectly understandable. We can often work with limited information. A little white pill… that narrows it down a bit, but it’s not very specific. Let's focus on what you do know. Besides the confusion and falls, has she been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… she’s been eating less lately. She used to love her food, really enjoy a good meal, but now she just picks at it. And she’s sleeping a lot more during the day, even though she has trouble sleeping at night. She gets agitated easily, too, especially towards the evenings. We call it ‘sundowning’, I think. She’ll get confused and upset, and sometimes even a little aggressive. It’s very difficult to manage.
DOCTOR: Eating less, increased daytime sleep, nighttime restlessness, and ‘sundowning’… those are all things we need to consider. Has she had any recent weight loss that you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. She's lost a good bit of weight. I hadn’t really thought to mention it, but now that you ask… she’s probably lost about fifteen pounds in the last couple of months. Her clothes are getting looser, and her face looks… thinner. It worries me a lot. She barely has an appetite anymore.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds in two months is significant, Calin. That, combined with everything else you’ve described, is concerning. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam with your mother, if that’s alright with you. Just to check her overall health and get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be possible?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps, I’m happy for you to examine her. She’s at her house right now, and I can arrange to bring her in tomorrow morning, if that suits you? I’ll need to clear my schedule at work, but I can manage. Just let me know what time would be best.
DOCTOR: That would be excellent. Tomorrow morning works perfectly. How about 9:00 AM?
PATIENT: 9:00 AM sounds good, Doctor. That gives me time to get her ready. Is there anything I should bring with me? Any paperwork or… anything at all? I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you to ask. If you have any of her recent medical records – anything from Dr. Ramdial, even just a summary of her visit – that would be helpful. Also, a list of all her current medications, including dosages. If you don’t have those readily available, don’t worry. We can try to obtain them from Dr. Ramdial’s office. Just bring your mother, and we'll take it from there. Is there anything else on your mind before we finish for today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you for being so thorough, and for listening to me. I feel a little bit better just having talked through it all with someone. I’m still worried, of course, but I appreciate your help. See you tomorrow then, at 9:00 AM?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Calin. I’m glad I could help, even a little. And don’t worry, we’ll do our best to figure things out. Yes, tomorrow at 9:00 AM. Please bring your mother, and we’ll get started. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions before then. Have a good evening.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Smetak. You too.
