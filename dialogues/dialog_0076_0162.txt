DOCTOR: Right. Lawton Kristofik… forty years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It’s… my stomach. It’s been puffed up, like a balloon. Honestly, it’s embarrassing. I just want it to stop. Don’t need a whole life story asked of me, alright?
DOCTOR: “Puffed up,” you say. Okay, okay. And how long has this “puffing up” been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, I dunno. A while. Weeks, maybe? Honestly, time kinda… blurs. It comes and goes. Some days it’s fine, some days I look six months pregnant. It’s just… annoying. Is that all you need to know? Because I got stuff to do.
DOCTOR: “Annoying” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Kristofik. Weeks, you say… and does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Look, I eat, I work, I sleep. What do you want me to say? Maybe… beans? I had some beans last week. But I eat beans all the time! It shouldn’t be the beans. This is ridiculous. I’m a pile driver operator, not a delicate flower. I need to know if this is something serious, or if I'm just wasting my time.
DOCTOR: A pile driver operator… right. And aside from the beans, anything else you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Nothing. I feel… normal. Except for the stomach, obviously. I don’t have… I don’t know… fancy symptoms. No pain, no… I don’t even know what other symptoms there are. Just… puffy. Can we just skip to whatever test you need to do? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen, then. Lie down on the table, please. I need to check your abdomen. Don't relax too much, just… natural positioning.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Get it over with. And try not to poke too hard, alright? I've got a hard day's work ahead of me.
DOCTOR: Okay… a little tender here, on the left side. Not acutely painful, but… distended. No masses that I can feel right now. Bowel sounds are… present, but a bit… sluggish. Hmm. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting? No. Look, I’m a practical man. I don’t… do vomiting. Nausea… sometimes, maybe? But that’s just from being tired, alright? It’s hard work, swinging a pile driver all day. Not everything is a medical emergency. Is this taking long?
DOCTOR: Right. And your bowel movements… regular?
PATIENT: Regular? Look, when I gotta go, I go. What kind of question is that? It’s not like I’m keeping a schedule, alright? Sometimes it’s easier, sometimes it’s… not. Is everything a problem? This is getting ridiculous. I swear, I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I'm trying to gather information. “Sometimes easier, sometimes not” isn’t helpful. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! No blood. Look, I’m telling you, I feel fine! Except for the stomach puffing up. I’m a strong guy, alright? I don’t… I don’t deal with fancy medical problems. This is probably just… gas. Can we just agree it’s gas and be done with it? I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your… vague description and insistence on everything being normal, I’m going to order a basic blood panel and a stool sample just to rule things out. It’s standard procedure. If you continue to experience this bloating, or if it gets worse, especially if you see blood, you need to come back immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Blood test, stool sample… Just get it over with. I don’t have time for this, but if it makes you happy… Just tell me where to go, alright? And make it quick. I haven't got all day, you know. .
DOCTOR: The nurse will take you to the lab. She’s just outside. And Mr. Kristofik… try to be a little more forthcoming next time. It helps me help you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. .
