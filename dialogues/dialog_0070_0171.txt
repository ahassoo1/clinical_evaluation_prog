DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Abady. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Um… my nails. They look… funny. Not good funny, bad funny. I don’t really… remember what happened. Just noticed they are… different. They always were kinda weak, if I’m honest. Not strong like a man's nails, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. You've noticed a change in your nails – they appear different than usual, and you’ve always considered them to be somewhat weak. Can you describe what "different" looks like, specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, they're… stripey. Like, lines going down them. And one of them… I think it’s kinda thick, not flat. I don't know, it's hard to explain. I don’t stare at my nails, Doctor. I got things to do, you know? It’s not like I’m one of those women.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you describing it for me, Ms. Thut. Stripey, with lines, and one nail feeling thicker than the others – that gives me a better idea. It’s perfectly alright that you don't regularly examine your nails; you came here because you noticed a change, and that’s what’s important. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me if this change happened suddenly, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Not like… boom, overnight. More like… slowly, over time. I don't really pay attention, like I said. Maybe a few months? It’s hard to say, honestly. I been busy with… things.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over a few months. And have you noticed any other changes related to your nails or hands?
PATIENT: Other changes? Let me think… not really. They don’t hurt, if that’s what you mean. Sometimes they break, like always, but that's just 'cause they’re weak. I use hand lotion sometimes, but… not always. I forget, you know? It's just nails, Doctor. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear they aren’t painful, Ms. Thut. And I understand your concern – you're wondering if this is something serious. It's always best to investigate changes like these, just to be sure. To get a clearer picture, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what kinda symptoms? I just… feel old sometimes, if that counts. My knees ache, but that's just from… livin', you know? I get tired easily. And sometimes I have a little trouble… remembering things. Is this gonna take long, Doctor? I got a… appointment later.
DOCTOR: I understand you're concerned about the time, Ms. Thut, and I'll do my best to be efficient. The knee pain and fatigue are helpful information, and the occasional memory trouble, too. These things can sometimes be connected. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. I get Medicare, if that means anything. I don't really… go to the doctor much. I used to have… something with my blood pressure, maybe? The doctor gave me pills for it, but I stopped takin’ them. Made me feel funny. It wasn’t that bad, you know? I felt better without 'em.
DOCTOR: Thank you for telling me that. It's good to know about the past blood pressure issue and that you stopped taking the medication due to side effects. To clarify, do you recall why you were prescribed those blood pressure pills in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… I think… my husband used to take me to the doctor. He did all the listenin' and rememberin'. He said my numbers were… high. But he's… gone now. It was a long time ago. I really don't remember much about it. I just know I didn't like the way the pills made me feel. They made me sleepy, I think. Is this important, Doctor? Seriously?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Thut. It's completely understandable that you don't remember the specifics, and I apologize for asking you to recall something difficult. It is important information, as high blood pressure can sometimes be related to changes in the nails. Now, aside from the blood pressure, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. Just… the usual old lady stuff. Aching knees, tired all the time… sometimes I get a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. But that’s just age, you know? Can we just look at my nails now, Doctor? This is makin’ my head hurt.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Thut. We can definitely take a look at your nails now. I just wanted to get a better understanding of your overall health first. If you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then take a closer look at your hands and nails. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… don't take too long. And be gentle, okay? My skin is sensitive. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Thut. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your blood pressure is a little elevated, at 140/90. Now, looking at your nails… I do see some vertical ridges – those are common as we age. However, I also notice some horizontal lines, or striations, across several of your nails, and one nail does appear noticeably thickened. These changes, along with your history of fatigue and occasional dizziness, warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Investigation? What kinda investigation? Do I have… something bad? Is it contagious? Oh, goodness. I don’t want to catch nothin’. This is just nails, Doctor! It can't be serious! I don’t need a lot of tests. I hate tests!
DOCTOR: Please, try not to worry, Ms. Thut. "Investigation" simply means we’ll run a few tests to help us understand what's causing these changes. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. There are several possibilities, and we need to rule them out. The horizontal lines can sometimes be associated with underlying medical conditions, such as anemia, thyroid problems, or even nutritional deficiencies. The thickened nail could be a fungal infection, but we need to confirm that. I would like to order a complete blood count to check for anemia, a thyroid stimulating hormone test to assess your thyroid function, and a nail fungus culture to rule out a fungal infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… tests… Oh, goodness. Fine. Whatever. But I don't wanna go to a lot of different places. Can they do it all here? And how long is this gonna take? I have things to do, you know! And who's gonna pay for all this? Medicare?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Thut, we can do all of these tests right here in the clinic. We have a laboratory on-site, so you won't have to go anywhere else. The blood draw will take just a few minutes, and the nail fungus culture involves taking a small scraping from your nail, which is quick and painless. The results usually take about a week to come back. And yes, Medicare should cover all of these tests, as they are medically necessary. Our billing department will handle the paperwork, but if you have any concerns, they can assist you. In the meantime, while we’re waiting for the results, I’d like you to try to maintain a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and get enough rest. If you notice any changes in your nails or experience any new symptoms, please let me know right away. Do you have any questions about the tests or anything we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: Healthy diet… hydrated… I try. Sometimes I forget to drink water. And I like my sweets, you know? No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just… get it over with, okay? I wanna go home. Are we done here soon?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Let's go ahead and get the blood draw done, and then the medical assistant will collect a sample from your nail. It won't take long. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them thoroughly and develop a plan to address any underlying issues. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you may have along the way. .
