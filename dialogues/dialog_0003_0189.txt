DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I am Dr. Yackey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, it's about my, uh… my business. Down there. Been seeing a bit of red when I… you know. Not a good colour, that. Especially for a man my age. Shouldn't be happening.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood in the stool. Not ideal, certainly. And you say this is… recent?
PATIENT: Recent? Oh, I don’t know about ‘recent’. It’s been… a spell. A few weeks, maybe? Hard to keep track when you've lived as long as I have. Doesn't mean it's normal, mind you. It's just… happening. And frankly, I expect better from my body at this point. Used to be a strong man, you know. Flew planes all over the world. A copilot. Not one of these newfangled pilots who just push buttons.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. A change in bowel habits, especially with bleeding, warrants investigation. Have you noticed any changes in the consistency of your stool?
PATIENT: Consistency? What do you mean, consistency? It’s… poop. What is this, an interrogation? It goes in, it comes out. Sometimes it’s hard, sometimes it’s soft. Lately, it’s been… a bit looser than usual, I suppose. And with the red, of course. Don't you doctors ask simple questions anymore?
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Rowbottom, these questions are pertinent. Looser stools and blood. Right. Any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Abdominal… pain? Not a sharp pain, no. More of a… discomfort. Like I ate something that didn't agree with me. Happens now and then. Though I haven't eaten anything particularly… exotic lately. Just the usual. Toast, mostly. And tea. A man needs his tea. Is this getting us anywhere, or are we just talking about my breakfast?
DOCTOR: Toast and tea. Very well. And has there been any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now that you mention it… my trousers have been feeling a bit looser around the waist. Though that could just be old age, couldn’t it? Everything starts to sag eventually. It's a fact of life. I haven't been trying to lose weight, if that's what you're asking. Just… existing. It's hard to keep track of these things, honestly. I don’t go weighing myself every day like some people I know. A waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of colon cancer or other gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: Gastro… what now? Look, my family mostly died of old age, or accidents. My Uncle George fell off a roof, my Aunt Mildred choked on a fish bone… not much talk of fancy illnesses when I was growing up. We were a hardy bunch. No one sat around complaining about their… insides. Besides, my mother didn’t talk much about anyone's insides. Rude, if you ask me. So, no, I wouldn't know a gastro… thingy from a hole in the ground. Now, are we going to do something about this red stuff, or just keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: Very well. I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, Mr. Rowbottom. Just a basic abdominal palpation and a rectal exam. It's standard procedure. It will help me determine the next course of action. If you'll excuse me for a moment.
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Now you’re just being ridiculous. I’m an old man, Doctor, not a… a specimen. But fine. Get it over with. Just don't go poking around too much. And be quick about it. I haven't got all day. And I expect a full explanation afterwards. No mumbling fancy words, understand?
DOCTOR: Right. If you could lie on your left side, please. I will be brief, Mr. Rowbottom. Okay. I'm feeling some tenderness in the lower abdomen, and… yes, there appears to be some blood present. Not a large amount, but enough to warrant further investigation. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary examination, I recommend a stool test to check for occult blood and a colonoscopy to visualize the colon. It’s the most thorough way to determine the cause of the bleeding.
PATIENT: Colonoscopy? Now hold on a minute. You’re going to stick a camera up my… there? That sounds… unpleasant. And what about the stool test? Is that going to involve… giving samples? Honestly, Doctor, I came in here with a bit of red in my business, not to be subjected to… indignities. What exactly are we looking for, and is there anything else we can do? I’d rather not have a camera where the sun doesn't shine, if you understand me. .
