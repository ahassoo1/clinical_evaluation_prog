DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's... about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. I think I’m here for an evaluation before that happens? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. My wife did most of the arranging.
DOCTOR: Surgery, you say. Alright. And your wife arranged this consultation… so you’re considering bariatric surgery?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Bariatric… that’s the weight loss surgery, isn’t it? She said something about needing to be checked out first. I don't really… remember all the details. It’s been a lot. I just… I want to feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand wanting to feel better, Mr. Kochubey. However, surgery is a significant undertaking, and a thorough evaluation is absolutely essential. We need to determine if you are a suitable candidate, and rule out any underlying conditions that might complicate things. Let's start with some background. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: A primary… doctor? Hmm. I used to, back home… but it's been a while. Not since we moved, I don't think. Honestly, things are a little blurry. I mostly just… deal with things as they come up. Does that make sense? I haven’t really needed a regular doctor, until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s… not ideal, but we can work with it. So, you haven't had a physical examination in quite some time. And no regular medical care since moving… I see. Let’s start then with a comprehensive review of your medical history, as best you can recall. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Wow… that’s… a lot to think about. I don't think so? I mean, nothing major. I get tired easily, sometimes. And my knees bother me, especially when it rains. But… diagnosed? No, I don’t think so. Back home, we didn’t really go to the doctor unless it was really bad. Does that make sense? It’s all a bit of a… mess, in my head.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Kochubey?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. Not that I remember, anyway. Maybe when I was a little kid? But nothing… serious. My wife would probably know more about that, if you need to be sure. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills, if I can help it. Just…try to get through things on my own, usually. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, no. I mean, sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I’m out in the sun, but that’s just a sunburn, I think. Nothing… serious. I’ve never had a really bad reaction to anything. Does that help? It's hard to remember, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. Now, let's discuss your current health. You mentioned wanting to feel better. Can you elaborate on your symptoms?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Well, I get tired really easily, like I said. And my knees, they bother me a lot. Especially when I walk. It’s hard to keep up with my grandkids, you know? And… I get out of breath pretty easily. Even just climbing the stairs. And, of course, the weight. It’s just… getting harder and harder. It makes everything else worse. It’s just… exhausting, Doctor. Honestly. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: I see. So, fatigue, knee pain, shortness of breath, and, of course, your weight. And you’ve noticed this has been progressively worsening. Before we proceed further, Mr. Kochubey, do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, no, never. I don’t smoke. My wife… she wouldn’t allow it. She’s very health-conscious. No, I’ve never been a smoker. I don’t like the smell of it. And it's bad for you, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… uh, sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, on a special occasion. Not every night, though. Definitely not every night. My wife and I, we don’t really drink much. A little bit, to relax, maybe. But nothing serious. Is that okay? I don't want to make a big deal out of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. Now, let's discuss your diet and exercise habits. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Oh… uh. That’s… not a good question. Well, my wife does most of the cooking. I eat what she makes. It’s usually… rice and chicken, sometimes lamb. But I… I eat a lot of it. And I like sweets. A lot. I have a sweet tooth, you know? I don’t really… cook for myself. And I don't really pay attention to portions, I guess. It's just… easier that way.
DOCTOR: And what about exercise, Mr. Kochubey?
PATIENT: Exercise… uh. Not much. I used to walk a little bit, before my knees started bothering me. But now… it’s hard. Really hard. I try to do a little bit around the house, you know? Gardening, maybe. But it's not… regular. I mostly just sit, to be honest. It's easier on my knees. I know I should exercise more. I just… haven't been able to. It's painful. Really painful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, I need to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That’s… fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle with my knees, please? They really bother me. I’m not a fan of doctors, if I'm being honest, but I want to get this done. So, yeah. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are… regular. No murmurs detected. Lungs are… clear bilaterally, though breathing is slightly labored. Blood pressure is elevated… 150/90. Abdomen is… soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the upper quadrants. No masses palpated. Knees exhibit crepitus and limited range of motion. There is mild swelling and tenderness to palpation. I’m detecting some crepitus in your knees, and they are quite tender. Your blood pressure is also elevated. I'd like to order some routine blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and thyroid panel. We also need to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions, so I'm going to order an ESR and CRP. I'd also like to get an X-ray of your knees.
PATIENT: Uh… okay. That’s… a lot of tests. Is something wrong, Doctor? Are my knees really bad? And… what’s a metabolic panel? And… CRP? I just… I don’t understand all this medical stuff. Is it going to be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, I understand your concern. The tests are simply to get a baseline understanding of your overall health and identify any potential contributing factors to your weight and symptoms. A metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. The lipid panel checks your cholesterol levels. And the CRP and ESR are indicators of inflammation in the body. As for the cost, I cannot provide an exact estimate. However, the lab will likely offer a self-pay discount. And we can discuss options if the cost is prohibitive. For now, let's focus on getting these tests completed. The lab is located down the hall. They will send the results to me, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, I think so. Tests… down the hall… they’ll send the results… and then another appointment. It’s just… a lot to take in. Can my wife come with me to the next appointment? She’s really good at remembering things. And… she can help me understand what you mean. I just… I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kochubey, your wife is welcome to accompany you to the follow-up appointment. In fact, I encourage it. It’s helpful to have a family member involved in these discussions. I will have the receptionist schedule the appointment for you before you leave. Do you have any other questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. Even if I don't understand all of it. I guess I'll go get the tests done. I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist is just outside the door. Have a good day, Mr. Kochubey. .
