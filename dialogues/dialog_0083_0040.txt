DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I've been having a bit of trouble with pain in my side, you see. And…well, I keep getting water infections. They’re quite frequent, really. It's been going on for a while now, and my daughter thought I should come see a doctor about it.
DOCTOR: I see. Pain in your side and frequent urinary tract infections. Thank you for letting me know. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It's…well, it's mostly on my right side, lower down. Not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times it’s quite bothersome. It doesn’t shoot through or anything, just…aches. And it seems to flare up when I drink a lot of fluids, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Espinueva. A dull ache on your right side that comes and goes, and seems to worsen with fluid intake. And you mentioned this has been going on for a while. Could you estimate how long, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Let me think… It must be… at least a year now. Maybe a bit longer. The water infections have been more frequent in the last six months, though. Before that, it was just the occasional ache. It’s been harder to ignore lately, with everything happening together.
DOCTOR: Okay, a year of intermittent right-sided pain, with increasing frequency of urinary tract infections in the last six months. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying either the pain or the infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. With the water infections, yes. I get a bit of burning when I go to the toilet, and I have to go quite often, even when I don't feel like I need to. And sometimes, my water is a bit cloudy, if you understand. With the pain… not much, really. Maybe a little tired, but I put that down to my age, to be honest. I haven't noticed anything else particularly different.
DOCTOR: I understand. Burning with urination, frequent urination, and cloudy urine with the infections. And a general sense of tiredness. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I do. My daughter, she's a nurse, and she's always telling me to remember things. I have something called… polycystic kidney disease, I think? It runs in the family. I haven’t been to see a specialist about it for a while now, though. I mostly just try to keep an eye on things. As for the other things you mentioned… no, not that I know of. I’ve never been told I have high blood pressure or diabetes.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know about the polycystic kidney disease, Mr. Espinueva. That’s important information. And it’s good you’ve been monitoring things. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don’t believe so. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, a very long time ago, but that was it. Nothing major, as far as I can remember. I’ve always been quite lucky, really, aside from this kidney business, of course. I’ve never had to spend a night in hospital for anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, but no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine, as far as I can recall. My daughter always checks when she gives me anything, and she hasn’t said anything about allergies. So, I think I’m alright on that front.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, Doctor. They get a bit achy, you see. It's called glucosamine, I think? I get it from the chemist. And sometimes, if I’m really struggling with the pain, I take paracetamol. Just the normal dose, of course. That’s it, really. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine for your knees and paracetamol as needed for pain. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never have. My father was a smoker, and I saw what it did to him. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought it was a silly habit, to be honest. I prefer a nice cup of tea, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Espinueva. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit now and then, Doctor. Mostly on special occasions, like Christmas or my birthday. I enjoy a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes, but I don’t drink very often. Not a regular thing, at all. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional social drinking. And finally, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned, my father smoked, and he did have some trouble with his lungs later in life. My mother, she was a very healthy woman, lived to a good old age. My brother, he had high blood pressure, I think. And, of course, my grandmother had something similar to my polycystic kidney disease. It seems to run on the women's side of the family, mostly. Nothing too serious on my father’s side, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. That’s a very helpful overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’d like to gently feel your abdomen to see if I can identify any areas of tenderness. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement, of course. And thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I appreciate it very much. I just want to get to the bottom of this pain, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I did find some mild tenderness when I pressed on your right side, which is consistent with the pain you’ve described. I don't feel any masses or anything concerning at this time. Based on your history and this preliminary exam, we need to investigate this further. I’d like to order a urine analysis and a blood test to check your kidney function and look for any signs of infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. A urine analysis and blood test seem like a good idea. Whatever you think is best, really. I’m happy to do whatever is needed to figure this out. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you taking the time. Where do we go from here? Do I need to make another appointment?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. The lab is just down the hall. The nurse will collect the samples for the urine and blood tests now. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. We’ll need to rule out a urinary tract infection, and assess how well your kidneys are functioning given your history of polycystic kidney disease. Depending on the results, we might consider an ultrasound of your kidneys to get a better look at them. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds very reasonable indeed. An ultrasound sounds… thorough, if that makes sense. And I’m happy to come back for a follow-up appointment whenever you’re ready. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any particular foods or drinks I should avoid?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to drink plenty of fluids – water is best – to help flush your system. Try to avoid sugary drinks and caffeine, as they can irritate your bladder. If you notice any fever, chills, worsening pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, just continue with your normal routine and we’ll discuss the results when they’re available. The nurse will provide you with instructions for the lab tests and schedule your follow-up appointment now. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate you explaining things so clearly. I’ll follow your instructions and wait for the results. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day.
