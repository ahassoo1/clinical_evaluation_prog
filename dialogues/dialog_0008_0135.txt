DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have… problem with my ear. A little liquid comes out. It is not comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Liquid coming from your ear, and it’s not comfortable. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It started… maybe three days ago? I wake up and there is… wetness. Small amount. I clean it with… cloth. But it keeps coming back. It does not hurt, but feels… full. Like ear is blocked, yes?
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started about three days ago with a small amount of discharge when you wake up, and it feels full or blocked. No pain, just a sensation of fullness. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. About the hearing… it is a little quieter. Not much, but I have to ask people to repeat sometimes. My wife… she says I talk too quiet, also. But I think this ear problem… maybe it is connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some decreased hearing and your wife has noticed you speaking quieter – possibly related to the ear issue. Have you had any fever, dizziness, or nausea along with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No… spinning feeling. And my stomach… it is okay. I eat normally. I sleep normally. Only this ear… it is the problem. I have never had this before, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No fever, dizziness, or nausea. And this is a new problem for you. Have you tried anything to treat it yourself so far?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not know what to do. I try the cloth, to clean, but… that is all. I do not put anything in my ear. Too afraid. I just… hoped it would go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It's best not to put anything in the ear. Let’s take a look. I'm going to use an otoscope to examine your ear canal. It doesn't hurt, I promise. Can you sit up and slightly pull your ear back for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will sit. I pull… like this? Is that correct? I am a little nervous, I have not been to doctor in long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Okay... I see some fluid in the ear canal and the eardrum appears slightly…bulged. It's a little red as well. It looks like you likely have an ear infection, possibly otitis media. Now, to be sure, I’d like to check your temperature and listen to your lungs just to rule out anything else. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Temperature is good idea. And listen… to my lungs, yes? I want to know what is wrong, so please do what you need. This fluid… is it bad? Will I… go deaf? I worry a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. It's good that you're getting it checked out. Let’s get your temperature first. Your temperature is normal. Now, I’m just going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. Your lungs sound clear. Given your symptoms and the examination, it does appear to be an ear infection, and the good news is, these are usually very treatable. It's unlikely to cause permanent hearing loss, but it's important to get it taken care of to avoid any complications. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have allergies. My wife… she remembers, if there is. But I have never had bad reaction to any medicine. I take… sometimes, for my blood pressure, but that is all. Very small pill.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Just a small pill for your blood pressure. We’ll want to avoid anything that interacts with that. I think the best course of action here is to prescribe you an antibiotic. It's a common one, and should help clear up the infection. I'll also recommend some over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the discomfort. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Medicine is okay. Will this pill… make me tired? I have work tomorrow. I am a teacher, you see. I must be alert for my students. They are… difficult sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Being alert for your students is important. This particular antibiotic isn’t known for causing significant drowsiness, but everyone reacts a little differently. It's best to take the first dose tonight and see how you feel tomorrow morning. If you do feel unusually tired, please let me know. I’ll write you a prescription for a 10-day course. I'll also give you some instructions on how to take the medication and what to watch out for. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Ten days… that is good. Instructions… I will read them carefully. Is there anything I should not do while taking this medicine? Like… avoid certain foods, or… I worry about interactions. I read things on the internet, sometimes, and it is… confusing.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. It's wise to be cautious and ask. With this antibiotic, the main thing is to avoid alcohol while you're taking it, and it’s best to avoid dairy products for a couple of hours before and after each dose, as they can interfere with absorption. Other than that, you should be fine. This sheet has all the details. Also, it's important to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better before the 10 days are up. Stopping early can lead to the infection coming back. I also want to see you back in a week to make sure it’s clearing up. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. No alcohol. No dairy with the medicine. And finish the ten days. One week for follow up. I can do that. Thank you very much. You have… helped me feel better already. I appreciate your… patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. Here’s the prescription, and the appointment for a follow-up next week is scheduled. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Get some rest, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Goodbye.
