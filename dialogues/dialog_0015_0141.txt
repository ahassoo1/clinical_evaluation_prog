DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this itch, really. Everywhere, almost. It’s been going on for… oh, a couple of weeks now, I think. Started on my arms, and now it’s kind of all over. It’s not painful, just… incredibly annoying. I scratch and scratch, but it doesn’t really do much, you know?
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, you say. And it began on your arms… all over now, you mentioned. Can you describe the itch for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it. That's a good question. It’s not like a bug bite itch, not sharp. More… deep? Like it’s under the skin, almost. And it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, then suddenly it’s really bad. It’s worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep. Is that… helpful? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Ferneding. Though you don’t need to apologize for not being a medical professional. "Deep" is a good way to put it. And worse at night... that is significant. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse, besides time of day?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, nothing really makes it better, honestly. I’ve tried some lotion, just regular stuff, but it doesn’t seem to do anything. Hot showers seem to make it a little worse, at least temporarily. And… oh, this is probably silly, but I had a new laundry detergent a couple of weeks ago, right around when it started. I hadn’t thought about that before. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mr. Ferneding. New detergent is quite relevant. We'll definitely consider that. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the itch?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no rash… well, except for the scratching, of course, but that's because of the itch. No tiredness, no… anything else, really. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. That’s why I didn’t rush to the doctor right away, it's just… this constant itching is driving me mad. My wife always said I was a bit of a nervous scratcher, even before this. She’d give me a hard time about it.
DOCTOR: I see. No other skin changes – no bumps, blisters, or redness besides what’s caused by scratching?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. It’s just… red from scratching, mostly. Sometimes it looks a little… inflamed, I guess, after I’ve been at it for a while. But there aren't any actual bumps or blisters. It just looks… irritated. And it’s all over, like I said. Arms, legs, back… even my stomach a little. It’s hard to get to everything, you know? I'm not as flexible as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this started around the same time as a new laundry detergent?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A new detergent. Floral scent, I think. My daughter picked it out for me. She meant well, of course. Said I was using “old man” soap. She's always trying to update me. Anyway, I switched back to my old brand a couple of days ago, to see if it would help. Still itching, though. No improvement yet.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, just to rule out anything obvious. Please lie down on the examination table. And please, refrain from scratching during the exam, if possible. It will give me a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. No problem. I'll try my best. It’s… difficult, though. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything. This itching… it's a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. If you could please turn your palms up, I’ll start with a quick inspection of your hands. Some mild excoriation present on the dorsal surfaces of both hands, consistent with scratching. Skin appears otherwise normal in color and texture. No visible rash or lesions. Similar findings on the arms. Scattered areas of excoriation, but no primary lesions. Skin is warm and dry. No signs of infection. Mild excoriation noted across the upper back. Again, no primary lesions or signs of infection. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Lymph nodes are non-palpable. Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Everything appears to be within normal limits, clinically speaking. No signs of anything immediately concerning. However, the persistent itching warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: That's… good to hear, I suppose. But frustrating, too. It's just so… annoying! What kind of investigation are we talking about? Blood work? Allergy tests? I'm not afraid of needles, just… I'd rather get to the bottom of this quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, I agree. Prolonged itching is quite unpleasant, and we want to determine the cause. I'd like to order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying systemic issues. Additionally, a comprehensive metabolic panel will help assess your overall organ function. Given the timing with the new laundry detergent, I also recommend a patch test to evaluate for contact dermatitis. It’s the most likely culprit, but we need to confirm. It will involve applying small amounts of various allergens to your back for a few days to see if a reaction develops. It’s not painful, but it does require a few follow-up visits. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, which is good. A patch test… a few follow-up visits. Okay, I can do that. I’m retired, so I don’t have a strict schedule. The blood work… fine. Anything to get this itching to stop. So, what do we need to do now? Paperwork? Or do you want to draw the blood right away? I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab technician is available now for the blood work. I'll have her come in and draw the samples. After that, we'll schedule your appointment for the patch test. It’s best to do it sooner rather than later, while the potential allergen is still fresh in your system. Here’s the requisition for the blood work. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll handle everything. After the lab work is completed, the results will be sent to me, and I will review them and contact you to schedule the patch test. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good. Just… I’ll take this to the lab, then. And you’ll contact me when the results are back. It’s all pretty straightforward, thankfully. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. I’m hoping we can figure it out soon. This itching… it’s driving me a bit mad, honestly.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I understand your frustration. We'll do our best to identify the cause and provide appropriate treatment. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms while you wait for the results. Here's a contact number for any urgent concerns. Have a good day.
