DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I’ve noticed a… a lump, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a few weeks now, and it’s just… concerning me.
DOCTOR: A lump, you say. And for how many weeks exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably around three, maybe four weeks now. It wasn’t very noticeable at first, just felt a little…different. But it’s definitely grown a bit since then. I'd say it's about the size of a plum now, perhaps a little bigger.
DOCTOR: And is it painful?
PATIENT: No, thankfully it isn’t painful. It’s more… uncomfortable, if anything. Like a dull ache sometimes, but not really painful. It doesn't hurt to touch it either, which is… reassuring, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has there been any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Change in… bowel habits? Let me see. Not that I've noticed, no. Everything seems pretty regular, if you want to know. No constipation, no diarrhea… same as always, really. I haven’t been feeling sick or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills. And my weight… I haven’t really been weighing myself lately, to be honest. I haven’t noticed any significant weight loss, if that helps. My wife might know better, she’s always keeping track of things like that. But I haven't felt any weaker or anything.
DOCTOR: Do you have any relevant past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that’s about it. No other surgeries, no chronic illnesses, nothing like that. Just the usual colds and flu, I suppose. And I have Medicare, if that’s what you need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of… well, anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother had… some stomach problems when she was older, but I don’t know the specifics, to be honest. My father was healthy as a horse, never really sick a day in his life. And my siblings are all doing well, as far as I know. Nothing major on either side, if that's helpful. It's a fairly large family, though, so keeping track is difficult.
DOCTOR: Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. Never have. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally – and I definitely don't use any recreational drugs. My wife would have a fit if I did! I try to stay healthy, you know? Mostly just… worried about this lump.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look then. Please lie down on the examination table for me. We'll need to do a quick physical exam.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie flat, please. I’m going to palpate your abdomen. I'll be checking for tenderness, size, and consistency. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Tell me if anything feels particularly sensitive.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Just let me know what you find. It’s… a bit strange having someone poke around down there, but I trust you. It doesn’t hurt, just… feels odd.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It’s located approximately five centimeters below your umbilicus, on the left side. It’s roughly oval-shaped, firm, and non-tender to palpation. No rebound tenderness. No guarding. The surrounding area is soft and unremarkable. It doesn't appear to be significantly enlarged. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all four quadrants. No bruits auscultated. Alright. That's what I'm finding on initial exam. It’s… inconclusive, to be frank.
PATIENT: Inconclusive? What does that mean, Doctor? Should we be worried? Is it something serious? I’m starting to get a little anxious now. Is it possible it's just a muscle issue, perhaps? I've been doing a lot of choreography lately, and it's quite physical work.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Raghunathan, “inconclusive” simply means we need further investigation to determine the cause of this lump. It could be a muscle issue, but given its firmness and location, I wouldn’t rule out other possibilities. And honestly, dismissing it as simply a choreographic issue without proper evaluation would be… irresponsible. We need to be thorough. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal ultrasound. The ultrasound will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on internally. I’ll also send the results to a radiologist for their expert opinion.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Ultrasound, blood work… I understand. Will the ultrasound be done here, or do I need to go somewhere else? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a rehearsal next week, and I'm hoping it won't interfere.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound will be done at the imaging center across the street – I'll have the order printed for you. As for the results, it typically takes 24 to 48 hours for the radiologist to send their report. I will have my nurse contact you as soon as I receive them. As for your rehearsal... I can't guarantee it won't interfere. It depends on the findings, and whether further intervention is required. But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. We’ll take it one step at a time. Here's the order for the ultrasound. Take this to the imaging center, and they’ll schedule an appointment for you. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything for now. Ultrasound, blood work, wait for the results… I understand. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you not dismissing it as just a muscle issue, even if I was hoping that’s all it was. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I’ll head over to the imaging center now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let my office know if you encounter any difficulties scheduling the ultrasound. And try not to worry unduly. We'll get to the bottom of this. Next!
