DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having… stomach trouble. A lot of it, actually. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s mostly… diarrhea. I think that’s the right word. It's… persistent, I guess? It’s just… not stopping. I feel pretty tired all the time because of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent diarrhea and fatigue. Thank you for sharing that, Jase. It's helpful to get a sense of the main issues. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this diarrhea?
PATIENT: Hmm… how much more is there to say? It's… watery, mostly. And it happens… a few times a day, I think? Sometimes more if I eat something… I don’t even know what sometimes, honestly. It just… happens. It’s been like this for… weeks, maybe? Months? It’s hard to remember exactly when it started, to be honest. I just know it’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, watery stools several times a day, for weeks to months, and sometimes seems related to certain foods but not always clear. That gives me a better starting point. Could you describe any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing alongside the diarrhea and fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, my stomach does hurt sometimes. Not like, really bad pain, but… uncomfortable. Like cramping, I guess? And… I’ve been losing weight, I think. My husband keeps saying I look thinner, but I haven’t really been keeping track. Oh! And I’ve been really thirsty all the time. I’m always drinking water, but it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have cramping abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss, and increased thirst. Thank you. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, the doctor a while back said something about… IBD? Or maybe it was… celiac disease? Something like that. It was a long time ago, and honestly, I don't remember all the details. I think I had some tests done, and they said something about my gut, but… I don’t really know what it all meant. I’ve just been… trying to manage it, and it’s been okay-ish until recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, a previous evaluation for possible inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease. That's important information. Do you happen to have any records from that evaluation, or remember what kind of tests were performed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. It was a different doctor, in a different town… a long time ago. I moved around a lot. I really don’t remember what tests they did, just… blood tests, maybe? And… something to do with my stool? It was a while back, so it’s all a bit fuzzy. I wish I could be more helpful. I’m really not good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jase. We can work with what you do remember, and potentially try to get those records if it becomes necessary. Let's move on to some other questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Just some vitamins sometimes, like Vitamin D, because the doctor said I was low on that. And… sometimes I take something for heartburn, if it’s really bad. But that's it. Nothing regularly, I don't think. Oh! And I use an inhaler sometimes for… just a little bit of asthma. But not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, Vitamin D supplements, occasional antacids for heartburn, and an inhaler for occasional asthma. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I've never had a really bad reaction to anything. I mean, I don’t love shellfish, but that’s just a taste thing, not an allergy. I think I’m pretty lucky, allergy-wise. My husband has a bunch, though! But I haven’t had any problems myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My family is… spread out. I haven’t seen a lot of them in years. My mom… she had some heart problems, I think. And my dad… he had diabetes, but that was a long time ago. I don’t really know much about my grandparents. It wasn't something we talked about much. I wish I could give you more information, but I really don't know much about their health history. It’s a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your father. That’s helpful to know. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I’m married, as I mentioned earlier. My husband, Omar, is a teacher. We’ve been married for… five years now? I think. We live in a pretty rural area. I work in sales, mostly on the phone. It’s not very stressful, which is good. I don't really drink or smoke. I try to eat healthy, but… well, with my stomach problems, it's been a little difficult lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, married, husband is a teacher, work in sales, non-smoker, attempt healthy diet, and live in a rural area. Thank you for sharing all of that information, Jase. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen for tenderness, and take your vitals.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do. Hopefully, you can figure out what’s going on with my stomach. It’s been really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, please lie back on the table. We'll start with your vitals – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Okay, your blood pressure is 118/76, pulse is 88, temperature is 98.6, and respiratory rate is 16. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I am palpating your abdomen now… Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that’s okay… just a little pressure, that’s all. Ooh, that… that feels a little tender, actually. Not bad bad, but… definitely noticeable. Like a dull ache, maybe? And… maybe a little bit here too. It’s hard to say, honestly. My whole stomach feels a bit off.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m hearing some bowel sounds, though they seem a bit… hyperactive. And I am noting some tenderness in your lower right quadrant and slightly higher up, as you pointed out. There’s no rebound tenderness or guarding at this time. Given your symptoms – persistent diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, increased thirst, and now the abdominal tenderness – along with your previous evaluation for possible IBD, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a flare-up of underlying IBD, an infectious cause of gastroenteritis, or potentially other issues. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some lab tests. These will include a complete blood count to check for signs of infection or inflammation, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your electrolytes and kidney function, a stool culture to look for bacterial pathogens, and a stool sample for microscopic examination to check for parasites or blood. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps figure out what’s wrong, then yes, please do whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to feel better, honestly. What does all that… mean, though? What are you looking for, exactly? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That's completely understandable, Jase. Let me explain. The complete blood count, or CBC, helps us see if your body is fighting an infection or if there’s inflammation. The comprehensive metabolic panel tells us about your overall health, including your electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function, which can be affected by diarrhea and dehydration. The stool culture is important to see if there’s a bacterial infection causing your symptoms. And the microscopic examination of your stool sample can identify parasites or even small amounts of blood that we can't see with the naked eye. Essentially, we’re trying to rule out common causes of gastroenteritis like bacterial infections, identify any signs of underlying inflammation, and assess your overall health status. The results usually take about 48 to 72 hours, depending on the lab. Once we have the results, we can discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids, like water or electrolyte solutions. You can also try eating bland foods, like toast, rice, and bananas. Avoid dairy, fatty foods, and caffeine, as these can worsen your symptoms. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Hydrate, bland foods… no dairy. That sounds manageable. It's just… a lot to take in. Forty-eight to seventy-two hours… okay. Is there anything I should be specifically looking out for in the meantime? Like, if my symptoms get worse, or if I notice something new? I don’t want to just wait and worry.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Jase. Absolutely. If you experience any of the following, please contact the clinic immediately or go to the nearest emergency room: High fever Severe abdominal pain that doesn’t improve with rest Bloody stools Signs of severe dehydration, such as decreased urination, dizziness, or extreme weakness Persistent vomiting that prevents you from keeping fluids down These could indicate a more serious condition that requires prompt medical attention. Otherwise, if your symptoms remain stable, we can wait for the lab results and discuss a plan then. I will have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they’ll give you instructions on how to collect the stool sample. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: High fever, severe pain, bloody stool, dehydration… got it. Um… no, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything really well, actually. Thank you, Dr. Glowka. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I'm just… hoping we can figure out what’s going on. It’s been exhausting.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I understand how exhausting this must be, and we’ll do our best to get to the bottom of it. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen before your follow-up appointment. I'm going to print out a summary of our discussion and the lab orders for you. The front desk will assist you with scheduling a follow-up appointment once the lab results are available. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
