DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look here, Doctor, I ain't got all day. It's about… well, lookin' at myself. I see things, and it ain't right. Always been a strong man, you understand? Pile driver work… keeps a man in shape. But things… shift. And I want it fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: “Shift,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Shift. Like… saggin'. Droppin'. Not where it supposed to be. I used to be… firm. Now it's like… pudding. Especially down there. You know! The… private parts. And the stomach, too. It ain't a pretty sight, Doctor. I want it tightened up. No messin' about. I'm a practical man.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Trendler, changes in body composition can happen with age, and as you mentioned, previous physical work can contribute. But we need to understand what is happening before we talk about… tightening things up. Let’s start with some questions, if you don’t mind. First, has this been a gradual change, or did you notice it happening relatively suddenly?
PATIENT: Suddenly! No, not suddenly like a broken leg. But… noticeable. Maybe six months ago I say it, but I thought it was just… the clothes. Now I know better. It’s me. And I don’t like it. You understand? Clothes don't sag on their own, Doctor. This is about flesh. Not fabric. Six months, maybe a little longer. It's gettin' worse, I tell ya. Faster now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms? I ain't sick! Just… loose. You askin' if I'm feelin' poorly? No. I feel strong enough. Still do the work, though it's a little harder than it used to be. No aches, no pains, no… nothin' like that. Just… the look of things. It's embarrassing, Doctor. A man likes to look presentable. And I ain't presentable no more.
DOCTOR: I see you’ve had regular check-ups with Dr. Davies. Nothing noted about any significant weight loss or muscle weakness, according to his records. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Normal! Always been a good eater. Never skipped a meal in my life. And energy...well, I get tired at the end of the day, like any man my age after hard work. But that’s normal, Doctor! Been doin’ this work fifty years! I ain't complainin' about bein' tired. I’m talkin' about the shape of things. You understand? The… droop! The looseness! It ain't about feelin' sick or tired. It's about lookin' respectable. Dr. Davies don't know nothin' about that. He just checks the heart and the blood. This is different.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand you're concerned about these changes. But changes in body composition can sometimes be indicative of underlying medical issues. We need to rule those out before discussing cosmetic procedures, if that's what you're thinking. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits?! Now you're askin' about… that? Look here, Doctor, I didn't come here for a proctology exam! I came here 'cause I'm saggin'! Is this how you treat a man who's worked hard his whole life? You askin' personal questions now. I ain't answerin' that. I want to know what you can do about the looseness. Not what’s comin' out the back end. This is ridiculous. I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I apologize if my questions seemed… intrusive. I assure you, I’m simply trying to get a complete picture of your health. However, if you’re unwilling to provide further information, it will be difficult to determine the cause of these changes. I can perform a physical exam, if you’d like, to assess the muscle tone and skin elasticity. But without a full assessment, any treatment I suggest would be purely speculative. Would you agree to a physical exam?
PATIENT: Physical exam, huh? Poke and prod at the sag? Fine. Do what you gotta do. But don't expect me to stand here all day while you measure every inch of droop. Just get on with it. Quickly. And tell me, afterwards, what can be done. I'm a practical man, Doctor. I want solutions, not questions. And no talkin' about bowels. Understand?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll need to assess your abdominal area, and then take a look at your… lower extremities. If you could just loosen your trousers a bit, that would be helpful. I'll start with your abdomen.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just be quick about it. And don’t poke too hard. I ain't made of stone, you know. Been pilin' iron for fifty years, but the flesh is still flesh. Just get it over with. This is undignified, I tell ya. Undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Just relax as much as possible. I'm just checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft, but there is some mild laxity of the abdominal muscles. No masses or tenderness noted. Skin turgor is slightly diminished, which is not uncommon with age. Now, if you could turn onto your side… I’d like to assess the skin and muscle tone on your thighs and buttocks.
PATIENT: Laxity? Diminished? Doctor, you're speakin' a foreign language again. Just tell me plain English. Is it fixable? Can it be tightened? I ain't payin' for fancy words, I'm payin' for results. And don’t poke too hard back there neither. This is gettin' ridiculous. Hurry up, I say. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. As I suspected, there's a noticeable loss of muscle mass in your thighs and buttocks, and skin elasticity is diminished. This is a natural part of aging, but it can be exacerbated by… changes in activity level or diet. Now, while I can’t wave a magic wand and restore your youth, there are options. However, it’s important to understand that any significant improvement will require… lifestyle changes. We can discuss options like strength training and dietary adjustments. There are also some cosmetic procedures available—skin tightening treatments, for example—but I won't recommend those until we've addressed the underlying causes. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes?! I’ve worked hard my whole life! What kinda lifestyle changes are you talkin' about? You think I ain't been eatin' proper? And strength trainin'? At my age? Doctor, I came here for a fix, not a lecture on how to live my life. Look, I ain't got time for fancy diets or pumpin' iron. I want somethin' done. Is there or isn't there somethin' you can do to tighten this sag? If not, just tell me straight. I ain't got all day to listen to you talk about muscles and skin. Plain English, Doctor. Yes or no? Can it be fixed, or can’t it? Don’t beat around the bush. This is gettin’ ridiculous. I’m losin’ patience.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, a significant improvement solely through a procedure is unlikely, given your age and overall condition. While some minor tightening can be achieved with treatments like radiofrequency skin tightening, the results will be… subtle. It won’t restore the muscle tone you had in your youth. A more realistic approach would involve a combination of strength training, a balanced diet, and potentially a referral to a physical therapist to develop a tailored exercise program. I can provide you with a list of qualified physical therapists in the area. And a dietary handout. But I want to be very clear: this will require effort on your part. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Effort? I've spent fifty years breakin' my back pilin' iron! Don't talk to me about effort! Look here, Doctor, I ain't got time for exercise programs and fancy diets. I came here for a medical solution, not a fitness regime. You're wastin' my time. I'm goin' to get a second opinion. From someone who understands what a man wants. .
