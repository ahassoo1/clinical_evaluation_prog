DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sachar. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, I received a letter about being checked to see if I qualify for home health or hospice care. To be honest, I’m not entirely sure what that all means, but I understand it has to do with getting some help at home? I’m hoping to learn more about what’s available.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. The letter indicates a potential need for support services. It’s perfectly alright to be unsure, Ms. Sachar. We want to assess your current health situation to determine the best course of action. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with your health recently?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…a bit of everything, really. I work as a presser – you know, in a dry cleaner’s? It’s physical work, standing all day, and it’s been getting harder. My back’s been bothering me for a while now, and my knees aren’t what they used to be. It’s just…things ache more than they used to, and I get tired easier. I also had a fall a few months ago, but thankfully didn't break anything. Just bruised myself up pretty bad. It’s been slow to heal, though. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does, Ms. Sachar. So, back pain, knee discomfort, fatigue…and a fall a few months ago with some bruising that hasn't fully resolved. I see. Could you describe the back pain for me?
PATIENT: It’s…a dull ache, mostly. It’s not sharp, unless I really twist or bend over. It’s just there, you know? It’s worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet at work. And sometimes it shoots down my leg a little, but not all the time. It’s…annoying, mostly. It keeps me up at night sometimes, too. I try to take over-the-counter pain relievers, but they don't always help.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache, radiating down the leg occasionally, worse at the end of the day and interfering with sleep. You've been using over-the-counter pain relievers, but with limited relief. Now, when you say it shoots down your leg, can you pinpoint where exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It’s not the whole leg, thankfully. It’s more like…down the back of my thigh, and a little bit into my calf. Not my foot, just the back of my leg, really. And it's not constant. It comes and goes. Sometimes it feels like a tingling, other times it’s more of a burning sensation, but it’s not too bad. It's hard to explain, Doctor. It’s just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so radiating down the back of the thigh and into the calf, intermittent, described as both tingling and burning. It sounds like it could be some nerve irritation, but we'll need to investigate further. Have you noticed any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness…hmm. That's a good question. I haven't really thought about it. I get tired easily, like I said, but I haven't noticed myself tripping more or anything like that. Maybe…maybe my legs feel a little heavier at the end of the day, but I just figured that was from being on my feet all day at work. It's not like I can't walk, or anything. I’m still able to do everything I need to do, just…it takes more effort now. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly well, Ms. Sachar. It’s good that you’re still able to perform your daily activities, even if it requires more effort. Fatigue and a feeling of heaviness are certainly things we should consider. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any diagnosed medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… The doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but it went down when I started watching my salt intake. I don’t take any medication for it now. Other than that… not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. My mother had arthritis, but I haven't been diagnosed with it myself. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy about ten years ago. Is that important? I don’t usually mention that unless they ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of elevated blood pressure that's currently managed with diet, a hysterectomy ten years ago…and a family history of arthritis. Good to know. Have you had any surgeries other than the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that was a long time ago. And… oh, yes! I had a knee operation a few years back. Just a small scope, they said. They cleaned up some cartilage, but it didn't really help much. That's why I haven't bothered with getting another one. It felt like a waste of time, to be honest. That's the knee on my right side. It's the one that gets stiff sometimes. Does that make sense? It's getting harder to explain all of this.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Sachar. You’re doing fine. Tonsillectomy, a knee scope on the right knee that didn’t provide much relief… Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional pain reliever, like ibuprofen, when my back or knees are really bothering me. I don't take it every day, just when I need to. And…oh, sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I've been forgetting lately, to be honest. I started it a while back, but I haven't been very consistent with it. I don’t take anything else regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent ibuprofen use, a multivitamin occasionally… Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to worry about bee stings, but I've never been stung. I don’t have any food allergies, either. My mother was very careful about what she fed us when we were growing up, so I’ve never really had to worry about that. So, no allergies, as far as I know. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Thank you for providing me with all of this information, Ms. Sachar. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your back and knees. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. That’s perfectly acceptable. I’m ready when you are. I’m hoping we can figure out what’s causing all of this discomfort.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat here, we'll begin with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not significantly so. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let’s examine your back. Please lie on your stomach for me. Do you feel any tenderness in this area?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s a little tender, right there. It’s not sharp pain, just…uncomfortable when you press on it. It feels like a dull ache, like it usually does. And…oh, yes, a little bit higher up too, but that tenderness is less. It's hard to say exactly where it hurts the most, it's just…all of it feels a bit sore.
DOCTOR: I see. There is some muscle guarding and tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region, particularly on the right side. Now, let's check your knees. Can you bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a bit uncomfortable. I can’t bend them much further than this without it hurting. It feels…tight, and a little bit stiff. It’s my right knee, mostly. The left one isn’t too bad, but it’s still not as flexible as it used to be. It makes a little clicking sound when I bend them, too. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: I notice some crepitus with range of motion and mild tenderness along the medial joint line. There’s no significant pain with the McMurray's test. Range of motion is limited in both knees, with more restriction on the right. Stability appears intact. Alright, Ms. Sachar. That concludes the physical exam. Based on your history and examination, it seems you're experiencing lumbar strain and likely some underlying osteoarthritis in both knees, with more pronounced symptoms on the right. Now, I’d like to order some x-rays of your lumbar spine and both knees to confirm these findings. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. X-rays seem like a good idea. I’d like to know what’s really going on. I’m happy to have them taken whenever you think is best. Do you think they can do them here, at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, we have an x-ray facility here at the clinic. I'll write you a referral order now. The technician will guide you through the process. It should take about 15-20 minutes. Once the images are taken, the radiologist will review them, and I'll discuss the results with you at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed. You can also try applying ice or heat to your lower back and knees for 15-20 minutes at a time. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds manageable, Doctor. Ice or heat, and the pain relievers. I think I can handle that. And the x-rays, of course. So, just go to the x-ray department after we’re finished here? Is there anything special I need to bring, or wear? I don’t want to forget anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, just take this to the x-ray department. You don't need to bring anything special, just wear comfortable clothing. They may ask you to remove any jewelry or metal objects near the areas being imaged. The technician will explain everything to you. I’ve also included instructions for a referral to physical therapy. If the x-rays confirm our suspicions, physical therapy can be very beneficial in strengthening your muscles and improving your range of motion. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you, or would you prefer to do that yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. If you wouldn’t mind scheduling it for me, that would be wonderful. I'm not very good at making appointments on my own, to be honest. And… what kind of things do they do in physical therapy? I’ve never been before. I’m a little nervous, if I'm being honest. It's just…I'm worried it'll be painful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Sachar. It's perfectly normal to be nervous about trying something new. Physical therapy typically involves exercises to strengthen your muscles, improve your flexibility, and reduce pain. The therapist will tailor the exercises to your specific needs and abilities. It may be a little uncomfortable at times, but they will never push you beyond your limits. They will work with you to ensure you're comfortable and safe. I’m scheduling you for an evaluation with Sarah Miller, a very experienced physical therapist. The appointment is on August 12th at 2:00 PM. Does that time work for you?
PATIENT: August 12th at 2:00 PM sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much for arranging everything. You've really put my mind at ease. I appreciate your patience and kindness. Is there anything else I need to do, or be aware of, before my appointments? I don't want to forget anything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sachar. I'm glad I could help. No, there's nothing else you need to do at this time. Just remember to bring your insurance information to the physical therapy appointment, and arrive a few minutes early to fill out any necessary paperwork. I'll review the x-ray results with you at your follow-up appointment on August 26th. If you experience any worsening pain or develop any new symptoms before then, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and help. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. I really appreciate it. I’ll go and get the x-rays done now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sachar. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I hope the x-rays provide us with some clarity. You have a good day as well.
