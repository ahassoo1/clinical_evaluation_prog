DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some… unusual results from a test the other day – a GI endo test, I believe it was called. My regular doctor suggested I come speak with you about them. I must admit, I was a little worried when I got the letter.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you had an endoscopy. And understandably, concerning results can be unsettling. I'll certainly do my best to help clarify things for you. Do you recall what specifically the results said, or what your regular doctor told you about them?
PATIENT: Well, to be perfectly honest, the letter was quite… detailed. Full of words I didn’t recognize. My doctor, Dr. Ramirez, simply said there were some… irregularities. He used that word – irregularities. And that I should come see a specialist, which is you, thankfully. He didn’t go into specifics, saying you would explain it all much better. I do remember something about… inflammation, perhaps? But truly, I’m not entirely certain. It all felt a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Denis. Medical jargon can be… difficult. Dr. Ramirez is a good doctor to send you my way. “Irregularities” and “inflammation” are good starting points. Let’s see if we can piece things together. I have your endoscopy report here… … Ah, yes. It does show some inflammation in the lower portion of your esophagus and stomach. Have you been experiencing any symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Though, I didn’t necessarily connect them to anything serious, you understand. For the past few months, perhaps six or eight, I’ve had a rather persistent burning sensation in my chest. It’s worse after I eat, particularly if I’ve had anything… spicy. And sometimes, a bit of difficulty swallowing. Not severe, mind you, but enough to notice. I also feel… quite full, rather quickly, even if I haven’t eaten much. Is that… relevant, do you think?
DOCTOR: Yes, Denis, that’s all very relevant. Burning sensation, especially after eating, difficulty swallowing, and early satiety – feeling full quickly – those are all symptoms that can be associated with inflammation in the esophagus and stomach. Now, can you describe the burning sensation?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain precisely. It isn’t a sharp pain, not at all. More of a warmth that rises in my chest. Sometimes it radiates up into my throat. And as I mentioned, spicy foods make it significantly worse. Even acidic foods, like tomatoes, can trigger it. It usually lasts for an hour or two after eating, and then gradually subsides. Sometimes, if I lie down immediately after eating, it feels… almost like it travels backwards. Is that… concerning? I apologize for rambling; I’m not accustomed to discussing my… inner workings with such detail.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t apologize at all. You’re providing me with very helpful information, and it’s important to be thorough. That description – warmth rising, radiating to the throat, worsened by spicy and acidic foods, and a sensation when lying down – sounds consistent with what we call gastroesophageal reflux – GERD – or acid reflux. The lying down sensation suggests the acid is coming back up more easily then. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Acid reflux… I have heard of that. My neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, suffers terribly from it. I see. Well, let me think… yes, actually. Occasionally, I have a rather unpleasant taste in my mouth, a sort of sourness. And sometimes, a bit of a cough, particularly at night. It’s not a persistent cough, but it does happen from time to time. And… oh, I almost forgot. I’ve been feeling quite tired lately. Not exhausted, but… lacking energy, shall we say. Could that be related as well, do you think? It seems rather a lot to be happening at once.
DOCTOR: Yes, Denis, those symptoms can all be related. The sour taste and nighttime cough are common with acid reflux, as the acid irritates the throat and esophagus. And fatigue can sometimes be a symptom, as your body is working to deal with the inflammation and irritation. Now, have you had any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. But I believe I may have lost a little weight, yes. Perhaps five or six pounds over the last few months. I attributed it to the warmer weather; I haven’t had much of an appetite in the heat. But now that you mention it… it may be more than that. I haven’t been eating any less intentionally, but I do feel… less hungry, overall. It's not a dramatic loss, mind you, but noticeable if I think about it. And my clothes do feel a bit looser than they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay. Unintentional weight loss, even a small amount, is something we need to investigate further. Given your symptoms – the burning sensation, difficulty swallowing, early satiety, cough, fatigue, and the recent weight loss – and the inflammation noted on your endoscopy report, I’m concerned about the possibility of something more than just typical acid reflux. There are several possibilities we need to rule out, including Barrett’s esophagus or, less commonly, something like a stomach ulcer or even a growth. Now, I want to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. I understand. I would much prefer to know exactly what is happening, rather than simply speculate. Tests are a good idea. What sort of tests are you thinking of, if you don't mind me asking? I must admit, I become a little anxious when it comes to medical procedures. Perhaps you could explain them to me in a bit of detail? I appreciate your thoroughness. It helps to calm my nerves, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Denis. I completely understand your anxiety, and I’ll explain everything in as much detail as possible. First, I want to repeat the endoscopy. This time, we’ll take several biopsies – small tissue samples – to examine under a microscope for any signs of Barrett’s esophagus or other abnormalities. That’s a standard procedure and usually doesn’t cause any discomfort, though you will be sedated during it. Then, I’d like to order a pH monitoring test. This involves placing a small capsule in your esophagus to measure the amount of acid reflux over a 24-hour period. It’s a relatively simple test you can do at home. Finally, I'll also order a complete blood count to check for any signs of anemia or infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… manageable. Biopsies, pH monitoring, and a blood test. I believe I can cope with all of that. The sedation for the biopsies is reassuring. And the pH monitoring at home sounds quite convenient. I do have one question, if you don't mind. What exactly is Barrett’s esophagus? I have heard the term, but I don’t know what it entails. Is it… serious? I apologize for asking so many questions; I just want to be prepared, you understand. It’s easier to face things when you know what to expect.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Denis, and you’re absolutely right to ask. It's always best to be informed. Barrett’s esophagus is a condition where the lining of your esophagus becomes damaged by chronic acid reflux. Over time, the normal cells in the lining can change and become more similar to the cells that line the intestine. This change isn't cancerous itself, but it can slightly increase your risk of developing esophageal cancer in the future. That’s why we take biopsies during the endoscopy – to see if any of these changes are present. If we do find Barrett’s esophagus, we would monitor it regularly with follow-up endoscopies to make sure it doesn’t progress. There are also treatments available to help manage the acid reflux and prevent further damage. It's important to remember that many people with Barrett’s esophagus never develop cancer, and with regular monitoring, we can catch any problems early. Does that explanation help?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help, thank you, Doctor. So, it’s a change in the cells, caused by the acid, which could become something more serious, but with monitoring, it can be managed. I understand. It’s… concerning, naturally, but at least I know what we’re looking for. And it sounds as though it’s quite treatable if caught early. Now, regarding these tests… when can we schedule them? And is there anything I need to do to prepare? I have a rather busy schedule, you see, but I’m happy to adjust it if necessary. I appreciate your patience with all my questions; you’ve been very helpful in calming my anxieties.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could help. For the endoscopy and biopsy, we can schedule that for next week, likely Wednesday or Thursday. You’ll need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand, and you’ll need someone to drive you home since you’ll be sedated. The pH monitoring test can be done anytime after that, once we’ve discussed the endoscopy results. It’s a very simple procedure you can do at home, and I’ll give you detailed instructions on how to insert the capsule. As for the blood test, you can get that done at any time. No special preparation is needed. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for about two weeks after the endoscopy to discuss the results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Wednesday or Thursday of next week for the endoscopy, then. I will arrange for a ride. And the pH monitoring can be done afterwards, and the blood test anytime. A follow-up appointment in two weeks. I believe I have that all down. Now, is there anything I should do in the meantime? Should I adjust my diet, perhaps? Or avoid certain activities? I wouldn’t want to do anything to interfere with the tests or make my symptoms worse. I suppose I should avoid spicy foods, naturally.
DOCTOR: Yes, good question. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to avoid spicy foods, acidic foods like tomatoes and citrus fruits, caffeine, alcohol, and chocolate, as these can all worsen your symptoms. Try to eat smaller, more frequent meals, and avoid lying down immediately after eating. Elevating the head of your bed by about six inches can also help reduce acid reflux at night. Beyond that, there are no specific restrictions. Just continue with your normal activities, but try to be mindful of your symptoms and avoid anything that makes them worse. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or severe chest pain, please contact my office immediately. I’ll also have my nurse give you a handout with more detailed information on managing acid reflux. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for your thoroughness and patience with all my questions. You’ve put my mind at ease considerably. I will avoid the spicy and acidic foods, and elevate my bed. And I will contact your office if anything changes. I appreciate you providing the handout as well. I think that’s all for now. I look forward to hearing from you next week after the tests.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could help. I’ll see you next week. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, we’re here to help. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. .
