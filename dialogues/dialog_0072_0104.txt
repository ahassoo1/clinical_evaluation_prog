DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I’m Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s my throat. It… hurts. Has been for a little bit now. I don’t have time for this, if you don't mind. Just want to get it over with, really.
DOCTOR: I understand you're pressed for time, Ms. Ottaviani, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. However, it's important we gather some information to determine the cause of your discomfort. "A little bit now"... can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… um. Maybe three, four days? It's just… sore. When I swallow. It feels like… sandpaper, maybe? I don’t… I don't really keep track of these things, Doctor. I work. That’s what I do. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have some idea of the duration, thank you. "Sandpaper" is a useful description. Do you have any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me think. No… no fever, I don't think. And I haven't coughed much. Maybe a little, but that’s just… dust, probably. From work. Everything is dusty at work, you see. I doubt it's anything serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any difficulty breathing, any changes in your voice, or any swollen glands in your neck?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. I breathe fine, thank you very much. Voice is… my voice. Sounds normal. And… glands? I don’t examine myself like that, Doctor. Really. I’m a working woman. No time for… that. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, a basic examination is necessary to appropriately assess your condition. I understand you’re busy, but I cannot provide a diagnosis without it. It will involve me looking in your throat, feeling your neck for swollen lymph nodes, and listening to your lungs. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Would you allow me to proceed?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't appreciate being… questioned. I came here for a quick fix, not a… a whole ordeal. If you absolutely must, fine. But hurry it up. And please, don't touch my hair. It's just been done.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lean back and open your mouth. I need to visualize your throat. I will be brief.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. I have things to do, you know. This is very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Your throat is a bit red, Ms. Ottaviani, but there's no sign of white spots or pus. Your tonsils don't appear significantly enlarged. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your neck to check for swollen lymph nodes. No significant swelling there either. Take a deep breath for me. And another one. Lungs are clear.
PATIENT: See? I told you. Nothing. Just a sore throat. It'll probably go away on its own. Honestly, Doctor, I really must be going now. Is there… is there anything you're going to do about it, or…?
DOCTOR: While the examination didn’t reveal anything alarming, a sore throat lasting three to four days warrants some consideration. It could be a common viral infection, which typically resolves on its own. However, it’s also possible it’s early strep throat, or another bacterial infection. To rule out strep, I recommend a rapid strep test. It’s a quick swab of the throat. Or, if you prefer, we could send a culture to the lab, which takes a few days for results. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: A test? Goodness. Honestly. I don’t have time for tests. Look, Doctor, I really don't see the point. I'm sure it's nothing. Just give me something to make it stop hurting, and I’ll be on my way. I haven’t got all day to sit around waiting for… cultures. A quick fix, remember? That's what I came for.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I understand your desire for a quick resolution. However, prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis is not sound medical practice, and could even be harmful. Treating a viral infection with antibiotics, for example, is ineffective and contributes to antibiotic resistance. I will not prescribe medication without knowing the cause of your sore throat. If you absolutely refuse a strep test, I can recommend supportive care – rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. However, if your symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or a rash, you must seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… write down something for the pain. I suppose. And don’t bother me again. Waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is a prescription for ibuprofen, 200mg, take two tablets every 4-6 hours as needed for pain. I strongly advise you to monitor your symptoms closely. If they do not improve within a few days, or if they worsen, please return or seek care elsewhere. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
