DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bulaong. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It’s… my chest. It hurts, kinda. Not all the time, but… yeah. It’s my chest.
DOCTOR: “Kinda” hurts?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like… a dull ache. Sometimes it’s sharp, but mostly just… uncomfortable. It's hard to explain. It's not like, a bad pain, just… there. Especially on this side. <points to left breast with a thin hand>
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this “uncomfortable” feeling been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a month now? It comes and goes. I thought it would just… stop. But it hasn’t. My wife said I should come see someone. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: A month. And does anything specifically bring it on?
PATIENT: Not really, I don't think. I work on roofs, you know? Lots of moving around… maybe that? But it hurts even when I’m just sitting. It's weird. I don’t know what to tell you.
DOCTOR: Roofs, right. And is the pain constant throughout the day, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It's more at the end of the day, I think. When I'm tired. And sometimes… I don’t know… when I touch it? Not always, but sometimes it hurts more if I press on it. Like, a little tender.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I just feel… tired a lot. But I work hard, you know? Maybe that’s normal. Nothing else, I don't think. No… bumps or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to some other questions. Any family history of… heart problems, lung issues, or… anything like this?
PATIENT: Um… my mom had some trouble breathing when she was old, I think. But she smoked a lot. And my dad… he just always complained about his back. Nothing about… this. I don’t think so. We don't really talk about health stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medicine in my life. Just… stuff for headaches sometimes. And… that’s it. I try to avoid the doctor, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I suppose we should have a listen to your chest. And I'm going to need to feel around a bit. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. It's standard procedure. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Uh… feel around? You mean… my chest? My wife will be mad if I don’t get this checked out, but… <shifts uncomfortably in chair> Is it… necessary? I mean, I just said it hurts.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, I am a doctor. A physical examination is necessary to determine the cause of your pain. It is my professional obligation, and frankly, rather rude of you to question my methods. It's not about you feeling comfortable, it's about figuring out what’s wrong. Now, please, just try to relax. I need to listen to your lungs and feel for any abnormalities. It will be quick. <gestures towards a gown on the back of the door> Please, take off your shirt.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. But… my wife said something about… not letting anyone touch. She worries about… things. But… if you say it's necessary. <slowly starts to unbutton shirt> Just… please be quick. And gentle?
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie back on the table. And breathe deeply. <gestures towards examination table> Try not to tense up. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, then I'll palpate the area. <Starts auscultating the chest, listening with the stethoscope. After a moment> Your breathing is slightly labored. And there's a mild wheeze in the left lower lobe. Palpating now… <presses gently but firmly on the left side of Aron’s chest> Tenderness here, as you mentioned. No obvious masses, but there’s some discomfort with pressure. <continues palpating, then stops> I'm going to order a chest x-ray just to be safe. And I'd like a complete blood count as well. We'll rule out anything serious. <Steps back from the table> It could be musculoskeletal, but we need to be certain. <Starts typing on the computer> And frankly, working on roofs with a history of chest pain is… unwise. You need to consider your safety. We will get the results as soon as possible. It may take a couple of days.
PATIENT: Okay… a couple of days. Right. My wife is going to be mad I was working on the roof, anyway. She doesn’t like heights. And… what does “musculoskeletal” mean? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: “Musculoskeletal” means relating to the muscles and bones. It’s likely a strain or inflammation, perfectly treatable. If that’s all it is. It's not necessarily “bad,” but it requires rest and proper care. We need to rule out anything more serious, which is why the x-ray and blood work are important. Don’t worry unnecessarily. It could be nothing. <Types some more on the computer> Now, I’m going to write you a referral for the x-ray and blood work. The lab is just down the hall, and the imaging center is across the street. Please, schedule those appointments as soon as possible. And please, refrain from any strenuous activity until we have the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… rest. No work. And… get the tests done. I understand. <takes the referral hesitantly> Is there… anything else I should be doing? Like… medicine or something? For the pain? And… what if it is something bad? <looks worriedly at the doctor>
DOCTOR: For now, over-the-counter ibuprofen should suffice for the pain. 400 milligrams, three times a day, with food. If the pain worsens significantly, or you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or a cough, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… ibuprofen. And if it gets worse… the emergency room. <nods slowly> My wife… she’ll know what to do. She always does. <stands up slowly, looking relieved but still worried> Thank you, Doctor. <pauses> I… I guess I’ll go get those tests done now.
DOCTOR: Very well. And Mr. Bulaong, I strongly advise you to reconsider your career choices. Your health is more important than a paycheck. <Without making eye contact> Next.
PATIENT: .
