DOCTOR: Right. Lytisha Hughston. Fifty-one years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Well, um… it’s about a test, I think. A… a screening? Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Something about needing one for work, I believe. It's for the paving job, maybe? I operate one of those big rollers. It's all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: A work screening, you say. And it’s related to operating heavy machinery… the roller, specifically. Right. Well, we’ll figure it out. Do you recall what kind of screening it was supposed to be?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Not really. Something about… checking for things? In your system? I think they said “drug test” at some point, but… honestly, I get so mixed up with all the paperwork these days. I mostly just do what they tell me. Is it a blood test? I don't like needles much.
DOCTOR: A drug test, possibly. It could be a urine test, more commonly. Though, yes, some work screenings do require blood work. Let’s start with the basics. Have you taken any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Just… just a little something for my arthritis, in my hands. It doesn't bother me too much most days, but when it flares up… Um, what is it called? It's a little white pill. I get it from the pharmacy, of course. I can't recall the name right off hand. It's… for the pain. Does that make sense? I'm so sorry, I'm terrible with names.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll try to get a list of your medications from the pharmacy later. Do you know the dosage?
PATIENT: Dosage…? Oh, now you're asking a hard one. I just take one, usually. Sometimes two if my hands are really bad. They're little pills, you see? I think it’s a small number… maybe 500? No, that doesn’t sound right… I really have no idea. I just take what the doctor tells me to. I should probably write these things down, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you really should. It makes things significantly easier. Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… I don’t think so. Not that I know of, anyway. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Though… I used to get a rash when I was little, from poison ivy, I think. But that wasn’t a medication! Is that what you mean? I've never had trouble with a pill or anything like that.
DOCTOR: No, I meant any allergic reactions to medications. Right. And you've never experienced a rash, hives, or difficulty breathing after taking a pill?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single time. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, for colds, headaches… even a stronger painkiller once, after I twisted my ankle. Nothing ever bothered me. Honestly, I’m pretty durable, if I do say so myself. Though my memory’s going, that’s another story!
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on. Do you have any major medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me see. The doctor did mention something about my cholesterol a while back… it was a little high, I think. He said to watch my diet, eat less… fried things, mostly. That’s hard to do when you like good food! But… no, nothing major, as far as I know. No diabetes, no heart problems. Just the arthritis in my hands and the cholesterol. And the memory, of course!
DOCTOR: High cholesterol. Noted. And you are currently being treated for the arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Just with those little white pills. The doctor prescribed them a couple of years ago now. They help, mostly. Not a miracle cure, mind you, but they take the edge off. I can still do my job, thankfully. It wouldn't do to have shaky hands when you’re operating a roller! Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Here we go… a bit stiff, you know. It takes a moment to get going. Is this for my balance, doctor? I'm pretty steady on my feet, all things considered. Though, I haven't been doing much walking lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just follow my finger with your eyes, please. Don’t move your head. And tell me if you feel any dizziness.
PATIENT: I'm following it… yes. No dizziness, not yet. It’s a little… wobbly, perhaps, but that’s just my old knees. Is this going to take long, doctor? I’m a bit worried about standing for too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. No obvious deficits noted. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Lung sounds are clear. Heart sounds normal. You do have slightly elevated blood pressure, which we should monitor. Do you have any history of family heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Family heart disease… hmm. My father… he had a bit of a weak heart, I think. He didn't take care of himself, you see. Smoked a lot, ate a lot of rich foods. He didn't live to be very old. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, too. She was always a worrier, my mother. So, yes, I suppose there is a bit of a history. Does that worry you, doctor?
DOCTOR: History of hypertension and heart disease in family. Noted. And you said your mother was a worrier?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a terrible worrier! Always convinced something bad was going to happen. It stressed her out something awful. She was a good woman, though. Just… anxious. I think I inherited a bit of that anxiety, to be honest. It doesn’t help with the memory, you know. Always thinking about things, instead of focusing on the present. Is that relevant, doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Given your family history and slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend a full lipid panel and a cardiac workup. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss stress management techniques. Now, about this work screening…do you have any paperwork from your employer regarding the specifics of the test they requested?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, so many tests! That sounds… a bit much, doesn’t it? But… if you think it’s necessary. And stress management… well, that sounds good, too. I’m easily flustered, you know. The paperwork… yes! I think I stuffed it in my bag. Here we go… it’s a bit of a mess, I apologize. I believe they said it was a… a "ten-panel drug screen?" Does that mean anything to you, doctor?
DOCTOR: A ten-panel drug screen… yes, that's fairly standard for heavy machinery operators. It tests for a range of substances. It looks like they’ve requested both a urine and a blood sample. Are you able to provide both?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a blood sample? I really don't like needles, doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, I can try, but I get quite faint, you know. And I’ve never been good at giving blood. It's a bit embarrassing, really. Perhaps the urine sample is enough? I could probably manage that… if I have enough time.
DOCTOR: The employer's request is for both samples, Ms. Hughston. It's their policy, unfortunately. However, given your anxiety about needles, we can discuss options to make it more comfortable. Perhaps a small dose of an anti-anxiety medication beforehand?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be… very kind of you, doctor. A small dose of something to calm my nerves… yes, that sounds much better. I really don't want to make a fuss, you understand. I just get so worked up over these things. Would it… would it hurt much? And how long would it take? I have to get back to work this afternoon, you see. I operate the roller, and they’re counting on me.
DOCTOR: It will be a quick prick, Ms. Hughston, and minimal discomfort. The blood draw itself will take only a few minutes. We can have the nurse draw the blood after we schedule the cardiac workup and discuss a follow-up for stress management. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. A quick prick… and then I can get back to work. Alright. Cardiac workup and stress management… and then the blood draw. As long as the nurse is gentle. And if I start to feel faint, you’ll take care of me, won't you, doctor? I do appreciate your patience. I'm not always the easiest patient, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hughston. We'll make sure you're comfortable. Let me get the nurse, and we'll get everything scheduled.
PATIENT: .
