DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Piet, was it? Yes, yes. Well, it's a bit silly, really. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps fussing… says I should know my blood type. Something about… emergencies? I can’t quite recall. She just said it’s important, and I thought… well, better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. Do you… do you determine that here?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly determine your blood type here, Ms. Nini. It is good to know, and your daughter is right to encourage you to be prepared. It’s not silly at all. It can be helpful in certain situations. Before we do that, though, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Overall health… Well, I’m… seventy-nine. That’s a good start, isn’t it? . I used to be very strong, you know. A rigger, I was. Lots of lifting, lots of… ropes. But that was a long time ago. Now… I mostly just potter about the garden. No major complaints, I don’t think. A little achy in the knees sometimes, but who isn’t at my age? I have a private insurance plan, if that matters. I can’t recall the name of it right now, though. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Nini. We can look up your insurance information, no problem. And it’s good to hear you're active in the garden. Being active is wonderful. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… Hmm. That’s a tricky one. Let me think… I had a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but that’s hardly serious, is it? And… oh! My husband, God rest his soul, he had to go to the hospital once for his heart. But that was… decades ago. I don’t think I’ve been hospitalized myself. Not that I remember, anyway. It's all a bit… hazy. Do you have a way of looking that sort of thing up? Like, a record of it all?
DOCTOR: Yes, we do, Ms. Nini. We can access your medical records electronically. Let me just pull those up now… . Ah, here we are. It looks like you were admitted for pneumonia about ten years ago, in 2015. Do you recall that?
PATIENT: Pneumonia… 2015… Oh dear. That rings a very faint bell. A terrible cough, I remember that. And feeling… very weak. But everything is so jumbled. Was that a bad one? I really don’t recall much beyond feeling unwell. It's funny what you forget, isn’t it? Still, it doesn't sound like it was… recent. So, we've established I'm prone to a bit of a cough, then. Is that important for the blood type thing?
DOCTOR: No, the cough itself isn't directly related to your blood type, Ms. Nini. I just wanted to get a complete picture of your health history. Knowing about the pneumonia helps me understand your overall health status. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I think… yes. When I was quite young, I had my appendix removed. A very common thing, I believe. And… oh! And I had a bit of a knee operation a few years after that. Something about a torn cartilage, I think. It didn't work very well, to be honest. Still aches sometimes. That was… a long time ago now. I don’t remember the exact year for either one, though. Old age, you know. Everything blends together. .
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Nini, don’t worry about the exact dates. We can often find those details in your records. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… Ah. Just this one. For my blood pressure, the doctor said. I take it every morning. Just the one little pill. I can’t recall the name of it, though. It's… orange, as you can see. And it helps me… not feel dizzy, I think. That's all. .
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Nini. This is Lisinopril, for high blood pressure. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, more or less. Pollen… well, I sneeze a bit in the spring, like everyone else, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? No, I don’t think I have any allergies. At least, nothing serious. . My daughter is always telling me I should be more careful, but I've lived a long life and haven’t had any problems!
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Nini. Alright, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s a tricky one. My parents… well, they both lived to a good age, but I don’t remember them being particularly… unwell. My father had a bit of trouble with his heart towards the end, I think. And my mother… she just sort of faded away, if you know what I mean. No major illnesses, I don’t think. My brother… he was always very healthy, too. Strong as an ox, he was. I don’t recall anyone in my family having any… terrible diseases. Honestly, my family wasn’t much for talking about health! . We were more interested in enjoying life.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Nini. It’s common for families not to discuss these things. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he used to smoke a bit when he was younger, but I always hated it. Smelled awful, and made him cough. No, I’ve never smoked. And I don’t drink much, either. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that’s all. Nothing excessive. . A healthy lifestyle, you see. That’s why I've lived so long!
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Nini. Now, before we proceed with determining your blood type, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, I can’t remember how long. It’s probably a good idea. Just don’t poke too much, dear. My joints aren't what they used to be! .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Nini. I’ll be very gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds regular, no murmurs auscultated. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. Just… old age, I suppose. A bit creaky, but nothing to worry about. You're being very gentle, dear, thank you. It's been a long time since anyone listened to my heart. Feels… reassuring, actually. . It's funny how a little attention can make you feel better, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s good. And finally, I'll just check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure slightly elevated, but within acceptable range considering age. Alright, Ms. Nini. Everything seems to be within normal limits for your age. Now, we can move on to the blood test to determine your blood type. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, let’s get it over with then. I always hate needles. Not terribly afraid, you understand, just… not a fan. Is it going to hurt much? And how long will it take? You’re very efficient, dear, I appreciate that. Getting old is… tiresome, you know. Everything takes so long. .
DOCTOR: It will be a very quick prick of your finger, Ms. Nini, just enough to get a small sample of blood. It shouldn’t hurt much at all, just a brief pinch. And it will only take a few minutes to get the results. I’ll be right back with the results. There, all done! Now, we wait. It's best to sit still, if you could.
PATIENT: Well? Is it going to be much longer, dear? My finger feels a bit… funny. Not painful, exactly, just… tingly. I do hope it’s not a bad sign. I’ve never been good with medical things. Always best to just get it over with, I say. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nini, we have the results. You are blood type A positive. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A positive, you say? A positive… Well, that’s… good, isn't it? My daughter will be relieved. She's always fussing about these things. I don’t really understand what it means, to be honest. Does it mean I can’t give blood to everyone? Or is it the other way around? Oh dear, it’s all very confusing! . Maybe I should just leave it to my daughter, she’s always so good with details. But thank you, dear. You were very kind and patient with an old woman like me. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Nini. It's perfectly normal to be a little confused about blood types. It essentially means that you have specific proteins on your red blood cells, and your body produces antibodies against other blood types. Being A positive means you can receive blood from types A positive and O positive, and you can donate to types A positive and AB positive. But don’t worry about memorizing all that right now. The important thing is that we have the information, and your daughter is right to be prepared. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That is confusing. I think I’ll leave it to my daughter, she's much better at these things. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. Just… thank you again, dear. You were very kind. And please, don’t think I’m being silly, but could you just… double-check that I’m A positive? Just to be sure, you understand. My memory isn’t what it used to be. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Nini. Let me just double-check… Yes, you are definitely A positive. It’s good to be thorough, and I'm happy to confirm it for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! A positive it is. Thank you, dear. That puts my mind at ease. No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again for your patience. You’ve been a lifesaver. Perhaps I’ll see you again next year for a check-up, if my daughter lets me. She’s very insistent on these things, you see. .
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: You're very welcome, Ms. Nini. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Take care, and have a wonderful day!
