DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure, I suppose. Though I must say, coming all the way out here... well. My daughter insisted. She thinks this… marijuana is the answer to everything. I’m here about getting one of those certificates, if you can even call it that. For… medicinal purposes. Though frankly, I don’t see what good it’ll do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Ranells. It sounds like your daughter feels medical cannabis might be helpful for you, and she encouraged you to come in for an evaluation. That's perfectly alright. We can certainly discuss whether you might be a candidate for a certificate. To do that, I'll need to get a good understanding of your medical history and what's been going on with your health. First, could you tell me a bit about what symptoms you're hoping to address with medical cannabis?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Honestly, Doctor, I’m… just getting older. It’s a perfectly natural process, you know. Things ache, I don’t sleep as well as I used to. It’s not as if I’m in pain, precisely. Just… discomfort. And a bit of trouble relaxing at night. My daughter says this… cannabis will help with that. I’ve always been a very sensible woman. This whole idea just feels… undignified. But she’s very persistent, that one.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Ms. Ranells. It’s very reasonable to feel that way, and I appreciate you being so open with me. Many patients feel similarly at first. It's good you're a sensible woman; that makes for a good conversation. So, to clarify, the main things you're hoping to address are general aches and difficulty relaxing or sleeping?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Aches and… a bit of restlessness. It’s not debilitating, Doctor, I must emphasize that. I still manage. I have my routine. I go to church, I volunteer at the library… I keep busy. It’s just… things aren’t as easy as they used to be. And my daughter is convinced this is the answer. She read something online, naturally. They always read things online. She keeps saying it's "natural." As if that makes it all right.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re very active and maintain a good quality of life, despite these changes. And yes, I understand the concern about relying on something simply because it’s “natural.” We want to be sure it’s truly appropriate and beneficial for you. To help me determine that, could you tell me a little bit more about the aches you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… everywhere, really. A bit in my knees, especially after I’ve been on my feet for a while. A dull ache in my lower back. And sometimes, a stiffness in my shoulders. It’s not a sharp pain, Doctor. It’s more of a… weariness. Like everything is just… tired. And it doesn’t go away entirely, no matter how much I rest. My husband, bless his soul, just says I’m getting old. Which is very helpful, I assure you.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it sounds like you're experiencing a generalized body discomfort – aches in your knees, lower back, and shoulders, with a feeling of weariness that doesn’t fully resolve with rest. And your husband isn’t much help with the specifics, I gather. Now, have you tried anything else to manage these aches—over-the-counter pain relievers, creams, physical therapy, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My daughter insisted on those creams, the ones with the… menthol, I think it was. They smelled rather strong, and didn't do a great deal of good, if I'm honest. I tried some of those over-the-counter pills, the ibuprofen, but they upset my stomach. And physical therapy? Goodness, no. I'm not about to be poked and prodded by strangers! I did try some gentle stretching exercises, but they didn't seem to make much difference. Honestly, Doctor, I've mostly just been… coping. Which is what sensible women do.
DOCTOR: “Coping” is a very valuable skill, Ms. Ranells, and sounds like you've been doing it quite well. It's good to know you've tried some of those common remedies—creams, ibuprofen, and stretching—and understand that they haven’t provided much relief. It's helpful to know what hasn’t worked. Now, to get a broader picture of your health, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing terribly exciting, I assure you. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox, all those things. I had my tonsils removed when I was a girl. And I had a rather difficult pregnancy with my daughter, but that was many years ago. I've been quite healthy, all things considered. No serious illnesses, no hospitalizations… I'm not one for doctors, you see. Only go when absolutely necessary. My blood pressure runs a little high, but my doctor – the one I see for my check-ups – keeps it under control with a small pill. Otherwise, I’m perfectly… functional.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Ranells. So, tonsils removed in childhood, a difficult pregnancy, and managed hypertension. No other major medical issues. And you see a doctor regularly for your blood pressure, which is excellent. Have you ever had any surgeries other than your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the tonsils. Never had anything else. I’ve always been very careful, you see. I didn’t spend my youth climbing trees or anything reckless like that. And I’ve always been… reasonably healthy. I eat a sensible diet, I get enough sleep… well, as much sleep as one can at my age. And I certainly don't go looking for trouble. Surgeries are for people who are… indiscreet, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Ranells. No surgeries beyond your tonsils. Sensible living certainly seems to agree with you. Now, thinking about your family—your parents, siblings, or other close relatives—have they had any significant health problems?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 89, which is quite good, I think. She had arthritis in her hands, which bothered her terribly, especially in the winter. My father died of a heart attack when he was in his early seventies. And my sister… well, she’s always been a bit delicate. She’s had trouble with her digestion her entire life. Nothing terribly serious, but she’s never been as robust as I am. Otherwise, no. No major health problems in the family. They were all… sensible people, like me.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Ms. Ranells. So, your mother had arthritis, your father had a heart attack, and your sister has digestive issues. Otherwise, a relatively healthy family. Now, could you tell me a bit about your current medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just the one. For my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. A small white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And that’s it. I don’t take anything else. I’m not one for pills, you see. Only take what’s absolutely necessary. And my doctor says the Lisinopril is keeping my blood pressure under control, so I haven't had to add anything else. I’m a very straightforward case, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Ranells. Just the Lisinopril for your blood pressure. And you have no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I'm rather fortunate, I think. I don’t have sensitive skin, I don’t have asthma… I’m a very… uncomplicated woman. Honestly, I sometimes wonder if all this fuss about medical marijuana is even necessary. My daughter just has a… fascination with these things, you see. She reads everything online, and then convinces herself that I need it. It’s very… trying, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Ms. Ranells, and I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like your daughter is very proactive about your health, perhaps to a fault. Now, before we proceed, just to be thorough, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I'm retired, as you can imagine. I used to be a bailiff, you know. Very responsible work. Kept everything in order. Now, I volunteer at the library a few days a week, help with the children’s reading hour. I go to church every Sunday, of course. And I enjoy gardening. Mostly flowers. Roses, mostly. I read a lot. Historical novels, mostly. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, and I certainly don't engage in any… questionable activities. A very quiet, respectable life, Doctor. Just… getting older. And my daughter thinks marijuana will fix it all. It’s rather… absurd, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: A very full and respectable life, Ms. Ranells. It sounds like you’ve remained active and engaged. I understand your skepticism about marijuana being the answer, and we’ll certainly explore all options carefully. Now, to get a better sense of your overall health, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose so. I don't particularly like being poked and prodded, but I understand it's necessary. As long as it's quick. And as long as you're gentle. I’m not a young woman anymore, you see. Everything is rather… fragile. And please, no surprises. I don’t like surprises. Just tell me what you’re doing before you do it. Honestly, all this fuss over a few aches and pains… It's rather… excessive. But if it will appease my daughter, I suppose I can endure a quick examination. Just be gentle, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ranells. I will be as gentle and thorough as possible, and I’ll explain everything before I do it. No surprises, I promise. “I’m just wrapping this cuff around your arm to check your blood pressure. It will inflate briefly, and then deflate. No discomfort involved.” “Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. That’s slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range, especially considering you're already taking medication for it. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally, please.” “Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently examine your joints—your knees, lower back, and shoulders—to see if I can identify any areas of tenderness or stiffness.” “Does this area feel tender or painful when I press here?
PATIENT: A little… yes. In my knees, particularly. And a bit in my lower back. It's not a sharp pain, Doctor, just… discomfort. Like everything is… worn out. And my shoulders feel a bit stiff, especially when I reach up. Honestly, it's what I’ve been dealing with for years. It’s not surprising, you see. Just… old age. And I can feel you poking around. Please, be gentle. It’s rather… unnerving, all this touching. Honestly, I don’t see what good it’s doing. But if it will appease my daughter… I suppose I can endure it. Just be quick about it, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Ranells. I apologize if this is unnerving. I’m just trying to get a better understanding of the source of your discomfort. “I’m noticing some mild tenderness in both of your knees, and a bit of stiffness in your lower back. Your shoulders have a limited range of motion, and I can feel some tightness there as well. There’s no swelling or redness, which is good. Your reflexes are normal, and your gait is steady.” “Overall, your physical exam is consistent with what you’ve described—generalized joint discomfort and mild stiffness, likely related to age and wear and tear. Now, based on our conversation and the physical exam, I’m wondering if medical cannabis might be worth exploring, but before we proceed, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out other potential causes of your joint pain, such as arthritis or inflammatory conditions.” “Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, it’s getting rather… excessive. But I suppose if it will rule things out… I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And as long as it doesn’t involve any… unpleasant procedures. My daughter will be thrilled, of course. She's always convinced something is terribly wrong with me. Honestly, I just feel old. That's all. But if it will appease her… and get her to stop reading things online… I suppose I can endure some blood work. Just… be quick about it, Doctor. Please. And tell me exactly what you’re doing before you do it. I don’t like surprises, you see. Honestly, this whole process is rather… trying.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Ranells. I’ll ensure the blood work is as quick and comfortable as possible, and I’ll explain everything before I do it. No surprises, I promise. “The blood work will involve a standard panel to check for inflammation, arthritis markers, and other potential causes of joint pain. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels, as a deficiency can sometimes contribute to joint discomfort. It will just involve a few tubes of blood drawn from your arm. The lab technician will handle the procedure, and it should only take a few minutes.” “Once the results are back, we can discuss them in detail and determine if medical cannabis is a reasonable option for you. If it is, we can explore different strains and delivery methods to find what works best. But we’ll proceed at your pace, and you’re in control every step of the way.” “Now, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well… what exactly is this… cannabis, Doctor? I understand it comes from a plant, but what does it do? And what are the side effects? My daughter keeps talking about “THC” and “CBD,” but I don't understand any of it. And what if it makes me… dizzy? Or forgetful? Or… worse? Honestly, I'm a very sensible woman, Doctor, and this whole idea just seems… undignified. And what if it's illegal? Or frowned upon? I don’t want to get into trouble. Honestly, I just want to feel a little bit better, but not at the expense of my dignity. And I certainly don't want to disappoint my church. This is all very… unsettling. Can you explain it to me in simple terms, Doctor? Please? And tell me what the risks are. I need to know what I’m getting myself into. Honestly, this is all rather… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Ranells, and I’m happy to address them. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed, and I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed decision. “Medical cannabis comes from the cannabis plant, yes. It contains compounds called cannabinoids, the two most well-known being THC and CBD. THC is the compound that produces the psychoactive effects—the ‘high’—but medical cannabis products are formulated to have very low levels of THC, or none at all. CBD, on the other hand, doesn’t produce a high, and it’s believed to have anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties.” “The idea is to use cannabis to manage your symptoms—the aches and stiffness—without experiencing any significant psychoactive effects. There are different ways to take it—oils, tinctures, creams, edibles—and we can start with a very low dose to see how you respond. Common side effects are mild—dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness—but they’re usually temporary and manageable.” “Regarding legality, medical cannabis is legal in our state with a certificate from a physician. I’m authorized to issue those certificates, and I’ll ensure you understand all the regulations and guidelines. As for social stigma, that’s a valid concern, and it’s entirely up to you whether you choose to disclose your use to others. There are privacy protections in place, and you’re not required to tell anyone.” “Ultimately, the goal is to improve your quality of life, and we’ll proceed at your pace. If you’re not comfortable with it, we can explore other options. But I believe it’s worth considering, and I’m here to answer any questions you have along the way.” “Do you have any further questions at this point?
PATIENT: Well… that’s… a little bit better, I suppose. But what about my church? I’m a very active member, you see. I teach Sunday school, I volunteer at the bake sales… What if they find out? It would be a scandal! Honestly, I don’t want to jeopardize my reputation. And what if it interacts with my blood pressure medication? I don’t want to have a heart attack! Honestly, this whole thing just seems… fraught with peril. And what if it’s addictive? My daughter keeps saying it’s not, but I don’t trust her. She reads everything online, you see. And what if it makes me… silly? Or forgetful? I need to be sharp, you see. I have responsibilities. Honestly, I’m starting to feel rather overwhelmed. Perhaps I should just forget the whole thing. It’s not worth the risk, you see. It’s just not dignified. But my daughter… she’ll be so disappointed. Oh, goodness. This is all very… distressing. Perhaps you should just give me something else. Something… conventional.
DOCTOR: “I understand your concerns, Ms. Ranells. Your faith and reputation are incredibly important, and it’s perfectly reasonable to worry about how this might be perceived. Let’s address those concerns one by one. “Regarding your church, it’s entirely up to you whether you disclose your use. There’s no requirement to tell anyone, and I respect your privacy completely. It’s a personal decision, and I wouldn’t expect you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. “As for interactions with your blood pressure medication, that’s a very important question. Cannabis can interact with certain medications, and that’s why it’s crucial to review your entire medical history and medication list. I will check for any potential interactions before recommending any treatment. We would also monitor your blood pressure closely if you decide to try cannabis. “Regarding addiction, cannabis is less addictive than many other substances, but it’s still possible to develop a dependence. The risk is lower with low doses and infrequent use, and we would start with a very conservative approach. “As for cognitive effects, cannabis can sometimes cause temporary forgetfulness or impaired judgment, but these effects are usually mild and resolve quickly. We would start with a very low dose to minimize these risks. “Ultimately, the decision is yours, Ms. Ranells. I wouldn’t recommend anything that I believe would jeopardize your health or well-being. If you’re not comfortable with it, we can explore other options. There are other treatments for joint pain, such as physical therapy, pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory medications. We can discuss those options if you’d prefer.” “I want you to feel comfortable and confident in whatever decision you make. Do you want to discuss some of those other options, or would you like me to order the blood work to rule out other potential causes of your joint pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Perhaps the blood work is a good idea. Just to rule things out, you see. I don't want anything terribly wrong with me. Honestly, I just feel old. But if there's something else going on… well, it's best to know, I suppose. I still don't like the idea of this… cannabis. It just seems… undignified. And I don't want to jeopardize my reputation. But if the blood work is negative… well, perhaps I'll reconsider. Just perhaps. But no promises, you see. And I still want to know everything about it. Everything. And I want to know what the side effects are. And I want to know what my church will think. Honestly, this is all very… stressful. But the blood work… yes. Let's do the blood work. Just to rule things out, you see. And then… then we'll see. But no promises. Absolutely no promises.
DOCTOR: “That’s a very reasonable approach, Ms. Ranells. We’ll proceed at your pace, and we’ll start with the blood work to rule out other potential causes of your joint pain. That’s a good first step. “I’ll write a prescription for the blood work now, and I’ll provide you with the lab information. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. It will involve a few tubes of blood drawn from your arm, and the results should be back in a few days. “Once the results are back, we’ll review them together, and we can discuss your options. If the results are negative, we can explore the possibility of medical cannabis. I’ll provide you with all the information you need—the potential benefits, risks, and side effects—and I’ll answer any questions you have. “I want you to feel comfortable and confident in whatever decision you make, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way.” “Do you have any questions for me before we proceed with the blood work order?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… tell me how long it will take. And tell me if it will be painful. I don't like needles, you see. And tell me what I need to bring with me. And tell me if I need to fast beforehand. Honestly, I just want it to be over with. And then… then we'll see. But no promises. Absolutely no promises. And please, be gentle. Both with the blood work and with my sensibilities. Honestly, this is all very… trying. But the blood work… yes. Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: “Of course, Ms. Ranells. I understand your apprehension. I’ll make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible. “The blood work appointment will likely take about 30 minutes—15 minutes for check-in and paperwork, and 15 minutes for the blood draw itself. The blood draw should only take a few seconds, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. They'll use a small needle, and you shouldn't feel much discomfort—just a brief pinch. “You don’t need to fast beforehand, but it’s best to drink plenty of water in the 24 hours leading up to the appointment. That will make it easier for them to draw the blood. “You should bring your insurance card—although you mentioned you're uninsured, so that might not be necessary—and a photo ID. It’s also a good idea to bring a list of your medications, just in case. “And please, don’t hesitate to let the phlebotomist know if you’re anxious or uncomfortable. They’re very experienced and will do their best to make you feel at ease.” “I'll write up the order now, and I’ll give you the information. Don’t worry, we’ll take things one step at a time. And I’ll be here to answer any questions you have along the way.” “Here you go, Ms. Ranells. I hope the blood work goes smoothly. And remember, we’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Now, do you have any further questions for me before we conclude today's appointment?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. And for explaining everything so carefully. And for not making me feel silly. Honestly, this whole thing is very… unsettling. But you’ve made it a little bit easier. A little bit. But no promises, you see. Absolutely no promises. But thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I think I need to go home and lie down. This has been… exhausting.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Ms. Ranells. I completely understand. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed, and I’m glad I could help, even just a little bit. “Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your blood work appointment. And remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. “Get some rest, Ms. Ranells. You deserve it. And please, don’t worry about a thing. I’ll be here to support you every step of the way.” “It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day.”
