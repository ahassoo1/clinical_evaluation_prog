DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Andraca, is it? Yes, yes… well, it’s about… a check-up, I suppose. Something to do with… performance. They said I needed clearance. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. Something about acting, maybe? I work at the theater, you see. Mostly just showing people to their seats these days. It all feels a bit…fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a check-up for performance clearance, and you work at the theater, mostly ushering now. And you mentioned some memory concerns. That’s good information to share, thank you. To clarify, is this clearance request related to a new role at the theater, or is it for something else entirely?
PATIENT: A new role… hmm. Not that I recall. No, no new role. Just… they sent me here. The manager, Mrs. Gable, she handles all that. She said it was routine. A formality, she called it. I just… want to get this over with, if you don’t mind. I have a matinee to get back to, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. We'll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible. It sounds like this is largely at the request of Mrs. Gable, and is a formality for your current position. Just to be thorough, even though it feels routine, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you seen a primary care doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly… oh dear. No, not regularly. I… I used to, when I was younger, of course. But things… slipped. My wife, bless her heart, she used to handle all that. After… well, after the divorce, it all got a bit… disorganized. I mostly just go when something really hurts. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Krahn. Life gets… complicated. It’s very common for things to fall by the wayside. So, for the record, it sounds like you haven't seen a doctor consistently for a while, and usually only when you're experiencing a specific problem. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you do recall being treated for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my appendix out, a long time ago. When I was a boy, I think. And… there was that time I broke my wrist. Skiing accident. Terrible fall. And… hmm. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is just… Swiss cheese. I think I had high blood pressure at one point, but I don’t recall ever taking anything for it. It might have just been a one-time thing. I really can't say.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal, a wrist fracture, and a possible past history of high blood pressure. We can try to look those up later to confirm. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don’t think so. Nothing that springs to mind, anyway. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I try to avoid shellfish, just because it doesn't agree with me, but it's not a true allergy. More of a… dislike, really. And no, I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a dislike for shellfish. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. I try to stay away from them if I can. Just a bit of tea in the mornings, that’s all. Earl Grey, if they have it. And maybe a pain reliever if my back acts up, but that's very rare. I mostly just try to rest when that happens.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, just occasional pain reliever for back pain. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a tricky one. My mother… she had some sort of stomach trouble, I think. She passed away when I was quite young. And my father… he was a very strong man, always healthy. I don't recall anyone having heart disease, specifically. Cancer… maybe an aunt, on my wife’s side? Honestly, Doctor, we didn’t talk about these things much. It wasn't our way.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history available. Mother with stomach trouble, father healthy, possible cancer in wife's family. That's helpful, even if it’s not extensive. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Not at all. Never smoked a day in my life. Alcohol… I used to have a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. But not anymore. It doesn’t agree with me. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not! I’m a theater usher, Doctor, not a… a wild man!
DOCTOR: Good to know, Mr. Krahn. That's very helpful. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, let's just quickly revisit your current symptoms. You mentioned being sent here for a performance clearance. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms – any pain, fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, changes in vision, or anything else that’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms at all! That’s the thing! I feel… perfectly fine. A little tired, perhaps, but that’s just the matinees. And I’m getting older, you see. But nothing that would stop me from doing my job. Honestly, Doctor, I think Mrs. Gable is overreacting. I just want to get this over with so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're feeling generally well, no current symptoms, and believe Mrs. Gable is being overly cautious. That's good information. To be thorough, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and maybe a quick look in your ears, eyes, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… please be quick, if you don’t mind. The curtain goes up in a few hours, you see. And I wouldn’t want to leave Mrs. Gable shorthanded.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. We’ll be as quick as possible. If you could just sit here on the table, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92. That’s not drastically high, but it’s something we should keep an eye on. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Another deep breath... and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Let’s take a quick look in your ears... Ears are clear. And finally, let’s just take a quick look at your throat… Say “Ah” for me. Throat looks clear as well.
PATIENT: “Ah…” Elevated blood pressure, you say? Oh dear. Is that bad? I used to worry a lot, you see. My wife… she always told me to relax. But it’s hard, sometimes. The theater, you know? So much responsibility. Is it something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re aware of your blood pressure, Mr. Krahn. A reading of 148/92 is considered Stage 1 hypertension. It's not immediately alarming, but it does mean we need to monitor it and consider some lifestyle changes. It could be related to stress, as you mentioned, and we can explore that. It's also possible it’s just a temporary elevation, but it’s best to be cautious. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some routine blood work. It will check your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar levels, as well as give us a more accurate reading of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, alright. If you think it's necessary. I just… I really don’t want to cause any trouble for Mrs. Gable. She’s counting on me for the matinee. Can it be done quickly? And… will it involve a lot of needles? I’m not very fond of needles, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. We’ll make it as quick and painless as possible. The blood work is relatively standard – just a few vials of blood. And yes, it does involve a needle, unfortunately. But our phlebotomist is very skilled and will do their best to minimize any discomfort. It should only take a few minutes. I’ll write up the order now. And we can discuss some strategies to manage your blood pressure while we wait for the results. Things like reducing salt intake, regular exercise, and stress management techniques. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds alright. Salt, exercise… stress. My wife used to say the same things. Is there anything else I need to do? Anything at all? I just want to be sure I'm not missing anything. And… will the results be back quickly? The matinee is at 2:00, you see.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within a few hours, Mr. Krahn. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a printed handout with information about hypertension, including dietary recommendations and stress-reduction techniques. I also want to mention, given your memory concerns and slightly elevated blood pressure, I think it would be a good idea to schedule a follow-up appointment with a neurologist to rule out any underlying cognitive issues. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it really necessary, Doctor? I mean, I just want to get back to work. I’m not feeling sick, you see. And I don’t want to worry Mrs. Gable. Perhaps it’s just… old age?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. It's not about assuming anything is seriously wrong. It’s about being thorough, especially since you mentioned some memory difficulties. Memory changes can be caused by many things, and it’s best to rule out any potential underlying issues. A neurologist is the specialist best equipped to evaluate those concerns. It doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong, but it will give us peace of mind and allow us to create a plan to support your overall health. We can do some simple cognitive tests in the office first to see if a full neurological evaluation is warranted. Would you be open to trying that?
PATIENT: Simple tests… in the office? Alright. Yes, alright. Simple tests. If that’s all. But please be quick, Doctor. The curtain… it’s looming. And… can you explain what sort of things the tests involve? I don’t want to be caught off guard.
DOCTOR: Of course. The tests are very straightforward, Mr. Krahn. They involve things like recalling a list of words, identifying objects, performing simple calculations, and answering a few questions about your day-to-day life. It will take about 15-20 minutes. If you're comfortable, we can do them now while we wait for the lab results. We can also postpone them if you'd prefer. It’s entirely up to you. Would you like to proceed now, or would you like a few minutes to think about it?
PATIENT: Alright. Let’s just get it over with. The quicker the better, Doctor. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit… flustered. This is all very unsettling. Just… please be gentle. And… don’t make me feel foolish.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. I will be as gentle as possible, and there’s absolutely no need to feel foolish. This is a safe space, and it’s all about gathering information. Okay, let’s start with a simple memory test. I’m going to read you three words, and I want you to try and remember them. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Ready… I suppose. Go ahead, Doctor. But please speak clearly. My hearing isn't what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The first word is… apple. The second word is… table. And the third word is… pencil. Now, I'm going to ask you a few unrelated questions, then I'll come back to the words. Can you tell me what day of the week it is today?
PATIENT: Today… Is it… Tuesday? No, wait. Wednesday? Oh dear. I always forget. It’s one of those days… the middle of the week. It escapes me. It truly does.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly normal to forget sometimes. Let's move on. Now, can you tell me what your phone number is?
PATIENT: My… my phone number? Oh dear. I… I haven’t memorized it. My wife used to handle all that. I just… I dial from my contacts list. I don’t recall the numbers. I truly don’t. It’s been years since I’ve needed to.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. It's not uncommon for people to rely on contacts these days. Now, let’s come back to those three words I read to you earlier. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Three words… I… I’m afraid I can’t. They’ve… they’ve vanished. It’s like a fog. Apple… something. A table, perhaps? And… and a pencil? I’m just… I’m so sorry. This is dreadful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. Don’t apologize. These tests are just a quick assessment, and it’s not uncommon to have difficulty recalling things, especially under stress. Based on these initial results, I think it would be wise to schedule a more comprehensive neurological evaluation with a specialist. This will allow us to get a clearer picture of what’s going on and determine the best course of action. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A specialist… Oh dear. Is it… is it serious, Doctor? Is something wrong with my brain? I’m just an old theater usher, you see. I just want to get back to work. I don’t want any trouble.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, it’s too early to say anything definitively. These initial tests simply indicate that there might be some memory concerns that warrant further investigation. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. Many things can affect memory, and a specialist can help us determine the cause. We’re simply being cautious and thorough. A neurological evaluation will involve some more detailed cognitive tests and possibly some imaging, but it will give us peace of mind and allow us to create a plan to support your overall health. I can refer you to a highly respected neurologist in the area. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: …Alright. Yes. Please. Refer me. If you think it’s best. Just… please send me to someone gentle. And… someone who understands that I just want to get back to my matinee.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. I will refer you to Dr. Eleanor Vance. She’s an excellent neurologist and is known for her compassionate and patient approach. I will also include a note in the referral outlining your concerns and your desire for a gentle and understanding evaluation. Here you go. This form contains Dr. Vance’s contact information and instructions on how to schedule an appointment. Her office will contact you to arrange a consultation. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. And remember, if you experience any sudden changes in your memory or any other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact me. The lab results should be back shortly. We’ll call you as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For everything. I just hope… I just hope it’s nothing serious. And… and that I can still get back to the theater.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and ensure you receive the best possible care. Try not to worry too much until we have more information. And remember, if you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Now, if you're feeling up to it, I'll have a nurse escort you to the waiting room. And we'll call you as soon as the lab results are available. .
PATIENT: .
