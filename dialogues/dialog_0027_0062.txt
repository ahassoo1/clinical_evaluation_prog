DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue. I am here today regarding a matter at my workplace. It concerns the requirement to wear masks, and I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and it’s… causing some difficulties for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. A mask exemption request related to your work… Protective Service Worker, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Protective Service Worker. It's a bit hard to explain without going into detail, but the masks interfere with some of the techniques we use to… well, to help people. And it’s causing me some discomfort, both physically and, truthfully, emotionally. I want to be able to do my job properly, and safely, for everyone involved.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a complex situation. Can you tell me a bit more about how the masks are interfering with your techniques?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s difficult to describe… a lot of what we do relies on reading body language, subtle cues. The masks cover a good portion of a person's face, which makes that very hard. And sometimes, we need to get quite close to individuals. It feels… distant, and less genuine, when I’m wearing one. It’s harder to build trust, you see. It’s not just about me being uncomfortable, it’s about the people I’m trying to help. It feels like a barrier.
DOCTOR: That makes a lot of sense, Mr. Knabenshue. Building trust is vital in your line of work, and nonverbal communication is key. So, you're finding the mask is impacting your ability to read those cues and connect with the people you assist. And it’s causing you some emotional distress as a result. Is there a specific type of mask your workplace requires?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is a very accurate assessment. It’s… unsettling to feel that disconnect. And yes, the workplace requires an N95 mask. They say it’s for protection, which I understand, but it’s a very… rigid mask. Not something easily adaptable to close interactions. It feels very… isolating, truthfully. It’s not like a simple cloth covering; it’s quite substantial. I haven’t been told why specifically an N95 is required, just that it is.
DOCTOR: Okay. An N95… That does present more of a challenge. And it’s good you’ve clarified they haven’t given a specific reason. Do you have any underlying health conditions that make wearing an N95 uncomfortable – shortness of breath, anxiety, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully I do not. I'm generally in good health, physically. It's not a breathing issue, or a feeling of being…claustrophobic, exactly. It’s more… the disruption to my work, and the feeling of distance. It affects my ability to do my job effectively, which then causes me… stress, I suppose. It’s a professional concern, more than a medical one, though I understand the two can be connected. I just… want to be able to help people, and this feels like an obstacle.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. Let me just quickly pull up your EHR… Just checking for any relevant history. Alright, I see nothing here that immediately contraindicates mask use. So, it sounds like we’re dealing with a situation where the mask is impacting your professional duties and causing you distress, rather than a direct medical issue. Have you discussed this with your employer at all?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. I spoke with my supervisor, and they were… understanding, but firm. They said the policy is company-wide, and based on recommendations from… well, they didn't specify who, exactly. They suggested I submit a request for accommodation, which is why I’m here. They haven’t denied the request outright, but they did say it would need to be supported by a medical professional. That’s why I wanted to get your opinion, and see if there's anything you can document to help support my case.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. So, they're requesting documentation. Let's talk about physical exam findings. I’d like to just quickly assess your respiratory function, just to be thorough. And I’ll check your general wellbeing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I have no objection to a physical examination. I want to be as thorough as possible, and I appreciate you taking the time to consider all aspects of this. I understand the importance of being complete and accurate. Please, proceed as you see fit.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start with your respiratory rate. Take a few deep breaths for me… Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi. Respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, which is within normal limits. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Overall, your vital signs are stable. Let’s quickly check your oxygen saturation... Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air, also within normal limits. Do you have any history of asthma, COPD, or other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve never been diagnosed with any lung conditions. I've always been a relatively healthy individual. I try to stay active when I can, though the nature of my work doesn’t always allow for it. I do not have a history of asthma or COPD, or any other respiratory problems. I’ve never smoked, either. I appreciate you being so thorough. It’s reassuring to know everything appears to be… normal, physically.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Mr. Knabenshue, based on my brief examination, your respiratory function appears normal, and there are no obvious medical contraindications to mask use. However, I can certainly document the impact this is having on your ability to perform your job duties, specifically the difficulty in reading nonverbal cues and building trust with clients due to the mask obstructing facial expressions. I can also note the emotional distress this is causing you, and the potential impact on the quality of care you provide. Would that be sufficient for your employer?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be… immensely helpful, and greatly appreciated. Documenting the impact on my job duties and the emotional distress… that is precisely what I was hoping for. That would certainly strengthen my case with my employer. I believe that accurately reflecting the challenges I am facing is the most important thing. Thank you for taking the time to listen and understand. I truly appreciate your support. Would you be able to provide that documentation in writing?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knabenshue. I'll generate a letter outlining my findings—or rather, my observations regarding your concerns. It will state that your physical examination revealed no medical contraindications to mask use, but I acknowledge the challenges you are experiencing in performing your job duties—specifically, the obstruction of nonverbal cues and the difficulty in building trust with clients—and the emotional distress this is causing you. I’ll include a statement that this may impact the quality of care you provide. I can print that out for you now. Here you go. Would you like me to go over it with you briefly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. I would greatly appreciate a quick review, just to ensure everything is accurately reflected. I want to be certain it will be a clear and concise representation of our conversation and my concerns. Thank you again for your time and consideration. I am very grateful.
DOCTOR: Alright. As you can see here, it states your vital signs were normal, and there were no respiratory abnormalities detected during the examination. Then, in the 'Assessment' section, I’ve detailed the challenges you described regarding your ability to read nonverbal cues and build rapport with clients while wearing an N95 mask. I’ve also included a statement acknowledging the emotional distress this is causing you. It concludes by stating that these factors may impact the quality of care you provide. Does that accurately reflect our conversation, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… remarkably accurate. The description of the challenges, and the acknowledgement of the emotional distress… it’s all there. You’ve captured the essence of my concerns very well. The statement about potentially impacting the quality of care is also important. Yes, that document will be very helpful. Thank you. I truly appreciate your support in this matter. Is there anything else I need to do, or any further information I should provide?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Knabenshue, I believe that’s all. I’ve documented my findings to the best of my ability. It's up to your employer to determine if this constitutes sufficient accommodation. I wish you the best of luck with your request. If you have any further questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Do you have any other medical concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is all. I greatly appreciate your time, your understanding, and your willingness to listen. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again. I believe I am all set for today. Have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and please, take care. .
