DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… my… my sinuses? They been… bothering me. For… a little while now, I think. It’s hard to say exactly how long. It feels stuffy, mostly. And… a little pain, on my face.
DOCTOR: "A little while now"... I understand pinpointing the exact start can be difficult. Could you describe the pain a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… not a sharp pain, Doctor. More… like pressure. Right… here, on my cheekbones. <points vaguely to her cheekbones> And sometimes… across my forehead. It’s worse when I… bend over, I think. Or when it’s cold. Does that make sense? I don't remember exactly when it started feeling this way, though. Everything feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Fuzzy. Like… I know it’s been going on for a while. But the dates… and when things started… it’s hard to remember. It’s not… a new thing, this feeling. But I can't say when it began. I’m sorry. I don't mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Boham. We'll work through it. It’s not uncommon for symptoms to be difficult to recall precisely. Aside from the pressure and the sensation of fullness, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this sinus issue?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. <pauses, looking up at the ceiling> I think… maybe a little bit of… running nose? Sometimes. Not all the time. And… I feel tired. Very tired. But… I always feel a little tired. <shrugs> It's hard to tell if that's from my sinuses or just… life. And I don’t have a fever, I don’t think. My husband would tell me if I did.
DOCTOR: And is the nasal discharge clear, colored, or thick?
PATIENT: Oh… <frowns, concentrating> Hmm. Sometimes clear, I think. But… sometimes it looks… yellowish. Not a bright yellow, but… a pale yellow. And… it’s not very thick. Just… not clear all the time. I don't really pay much attention, to be honest. It's just… a nose thing. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Boham. Now, have you experienced any recent illness—a cold, the flu, or anything similar—prior to the onset of these sinus symptoms, as best you recall?
PATIENT: <pauses, tilting her head> Oh, goodness… I… I think… maybe a little cold. A few weeks ago, maybe? But it wasn’t a bad cold. Just… a little sniffly. My husband had it too, and it went away pretty quick. I can’t really remember when exactly, though. It feels like a long time ago. Everything is… mixed up in my head. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on, then. Do you have any allergies that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies…? <frowns, concentrating hard> I… don’t think so, Doctor. My husband says I don’t sneeze enough to have allergies. <chuckles softly> He's always teasing me about that. But… I don’t go outside much. So… maybe I just haven’t been allergic to anything yet? I really don't know. We don’t have much dust in the house, either. He keeps it very clean.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not anything. Just… <pauses> sometimes a little tea. For… feeling calm. But it doesn't have medicine in it. Just… herbs. My neighbor gives it to me. She grows them herself. And I don’t take it every day. Just when I’m… stressed. I don't really like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: <pauses, thinking hard> Oh… that’s a hard question, Doctor. I… I’ve been pretty healthy, I think. I mean, I get tired. But everyone gets tired, right? My husband says I have a strong heart. But… I don’t know about conditions. I don’t really go to the doctor much. Not unless I really need to. <shrugs helplessly> I don't remember being told I had anything.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not any. Not that I remember, anyway. <pauses> I had my babies, of course. But that wasn't a… surgery, was it? Just… babies. And I was healthy after that. As far as I know. I didn't stay in the hospital long, either. Just a few days, each time. It was a long time ago. Everything is… fuzzy, like I said. I’m sorry I can’t be more clear.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try this. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family…? <frowns in concentration> My mama… she had… a little trouble with her stomach, when she was older. But I don’t know what it was. Just… stomach trouble. And my papa… he had a strong heart, like me. He lived to be a very old man. <pauses> I don’t know about anyone else. My brother lives far away, and we don't talk much. I don't know if he’s had any… troubles. It’s been a long time. Does that help? I don't have very good memories of my family.
DOCTOR: And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? <pauses, thinking hard> Oh… I stay home, mostly. I take care of the house. And my husband works. He’s a… a very good man. I don’t go out much. I like to read. And I cook. And I pray. <smiles faintly> It’s a quiet life. I don't smoke. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Just… a little wine sometimes, with dinner. It's… peaceful. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is what I meant. Now, Ms. Boham, I’m going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and I’ll examine your sinuses. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. <slightly anxious> I… I don’t like the cold instruments, but… if you need to, you can. Just… be gentle, please? I'm a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. <Starts auscultating Ms. Boham’s chest with the stethoscope. After a moment> Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. <Palpates Ms. Boham's sinuses, pressing gently> There's tenderness to palpation over the maxillary sinuses. Minimal edema. <Uses the otoscope to briefly examine Ms. Boham’s nasal passages> Nasal passages are slightly erythematous, with some clear discharge present. No significant polyps noted. <Removes the instruments> Okay. That concludes the examination.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That wasn't too bad. <slightly relieved> Is… is it bad, Doctor? What does that… erythematous mean? And what should I do? I’m a little worried now. It feels like I'm not explaining myself very well.
DOCTOR: "Erythematous" simply means there is some redness and inflammation of the nasal passages. Based on your history and the findings of the examination, it appears you are likely experiencing acute sinusitis, likely viral in origin. However, given the prolonged duration of your symptoms and the presence of yellowish nasal discharge, we must rule out a possible bacterial component. I’m going to order a complete blood count to assess for signs of infection.
PATIENT: Oh… a… complete blood count…? <frowns, looking anxious> What will that… show, Doctor? Will it be… painful? And what if it is bacterial? Will I need… pills? I don’t really like taking pills, as I said. I'm starting to feel a little dizzy now. <clutches her chest lightly> Is this… serious?
DOCTOR: The complete blood count is a routine blood test, Ms. Boham, not a painful procedure. It will help determine if your body is fighting an infection. If the results indicate a bacterial infection, you may require a short course of antibiotics. It is a standard treatment. However, we will proceed cautiously and only prescribe antibiotics if absolutely necessary. The dizziness you are experiencing could be related to your sinus congestion, but I will also check your blood pressure to rule out other causes. <Takes Ms. Boham’s blood pressure> Blood pressure is 118/76. Within normal limits. <Looks directly at Ms. Boham with a slightly condescending tone> While antibiotics are often necessary, they are not without side effects, and overuse can lead to resistance. We will proceed with a conservative approach. I recommend nasal saline rinses twice daily, increased fluid intake, and over-the-counter decongestants as needed. We will re-evaluate in five days. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, you are to contact the clinic immediately.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That sounds… better. Nasal… saline rinses? Like… with salt water? I think my neighbor told me about that. <pauses> And if it gets worse, I should call. Okay. Five days… I can remember that. <slightly relieved> Will I… need a special form for the blood test? And… is there anything else I should be doing? I don’t want to forget anything. I just want to feel better. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Boham, saline rinses with salt water. The lab will provide you with the necessary requisition form. As for anything else, rest and hydrate. Avoid exposure to irritants, such as smoke or strong perfumes. And try to reduce stress, if possible. <pauses> Now, is there anything you would like to ask me?
