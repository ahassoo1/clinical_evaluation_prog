DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Good morning to you too. Look, I don't have all day, you know. I just... I don't like what I see in the mirror no more. Everything's… drooping. And it's not a pretty sight. I want it fixed. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. You’re concerned about some changes you’ve noticed in your appearance. “Drooping,” you said?
PATIENT: Yes, drooping! Like an old… well, never you mind what I said. Everything’s going down. My face, you understand? It used to be… firmer. Now it's just… sad lookin’. And it's botherin’ me. Is that so hard to understand? I want it pulled back up. You got somethin’ that can do that?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Mr. Trendler. And it’s certainly valid to want to address concerns about your appearance. Could you tell me a little more specifically where you’re noticing this drooping?
PATIENT: Ugh. You askin’ me to be a mapmaker now? It's… everywhere! The cheeks, mostly. And around the mouth. Makes me look like I’m always frownin’. You know, like a grumpy old man. Which I ain’t… usually. But it makes me look like one. Is that clear enough for you? I ain't got time for this detailin'. Just fix it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a bit clearer, thank you. So, it sounds like you're concerned about the skin around your cheeks and mouth. Have you noticed any other changes, perhaps with your jawline or neck?
PATIENT: Neck? What about my neck? I haven’t even looked at my neck. I don’t go around inspectin’ my body like some… model. I told you, cheeks and mouth! That's where the problem is. You keep askin’ me about things I haven’t noticed. Look, just tell me if you can tighten it up, or if I’m wastin’ my time. I got better things to do. Like… gardenin’.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. It's perfectly alright if you haven’t noticed changes elsewhere. Let’s focus on the cheeks and mouth then. Have you noticed any changes in how you eat or speak?
PATIENT: Speak? What’s speakin’ got to do with my face droopin’? I talk just fine! And I eat just fine. I enjoy a good plate o’ ackee and saltfish, same as always. You askin’ silly questions now. Is this some kind of test? I just want to know if you can fix it, or not. I ain't here to be quizzed on my appetite.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I apologize if my questions seem silly. I just want to get a better understanding of what's going on. You mentioned noticing these changes recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Hmmph. Well, not yesterday. But... maybe a year or so? Hard to say exactly. Time flies when you’re gettin’ old, you know. It just... slowly started lookin’ worse. That's all I know. Don't need a calendar to tell me that. Just fix the droopin’. Is that possible, or am I talkin’ to a brick wall here?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand. It sounds like this has been a gradual change over the past year. To get a better idea of what’s going on, and to see what options might be available, would you mind if I just take a quick look at your face?
PATIENT: Look at my face? You mean… poke at it? I don't like bein' poked and prodded. I ain't come here for no examination. I just want to know if you can tighten it up or not. But… alright. Quick, you said? Don't go pressin’ too hard, now. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Very quick, I promise. Just a gentle assessment. And I will be very careful. I'm just going to look at the skin’s elasticity and the underlying muscle structure. Okay, Mr. Trendler. Just relax. I’m just feeling the tone of the skin here… and along the jawline. I notice some mild laxity in the skin around your cheeks and mouth. And the muscle tone feels… diminished. It’s not dramatic, but it’s noticeable. I also see some… subtle wrinkles.
PATIENT: Wrinkles?! Now you're insultin’ me! I ain't old old! I just… lived a good life, that's all. Diminished muscle tone? Sounds awful. Look, just tell me what can be done about the droopin’. Don't need a fancy description of my failings. Can you fix it or can't you? I got gardenin' to do. And a perfectly good ackee and saltfish waitin’ for me at home.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I offended you, Mr. Trendler. I certainly didn’t mean to. These are just observations, not judgments. As for fixing the “drooping,” there are several options we could consider. One possibility is a facelift, which involves tightening the underlying muscle and skin. Another option would be dermal fillers, which can add volume and lift to the cheeks. There are also non-surgical options like radiofrequency skin tightening, though those typically provide more subtle results. Each option has its own risks and benefits, and the best choice would depend on your specific goals and expectations. Would you be interested in discussing these options in more detail?
PATIENT: Radio… what now? Look, I ain’t interested in no fancy names and technical mumbo jumbo. Just tell me… which one will fix the droopin’ the fastest? And which one is least likely to make me look like… a stretched rubber band. I don't want to end up lookin’ like one of them… Hollywood folks. I just want to look… normal again. And preferably, soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand. You want something relatively quick and natural-looking. In that case, dermal fillers would likely be the best starting point. They require minimal downtime and can provide a noticeable lift to the cheeks without significantly altering your appearance. The results aren’t permanent, lasting typically six to twelve months, but that allows you to adjust the treatment as needed. A facelift provides more dramatic and longer-lasting results, but it requires more significant recovery time and carries a higher risk of complications. The fillers can be done right here in the office, with very little discomfort. Would you be interested in learning more about that procedure?
PATIENT: Six to twelve months?! You mean I gotta come back and get poked again and again? Sounds like a racket! But… alright. If it’s just a poke, and I don’t end up lookin’ like a stretched rubber band, maybe. Tell me… does it hurt? And how long will I be… all puffed up afterwards? I got gardenin' to do, remember. Can’t be lyin’ around lookin’ like a balloon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Trendler. The discomfort is typically minimal. We use a local anesthetic to numb the area before injecting the filler, so most patients only feel a slight pinching sensation. As for swelling, it’s usually mild and subsides within a few days. Some bruising is also possible, but we can take steps to minimize that. Most patients are able to resume normal activities, including gardening, within a day or two, although strenuous exercise should be avoided for 24 hours. Would you like me to show you some before-and-after photos of patients who have undergone this procedure?
PATIENT: Pictures, eh? Alright. Let’s see these… pictures. But don't show me no fancy Hollywood types. Show me regular folks. Folks who look… normal. And if they still look normal after the poke, maybe I’ll consider it. But if they look like stretched rubber bands, forget it. I ain't wastin' my time or my money on that.
DOCTOR: Here are a few examples, Mr. Trendler. These are all patients who have undergone dermal filler injections to address similar concerns – mild laxity in the cheeks and mouth. As you can see, the results are subtle but noticeable. They don't dramatically alter their appearance, but they provide a more refreshed and youthful look. This woman was concerned about similar drooping you mentioned. Notice how the filler has lifted her cheeks and smoothed out the lines around her mouth. It doesn't look overly done, does it?
PATIENT: Hmmph. She still looks… like a normal lady. Not stretched or nothin'. Not bad. Not bad at all. But… how long does this… stuff last? And what happens when it wears off? Do I just… deflate? I don’t wanna be lookin' worse than I do now. That would be a disaster.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Trendler. The filler is made of hyaluronic acid, which is a naturally occurring substance in the body. As it gradually breaks down, it’s absorbed by the body. You won’t “deflate” suddenly. The effects simply fade gradually over time, typically six to twelve months. If you choose not to repeat the treatment, your face will simply return to its original appearance. There are no lasting effects. And we can always start with a conservative amount of filler, to ensure you’re happy with the results before adding more. Would you like to discuss the cost of the procedure, and schedule a consultation to determine the best treatment plan for you?
PATIENT: Hmmph. No sudden deflatin’, eh? That's good. Alright. Let’s talk about… money. How much is this… poke gonna cost me? And don't try to pull any fancy tricks. I ain't no fool. Tell me straight. And then… maybe we can talk about a consultation. But no promises. I still got gardenin’ to do. .
