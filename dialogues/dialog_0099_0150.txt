DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. Good to meet you. So, you're here today… tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day. I’m 51, and I want to be perfectly clear – I want to get pregnant. And I want to do it without any… complications. Is that so difficult to understand? I’ve read things, you know. It shouldn’t be a problem, should it? I’m still… capable.
DOCTOR: Capable is… relative, Ms. Shteynberg. And while I appreciate your directness, achieving a successful pregnancy at 51 is significantly more complex than simply being "capable." It’s not a matter of dismissing the possibility, it's about understanding the risks and preparing appropriately. We’ll need to do a thorough assessment. I’m going to ask a lot of questions, alright?
PATIENT: Questions. Of course. Everyone asks questions. Look, I'm in good health. I cycle every day – I repair bicycles, remember? It keeps me quite fit. I don’t smoke, I drink occasionally – a glass of wine with dinner, nothing excessive. I just want to know what tests I need, and how quickly we can move forward. Honestly, the waiting is what worries me most. Time isn't exactly on my side.
DOCTOR: Right. Cycling is good exercise, yes. But "good health" and fertility are… distinct concepts, Ms. Shteynberg. While your lifestyle habits are commendable, age significantly impacts egg quality and ovarian reserve. And even occasional wine… well, it’s best to be entirely abstinent when considering pregnancy. Before we discuss tests, let's clarify a few things. Have you been attempting conception already?
PATIENT: Attempting? No. I haven't been… trying. I'm not foolish. I understand things might be… different at my age. That's why I'm here now, before wasting time on… natural methods. I want to know what can be done, not if it's possible. Is that so hard to grasp? I want to explore options. Assisted options. And quickly. I'm a practical woman.
DOCTOR: Practical, yes. I understand. And frankly, a proactive approach is sensible. "Options," as you say, primarily revolve around assisted reproductive technology – specifically, in vitro fertilization, or IVF, with donor eggs being the most viable route at your age. Before we delve into that, I need to establish a baseline. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Once. A long time ago. It… didn’t work out. A very long time ago. And frankly, I’d rather not rehash old history. It’s irrelevant. What is relevant is that I’m healthy now, and I want to know if my body is capable of carrying a pregnancy. Not whether I was successful decades ago. It's a different body. A stronger body, frankly. Just tell me what tests you need to do, doctor. Let's not waste any more time with personal questions.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, with all due respect, past pregnancy history is relevant. It informs potential risks and complications. Dismissing it isn’t helpful. But, very well. We'll focus on the present. We'll need a comprehensive blood panel – hormone levels, complete metabolic panel, blood type and Rh factor, infectious disease screening… the standard fertility workup. We also need to assess your uterine lining – a saline sonohysterogram to rule out any polyps or fibroids. And, given your age, a full cardiac evaluation is absolutely necessary before proceeding. Are you agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Cardiac evaluation? Really? I cycle uphill for a living! Do you even listen? Fine. Do your tests. All of them. Just… get it over with. And tell me how long they'll take. I have commitments. Important commitments. Don't tell me it's going to be weeks, doctor. I haven’t got weeks. I’d like to know approximately when I can expect results. And who exactly will be explaining them? I don't want to be bounced around between nurses and technicians. I want you.
DOCTOR: Very well. The blood work can be done today – results typically take 72 hours. The saline sonohysterogram will require scheduling with radiology – let's say within the next three business days. As for the cardiac evaluation… given your insistence, I'll expedite a referral to Dr. Chen – she’s excellent and can typically see new patients within a week. And yes, I will personally explain the results to you. However, understand that IVF involves a team – endocrinologists, embryologists… I will oversee your care, but it’s not a one-doctor process. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: No allergies. Absolutely none. And I understand about the “team”. Just… please, keep it efficient. I don’t have time for endless meetings and drawn-out explanations. I need a clear plan, and I need it quickly. Now, about the donor eggs… do you have any preferred agencies? Or will I be left to sort through… questionable candidates myself? Honestly, the thought is… unsettling. I expect a certain level of quality. This isn't some… lottery.
DOCTOR: "Questionable candidates," as you put it, are thoroughly screened, Ms. Shteynberg. We work with two reputable agencies: Create Fertility and Pinnacle Egg Bank. Both have stringent donor selection criteria – medical history, genetic screening, psychological evaluations… it's a rigorous process. I have their catalogs here. They outline donor profiles, ethnicity, education levels, physical characteristics… You review them, and we discuss options that align with your preferences. Before you delve into that, however, let’s obtain the baseline test results. We need to confirm your overall health before proceeding with any significant investment. Do you have your insurance card with you?
PATIENT: Medicare. It’s all I have. And frankly, I doubt it will cover much of this… extravagance. Don’t bother checking. I’m prepared for out-of-pocket expenses. I’m a pragmatic woman, remember? I have resources. Just… don’t waste my time with insurance approvals and denials. I’m paying for this, one way or another. Just let’s get the tests done, and tell me how much it's going to cost. All of it. A clear, concise figure. No hidden fees. And no surprises. Is that possible, doctor? A simple, honest quote?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your… directness. However, providing a definitive “quote” for IVF with donor eggs is exceedingly difficult. It depends on donor availability, medication protocols, and potential complications. But, a rough estimate, excluding complications, is between $18,000 and $25,000 per cycle. That includes donor egg procurement, fertilization, embryo transfer, and initial monitoring. Medication costs will be additional. We'll review a detailed breakdown with the financial counselor once we have the baseline results. Let’s begin with the blood work. The phlebotomist is ready in Lab 3. Please refrain from eating or drinking anything except water for at least eight hours prior to the test. And if you could provide a urine sample, that would be excellent. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Eight hours? I had breakfast. That means I’ll have to reschedule. Honestly, this is becoming more and more inconvenient. Very well. I’ll reschedule. But I expect to be prioritized. And I expect a prompt appointment. I’m not known for my patience. Just tell me the number for rescheduling. And make sure it's someone efficient. I haven’t got all day. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. That’s 555-1212, extension 314. Ask for Sarah. She's quite efficient. I'll also make a note to prioritize your scheduling. I trust that will suffice, Ms. Shteynberg?
