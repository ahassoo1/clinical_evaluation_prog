DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now? Not all the time, comes and goes. Feels like… a pressure, maybe? Not a bad pain, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pressure at the back of your head for about three days, coming and going. Not severe, just bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… after I was working. At the yard. I drive the little train, you know? The dinky? Takes the parts around. It was hot that day. Very hot. I was lifting some things too, not too heavy, but… lifting. I think it started then.
DOCTOR: Right, so it seems to have started after a day of work at the yard – driving the train and some lifting, on a hot day. Do you recall anything specific that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: Triggered? You mean… what made it start? Not really. Just… hot. And lifting. I always lift things at the yard. I been doing that work for… oh, a long time. Maybe sixty years? But that day… it was really hot. I remember sweating a lot. And I had to wait a long time for a part… sun was strong then.
DOCTOR: Sixty years, that's quite a commitment! Okay, so a particularly hot day with lifting and some time spent in the sun. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… No fever, I don’t think. Maybe a little tired, but I’m always a little tired. No blurry vision. No… feeling sick to my stomach. Just… the head. And sometimes… my neck feels a little stiff, but that happens sometimes too. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, things do sometimes ache with age. No fever, no nausea, no vision changes. Just the headache and occasional neck stiffness. Do you take anything for the headache currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take nothing. Never been one for pills, if I can help it. I just… try to rest. And drink water. Sometimes it goes away on its own. But it keeps coming back. That's why I came. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand. You prefer to avoid medication, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out when it started to bother you. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and feel around your head and neck. It won't take long.
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Blood pressure is 148/92, pulse is 78 and regular. I'm feeling some mild tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull, on both sides. No swelling or other abnormalities that I can feel. Your range of motion in your neck is slightly limited, but doesn’t seem to cause significant pain with movement. Given your description and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing a tension headache, possibly brought on by the heat and physical exertion. The muscle tenderness is consistent with that. However, given your age, and because it’s a new symptom, I want to be thorough. Would you mind if I order a simple blood test, just to rule out anything else?
PATIENT: Blood test? Hmm… okay. If you think it’s best. I don’t like going to the hospital, but… if it will make sure nothing bad is happening, then yes. Okay, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. It's a simple blood draw, we can do it right here in the clinic. It will help us check for things like inflammation or other underlying causes. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend staying well-hydrated, especially if you’ll be out in the heat. Over-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with the pain, if you’re willing to try that. And try to avoid strenuous activity for a few days. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, Doctor. Never had any allergies. I can eat anything, take anything. My wife… she was the one with allergies. Pollen, mostly. But me? No. I’m a tough old man.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No known allergies. Okay, I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw a few vials of blood. We should have the results back within a couple of business days. I'll give you a call as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if the headache worsens significantly, or if you develop any other symptoms like fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Clear as a bell, Doctor. If it gets worse, go to the hospital. I understand. Thank you. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. I'm glad I could help. We'll get those results back as quickly as possible and go from there. Here’s a slip with the lab’s contact information, and my direct line if you have any questions. Do you have any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again. It’s good to know someone is looking after me. My wife… she would have liked you.
DOCTOR: It's my pleasure, Mr. Brum. I'm happy to help, and I'm glad you feel reassured. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any further questions. Get some rest, stay hydrated, and we’ll talk soon. Have a good day, Mr. Brum.
PATIENT: .
