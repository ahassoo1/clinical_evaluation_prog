DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s about getting surgery, I think. For my weight. My wife helped me set up the appointment… I don’t really remember all the details, honestly. It’s a pre-surgery thing, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. We do have you scheduled for a consultation regarding weight management, and potentially bariatric surgery. It seems your wife contacted us. I understand you said you don’t recall all the details, that’s perfectly alright. We can go over everything together. First, could you tell me a little bit about why you are considering surgery?
PATIENT: Um… well, it’s hard. I’ve always… struggled with my weight. It makes things difficult, you know? Just… getting around. And I want to be able to… play with my grandkids more. My wife says it’s affecting my health, too. I get tired easily. I just want to feel better, I guess. It’s been a long time coming. I don’t really know why exactly, just… that it's time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Mr. Kochubey. That makes perfect sense. It sounds like you’re looking for an improvement in your overall quality of life – more energy, being able to enjoy time with your grandchildren. We want to help you with that. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a little bit about how long you’ve been struggling with your weight?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… a long time. Since I was a kid, probably. It goes up and down, but mostly… up. I tried diets, you know? Lots of them. And exercise… when I could. But it never really stayed off. It’s been worse the last… five years, maybe? Since my retirement. I just… don't move around as much anymore. It’s hard to explain. I feel like I've tried everything.
DOCTOR: It sounds incredibly frustrating to have tried so many approaches without lasting success. Five years is a significant period. We appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day… hmm. I wake up, usually around 7. My wife makes breakfast – eggs, toast, sometimes cereal. I watch TV for a bit, then maybe read the newspaper. I don’t really do much. I might go for a short walk if the weather is nice, but not every day. Lunch is usually something simple – a sandwich, soup. Then more TV. Dinner with my wife, and… that’s pretty much it. I’m retired, so there’s not much structure to my day. It’s pretty quiet.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like a fairly sedentary lifestyle. Have you noticed any other health issues alongside your weight?
PATIENT: Well… I get tired easily, like I said. And my knees… they bother me sometimes. Especially when I walk. My wife says I snore a lot, too. And… I get out of breath pretty quick if I try to do anything strenuous. I haven’t really seen a doctor in a while, so I don’t know what’s going on exactly. I just figured it was because of my weight. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Those symptoms – fatigue, knee pain, snoring, shortness of breath – can certainly be associated with weight, yes. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. Snoring, in particular, can be a sign of sleep apnea, which is a serious condition. Before we discuss surgical options, I’d like to get a more complete picture of your health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had high blood pressure a few years back, I think. But it went down with medication. And… I think I had some trouble with my cholesterol once. But again, it went down with pills. I don’t really remember much else. My wife usually handles all that stuff. I’m not very good at remembering medical details.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. That's alright, we’ll do our best to piece everything together. I see a note here about hypertension managed with medication, and elevated cholesterol also previously treated. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Let's see... yes. I take a pill for my blood pressure, every morning. And… a little orange one for my cholesterol. That’s it, I think. My wife gets them filled every month. I just take them, I don’t really ask too many questions. I leave that to her.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes during pollen season, but nothing serious. I don't think I'm allergic to any foods, either. My wife says I eat everything. I guess I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, Mr. Kochubey, before we move onto a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… um. My dad, he had heart problems. He had a heart attack when he was pretty young. And my mom, she had diabetes. She had to take shots for it. And… my brother, he’s overweight too. Really overweight. Other than that, I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. My parents are gone now, and we didn’t really talk about those things much. It wasn't really a big thing in my family.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kochubey. That’s helpful information. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I go along. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, and I can hear some mild crackles in your lungs. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 150/90 – a little higher than we’d like to see. I’ll also take your temperature and pulse. Your temperature is normal, and your pulse is 88. Now, I’d like to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Everything looks normal there. Finally, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. It's soft to the touch, but slightly enlarged. I would also like to examine your knees. Please lie down on the examination table. There is some tenderness and limited range of motion in both knees. I suspect some early signs of osteoarthritis. Okay, Mr. Kochubey, that concludes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis, huh? I figured something was wrong with my knees. They’ve been bothering me for a while now. So… what does all this mean, Doctor? Is surgery the only option?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, you have several factors contributing to your weight and overall health. We have elevated blood pressure, a history of high cholesterol, family history of heart disease and diabetes, and signs of osteoarthritis in your knees. Your BMI is 32, placing you in the obese category. Surgery is an option, but it is not the only option. We want to explore all possibilities before considering something as significant as bariatric surgery. We should start with lifestyle modifications - a healthier diet and regular exercise, if possible. I also recommend a referral to a physical therapist to address the pain and limited range of motion in your knees. We could also discuss medication to help manage your blood pressure and cholesterol. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests – a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and A1C to check your blood sugar levels. We could also do an X-ray of your knees to confirm the osteoarthritis. How does that sound to you?
PATIENT: That… sounds good, Doctor. Maybe surgery isn't the best first step. I’d like to try the other things first, if possible. I’m not very good at exercise, but I can try to eat better. And the physical therapy sounds like a good idea for my knees. Blood tests are fine too. Whatever you think is best. What’s the next step?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Kochubey. I agree, starting with lifestyle modifications and addressing your knee pain is a good approach. My nurse will draw the blood for the tests right away. We’ll get those results back in a few days. I’ll also write you a referral to a physical therapist – they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also provide you with some information on healthy eating and resources for exercise. In the meantime, please try to increase your physical activity gradually, even if it's just a short walk each day. And focus on making small, sustainable changes to your diet – reducing sugary drinks, processed foods, and increasing your intake of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the blood test results and how you’re progressing with the lifestyle changes. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Two weeks is good. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a lot better now, knowing what’s going on and what we can do about it. I appreciate your help. I guess I’ll go get the blood tests done.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re a team in this. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will guide you to the lab. Have a good day, and we’ll see you in two weeks.
