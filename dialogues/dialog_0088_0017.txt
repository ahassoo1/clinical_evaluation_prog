DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I’m Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Yes, well… it’s about this… tryout. For the team. Baseball. I think. It’s… a physical, right? They said I needed one. A long time ago, maybe. I don't recall all the details, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bartok, it looks like we do have you scheduled for a sports physical. And you’re right, it’s been a while – October 2023. Alright. To start, can you tell me a little more about this team?
PATIENT: A team… hmm. It’s… local. I think. Old men mostly. Not the young fellas. Recreation league. Something like that. Honestly, Doctor, my memory ain’t what it used to be. It’s… over by the park. Near the bakery, I believe. Used to be a good bakery. They don't make 'em like they used to. Is that important? The bakery?
DOCTOR: No, the bakery isn't directly important, Mr. Bartok, but thank you for letting me know. It’s helpful to get the full picture. So, this is for a recreational baseball league, mostly with other older players. And you're getting this physical so you can participate. Have you been doing any training or practicing for the tryouts?
PATIENT: Training? Well… I walk. Every day. To the store and back. Does that count? And I… I swing the bat in the yard sometimes. My grandson has one. It’s a good bat. Heavy. Not like the ones we used. Mostly, I just… try not to pull anything. I’m not a spring chicken anymore, you know? Old bones creak. Is that… a problem? Should I be training more?
DOCTOR: Walking is good, Mr. Bartok, and swinging the bat is a start. It’s smart to be aware of your limits. The “creaky bones” are something we’ll definitely look into today. Before we do a physical exam, let’s talk about your overall health. Have you had any recent illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the last few years?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. My wife… she was in the hospital. A few years back. But me? Not recently. I had the… the flu, maybe. A bad cold, anyway. A couple of winters ago. And my knee… it bothers me sometimes. Old injury. From… work. Construction. A long time ago. Does that count as an illness? It’s always a little sore, especially when it’s cold. I take… something for it. A white pill. I don't remember the name. The doctor gave it to me. Years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a cold a couple of winters ago and some ongoing knee pain from a past construction injury. We’ll definitely take a closer look at the knee today. And you mentioned a white pill for it. Do you know the dosage, or anything else about it?
PATIENT: Dosage? No, Doctor. I just take one. Every day. When it bothers me. It’s small, I think. Round. White. That's about all I know. My ex-wife used to handle the pills. She was very organized. I… I'm not good with those things. She always knew what I needed and when. Now… I just take one when it hurts. It helps a little. Sometimes. Not as much as it used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok, that’s helpful. We can try to figure out what the pill is later, if needed. It's okay if you don't remember everything. Now, besides the knee pain, do you have any other medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart trouble?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? I don't think so. The doctor checked it once. Said it was… okay. Borderline, maybe? I don't remember exactly. Diabetes… no. I like sweets, but I don't have diabetes. Heart trouble… my chest feels a little tight sometimes. When I walk uphill. But that’s just… old age, isn’t it? Everyone gets a little winded. It’s nothing serious, I’m sure. My father… he had a strong heart. Lived to be eighty. A very strong man. Is that important? Family history?
DOCTOR: Family history is important, Mr. Bartok, thank you. So, no known diabetes, and borderline blood pressure. Chest tightness when walking uphill is something we should investigate a bit further, even if it’s just to be cautious. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. I eat everything. My ex-wife always said I had an iron stomach. Sometimes it felt like an iron stomach. No hives, no swelling, no nothing. Maybe… dust? Makes me sneeze sometimes. But everyone sneezes in the dust, don't they? I don't recall any serious allergies. Never been to the hospital for an allergic reaction, that's for sure. Is that… a relief?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know, Mr. Bartok. No known allergies is helpful. Okay, and lastly, are you currently taking any other medications besides the white pill for your knee?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me see… I take a little something for my… water. My water. The doctor said my… kidneys weren't working as good as they used to. So I take a pill for that. A small yellow one. Every morning. And… I think that’s it. Sometimes I take something for… indigestion. But that’s only when I eat something bad. Like spicy food. My ex-wife always said I shouldn't eat spicy food. She was always right, that woman. So, yeah. Yellow pill for the water, white pill for the knee, and sometimes a pink one for… the stomach. Is that too many? Should I be taking so many pills?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a yellow pill for your kidneys, a white pill for your knee, and a pink one as needed for indigestion. It's good that you're keeping track of what you're taking. It's not necessarily too many pills, but we'll review them to make sure they're all appropriate and not interacting with each other. Alright, Mr. Bartok, I think we have a good overview of your medical history now. Let’s move on to a physical exam. I'll need you to change into a gown, and we’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Blood pressure. Heart rate. Yes. A gown. Where is the gown? I’m not very good with… directions. Is it down the hall? My ex-wife always knew where everything was. She had a place for everything. Tell me… will this take long? I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: Yes, the changing room is right through that door. And I’ll be right here. It shouldn't take too long, Mr. Bartok. Just a standard check-up. I'll be in and out, and we’ll see how long the full exam takes. We can certainly pace it to your comfort level. Take your time. I'll be right outside when you're ready.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I hope this doesn’t take too long… My ex-wife… she always made things so easy.
