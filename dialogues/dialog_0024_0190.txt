DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s…difficult to explain, precisely. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet lately. It’s like…losing my balance. It’s been worrying me, to be honest. I don’t…recall anything specific causing it, just…a general feeling of being off-kilter.
DOCTOR: “General feeling of being off-kilter,” you say. Vague symptoms are…unhelpful, Ms. Snerling. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand, Doctor. It is frustratingly vague, isn’t it? Let me think… It’s not a sudden dizziness, exactly. More like… a wobble. Like the floor isn’t quite solid. It happens when I’m walking, sometimes when I’m just standing. It hasn't caused me to fall yet, thankfully. But it’s… disconcerting. I suppose it’s hard to describe without…a better memory of when it started or what brings it on.
DOCTOR: Right. "Wobbliness." And how long has this "wobbliness" been occurring?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question, Doctor. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure. It feels like…several weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month or two? Time seems to…slip away from me sometimes. I wish I could be more precise, but my recollections are…fragmented. It wasn’t a sudden onset, I can tell you that much. It just…gradually became noticeable.
DOCTOR: Fragmented recollections… interesting. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this imbalance?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. I’ve been…more tired than usual, I suppose. But that could just be the work. It’s physically demanding. And… occasionally, a slight…fuzziness in my vision, but nothing consistent. It comes and goes. And… oh, there was a moment, just the other day, when things sounded a little… muffled. But it passed quickly. It’s hard to tell what’s related and what isn’t, you see.
DOCTOR: Muffled sounds and blurry vision… These are…concerning details. Have you experienced any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… Not…severe ones, no. Just a mild throbbing, occasionally, behind my eyes. But honestly, Doctor, working with the drills all day… I often have a dull ache just from the vibrations. So it’s difficult to say if it's anything new or just the usual strain. I wouldn't say it's a constant thing, certainly. More… intermittent. Perhaps once or twice a week? And they’re not debilitating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of neurological issues in your family?
PATIENT: Neurological issues… in my family? That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My parents…passed when I was young, and I didn’t know them well enough to recall any such history. And I was… rather distant from my extended family. I don't…believe so, but I honestly couldn't say with any certainty. I’m afraid my memory is…not the best. I truly don't know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination. Please stand up and follow my finger with your eyes. Do not move your head.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I'll do my best. Just let me know if you need me to slow down. This…following motion can be a little difficult sometimes.
DOCTOR: Your pursuit is…sluggish, Ms. Snerling. And nystagmus is present. Very subtle, but it’s there. Now, close your eyes and extend your arms. I will test your balance.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’ll try to remain still. It…may be difficult, as you can see. I’m doing my best to hold steady. I feel…a little unsteady, even standing still.
DOCTOR: Romberg test is positive. Significant instability. And your gait is noticeably ataxic. Please walk ten steps forward, then turn around.
PATIENT: Ten steps…right. It’s… difficult to keep my balance. Oh! Perhaps…that wasn't as smooth as it could have been. I can feel myself…correcting constantly to stay upright. It’s… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Ataxia is pronounced. Further testing is required. I am ordering an MRI of the brain and a comprehensive blood panel. This will help rule out several possibilities. I suspect we are dealing with something more than just fatigue, Ms. Snerling. I recommend you schedule these tests immediately. And avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An MRI…and a blood panel? Oh dear. Something…serious, you think? What…what could it be, Doctor? And… strenuous activity? That’s…difficult. It’s my job. I understand you’re busy, but could you perhaps… elaborate a little? I… I’m afraid I'm rather easily frightened by medical uncertainties. And… what is “ataxia,” exactly?
DOCTOR: “Ataxia” simply means a lack of coordination, Ms. Snerling. As for what it could be… a multitude of possibilities. A stroke, a tumor… even certain vitamin deficiencies. It is far too early to speculate. The tests will provide clarity. As for your job… that is your concern. I am a physician, not a vocational counselor. I have outlined the necessary precautions. Any further discussion is unproductive. I have other patients waiting. The lab requisition and MRI order will be sent electronically to your insurance. Schedule the MRI promptly. We will discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. Next.
PATIENT: Oh. I…understand. Thank you, Doctor. I will…schedule the tests as soon as possible. Thank you for your time. .
