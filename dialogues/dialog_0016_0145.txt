DOCTOR: Hi Lonell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here… because I need to know if my mother is able to receive care at home. She is getting older, and it is becoming… difficult. I have paperwork, if that is helpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, paperwork is always helpful! Please, have a seat. We can definitely discuss home care options for your mother. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what's making things difficult for her?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Well, she has… trouble with many things now. Walking is very slow, and she often forgets where she is, even in her own home. She needs assistance with… everything, really. Eating, bathing… even remembering to take her medicine. It is becoming too much for me to manage on my own, and I want what is best for her. I worry constantly.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very challenging, and it's good you're thinking proactively about her care. Let me pull up her record here… Ah, yes, I see some notes from her previous visits. Before we go further, just to confirm, are you her son, and are you authorized to discuss her medical information?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am her son, Jean-Paul Bahta. And yes, absolutely. I have the paperwork here confirming my authority to speak about her care. It was prepared by my lawyer, just to be certain everything is correct. I want to make sure we are doing everything properly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for being so prepared. Okay, I see she's been seen here a few times over the last year. It looks like there's a note about increasing forgetfulness and some concerns about falls. Can you tell me a bit more about the falls?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. She has fallen… three times now in the last six months. The first time was minor, just a stumble, really. But the last two… she needed stitches. Thankfully, nothing broken, but it is very frightening for both of us. She gets confused and unsteady when she tries to move around. She insists she is fine, but I worry she will fall again when I am not there. It is… a constant worry.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry – three falls in six months is certainly concerning. And she's insistent she's fine despite this?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. She is… quite stubborn, my mother. She will say she just tripped, or that the rug moved. She does not like to admit she is having trouble. She always has been very independent, and she does not want to lose that. She brushes it off, even when she is clearly shaken. It makes it difficult to get an accurate picture of how much help she truly needs.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. It's common for people to downplay their difficulties, especially when it impacts their independence. Now, besides the falls and forgetfulness, have you noticed any other changes in her behavior or physical abilities?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, there have been other things. She is… less interested in her hobbies. She used to love to garden, but she hasn’t been out there in months. She also… has trouble with her speech sometimes. She forgets words, or repeats herself. And she has been… sleeping much more. It is not a restful sleep, though. She wakes up often, confused and disoriented. It is… upsetting to see her like this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Those are all important things to note. It sounds like we need to rule out several possibilities. Has she had any recent infections, like a urinary tract infection, or any changes in her medications?
PATIENT: That is a very good question, Doctor. She had a small infection… about three months ago. A bladder infection, I believe. She was treated with antibiotics, and it seemed to clear up. As for her medications… she takes a pill for her blood pressure, one for her cholesterol, and another for… arthritis, I think. Her regular doctor changed the dosage of the arthritis medication just last month. He said it would help with the pain, but I do not think it has made much difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Knowing about the recent infection and the medication change is helpful. Let's do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of her current condition. We'll check her vital signs, neurological function, and mobility. Just to clarify, is she currently experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly acceptable, Doctor. I am glad you wish to do a thorough examination. As for pain… she does complain of some discomfort in her joints, particularly her knees and hips. It is not a constant, sharp pain, more of a dull ache, she says. But she does not like to move around much because of it. And sometimes, she seems… agitated, even when she is not in pain. It is difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache in the knees and hips, and periods of agitation. Let's start with her vital signs. Could you help her onto the table, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please forgive me, she is not here with me today. I am describing her condition as best I can. I would be happy to bring her for an examination at a later date, if that is necessary.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jean-Paul. It’s helpful to get a detailed history first. Since she isn’t here, we'll focus on what you can tell me. Let’s start with her gait. You mentioned she's slow and unsteady. Can you describe how she walks?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Well, she shuffles her feet, really. It is… not a smooth walk at all. She takes very small steps, and she leans forward slightly. She needs to hold onto furniture to steady herself, and she is… very slow. It takes her a long time to get across a room. And she seems… afraid to move quickly. It is as if she is worried she will fall. It is… quite concerning to watch.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very descriptive. Shuffling gait, leaning forward, needing support, and fear of moving quickly. And you mentioned periods of agitation. Can you tell me more about those?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… difficult to explain. It is not like anger, exactly. She becomes… confused and restless. She paces around, repeating questions, and she seems… anxious. Sometimes, she does not recognize familiar faces, even me. It is… very upsetting to witness. It usually happens in the evening, and it can last for several hours. It is… as if she is lost in her own mind.
DOCTOR: Okay. That sounds like it could be delirium, or related to cognitive changes. Given her history and your description, I think we need to rule out a few things. Has she had any recent changes in her vision or hearing?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. She has… complained of blurry vision recently, but she dismissed it as just getting older. She also… has trouble hearing sometimes, particularly in noisy environments. She says the television is too loud, but then she complains that she cannot hear me when I speak softly. It is… inconsistent, really. She does not seem to notice it much, but I have definitely noticed a decline.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and fluctuating hearing. Given all of this – the falls, the confusion, the agitation, the changes in gait, vision, and hearing – I'm concerned about potential dementia, but we need to rule out other causes first. I would like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and signs of infection. I also recommend a neurological evaluation and a hearing test. Would you be open to those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Absolutely. Anything that can help determine what is happening to my mother, I am in favor of. Blood tests, neurological evaluation, hearing test… whatever you recommend. I want to be certain we are doing everything possible to provide her with the best care. I am… quite worried, and I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I'm going to write up the orders for the blood tests, a referral to a neurologist, and an audiology appointment. The blood tests can be done here at the clinic. For the neurologist, I’ll give you a list of recommended specialists. And I’ll have the audiology department schedule the hearing test. It may take a few weeks to get all of these appointments scheduled. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: That is… very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. No, I do not think so, at this moment. Just the orders for the tests and the referrals will be sufficient. I will be in touch if any questions arise. And thank you again for taking the time to listen to my concerns. I feel… much better knowing we are taking steps to address this.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Here are the lab orders, the list of neurologists, and the audiology contact information. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. We’ll discuss the results of the tests and the neurologist's recommendations then. I hope everything goes well, Jean-Paul. And remember to take care of yourself as well. It's important to have support when you're caring for someone.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Maskal. I will do that, and I appreciate your kindness. Goodbye.
