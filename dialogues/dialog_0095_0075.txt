DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this daytime sleepiness, really. It's… persistent, even with the machine. I’ve been using it faithfully, you understand, every night. But I still find myself nodding off during the day. It’s not ideal, especially when I’m trying to grade papers!
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Daytime sleepiness despite consistent CPAP use. Let’s get a bit more detail about this. When did you first notice this sleepiness starting, even with the machine?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It’s been… oh, maybe six, seven months now? Right after I started the machine, honestly. I thought it would just go away after a week or two, you know? Get used to it. But it hasn't. It's just… lingering.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started pretty much immediately after beginning CPAP therapy. And you’re using it every night, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, every night. I have the ramp setting on, of course, and I try to keep the mask snug, but not too snug. It's a ResMed AirSense 11, if that matters. My sleep tech, Sarah, she was very good at showing me how to adjust it.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s helpful to know. A ResMed 11. And Sarah sounds thorough. Let's talk about how you're feeling when you're sleepy. Is it just a general tiredness, or do you feel like you might actually fall asleep?
PATIENT: Oh, I definitely feel like I’m going to fall asleep. Not all the time, but… especially in the afternoons. If I’m sitting and reading, or even sometimes just talking to someone, my head starts to nod. It's embarrassing, really. I’ve caught myself a few times, you know? And then I feel more tired trying to fight it. It’s a vicious cycle, almost.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're experiencing definite episodes of near-sleepiness or “sleep attacks” during the day, especially in the afternoons. And it’s interfering with your activities. Do you snore, and if so, has your wife noticed any change in your snoring since starting the machine?
PATIENT: Well, I’m divorced, Doctor. Been divorced for… oh, twenty years now. My ex-wife, bless her heart, she definitely noticed the snoring. That’s why I got the sleep study in the first place! As for changes… well, I don't have anyone to tell me. I assume it's less now, with the machine. It sounds quieter, at least, when I wake up. But I’m just guessing.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Sorry to ask. Let's move on. Are you taking any other medications currently?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure medication, Doctor. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams a day. And a multivitamin, but that's it. Nothing for sleep, nothing for anxiety… just the blood pressure pill. Been on that for years, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and a multivitamin. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I used to get hay fever pretty bad as a kid, but I haven’t had a problem with that in… decades. No reactions to any medicines I’ve ever taken. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you drink alcohol or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No tobacco, never. And I have a glass of wine with dinner… maybe three or four times a week. Just a small glass, though. Nothing excessive. A little Cabernet Sauvignon.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional Cabernet Sauvignon. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your oxygen saturation. Then we can review your sleep study data from the computer here. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your oxygen saturation… 96% on room air, which is good. Now, let me pull up your sleep study data… Okay… AHI was 22 before treatment, which is moderate sleep apnea. With CPAP, it was reduced to… 5.4. Which is good, but still not ideal. Let’s look at your leak rate… Hmm. It’s averaging around 25%… which is a little high.
PATIENT: Twenty-five percent leak? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Sarah didn’t mention anything about a leak rate… Is that… is that why I’m still sleepy, Doctor? The machine isn’t working properly because of the leak?
DOCTOR: It’s certainly a possibility, Mr. Paske. A leak can reduce the effectiveness of the therapy. It means the pressure isn't consistently delivered throughout the night. 25% is higher than we’d like to see. It's not necessarily a catastrophic number, but it can contribute to residual sleepiness. We may need to adjust your mask to improve the seal. It's also possible you've developed a small air leak somewhere in the tubing or the mask itself. Let's try repositioning it first and see if that helps. Do you feel any air escaping around the edges of the mask when you’re sleeping?
PATIENT: I… I don’t know. I haven’t really paid attention. I’m usually just trying to get comfortable and fall asleep. I suppose I could feel a little bit of air sometimes, but I just figured it was normal. It's hard to explain… it's just a little puff of air now and then. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Even a small, intermittent leak can disrupt therapy. Let's try a few things. I'm going to adjust the headgear to see if we can get a tighter, but still comfortable, seal. Tell me if this feels too tight or uncomfortable. We want a good seal without creating pressure sores or making it difficult to breathe. It's a bit of a balancing act.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That feels… snugger, definitely. But not too bad. Not uncomfortable, yet. I can still breathe normally, I think. It feels… more secure, I suppose. Like it’s not going to come off in the middle of the night.
DOCTOR: Good. Let's see if you can feel any air escaping now with those deep breaths. Any air leaking around the nose or mouth?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. It feels much better. Still a little puff of air, maybe, but it’s definitely less. It's hard to tell, honestly, but it feels more sealed.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s try this – I want you to continue using your CPAP machine as you normally would for the next week. And I want you to keep a sleep diary, if you’re willing. Just jot down how many hours you sleep, how you feel when you wake up, and any instances of daytime sleepiness. And please, please note if you notice any significant leaks. If you're still experiencing sleepiness after a week, we can schedule a follow-up to reassess your mask fit, and potentially consider a different mask type. And if you're having trouble remembering to track this, I can have the nurse give you a pre-printed chart. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A sleep diary… I can do that. I used to keep a journal when I was teaching, so I'm used to writing things down. And I'll pay closer attention to the leaks. I promise. A week… and then we see what happens. That’s a good plan. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And one last thing, just to be safe, let's send a referral to a neurologist just to rule out any other potential causes of your daytime sleepiness. It’s unlikely to be anything neurological, but it’s always best to be thorough. I'll have the nurse get that started for you now. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh. Well, I suppose that's a good idea, just to be sure. I don’t have any immediate questions, no. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And thank you for the referral. I feel… better, just knowing we're trying everything we can.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get those referrals sent over and the nurse will go over everything with you before you leave. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Have a good day, and let’s hope you get a better night’s sleep soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate your help. Goodbye.
