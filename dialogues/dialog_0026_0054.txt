DOCTOR: Good morning, Rayshon. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… cough. I got… lots of cough. And tired. Very tired. Feels like… long time now. And my nose… always block, then runny. Like… sinus, I think? My wife say I need see doctor. I… don't remember much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, fatigue, and a stuffy, runny nose. I understand. You said it’s been going on for a “long time now” – could you try to give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough…? Hmm… maybe… six months? Or more? I work a lot. Tire shop. Dusty. Maybe start then? I not so sure. I remember feeling sick around… rainy season, maybe? Everything… a bit blurry. Sorry. I not good with dates.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, don’t apologize at all. Six months or more… okay. And you said it started around the rainy season. Let’s talk about the cough itself. Is it a dry cough, or do you bring anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes wet. Sometimes dry. Mostly… phlegm. White, usually. Sometimes… yellow. When I really sick. I need to… spit it out a lot. Sorry. And it worse… morning. And when I bend down. Like… when I change tire. Makes it really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, white and sometimes yellow phlegm, worse in the mornings and when you bend over. Thank you for telling me that. Have you had any fever or chills with this cough?
PATIENT: Fever…? I think so. Maybe. A little hot sometimes. Not very high, I think. My wife… she check with thermometer. She say I have little fever. But not all the time. Mostly… feel warm. And little headache sometimes. But not always. I don't like fever. Makes me very weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, some intermittent fever and occasional headaches. Have you noticed any body aches or muscle pain along with the cough and fatigue?
PATIENT: Body aches…? Hmm… sometimes. My back hurts a lot. But I think that's from lifting tire all day. Very heavy tire. And… my legs, sometimes. Feel like… sore. But I don’t know if it from cough, or from work. Hard to tell. I not young anymore, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s fair. It’s hard to separate work-related aches from illness. Do you ever wake up at night feeling very sweaty, even if the room is cool?
PATIENT: Sweaty…? Not really. Sometimes… a little warm. But not like… soaking wet. My wife… she always hot. She use fan all night. But I okay. Maybe… little sweaty sometimes. But not big deal. I think. I not sure. I sleep very deep. Don't wake up much.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant night sweats. Have you noticed any difficulty breathing or shortness of breath at all with this cough?
PATIENT: Short of breath…? Not really. Maybe… little bit. When I run. But I don’t run much. And when I… really bend down, lifting heavy tire. Feel tight in my chest. But… only for a moment. Then okay. I think it just… hard work. I not run marathon, Doctor. Just change tire.
DOCTOR: I understand. Just changing tires is quite different from running a marathon. Okay, Rayshon. I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That's fine. Go ahead. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Rayshon. I listened to your lungs, and I heard a little bit of wheezing, mostly in the lower parts of your lungs. Your throat looks a little red, and your ears look fine. I also felt some tenderness when I pressed on your sinuses. Now, I’m going to check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay… wheezing? Sinus…? What is that mean, Doctor? Is bad? My wife say I need… antibiotics?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take things one step at a time. Wheezing just means there's a bit of narrowing in your airways, which can happen with a cough and inflammation. Sinus tenderness means your sinuses are a little bit inflamed, which often happens with a stuffy nose. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s good to know. Your temperature is slightly elevated at 100.4°F. Your pulse is 88 and blood pressure is 130/80. It could be something that antibiotics would help with, but we don’t want to use them unless we need to. I want to explore a few other possibilities first. Do you have any allergies, Rayshon?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm… I don't think so. Maybe… dust? From the tire shop. Makes me… sneeze sometimes. But not very bad. My wife… she allergic to cat. She very sensitive. But I okay with cat. I think. I not remember any… serious allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible dust allergy. Are you currently taking any medications at all, Rayshon?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't like… pills. My wife… she take a lot. For her blood pressure. But I… strong man. I okay. I just need… rest, maybe? But my back… very sore.
DOCTOR: Alright, you prefer to avoid medication if possible. I understand. Just out of curiosity, what do you do for work besides changing tires?
PATIENT: Just… tire shop. All day. Every day. Long hours. Sometimes… overtime. No other work. My wife… she work at market. Selling vegetables. We… busy people. No time for… hobbies. Maybe watch TV sometimes. Not much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so long hours at the tire shop. It sounds like a physically demanding job. And finally, have you ever smoked or used tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My wife… she not like smoke. She say bad for health. I agree. I need strong lungs. For… changing tire! Never touched cigarette. Not even tried.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. So, let me summarize what we've discussed. You've had a cough with white and sometimes yellow phlegm for at least six months, accompanied by fatigue, a stuffy and runny nose, intermittent fever, and some body aches. You work long hours at a tire shop, which is physically demanding, and you don’t smoke. Based on what you've told me and my examination, it sounds like you likely have bronchitis, possibly with a secondary sinus infection. Bronchitis is an inflammation of the airways, which can cause a cough, wheezing, and fatigue. The sinus tenderness suggests that you may also have an infection in your sinuses. I’d like to start with a chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis and rule out anything more serious. I’ll also prescribe a saline nasal spray to help relieve your stuffy nose, and a cough suppressant to help you sleep at night. We can also try an over-the-counter pain reliever for your headache and body aches. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Is… safe? I… not so sure about radiation. And… suppressant? Will make me… sleepy? I need work, Doctor. Cannot sleep all day. And… okay, saline spray. I try that. But… no strong pills, okay? My wife… she always worry about pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your worries, Rayshon. That’s very reasonable. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very low, similar to what you receive from a few days of natural background radiation. It’s a very safe and helpful test to make sure we get the right diagnosis. The cough suppressant is a mild one, and it shouldn’t make you excessively sleepy. It's just to help you rest at night, so you can recover. We can start with a low dose and see how you feel. And I completely understand your concerns about medication. We can absolutely avoid strong pills if possible. Let’s get the chest X-ray scheduled, and then we can discuss the results and decide on the best course of action. I'll also give you a written prescription for the saline spray, and some information about managing your symptoms at home. Would you like me to help you schedule the X-ray now?
PATIENT: Okay… X-ray… if you say it safe. I trust you, Doctor. Yes… please schedule. And… thank you. You… very kind. And… can you write down everything? For my wife? She… always need to know everything. She worry a lot.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m happy to. I’ll schedule you for a chest X-ray at the clinic tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. I’ll also print out a summary of our conversation, including the potential diagnosis of bronchitis, the plan for the saline spray and cough suppressant, and instructions on managing your symptoms at home. I’ll also include information about when to seek further medical attention. Here's the appointment slip and the summary. Please bring it with you tomorrow. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Rayshon?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's… everything. Thank you… very much. You… good doctor. Now… I go home, rest. And try… not cough too much. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshon. Get some rest, and try to take it easy. And remember, if things get worse or you’re not feeling better in a few days, please don’t hesitate to call. Goodbye, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. .
