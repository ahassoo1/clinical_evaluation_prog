DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Theriot. Look, it’s probably nothing, but my mother… she had a lot of health problems. Heart stuff, mostly. And her sister, too. It’s just… I’d like to know I’m not heading down the same path, if you understand. I'm a teacher, and I need to be… reliable. You know? Not dropping dead in front of a classroom.
DOCTOR: I certainly understand. It’s very sensible to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history like that. And being reliable for your students is important. So, let's talk a bit more about this. When you say “heart stuff,” do you remember what specifically your mother and aunt were diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. It was always just… “her heart.” Lots of visits, medication, then… well, you know. My dad handled most of the details. I was… busy with school. I just remember it being stressful for everyone, and a lot of worrying. I didn’t really ask a lot of questions, I guess. It wasn't something I focused on at the time. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not bad at all, Blain. It’s completely understandable to cope by focusing on other things when someone you love is unwell. It's very common. Okay, so we'll focus on you now. Are you experiencing any symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get tired, but teaching is exhausting, right? All those papers to grade… And sometimes my chest feels a little… tight, but I think it’s just stress. I'm pretty active, though. I try to go for a run a couple of times a week. I eat okay, mostly. I wouldn’t say I’m a health nut, but I don’t live on junk food. I just… want to be sure. It's better to be safe than sorry, I think.
DOCTOR: You’re right to think that way. It is always better to be safe. That sounds like a good level of activity and a reasonably healthy diet. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe that chest tightness a little more?
PATIENT: It's not like… a crushing pain, or anything. It's just… a bit uncomfortable. Like someone's sitting on my chest. It usually happens when I'm stressed, or after I've been running. It doesn’t last long, maybe five or ten minutes, then it goes away. It's probably just… anxiety, right? I get anxious about a lot of things. Grading, lesson plans, parents… the usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And it sounds like it’s related to your activity and stress levels, which is good to know. Still, we should rule out anything more serious, just to be certain. Would you mind if I do a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, go ahead. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this sorted, one way or another. I have a lot on my plate, and worrying about my heart isn't helping. Do you need me to… change into one of those gowns?
DOCTOR: No gown necessary for this part, Blain. Just your regular clothes are fine. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. I’ll also take a quick look at your neck. It shouldn’t take long. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is perfectly normal. Your pulse is 68 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or extra sounds detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No swelling in your neck or enlarged lymph nodes. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. I haven't really taken much medication in my life. Maybe some ibuprofen for headaches now and then, but that's about it. My dad always said I had a strong constitution. He was a pharmacist, so he was always checking up on everyone's health. It’s ironic, isn't it? Him being a pharmacist and all, and then… well, never mind. It’s not important.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you don’t have any known allergies. And don't worry about sharing, Blain. It sounds like you've had some difficult experiences. Just one more question before we discuss next steps. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Like I said, I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. I've always preferred to just… tough it out. My dad used to say I was stubborn. He wasn’t wrong. I don’t even take vitamins, really. I should probably be more responsible, but… I just haven’t gotten around to it. It’s on my list. Everything is always on my list.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, no supplements. That simplifies things. Given your family history and the chest tightness you've been experiencing, even though it seems related to stress and activity, I think it would be prudent to order a few tests. Specifically, I'd like to do an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, and a basic blood panel to look at your cholesterol and other indicators of heart health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. Better to know, I guess. An EKG and bloodwork… is that going to be expensive? My Medicare… it doesn't always cover everything. And I just got divorced, so… money's a little tight right now. I don’t want to get a huge bill.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Blain. Let me check the coverage with your Medicare plan for those tests. Okay, good news. Both the EKG and the basic blood panel are fully covered under your plan with your current deductible met. There shouldn't be any out-of-pocket costs for you. We can do the EKG right here in the office. For the bloodwork, you'll need to go to the lab across the hall. They're very familiar with Medicare and can bill directly. They'll take your insurance card, and you shouldn't have to pay anything upfront. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: That's… a relief. Actually, that's really good to hear. Covered by Medicare, no upfront costs… that’s one less thing to worry about. Okay, yeah, that’s manageable. Let’s do it. EKG here, bloodwork across the hall… tell me what I need to do. Do I need to fast for the bloodwork? And… will it take long? I have a lesson plan I need to finish by tomorrow. I'm already behind.
DOCTOR: Yes, you do need to fast for 8 hours before the bloodwork. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We'll do the EKG right away, it will only take about 5-10 minutes. As for the bloodwork, it shouldn’t take long – about 30 minutes at the lab. I'll send the order over to them now. They’ll call you when they’re ready for you. I'll have my assistant, Sarah, give you a written summary of the tests and instructions before you leave. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Fast for 8 hours, EKG now, bloodwork across the hall… I can manage that. And Sarah will give me the instructions… perfect. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It's… reassuring to know I’m not just being dismissed. A lot of doctors don’t take the time to listen. I guess… let's get the EKG done then. Where do I lie down? And… will it hurt? I’m not good with needles, if that matters. Not that I’m expecting a needle for the EKG, but… you never know.
DOCTOR: Of course. No needles for the EKG, thankfully! It's completely painless. We'll just attach some small, sticky patches called electrodes to your chest, arms, and legs. These patches read your heart's electrical activity and transmit the information to the machine. It doesn't involve any injections or discomfort at all. Just lie back on the table, and I’ll place these in a few key locations. It's a quick and simple procedure. We'll get a good baseline reading of your heart function and go from there. And you’re very welcome, Blain. It’s my job to listen, and I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Don't hesitate to let me know if you feel any discomfort during the procedure.
