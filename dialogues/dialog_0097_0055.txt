DOCTOR: Hi Ellan, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s about… this marijuana. Medical marijuana, that is. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s been reading about it. Says it might help with… things. I'm here to see if I can get one of those certificates, you know, to make it legal. Though frankly, I still think it’s a bit… much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's becoming more common for patients to explore medical marijuana as an option, and it's good you're approaching it thoughtfully. Just to be clear, you're interested in a certification to legally obtain medical marijuana, and you’d like to discuss if it might be appropriate for you. Is that right?
PATIENT: Appropriate? Well, that's what you're here for, aren’t you? To tell me if it's appropriate. My daughter keeps going on about aches and pains, but I’ve always just… dealt with them. Still, she’s insistent. And frankly, it's a nuisance having to worry about the law. So yes, I suppose I want to know if you think I should be bothering with it.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask me that, Ellan. My role is to help you decide if it’s a suitable option for you, based on your specific health situation. It’s wonderful that your daughter is looking out for you, and it's perfectly reasonable to want to explore all avenues for relief. To do that, I need to get a better understanding of what's been going on. Could you tell me a little bit more about these aches and pains?
PATIENT: Oh, where to begin? It's not one particular thing, you see. It’s… just old age, I suppose. My knees ache, particularly when the weather changes. And my back… well, my back has been troublesome for years. I used to be very active, you know. Dancing, gardening… but it all gets harder as you get older. I’ve just always… pushed through it. I don’t like to complain, Doctor. It’s not in my nature. But my daughter, she thinks this… marijuana, will make things easier.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been managing chronic pain for quite some time and have a strong history of resilience. It's admirable that you’ve pushed through it for so long. And it's common for aches and pains to worsen with weather changes. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about where exactly your knee pain is located?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… everywhere, really. The whole joint, you know? Inside, outside… sometimes it feels like it’s going to lock up completely. And it’s worse in the mornings, naturally. And after I’ve been sitting for too long. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. A constant reminder, if you will. Honestly, I don’t know why I’m bothering you with all this. It’s just… old age, Doctor. Like I said. You can’t fix old age.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, Ellan. It’s important for me to understand the specifics of your pain so we can determine the best course of action, even if it's simply managing symptoms. And you're right, we can't fix old age, but we can certainly improve your quality of life. You mentioned it's a dull ache, and it’s worse in the mornings and after sitting. Does anything relieve it?
PATIENT: Relieve it? Hmm… well, moving around a bit helps, I suppose. A short walk, if the weather permits. And I take a hot bath sometimes. But it doesn’t last long, the relief. And frankly, Doctor, I’m not one for taking pills. I’ve always been… cautious about medications. Too many side effects, you know? My sister, God rest her soul, she was always getting sick from everything the doctor prescribed. So I try to avoid them if at all possible. That’s why my daughter suggested this… marijuana. She says it’s natural. Though I still have my doubts.
DOCTOR: That’s very reasonable, Ellan. It's wise to be cautious about medications, and it’s good you’re aware of potential side effects. Your sister’s experience is certainly something to consider. So, you find some relief with walking and hot baths, but it's temporary. Now, let’s talk about your back pain. Where specifically is the pain located in your back?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, it's… lower back, mostly. Right across the small of my back. It's not constant, you see. It comes and goes. Sometimes it's just a stiffness, other times it’s a sharp pain if I bend over too quickly. And sometimes… sometimes it radiates down my leg. Not all the way, thankfully. Just a little ache in my hip. It's been like that for years, ever since I lifted that heavy box of Christmas decorations. Foolish, really. I shouldn't have been lifting heavy things at my age. But I always like to be prepared. And now… well, now my back reminds me of it.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite uncomfortable, Ellan. Radiating pain down your leg is something we'll want to keep track of. It's good you remember what triggered it – lifting that box of decorations. It sounds like it might be related to a pinched nerve or muscle strain. Now, aside from the aches and pains, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? I get tired easily, of course. But who doesn't at my age? And my hands are a bit stiff in the mornings, but I put that down to arthritis. My mother had it, you see. Terrible pain she was in. No, I can’t say I’ve noticed anything else… except maybe a bit of trouble sleeping sometimes. But that’s just… worrying, I suppose. I worry about everything these days. The world is such a mess, you know?
DOCTOR: It's very common to experience fatigue, joint stiffness, and sleep disturbances, especially as we get older and with worry. It’s good you are self-aware. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, thankfully, no. I've always been very careful about my health, you see. Lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. And I used to walk every day, before my knees started acting up. The doctor always told me I had a strong heart. Blood pressure was always a little high, perhaps, but nothing that couldn’t be managed with a little less salt. No, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything serious. I pride myself on that, Doctor. I’ve always taken good care of myself. That’s why I’m hesitant about all this… marijuana. It seems… unhealthy.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ellan. It’s clear you’ve prioritized your health, and that’s admirable. And your caution is perfectly reasonable. It's good you are thoughtful about this. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I suppose. But that was ages ago. And I spent a night in the hospital once when I broke my wrist falling off my bicycle. But that was a long time ago, too. Nothing serious. No major surgeries, no lengthy hospital stays. I’ve always been… lucky, I suppose. Relatively healthy, all things considered. That’s why I’m so skeptical about needing something like this… marijuana. It just doesn’t seem… necessary. But my daughter… she's very persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or significant hospitalizations. That's helpful to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family… yes, well, my mother had arthritis, as I mentioned earlier. Terrible pain, she was in. And my father… he had heart problems. He passed away when he was quite young, actually. Heart attack, they said. And my sister, God rest her soul, she had cancer. Lung cancer. She smoked, you see. Terrible habit. So, yes, there’s a bit of… everything, really, running in the family. That’s probably why I worry so much. It’s all very… unsettling. So, you see, Doctor, I'm not sure this… marijuana, is the answer. It just seems… risky, with my family history.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a family history of some serious conditions, and it’s perfectly understandable that you're concerned about that. Knowing your family history helps me understand your overall health risk. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little itchy sometimes when I eat shellfish, but it's not a serious allergy. Just a little irritation. And I can’t take penicillin, I think. I had a bad reaction to it when I was a child. But that was ages ago. Other than that, no, I don’t have any allergies. I’m quite lucky, really. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat and what I put in my body. That’s probably why I’m so skeptical about this… marijuana. It just seems… unnatural. And with my family history and my general good health, I’m not sure it’s the right choice for me. But my daughter… she’s very persuasive.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild reaction to shellfish and penicillin allergy – good to know. It sounds like you've had a relatively healthy life, and you're being very thoughtful about this. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I told you, Doctor, I don’t like taking pills. I take a little Vitamin D in the winter, perhaps, but that’s it. Just to keep my bones strong. Other than that, no, I’m not taking any medications. I prefer to rely on a healthy diet and a little bit of exercise. Well, I used to exercise, before my knees started acting up. But no, I’m not taking anything. I’m a very simple woman, Doctor. I don’t need a lot of fancy medications. I’m just trying to find a way to manage these aches and pains, and my daughter keeps telling me this… marijuana, might be the answer. But I’m still very skeptical.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan, thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you’re generally very healthy and have been careful about your well-being. Given your medical history, family history, and the fact that you don’t take any medications, I can understand your skepticism about medical marijuana. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your current symptoms. You mentioned aches and pains in your knees and back, difficulty sleeping, and fatigue. Are these symptoms interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Well, yes, they are, actually. It’s not that I can’t do anything, you understand. But it’s… harder. Gardening, for example. I used to love gardening. But now, bending over is a real struggle. And walking… I can’t walk as far as I used to. And the pain keeps me up at night sometimes. It’s not every night, but enough to make me feel tired during the day. And I used to be very active, you see. I like to go to church, and volunteer at the library, but sometimes I just don’t have the energy. It’s… frustrating, Doctor. I want to be able to do the things I enjoy, but these aches and pains keep getting in the way. And my daughter… she keeps saying this… marijuana, might help. But I’m still not convinced. I just don’t want to rely on something… unnatural.
DOCTOR: It sounds like these symptoms are significantly impacting your quality of life, and it’s completely understandable that you're frustrated. It’s good you are being honest about how these aches and pains are affecting you. Before we discuss medical marijuana further, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your knees and back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well… I suppose so. I haven't had one in years, truthfully. I always thought I was perfectly healthy. But if you think it's necessary… alright. But please be gentle, Doctor. My knees are very sensitive, and my back… well, it's not what it used to be. I just don’t want to make things worse. And I still don’t want to end up relying on something like… marijuana. But my daughter… she's very insistent. So I suppose I should at least try to explore all my options. But please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. I will be very gentle. We’ll take it slow and only do what you’re comfortable with. I'll start with your knees. Could you please lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This isn't going to be easy, is it? Alright, Doctor. But please, do be careful. And if it hurts, I'll let you know. I haven't been on one of these tables since… well, a very long time ago. My daughter keeps saying I need to be more proactive about my health, but honestly, I'm not very good at this sort of thing. Alright, here goes…
DOCTOR: That's right, Ellan, just relax. We’ll take it one step at a time. Now, I’m just going to gently feel around your knees to check for any swelling, tenderness, or range of motion limitations. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright. But please be careful. And don't pull anything. My knees are very… sensitive, you see. And I don’t like being poked and prodded. It reminds me of the dentist.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan, I’m just gently feeling around the front of your knee now. I’m not finding any significant swelling at this point. Just checking for tenderness… any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! A little bit there, on the side. Not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. Like a throbbing. Is that normal, Doctor? It's been like that for weeks, you see. Especially when the weather changes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. A little tenderness on the side of your right knee, with a dull ache. Now, let’s check your left knee. Just gently feeling around… any pain here, on the front of your knee?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit there too, actually. Not as bad as my right knee, but… still uncomfortable. It's a nagging ache, you see. Like a constant reminder. And it's worse in the mornings, especially when I try to get out of bed. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know what’s going on. My knees used to be so strong. I used to dance for hours, you see. But now… now they just ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan, I’m just going to gently bend and straighten your knees now, just to see how they move. This will help me understand if there’s any stiffness or limitations. Let me know if you feel any pain. Slowly bending now… how does that feel?
PATIENT: Ooh! Careful, Doctor, careful! That hurts! Not a terrible pain, but… uncomfortable. It feels… stiff, you see. Like they’re not moving properly. And it clicks a little bit, which is… worrying. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t like this at all. My knees are not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan, I stopped. I’m sorry, that shouldn't be causing that much discomfort. You're right, that's not good. And the clicking is something we'll want to investigate further. Let's not bend that one anymore for now. Now, let’s move to your back. Could you gently turn onto your side for me, with your knees bent?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is not easy, is it? Alright, Doctor. But please be gentle. My back is very sensitive, you see. And I don’t want to make things worse. Honestly, I’m not very good at this sort of thing. My daughter keeps saying I need to be more proactive about my health, but…
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan, I’m just gently feeling along your lower back now, checking for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Just relaxing… any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, right there! A little bit tender. Not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. Like a throbbing. It's been like that for weeks, you see. Especially when I bend over. And sometimes it radiates down my leg, just a little bit. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know what’s going on. My back used to be so strong. I used to garden for hours, you see. But now… now it just aches.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Tenderness in your lower back, and some radiating pain down your leg. Now, I’m just going to ask you to gently lift each leg, just to see how that feels. And then I’ll ask you to gently rotate your torso, just to see if that causes any pain. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Just gently lift your right leg now… how does that feel?
PATIENT: Ooh! Careful, Doctor, careful! That hurts a little bit! Not a terrible pain, but… uncomfortable. It feels… stiff, you see. Like they’re not moving properly. And it’s difficult to lift it very high. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know what’s going on. My legs used to be so strong. I used to dance for hours, you see. But now… now it just aches.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ellan, I stopped. It's alright. We won't push it if it's causing pain. It sounds like you have some limited range of motion and some discomfort in both your knees and your back. Now, let's stop the physical exam for now. Just lie comfortably on your side. I’ve noted all your findings. To summarize, you're experiencing aches and pains in both knees and your lower back. The pain is worse with activity, especially bending, and you’ve noticed limited range of motion. You also reported clicking in your knees and radiating pain down your leg. Based on your history and the physical exam, I think it's important to get some imaging done to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I recommend an X-ray of both knees and your lower back. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Imaging, you say? X-rays? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good with all this medical stuff. It sounds… complicated. And I don’t like being exposed to radiation. But… if it’s important, I suppose I have no choice. My daughter keeps saying I need to be more proactive about my health, and… well, I don’t want to ignore things. But I still don’t think it’s anything serious. It’s just old age, you see. But… what about this… marijuana? Could that at least help with the pain while I’m waiting for the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about the imaging, Ellan, and I assure you we'll take all necessary precautions to minimize your radiation exposure. It's the best way to get a clear picture of what's going on, so we can determine the most appropriate treatment plan. Now, regarding the medical marijuana, it's a valid question. It can help manage chronic pain for some people, but it's not a guaranteed solution and it's not without potential side effects. Given your age and overall health, it's important to approach it with caution. I'm not opposed to exploring it, but I want to make sure we have a full understanding of what’s going on first with the imaging. Once we have the results, we can discuss the potential benefits and risks of medical marijuana in more detail, and determine if it’s the right choice for you. In the meantime, while we're waiting for the results, I can recommend some conservative measures to manage your pain, such as over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, gentle exercise, and physical therapy. Would you be interested in learning more about those options?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen and ibuprofen? Oh dear. I told you, Doctor, I don’t like taking pills. But… gentle exercise, perhaps. I used to walk every day, before my knees started acting up. And physical therapy… well, I suppose I could try it. If it helps with the pain. But honestly, I’m still skeptical. It’s just old age, you see. And I don’t want to rely on anything that could have side effects. But… if you think it’s worth trying, I suppose I could. But I still want to explore this… marijuana. Is it legal, at least? And what would I even do with it? I’ve never… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ellan. And it's perfectly valid to be hesitant. We can definitely explore conservative measures first, such as gentle exercise and physical therapy. And if those aren't enough, we can discuss medical marijuana further once we have the imaging results. Regarding the legality, medical marijuana is legal in this state with a physician’s certification. The process involves getting a recommendation from a qualified doctor, registering with the state, and then obtaining your medical marijuana from a licensed dispensary. As for what you’d do with it, there are various ways to consume it, such as smoking, vaping, or edibles. However, I would strongly advise against smoking due to potential respiratory issues. Edibles or vaping might be safer options, but it’s important to start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed. I can provide you with a list of licensed dispensaries in the area and some resources on responsible medical marijuana use. But let's focus on the next steps for now. I'll write you a referral for X-rays of both knees and your lower back. And I’ll also give you some information on gentle exercises you can try at home. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and explore other options?
PATIENT: Alright. A referral for X-rays, you say? And some information on gentle exercises. Yes, that sounds… sensible. And a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Yes, that would be good. I suppose I have no choice, really. My daughter keeps saying I need to be more proactive about my health, and… well, I don’t want to disappoint her. But I still want to explore this… marijuana. Is it expensive, at least? And what if it doesn’t work? I don’t want to waste my money. And honestly, Doctor, I’m still skeptical. It’s just old age, you see. But… alright. Let’s see what the X-rays show. And then we can talk about… options.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Ellan, and your concerns about the cost and effectiveness of medical marijuana. It’s good to be cautious and ask questions. Regarding the cost, it can vary depending on the product and the dispensary. But generally, it's comparable to other medications. And as for its effectiveness, it's not guaranteed to work for everyone. But it’s worth exploring if other options haven't provided relief. I’m writing you a referral for the X-rays now, and I'll also provide you with some resources on gentle exercises and medical marijuana. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the results and explore all your options. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I'm here to help you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ellan?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. But thank you for your time. And thank you for… explaining everything. It’s still a bit overwhelming, to be honest. But I suppose I’ll see what the X-rays show. And then we’ll talk about… options. But if it’s alright, Doctor, could you just tell me one thing? What is this marijuana, exactly? I’ve never… well, you understand. I’ve always been a very proper woman.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. That's a perfectly valid question. Marijuana, also known as cannabis, is a plant that contains compounds called cannabinoids, which have various effects on the body. The two main cannabinoids are THC and CBD. THC is the psychoactive compound that produces the “high” associated with marijuana, while CBD does not have psychoactive effects and has been shown to have various therapeutic benefits, such as reducing pain and inflammation. Medical marijuana uses specific strains and formulations of cannabis to treat various medical conditions, such as chronic pain, nausea, and anxiety. It's important to note that it's not a “cure-all” and it's not without potential side effects. But it can be a helpful option for some people, especially those who haven't found relief from other treatments. Think of it like any other medication, Ellan. It has potential benefits and risks, and it's important to use it responsibly and under the guidance of a qualified doctor. Do you have any other questions, or would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: I see. THC and CBD. And potential benefits and risks. It sounds… complicated. But thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I still have my doubts, but… I suppose I’ll see what the X-rays show. And then we’ll talk about… options. Well, thank you for your time, Doctor Georgiou. I appreciate your patience. I suppose I’ll see you in two weeks. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ellan. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before our follow-up appointment. .
