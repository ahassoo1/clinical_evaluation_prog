DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning. Yes. My husband, he… said I should come. Something about… learning things? I don't really remember. He worries too much, you know. He says I don't take care of myself. It’s just… a check-up, I think? Not feeling sick, exactly. Just… here. Because he said so.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s good of you to come in, even if it’s primarily at your husband’s suggestion. We can certainly do a general check-up. To get a better understanding of your overall health, perhaps we could start by discussing any changes you have noticed recently, even if they seem small?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Well, my hands… they sometimes hurt. When I’m working, of course. Sheet metal, it’s hard work. But… they always hurt, a little. It's normal. I think. And… I get tired easier now, maybe? But everyone gets tired, right? I don't know. It's hard to say what’s “new.”
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right, everyone gets tired. And hand pain with sheet metal work is certainly not uncommon. However, it’s good that we’re discussing it. Could you tell me more about the hand pain?
PATIENT: More…? It’s just… aches. Like when you've been holding something heavy all day. And sometimes… a little numbness. Not all the time. Mostly in my fingers. The little ones. And it feels worse when it's cold. The shop… it’s not always warm enough, you know? My husband says I should wear gloves. He always says something.
DOCTOR: I see. So, aching and some numbness in your fingers, particularly the smaller ones, and it’s aggravated by cold temperatures. That’s helpful information. Does this pain affect your ability to do your work?
PATIENT: Well… yes. Sometimes. It’s harder to bend the metal, to hold things tight. I have to… stop and shake my hands sometimes. But I do my work. I’m a good worker! I just… work through it. A little pain doesn’t stop me. I have bills to pay, you know. It's not like I can just… not work. My husband worries too much about everything. He thinks I should slow down. But… what else am I going to do?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Fontanazza. You're very dedicated, and I commend you for that. It's good to be resilient, but it's also important to address these issues before they potentially worsen. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, would you mind if I performed a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Examination? What kind of examination? I don’t like being poked and prodded. Is this… necessary? I just came to… learn things. Not to be… inspected. My husband didn’t say anything about an examination. He just said I need to be… informed. Is there a charge for this?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Fontanazza. I apologize if I wasn’t clear. A physical examination would be a simple assessment – checking your reflexes, range of motion, and feeling for any tenderness – to help me understand the cause of the pain and fatigue you're experiencing. It will help me to "learn things" about your health and give you the best possible information. It's a standard part of a medical consultation, and we can certainly proceed at your pace. As for charges, since you are uninsured, we will discuss options to help keep costs affordable. Would you be willing to allow me to do a quick look at your hands and arms, then perhaps listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Fine. But quick is the key word. I have things to do. And don't poke too hard! I bruise easily, you know. And… what will you do with the information, anyway? My husband always tells me doctors just want to give you expensive medicines. Is that true? I don't trust doctors very much. They never explain anything properly. Just tell me what’s wrong, and how long I’ll have to be off work. That’s all I care about.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Fontanazza, and I assure you my goal is to provide clear information and work with you to determine the best course of action. We'll certainly discuss all options thoroughly, and I’ll explain everything in a way you understand. No unnecessary medications will be prescribed without a clear explanation of why they are needed. Now, if you'll please extend your arms, palms up. I’ll start by gently palpating your wrists and hands to check for any tenderness or swelling. I am just feeling for any areas of discomfort. Please let me know immediately if anything feels particularly painful.
PATIENT: Ow! Be careful! Yes, right there… that’s a little tender. And… here, on the side. It’s always been a little sore, but… it’s worse when it's cold. See? This is what I mean. You're poking it! You're making it hurt more! My husband says I have arthritis. Is that what this is? Arthritis? He Googled it, you know. He always Googles everything. Is Google right this time?
DOCTOR: I apologize for causing you discomfort, Ms. Fontanazza. I am being as gentle as possible, but I understand it can be sensitive. It's good that your husband has been doing some research, but Google isn’t always accurate. While arthritis could be a possibility, it’s too early to say definitively. There are several conditions that can cause pain in the wrists and hands, including tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and even nerve compression. To get a better understanding, I’d like to check your grip strength and range of motion. Could you please make a tight fist for me, as strong as you can?
PATIENT: Ow! Not so tight! It hurts! This is ridiculous. I work with metal all day! Of course it's going to hurt! You don't need to test my grip strength, I know it's strong enough! It has to be! I’d rather just… get a cream or something. Something to rub on it. My neighbor uses a cream for her arthritis. It smells like onions, but she says it works. Can I get a cream like that? This is a waste of my time. And you keep poking me! I told you, be careful!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Fontanazza. I apologize again for causing you discomfort. It seems you’re understandably sensitive, and pushing further with the examination at this moment wouldn’t be helpful. Based on what you’ve told me – the pain in your wrists and fingers, the numbness, the aggravation with cold temperatures, and your occupation – it's likely your symptoms are related to overuse and repetitive strain. While a cream might provide some temporary relief, it's unlikely to address the underlying cause. To determine the best course of action and rule out other possibilities, I would recommend an X-ray of your wrists and hands. This will help us assess for any underlying joint damage or other structural issues. Additionally, a nerve conduction study could be helpful to evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome. Would you be open to considering these tests?
PATIENT: X-rays? Tests? Absolutely not! That sounds expensive! And… scary! I don't want to be poked and prodded and… radiated! My husband will want me to get all sorts of things done, I just know it. He always wants the most expensive option. No! Just… tell me what I can do. A cream, maybe? Or… a wrap? Something simple. I don’t have time for tests and X-rays. I have work to do! And… I don't have insurance! This is a nightmare! I should have just stayed home. This is a complete waste of time. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Fontanazza. It's perfectly alright to be hesitant, and you are absolutely right to prioritize your time and finances. Given your reluctance to pursue further testing at this time, and acknowledging that you do not have insurance, we can certainly focus on more conservative management options. To start, I recommend regular application of a topical anti-inflammatory cream, such as ibuprofen gel, to your wrists and hands, particularly after work. You can purchase this over-the-counter at most pharmacies. Wearing wrist supports during activities that aggravate your symptoms can also provide additional support and reduce strain. Additionally, trying to keep your hands warm, particularly in the shop, can help to minimize discomfort. However, if your symptoms worsen or do not improve within a few weeks, I strongly recommend reconsidering the X-ray to rule out any underlying issues. I will provide you with a written summary of these recommendations, and a list of over-the-counter products that may be helpful. And finally, a note about the importance of good hand hygiene to prevent infection. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
