DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I am Dr. Yackey. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. It’s… my ear. Feels blocked, you know? Full. Been like that for… well, I don’t rightly know how long, to be honest. A while, I think. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: A blocked ear… yes. And this has been ongoing for “a while,” you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, a while. Not… sudden. Not like a sharp pain or anything. Just… gradually got worse, I suppose. It’s hard to say exactly when it started. Things aren’t as clear as they used to be, you understand? I just noticed it getting more bothersome. Do you… need a specific date? Because I really couldn’t tell you.
DOCTOR: Dates aren’t essential, Mr. Guerrerolopez, but a rough estimate helps. Is it affecting your hearing at all?
PATIENT: Hearing… hmm. Maybe a little? Sounds are… muffled, I guess. Not completely gone, no. I can still hear people talking, but it’s like… talking through cotton wool, you know? Especially when it’s quiet. It’s not… crippling, if that makes sense. Just… present. It’s mostly just bothersome.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing… Alright. And have you experienced any pain, discharge, or dizziness along with this fullness?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Definitely no… discharge. And dizziness… not that I’ve noticed. I trip over things sometimes, but I always just put that down to… well, being clumsy, to be honest. Not sure that's related. No… nothing like that. Just the fullness. And the muffling. Is this going to take long? I have… things to get back to.
DOCTOR: We will try to be as efficient as possible, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Have you noticed any ringing in your ear?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Now that you mention it… sometimes. Very faint. Like a… high-pitched whine. But it’s not constant. Comes and goes. It's so quiet, I often wonder if I’m just imagining it. It’s hard to describe. It's not… loud, certainly. More like a… ghost of a sound.
DOCTOR: A “ghost of a sound.” Right. Have you had any recent colds, sinus infections, or been around anyone who has?
PATIENT: Colds… hmm. I think I had something a few months back? A bit of a sniffle, a cough. Nothing major. Old age, you know. Gets you all sorts of things. And… no, not that I recall. I mostly keep to myself these days. Farm work, mostly. So… not much contact with people. Though, Mrs. Gable next door did have a bad cough last winter… but that was ages ago. I don’t think it's connected.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'd like to take a quick look in your ears, if you don’t mind. It will only take a moment. Please lean forward.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. Lean forward… yes. I suppose that's alright. Hope it doesn’t tickle. I don’t like things in my ears. Is this going to be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: No immediate signs of infection… slight cerumen impaction bilaterally. That explains the fullness and muffled hearing. Similar findings on this side. Nothing alarming, but the wax buildup is significant. It’s quite common, actually.
PATIENT: Wax buildup, you say? Well, that’s… good, I suppose. That’s all it is? Just wax? I was worried it was something serious. Can you… just get it out then? I’d like to get this sorted. I have things to do, you know. Fields won't tend themselves. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: It's usually a simple procedure. We can attempt manual removal. It may be slightly uncomfortable, a brief sensation of pressure. If it's too difficult, or you experience discomfort, we can schedule a follow-up with an audiologist for cerumen removal under microscopic guidance. Lean your head slightly to the left.
PATIENT: Left… yes, okay. Pressure, you say? I don’t like pressure. I’ve always had sensitive ears. Just… be gentle, alright? I just want this over with. Quickly, if possible. And… let me know if it's going to hurt before you do anything. I really would appreciate that.
DOCTOR: There may be a slight scraping sensation. Moderate amount of cerumen removed from the left ear canal. Hearing appears improved. Let’s repeat on the other side.
PATIENT: Oh… that is a bit… strange. Not painful, exactly, just… odd. Is it working? Can you tell if you're getting it out? It feels… different. Like something is… shifting. Just please be quick, alright? This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Moderate amount of cerumen removed from the right ear canal. Significant improvement bilaterally. Hearing is markedly better. Alright. The bulk of the wax is out. You should experience significant relief. I recommend avoiding cotton swabs in the future, as they tend to compact the wax further. Is that all clear?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. Yes, I think so. It is better. Definitely better. Less… muffled. Thank you. No cotton swabs… right. I’ll remember that. So… that’s all then? I can… go now? I really need to get back to the farm. The fields… they’re waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Guerrerolopez, that will be all. Here is a discharge summary outlining the procedure and aftercare instructions. If you experience any worsening of symptoms – pain, drainage, persistent hearing loss – please contact the clinic to schedule a follow-up. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Right. Thank you. Very… efficient. Yes. Thank you again. Fields… waiting. .
