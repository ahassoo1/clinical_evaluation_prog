DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good day to you, Doctor. Well, to put it plainly, it's the smoking. I've been... enjoying it for a very long time, you see. Perhaps too long. And I’d like to… well, stop. It’s becoming a bother, and I thought it best to get some advice from a professional.
DOCTOR: Right. Smoking. Okay. And how long is a very long time, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I started when I was fifteen, back in Lithuania. That would make… sixty years, give or take a month. Yes, sixty years. It was quite common then, you understand. Everyone smoked. Though, not like they do now, with these… flavored things. I stick to the traditional roll-ups, myself.
DOCTOR: Sixty years… That’s a considerable amount of time. And how many cigarettes would you say you typically go through in a day?
PATIENT: Hmm. That varies, Doctor, it does. If I’m working – and I still do a bit of work, you see, with the machines – it can be upwards of twenty. Perhaps twenty-five on a particularly… trying day. When I'm not working, maybe fifteen. I try to keep it under twenty, for the sake of… well, my lungs, naturally. Though, “trying” doesn’t always mean succeeding.
DOCTOR: Right. So, roughly a pack a day, sometimes more. Have you tried to quit before, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Several times. Back in the… nineteen eighties, there were those patches, you see? The nicotine patches. They did little for me, I’m afraid. Made me quite irritable, and I couldn't sleep. And then there was that gum… equally ineffective. I suppose I have a strong will, but perhaps not strong enough for these… aids. I've mostly relied on… willpower alone, to be honest. Which, as you can see, hasn't been entirely successful.
DOCTOR: Right. Patches and gum didn't work, willpower alone hasn't been enough. Okay. And have you noticed any specific health problems related to the smoking, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I do cough, naturally. A good deal, especially in the mornings. Though, I suppose that comes with age, doesn’t it? And I get… short of breath, climbing the stairs, that sort of thing. Not terribly serious, mind you. I've always been… a bit of a wheezer. My mother had the same problem. But I suspect the smoking doesn’t help matters, you understand. And I tire more easily these days. It’s… a gradual decline, I suppose. Nothing sudden.
DOCTOR: Right. Cough, shortness of breath, fatigue. And when did these symptoms start to become noticeable?
PATIENT: Let me think… the coughing, always been there, but it got worse, perhaps, ten years ago. When I turned sixty-five, around that time. The shortness of breath… five years ago, I’d say. Gradually worsening. The fatigue, it’s more recent, the last year or so. It's a slow process, Doctor. Not something that happened overnight. I'm not looking for a miracle cure, you understand. Just… some guidance. Some sensible advice. Perhaps something to make it a little easier.
DOCTOR: Right. A gradual decline over the past ten years. Okay. And do you have any chest pain, or have you noticed any blood when you cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no chest pain. Not at all. And thankfully, no blood. Not a drop. Just… a persistent cough. And the feeling of… being winded, easily. It’s not a pleasant sensation, I assure you. I should probably mention, my appetite hasn’t been the best lately either. Though that could be the weather, perhaps? It’s been quite humid, hasn’t it? I do worry about losing weight. A man needs his strength, you understand. Especially at my age.
DOCTOR: Right. No chest pain or blood. Loss of appetite. Okay. And have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Goodness, Doctor, are we discussing everything now? That seems a bit… personal. I suppose… they’re a bit irregular, if I'm honest. Not terribly so, but… not as regular as they once were. Perhaps it’s the food I’ve been eating. I’m not much of a cook, you see. Mostly sandwiches and soup. Though, I do enjoy a good potato pancake when I can get one. Is this relevant to the smoking? I thought we were discussing my lungs.
DOCTOR: It can be relevant, Mr. Knoch. It’s important to get a complete picture. And yes, changes in bowel habits can be linked to smoking and, more importantly, to rule out other potential issues. But let's return to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions – heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, of course. A complete picture. My apologies, Doctor. I simply get a bit… flustered when asked about… such things. Let me see… my father had a weak heart, if that counts. He passed away young, you see. I myself have been told my blood pressure is a bit elevated, at times. The doctor gave me a pill, a small white one, to take when it gets too high. I don’t take it regularly, mind you. I try to manage it with diet and… avoiding stress. And no, no diabetes. I do enjoy a sweet pastry from time to time, but I don't overdo it. I’ve always been a relatively healthy man, despite the smoking.
DOCTOR: Right. Family history of heart problems, occasionally elevated blood pressure… The EHR confirms occasional hypertension, but no consistent diagnosis. And are you currently taking any other medications besides that pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing else. Just that small white pill when my blood pressure gets too high, which isn't often, thankfully. And a multivitamin, of course. Every morning. I believe in looking after myself, you understand. Even with the smoking, I try to maintain some semblance of… responsibility. I do enjoy a small glass of sherry before bed, but I wouldn’t say that’s a medication. A comfort, perhaps. Is this all relevant, Doctor? I feel I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch. We'll get to the bottom of things. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll check your blood pressure and oxygen levels. Then we'll discuss some options. Please remove your shirt.
PATIENT: Oh. Remove my shirt? Doctor, are you quite sure that’s necessary? It’s a bit… chilly in here, you see. And I haven't… I haven’t been doing any exercises lately. It's not a pretty sight, I assure you. Perhaps we could skip that part? I'm happy to answer any questions you have, or discuss my smoking habits in more detail. But removing my shirt… I'm not entirely comfortable with that. Is there perhaps another way?
DOCTOR: Mr. Knoch, a basic physical exam is necessary to assess your condition. Listening to your heart and lungs requires me to hear them directly, and checking your oxygen saturation is crucial. It’s a routine procedure and completely confidential. I assure you, I’ve seen far worse. Please, it will only take a moment. I need to gather information to provide you with the best possible care. If you are uncomfortable, I will need to refer you to another physician.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you insist. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, that’s all. I haven't always been this… frail, you understand. But years of smoking… and a bit of loneliness, perhaps. There. Is that sufficient? I do hope you don't mind the… discoloration. It's from the roll-ups, you see. The tobacco stains. It's quite difficult to remove.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is elevated, slightly irregular. Auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally, with some wheezing. Blood pressure is 145/90. Oxygen saturation is 92%. Alright, Mr. Knoch. As you can see, your heart is working harder than it should be, and your lungs show signs of obstruction. Your oxygen levels are slightly low. This is consistent with your smoking history. The immediate concern is your respiratory function. I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung damage. And we need to address the smoking, of course. Nicotine replacement therapy hasn't worked in the past, so we can explore other options, or potentially refer you to a smoking cessation program. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray, you say? Is that… dangerous? I’ve always been a bit wary of those machines. And a smoking cessation program? What does that involve? More… talking? I'm not much for group activities, Doctor. I prefer my own company. I suppose I should ask… what are my options if I don’t quit? Is it… dire? I've lived a long life, you see. Perhaps it's too late to make drastic changes. I understand you’re a doctor, and you have a duty to advise me, but I'm also a grown man. I’d like to know… realistically, what am I facing? Without the… intervention.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knoch, a chest X-ray is not dangerous. It uses a very small amount of radiation and provides valuable information about your lung health. It’s a standard diagnostic procedure. And a smoking cessation program involves counseling and potentially medication to help you overcome your addiction. As for your question… realistically, without quitting, you are facing a continued decline in your respiratory function, an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, and a significantly higher risk of developing lung cancer. Your quality of life will likely deteriorate, and your lifespan will be shortened. It's not a matter of if something will happen, but when. I understand you’ve lived a long life, but it's never too late to improve your health. We can discuss options that may be more suited to your preferences, such as individual counseling. But ignoring the problem will only lead to a worse outcome. I recommend scheduling a chest X-ray as soon as possible, and then we can discuss a plan to address your smoking. Do you have any allergies or other medical conditions I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. And no other conditions, besides the occasional indigestion. I… I suppose you’re right. Ignoring it won't make it go away. A chest X-ray, then. As soon as possible. And… individual counseling. That sounds… less daunting. My wife… she passed away five years ago. She always told me to quit. Perhaps… perhaps this is for her, as well. What’s the next step, Doctor? Just tell me what I need to do. I'll… I'll cooperate.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch. I'll write you a referral for a chest X-ray at the clinic down the street. They should be able to fit you in within the next few days. Once you have the results, bring them back to me, and we can discuss them. In the meantime, I'll provide you with some information about local counseling services. There are several options available, and we can find one that suits your needs. And Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It takes courage to admit you have a problem and seek help. I commend you for taking this step. And remember, I'm here to support you through this process. I also want to emphasize the importance of avoiding any secondhand smoke exposure. It can exacerbate your existing condition. Do you have any questions before you leave, or would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the X-ray results?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. No secondhand smoke, individual counseling, and the chest X-ray. I’ll… I’ll do my best. A follow-up appointment… yes, that would be sensible. Perhaps in two weeks? That should give them enough time to… process the results. Thank you, Doctor Todorovich. I appreciate your… frankness. And your… patience. I think that’s all for now. Good day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch. You’re welcome. .
