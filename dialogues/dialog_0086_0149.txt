DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Dr. Murtic, is it? Well, honestly, I don't rightly know why I'm here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Said I needed to get this… looked at. Something about not wanting any “interventions.” Honestly, sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing. My feet are fine. Been walking on them for eighty-three years, haven't they done well enough?
DOCTOR: Eighty-three years is a good run, certainly. But even well-worn things need a check-up now and then. Your daughter sounds…concerned. “Interventions” can mean a lot of things, usually just preventative measures. But tell me, even you aren’t experiencing any pain, discomfort, or difficulty with your feet?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Heavens, no. A little ache now and then, maybe, but what eighty-three-year-old doesn’t have a little ache? It’s just…getting old, dear. My daughter, she worries too much. Always has. Thinks a little stiffness means I need…well, I don’t even know what she thinks I need. She just keeps talking about things I don’t understand. Preventative measures… honestly. I’ve lived a long life without needing anyone to “prevent” anything.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's good you're relatively comfortable, but aches and stiffness can indicate underlying issues, even if they aren’t immediately debilitating. It’s my job to rule those out, even if it turns out to be just “getting old,” as you say. Let’s just do a quick examination, alright?
PATIENT: Examination? Oh, now see, that’s what I was afraid of. What kind of examination? I don’t like anyone poking and prodding at my feet. They’re perfectly good feet! I’ve worn sensible shoes my whole life, you know. Never any of those…high heels and nonsense. I just want to know why my daughter dragged me all the way over here. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's a simple check of range of motion, sensation, and circulation. I need to see what your daughter is concerned about, and rule out anything serious. Honestly, it's quicker than explaining all the possible diagnoses. And I assure you, I’m not going to “poke and prod” unnecessarily. It’s standard procedure, Wynell. Unless you’d prefer I just send you home and tell your daughter everything is fine?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you start with that "standard procedure" nonsense. I've heard that one before. Doctors always want to do something. Always poking and prodding and running tests. Honestly, I just want to sit down and have a nice chat. Maybe a cup of tea. Is that too much to ask? And honestly, my daughter... she gets it in her head things are worse than they are. She always has. She worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Wynell, with all due respect, this is a medical appointment, not a social visit. I understand your daughter is concerned, and it’s my professional responsibility to assess your condition. A “nice chat” and a cup of tea won’t rule out potential circulatory problems, nerve damage, or other issues that can significantly impact your quality of life. Now, are you willing to let me perform a basic foot examination, or shall we simply disregard your daughter’s concerns and send you home?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re just being rude. Rude, I tell you. I came here to appease my daughter, not to be scolded by some young doctor. Honestly, I don't appreciate your tone. Circulatory problems? Nerve damage? I’ve lived a long life, dear, and I’m still here, aren’t I? Look, just tell me what my daughter said, what’s she so worried about? Maybe if I know that I can explain to her why she’s fussing over nothing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Your daughter expressed concern about changes she's noticed in your gait – how you walk. She also mentioned some swelling in your ankles and feet, and a slight change in the color of your toenails. She’s worried it could be a circulation issue, possibly peripheral artery disease. She also noted you’ve mentioned some numbness or tingling in your feet recently, and wants to rule out any nerve damage. Is that a fair assessment, or am I missing something?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… she did say something about my ankles looking a little puffy. And I suppose I have noticed my feet feel a little…cold sometimes. Not all the time, mind you. Just when I’ve been sitting for a while. And…yes, I think I did mention a little tingling. But it goes away! It's nothing, really. A little discomfort. Old age, dear. It’s just…old age. Honestly, I wish she hadn’t made such a fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright. Coldness, swelling, and intermittent tingling… those can be signs of circulation issues, even if they’re mild. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it warrants a quick examination to get a baseline and rule out anything more concerning. Just a simple check, Wynell. I'll check the pulses in your feet, assess the skin temperature, and do a quick neurological assessment. It won’t take long. And then, if everything checks out, we can reassure your daughter and you can go home. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But if you poke too hard, I’m telling you right now… And please, don’t talk to me in all that doctor-speak. Just tell me what you’re doing as you go along. And don’t make a fuss if I pull my foot away. It’s just a reflex. Honestly, I don't like anyone messing with my feet. But… alright. Go ahead. But be gentle, you hear?
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll start by checking the pulses in your feet. Just relax. I’m just feeling for the pulse here. It feels…weak. And here. Also quite weak. Now, the left foot is even weaker. This is...not ideal. Now, I'm going to check the skin temperature. It’s…cooler than it should be on both feet. I also notice some discoloration in your toenails, as your daughter mentioned. It's not a severe change, but it's worth noting.
PATIENT: Oh. Weak? Cooler? Discoloration? Now see, this is what I was afraid of. You’re making it sound terrible. My daughter always exaggerates everything. Honestly, I’ve been walking on these feet for eighty-three years, and they’ve always been a little cold sometimes. And the discoloration…well, I polish them myself, you know. Maybe it’s just the polish. Honestly, I don’t like this at all. What does “weak” even mean? Am I going to lose my feet?
DOCTOR: No, Wynell, you are not going to lose your feet. But the weak pulses and cooler temperature do suggest reduced circulation in your lower extremities. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything catastrophic, but it warrants further investigation. It could be early signs of Peripheral Artery Disease – PAD – which is a narrowing of the arteries that reduces blood flow to your legs and feet. We need to determine the cause and severity. I'm going to order a couple of tests. An Ankle-Brachial Index - ABI - which compares the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms, and a Doppler ultrasound to visualize the blood flow in your legs. This will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, honestly. More poking and prodding and machines? I don’t like machines. And what’s this “Peripheral Artery Disease?” Sounds dreadful. Is it contagious? Will I have to be quarantined? Honestly, I just want to go home and have a nice cup of tea. My daughter is going to be so pleased with herself. Always getting me worked up over nothing. What if these tests show something terrible? Will I have to have surgery? I don’t want surgery!
DOCTOR: No, Wynell, it is not contagious, and you will not be quarantined. PAD is not an infection; it's a circulatory problem, often caused by plaque buildup in the arteries. And the tests are non-invasive—they don't involve needles or incisions. The ABI involves simply taking blood pressure readings on your arms and ankles. The ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of your arteries. As for surgery…we aren’t even at that point. If the tests show a significant blockage, we'll discuss all your options, which may include medication, lifestyle changes, or, in rare cases, a procedure to improve blood flow. But right now, we just need to get some information. I’m ordering the ABI and the ultrasound, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. It’s best to get this done as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you start a walking program—even just a short walk each day can help improve circulation. And please, try to elevate your feet when you’re resting. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Walking program? Elevate my feet? Honestly, I already do elevate my feet. When I'm watching television, of course. And I walk to the kitchen to make my tea. That's walking, isn't it? Honestly, this all sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing. My daughter will be insufferable. Insufferable, I tell you! Fine. I'll try to walk a little more. And I'll elevate my feet. But don't expect miracles. Honestly, I just want this to be over with. And I want the results of these tests right away. No waiting around for weeks and weeks, you hear? And tell the lab to be gentle.
DOCTOR: I’ll do my best to expedite the results, Wynell, but it does take time to process the tests and have them reviewed by a radiologist. I will also make a note in your chart for the lab to be as gentle as possible. Now, I'm going to write you a prescription for a low-dose aspirin, which can help improve blood flow. It’s a standard preventative measure. And I want you to see a podiatrist within the next month for a foot exam and assessment. They can provide specialized care for your feet and monitor any changes. Here's the prescription. I'll also give you a list of podiatrists in the area. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Aspirin? I don't like taking pills. They always give me heartburn. And another doctor? Honestly, this is ridiculous. My feet are perfectly fine! A podiatrist… honestly. What will they do? Polish my toenails? No, I don’t have any questions. I just want to go home. And I want my daughter to know I told you my feet are perfectly good. Don’t tell her I said that, you hear? Honestly, she'll just fuss over me even more. I think that's all. Just let me go home, please. And I really do hope these tests don't show anything terrible.
DOCTOR: Very well, Wynell. I understand your concerns, and I hope the tests will provide some reassurance. I will document your preference regarding informing your daughter of your concerns. Please, try to follow the recommendations—even if it’s just a short walk each day. It can make a difference. Here’s a copy of your discharge instructions and the list of podiatrists. If you experience any sudden changes in your feet—severe pain, numbness, or discoloration—please go to the emergency room immediately. I wish you a good day, Wynell. And please, take care. And just one more thing… try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
