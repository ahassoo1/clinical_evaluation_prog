DOCTOR: Hello, Evann. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. I believe I scheduled this appointment to discuss… plans for the future, should something unexpected happen. I’m afraid my memory isn't what it used to be, and I want to ensure my wishes are known. Something about… a form? An advance directive, perhaps? I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: Right. An advance directive. Yes, many people come in for those. It is a good idea to get that sorted. Though frankly, at your age… well. But, no matter. It’s… responsible. So, you want to make sure your wishes are documented, in case of… incapacity. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Incapacity. That sounds… correct. I’ve been told I should have this done for some time now. My… ex-husband, mostly. He was always very… practical. I just want to avoid any… complications, if you understand. And I suppose it would put my family at ease, knowing what I want. Though, truthfully, I struggle to even recall what I want sometimes. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. Well, we can certainly work through it. It doesn’t have to be all decided today. We’ll just go through some questions, and you tell me what feels right. Have you given any thought to who you’d want to make medical decisions for you if you were unable to?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. Honestly? Not really. My family is… distant. A sister, I believe, but we haven’t spoken in years. And my ex-husband… well, he’s perfectly capable, I suppose, but I’m not certain I want him making those kinds of decisions for me. It’s… complicated. Perhaps someone from the shop? I have a very trusted colleague, Mr. Chen, but I don’t know if that’s… appropriate. I’m truly unsure.
DOCTOR: Right. Complicated is… putting it mildly. A colleague isn’t ideal, legally speaking. It needs to be someone with your best interests at heart, and who understands your values. And legally, they’d need to be able to act on your behalf. We can discuss the requirements later if you like. Let’s put that aside for a moment. Before we get into who, let's talk about what. Are there any treatments you definitely wouldn't want, no matter what?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I… I suppose I’m not afraid of death, exactly. But I have a strong aversion to being… kept alive artificially. Tubes, machines… I find that deeply unsettling. Prolonging things unnecessarily… it doesn’t seem… dignified. I wouldn’t want to be a burden, either. But beyond that… I’m not sure. Is there a list of… options? Perhaps seeing them written out would help me clarify my thoughts. My mind feels rather… foggy.
DOCTOR: Foggy, yes. It’s common. We have some standard forms that outline common scenarios and treatment options. Let's start with a Do Not Resuscitate order, a DNR. That specifies whether or not you want CPR if your heart stops. And then there's a section on mechanical ventilation - breathing machines. We can also discuss feeding tubes, dialysis, antibiotics... the usual end-of-life considerations. Here. Take your time. Read through these. I’ll be back in a few minutes. Don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. Though, honestly, they are rather… wordy.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… very kind of you. Wordy is… an understatement. I suppose I should start with the DNR. It seems… the most straightforward. Though, the legal jargon… it’s rather daunting. I appreciate your patience with this, truly. It’s… a lot to process. Perhaps I should have brought a friend.
DOCTOR: Friends are… often unhelpful in these situations. They tend to project their wishes onto you. Best to focus on what you want. Take your time. I have other patients, naturally, but I’ll check back with you shortly. Don't feel pressured to complete everything at once. And if you get stuck, just… flag me down. Though, frankly, these forms are fairly self-explanatory.
PATIENT: Self-explanatory… Perhaps I should have brought someone. Or, at least, a stronger pair of glasses. This is… quite small. And the language… "prolongation of life," "artificial means"... It feels very… impersonal. I suppose I’ll try to focus on the options, and see if anything resonates. Though, truthfully, I feel more confused now than I did before.
DOCTOR: Are you having trouble understanding the terminology?
PATIENT: Oh! Doctor. Yes, actually. I… I apologize for the interruption. It’s just… “advanced directives,” “mechanical ventilation,” “artificial means”… it’s all very abstract. And frankly, it’s rather frightening to consider. Is there a simpler way to explain what these things mean? I feel as though I need a… translation. I understand the concept of expressing my wishes, but the details… they’re overwhelming. I'm afraid my medical knowledge is… limited, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s fairly straightforward. CPR is chest compressions – pushing on your chest to get your heart going. Mechanical ventilation is a breathing machine. Artificial means… is anything that keeps you alive when your body can’t do it on its own. It’s not rocket science. Frankly, most people understand this. Do you want people trying to revive you if your heart stops, or not?
PATIENT: I… I understand what those things are, Doctor. It’s the… implications I’m struggling with. If I say “no” to CPR… does that mean I’m giving up? And if I refuse ventilation… is that considered… a rejection of life? It’s not about a lack of understanding the procedures themselves, it’s about the… moral weight of the decision. It’s a rather philosophical question, isn’t it? I apologize for my… hesitancy. I’m simply trying to be… thorough. And, perhaps, a little afraid.
DOCTOR: Philosophical?
PATIENT: Well… isn’t it? If I choose not to pursue every possible medical intervention, am I… actively choosing to end my life? Or am I simply respecting the natural order of things? It’s… a rather difficult distinction, don’t you think? And I suppose it depends on one's beliefs, and… and values. I apologize for being so… verbose. I realize this is probably a rather tedious conversation. Perhaps I’m not the right person to be making these decisions. I feel… utterly lost.
DOCTOR: Look, I don’t have time for existential debates. You want to fill out these forms, or not?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I understand you’re busy, Doctor. I truly do. Perhaps this was a mistake. Perhaps I should just… leave it blank. It wouldn’t be a burden, would it? If I simply didn't… specify anything? I apologize for wasting your time. I’m clearly not… capable of this.
DOCTOR: Look, I’m going to be blunt. You're perfectly capable. You’re just… overthinking it. It's a simple form. Decide what you want, check the boxes, and we’ll be done. If you don’t want CPR, check the box saying you don’t. It’s not a referendum on your will to live. If you leave it blank, your family will have to decide, and frankly, they’ll likely do whatever they want. Do you want that?
PATIENT: No. No, I don’t want that. That’s… precisely why I came, wasn’t it? To avoid that very situation. To ensure my wishes are… respected. It’s just… the responsibility feels… immense. And the language… it’s so clinical. So… detached. Perhaps… perhaps if you could just explain the implications of each option, in… simpler terms? Just a brief overview? Then I could… make a decision. I promise I won't… overthink it. I'll just… check the boxes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look. First box: CPR. If your heart stops, do you want us to try to restart it?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. If my heart stops… I want you to try. I… I suppose I haven't fully reconciled with the idea of… not being revived. It feels… wrong, to simply… give up. Even if it's… prolonged. There. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: Mechanical ventilation. That’s a breathing machine. If you can’t breathe on your own, do you want us to put you on one?
PATIENT: That’s… a more difficult question. I… I remember reading something about… the discomfort. And the… indignity. But the thought of… not being able to breathe… that’s… terrifying. I suppose… I've always valued my independence. And the idea of being… tethered to a machine… it feels… suffocating. Is there… a limit to how long they would keep me on it? Or is it… indefinite? That’s… a rather important distinction, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It depends. There are guidelines, but ultimately, it's a medical decision. We'll consult with your family, assess your quality of life... It's not a simple yes or no. But if you want to state a preference… do you want us to try ventilation, or not?
PATIENT: If… if I were to be… completely incapacitated… and there was no hope of recovery… then… no. No ventilation, please. I… I don’t want to be kept alive artificially. It wouldn’t be… me. There. Is that… clear enough? It feels… strange, to make these decisions. But… perhaps it’s better to have said something, than nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's… reasonable. Are there any other specific treatments you want to refuse?
PATIENT: I… I don’t think so. I haven’t… given much thought to dialysis or antibiotics. I suppose… I trust your judgment. If… if there’s something that wouldn’t improve my quality of life, or prolong my suffering… then I trust you to make the right decision. No. I think… I think that’s all. I… I think I’m done. Thank you, Doctor. For your patience. And… for explaining everything. It means… a great deal.
DOCTOR: Alright. This is… sufficient. I’ll put this in your file. Here. For your records. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. You’ve been… incredibly helpful, Doctor. I… I feel much better now, knowing that my wishes are documented. Thank you again, for your time and… your patience. And for not… laughing at me. Have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye.
