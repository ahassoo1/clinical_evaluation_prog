DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter from the lab, you see. Said my cholesterol is a bit high. Hyper… something, I think it was called. I don’t really understand all those big words, but I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A high cholesterol reading flagged on your lab results. Hyperlipidemia is the term – it just means you have higher than optimal levels of cholesterol in your blood. It's good you're getting it checked out. Let's take a look at these numbers. Before we dive into that though, can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Sure. Hmm, overall… I think I’m pretty healthy. I try to walk most days, usually about a mile or so. I eat… reasonably well, I guess. Not a lot of fried foods. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but other than that, not much. Oh, and I have Medicare, of course. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful information, thank you. Knowing about the gallbladder removal is good to have. And the walking is excellent – good for your heart. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I can recall, no. I’ve had the usual things, you know, colds, the flu… nothing serious. My blood pressure has been a little high at times, the nurse mentioned it at my yearly check-up, but it usually comes down when I relax a bit. I haven’t been told about anything else. I’m pretty regular with my check-ups, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother… she had some heart trouble when she got older, needed a stent, I think it was. And my father had diabetes, but he didn’t take care of himself very well, to be honest. He ate a lot of sweets. My brother is fine, as far as I know, but we don’t see each other much anymore. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, thank you. A family history of heart disease and diabetes does increase your risk. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a daily vitamin, Doctor. Nothing else. And sometimes I take something for a headache, but that’s not regular. Nothing prescribed, just something you can get at the drugstore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve had a few shots over the years, of course, but nothing bad happened. I’m pretty lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. Now, let's talk about the cholesterol results themselves. Your total cholesterol is elevated at 240. Your LDL, that's the "bad" cholesterol, is 160, which is above the optimal range. Your HDL, the "good" cholesterol, is 45, which is a little low. And your triglycerides are 180, which is borderline high. Would you like me to explain any of those terms in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… not good, doesn’t it? Honestly, Doctor, all those numbers just swim in front of my eyes. Could you explain them… maybe like you’d explain it to a child? I understand “bad” and “good”, but I don’t really know what they do. And what does it mean if they’re “high” or “low”? I’m just trying to understand what’s going on here.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. I'm happy to explain it in simpler terms. Think of cholesterol like a tiny bit of wax in your blood. You need some wax to build healthy cells, but too much wax can clog up your pipes – those are your arteries. LDL, the "bad" cholesterol, is like the sticky wax that builds up and causes those clogs. HDL, the "good" cholesterol, is like a little cleaner that sweeps away the sticky wax. Triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood, and high levels can also contribute to clogs. So, your LDL is too high, meaning you have a lot of sticky wax building up. Your HDL is a little low, meaning you don’t have enough cleaners. And your triglycerides are borderline high, meaning there’s a bit too much extra fat. This increases your risk of heart disease and stroke, but we can definitely work on improving these numbers. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… a much better explanation, thank you. The wax and the pipes… I can picture that. So, more wax is bad, less cleaner is bad, and extra fat is not good. Okay. What do we do about it? Do I need… medication? I’ve always tried to stay away from taking pills if I can avoid it. Is there anything I can do with my diet or exercise? I walk every day, like I said.
DOCTOR: Good question. Many things can help, and we often start with lifestyle changes before considering medication. Walking is excellent, so keep that up! Let's talk about your diet. Are you able to describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I’m glad to hear walking is good. A typical day… hmm. Well, for breakfast, I usually have oatmeal with some fruit – berries mostly. And a little bit of brown sugar, I admit. For lunch, I often have a sandwich – turkey or chicken on whole-wheat bread, with lettuce and tomato. Sometimes a side salad. And for dinner… well, that varies. Sometimes fish, like salmon, which I know is good for you. Sometimes chicken, maybe with roasted vegetables. And sometimes, I’ll have pasta. Not a huge portion, but… pasta. And I do like a little bit of cheese with my meals. I try not to have too many sweets, but I do enjoy a small piece of chocolate after dinner. Does that sound… terrible? I really do try to eat reasonably well.
DOCTOR: That doesn’t sound terrible at all. It sounds like you have a pretty good base. The brown sugar with the oatmeal, the cheese, and the pasta are areas we could look at. Reducing saturated and trans fats is key. Saturated fats are often found in full-fat dairy products like cheese, and trans fats are in processed foods. Also, are you consuming any fried foods?
PATIENT: Not really. I haven’t had anything fried in… well, I can’t remember when. I try to avoid those. I bake things sometimes, but mostly cookies or muffins, not… fried chicken or anything like that. I’m pretty careful about what I eat, honestly. It’s just… hard to give up everything! I enjoy my food. I’m 54, Doctor, and I think a little bit of enjoyment is important, don’t you?
DOCTOR: I absolutely agree! Enjoyment is very important. We're not aiming for perfection, just small changes to improve your numbers. Let’s focus on limiting the saturated fats and increasing your fiber intake. More vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. And a smaller portion of pasta. Now, before we discuss a potential plan, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. A quick exam is no problem at all. I always get a little nervous when they listen to my heart, but I understand it’s important. I suppose it’s good to know everything is working okay. Where should I go?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, please. I'll grab my stethoscope. Just relax, and I’ll be right back. We'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I’ll just sit here and try to relax. It’s always easier said than done, isn’t it? But I’ll try.
DOCTOR: Alright, just take some nice, deep breaths. 142 over 88. A little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Everything sounds good. I don't detect anything concerning.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to hear. “Regular” and “clear” are good words, aren’t they? I always worry when they use complicated words! So, what does this all mean, Doctor? What’s the plan? Are we talking about pills, or can we try to fix this with food and exercise? I’m really hoping we can avoid medication if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, "regular" and "clear" are definitely good words! Based on what we've discussed, I think we can definitely start with lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise. I'd like you to follow a heart-healthy diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Limit saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium. And continue your daily walking. I’m going to write you a referral to a registered dietitian. They can help you develop a personalized meal plan. And I want you to increase your fiber intake to at least 25-30 grams per day. I also recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible. We’ll repeat your cholesterol levels in three months. If they haven’t improved significantly with these changes, then we can discuss medication options. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. A registered dietitian sounds like a great idea. I could definitely use some help with the meal planning. And I can certainly monitor my blood pressure at home. I have one of those machines, actually. Three months… that gives me time to work on things. Okay, so I’ll get the referral to the dietitian, and I’ll keep walking and try to eat better. Is there anything else I should be doing, Doctor? Any specific foods I should avoid completely, or any exercises that would be particularly helpful? I want to do everything I can to get these numbers down.
DOCTOR: Excellent. You’re taking a very proactive approach, and that’s great. As for specific foods to avoid completely, processed foods, sugary drinks, and foods high in saturated and trans fats are the biggest culprits. Read labels carefully. And be mindful of portion sizes. Regarding exercise, walking is fantastic. But incorporating some strength training exercises a couple of times a week would be beneficial. It helps build muscle mass and improves your metabolism. You don't need to go to a gym, simple bodyweight exercises like squats, push-ups, and lunges can be very effective. I'm also going to give you a handout with a list of heart-healthy foods and some sample meal plans. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very helpful, thank you. The handout is a great idea. I always forget what’s good and what’s bad. Strength training… I haven’t done that in years! But I can certainly try. I think I can manage squats, maybe. Push-ups… that might be a challenge! No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. I feel much better about this now. It’s not as scary as I thought it would be. Thank you again, Doctor Vanochten. I’ll see you in three months.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Geho. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Here’s the referral for the dietitian, and the appointment scheduler’s number if you need to reschedule anything. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in three months.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Geho. Have a good day!
