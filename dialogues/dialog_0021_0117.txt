DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. Good to meet you too. I... I got a cough. Been coughin' up stuff. Not just regular stuff, you know? There's... blood in it. It's kinda scary. I smoke, if that matters. Been smokin' a long time. I just wanna get it checked out, quick if we can.
DOCTOR: Blood, you say. Right. Smoking certainly can contribute to things. How long has this cough been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Time... it kinda all blends together. A few weeks, maybe? Longer? I don't really keep track. It started small, just a tickle. Then it got worse. And that’s when I saw the... you know. The blood. Not a lot, but enough to worry me. I guess. It’s just… hard to remember details. Everything feels fuzzy lately.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, fuzzy memory… Alright. And is the cough constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. More in the mornings, usually. When I first wake up. And when I… when I’ve been doin’ stuff, like walkin’ around. It’s worse then. When I’m sittin’ still, it’s not so bad. Does that make sense? I'm not good at explainin’ things. It’s just… a cough. Sometimes bad, sometimes not. Mostly bad.
DOCTOR: Right, so worse with exertion, better at rest. Any other symptoms accompanying the cough?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. I get kinda tired, easier than usual. And… my chest feels tight sometimes. Like somethin’s pressin’ on it. No fever, I don’t think. I haven't checked. I just figured it was from the coughin’. Honestly, I just want to know if it’s somethin' serious. I don’t wanna mess around with this stuff. Is it my lungs? From the smokin’? Is that what you think?
DOCTOR: Smoking definitely doesn't help. It could be a number of things, Mr. Reyno. Let’s do a quick listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Then we’ll talk. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. Maybe? I haven’t been weighin’ myself. My clothes feel a little looser, now that you mention it. But I figured that was just… gettin’ older. I don't really eat much anymore, to be honest. Not a big appetite. It's just… hard to get motivated to cook. Can we just get this over with? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just need to listen to your chest. If you could just sit up there for me. Then we'll check your oxygen. Don't fuss so much. It’ll be quicker if you cooperate.
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you say. Just… hurry it up, please. This is makin’ me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your oxygen is a little low, 92%. Not critically low, but not ideal. Lungs… I hear some wheezing, a bit of diminished breath sounds on the left side. History of smoking, reduced appetite, weight loss, low oxygen, wheezing… This isn’t ideal. Have you ever had a chest X-ray before?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? Uh… I don't think so. Not that I remember. Maybe a long time ago, when I was younger? But I can’t be sure. Everything's kinda blurry, like I said. I don’t really go to the doctor much. Just when somethin’ really bad happens. You think I need one now? Is it gonna be expensive?
DOCTOR: Well, given your symptoms and the findings, yes, I do think a chest X-ray is warranted. It's the best way to see what's going on in your lungs. As for the cost… Medicare should cover most of it, but I can't guarantee everything. We have a form you can fill out for financial assistance if needed. Look, Mr. Reyno, I'm not going to leave you hanging. We need to rule things out. Let's just get the X-ray done. It's right down the hall.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. X-ray. Fine. Medicare, you said? I got that. Just… get it over with. The sooner, the better. I really don’t like hospitals. Or… whatever this is. Just tell me what I gotta do. Is it gonna hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it won't hurt. It's just a quick picture. The technician will position you, and it's over in a few seconds. She's very nice. I'll have her send the results to me as soon as they're available. After the X-ray, we'll discuss the next steps. Here's the form. Just take it with you to the radiology department. It’s just down the hall, first door on your right. Now, go on. Don’t dawdle.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Down the hall, first door. Got it. Thanks… I guess. .
