DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I need some papers signed, mostly. Just some health forms for… things. I don't really understand all the fuss, honestly, but they said I needed a notary to verify them. Is that something you can do here? I'm trying to get this all done quickly, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can certainly help with that. I'm a notary public, so I can verify those forms for you. It sounds like you've already started the paperwork process. Before we get to the signing, though, as your doctor, I'd like to just quickly ask a few questions to get a better understanding of your overall health. It's standard practice, even if you're primarily here for paperwork. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that's fine, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. I just… I don't have a lot of patience for filling things out, you know? And my memory isn't what it used to be, so if I repeat myself, please excuse me. What kind of questions are we talking about?
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Melvenia, we’ll take it slow. And repeating yourself is perfectly fine – it helps me make sure I have everything right. We'll start with some basic questions about why you are seeking care today, beyond just the forms. Are you experiencing any specific health concerns right now?
PATIENT: Well… not really. I mean, I'm 76, so things ache here and there, but that's just getting old, right? Nothing new or sudden. I mostly just want these papers signed so I can get on with things. Is there a way we can skip the questions and just… get to the signing? I’m not trying to be difficult, it’s just that I feel perfectly healthy for my age.
DOCTOR: I understand, Melvenia. It's good that you feel healthy. However, even if you’re feeling well, it's important for me to ask a few questions to get a complete picture of your health history. It’s part of providing the best possible care, and also necessary for me to legally sign off on certain forms. It doesn’t have to be a long, drawn-out process, I promise. Perhaps we can start with your past medical history – have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I had a bad case of the flu when I was younger, and I broke my wrist once falling off a horse. Does that count? Oh, and I had my tonsils out when I was a child. Other than that… not really. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. I’ve never really been one for doctors, honestly. Is knowing about my tonsils important for these papers?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, thank you. Tonsils out isn't usually something that’s relevant for these forms, but it’s good to have a complete picture. The flu and the broken wrist are good information, too. Now, have you ever had any surgeries other than your tonsils?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve avoided surgery like the plague my whole life. Always thought it was too risky. I prefer a good cup of chamomile tea if I'm feeling unwell, if you don't mind. Can we please hurry this up a bit? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand wanting to keep things brief, and I apologize if this feels slow. We’re getting through it. Just a few more questions, and then we can get to the paperwork. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I eat everything. Never had a problem. My mother always said I had an iron stomach. Honestly, I think these questions are just a waste of time. But alright, I’ll answer them if you really need me to. Is it important if I like spicy food? Because I love spicy food. Does that count as an allergy if I feel ill after eating something really hot?
DOCTOR: No, a love for spicy food doesn't count as an allergy, Melvenia. And feeling unwell after eating something spicy isn't an allergy, either – it's probably just your stomach reacting to the heat. So, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing at all. I try to stay away from those things as much as possible. My grandmother used to say, “Too much medicine is worse than the illness.” I just… prefer to let my body heal itself. Can we please get to the signing now? I feel like I’ve been here forever.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Melvenia. We can absolutely get to the signing now. You’ve been very patient, and I appreciate you answering my questions. Before we do, just so I have a complete record, let me quickly check your height and weight. It’s standard procedure, and it'll only take a moment. Then we can get these forms notarized for you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine, whatever. I suppose I can stand on the scale. But please, be quick about it. I’m starting to feel faint. And don’t tell me I’ve gained weight, I'm sensitive about that. Just get it over with. I just want to get out of here.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. We’ll be quick and discreet. I promise I won’t say anything that will upset you. Okay, that's 189 centimeters and 110 pounds. Thank you. Everything looks alright. Now, if you could just sit back down, we can go over these forms and get them signed and notarized. Just let me know if anything is unclear.
PATIENT: Finally. Alright, let's get this over with. gestures impatiently towards the forms Just point to where I need to sign, please. And make it quick. I really have to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, so here, on this first form, it's just your signature and the date. And here, on this second one, your signature, the date, and initialing to confirm you understand the contents… And so on. I'll be right here to guide you through each one. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions at all.
PATIENT: Signs each form with a brisk, somewhat shaky hand, barely glancing at the content. There. Done. Is that everything? Can I please go now? I feel like I've aged ten years just sitting here. Seriously, thank you. Thank you so much. Just give me the papers and I’ll be on my way. reaches for the signed forms eagerly
DOCTOR: Here you go, Melvenia. All signed and notarized. And you’re very welcome. You mentioned feeling faint earlier, and you seem a little unsteady. Would you like me to call someone for you – a family member or friend – to help you get home?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, that's alright. I’m fine. Really. It’s just… a lot of sitting around. And I didn’t have breakfast. I'll be alright once I get some fresh air and a cup of tea. Thank you for your concern, though. You've been very kind. clutches the forms tightly and starts to rise from the chair with some difficulty. Just… let me go now. I really need to rest.
DOCTOR: Of course. You take care now, Melvenia. And if you do start feeling unwell, please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Here's my card with the clinic information. It was nice meeting you, and I wish you all the best. Please don't hesitate to call if you need anything.
