DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my left leg has gotten quite swollen. It's been happening on and off, but it’s worse now. I also… I have a heart thing, the doctors told me. Atrial… something? It makes my heart beat funny sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Swelling in your left leg, and you mentioned a heart condition – atrial fibrillation, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Atrial fibrillation. I don’t really understand it, to be honest. They said it’s why I get tired easily sometimes, and a bit breathless. But the leg is the main thing right now. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, the leg swelling is new or has it been a gradual process?
PATIENT: It's… not new new. It comes and goes, like I said. But it's been getting worse each time it comes back, I think. This time it's quite a bit bigger than usual, and a bit painful. Not terrible pain, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, noticeable pain. And is the swelling just in your left leg, or is it affecting your right leg at all?
PATIENT: Just the left leg, Doctor. The right one is perfectly fine. I checked this morning, just to be sure. It's only the left one that's bothering me. It feels… tight, almost. Like it's filled with water, maybe? I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Nixon. Tightness and a feeling of fullness are common with swelling. Have you noticed any skin changes – redness, warmth, or any sores?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven’t seen any sores, no. It’s not particularly warm to the touch, and I don't think it's red, but it might be a little bit. It's hard to tell with my skin tone, honestly. I have fair skin. It just looks… puffy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, puffy. And have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness along with the leg swelling, or at all recently?
PATIENT: I do get a bit breathless sometimes, like I said earlier, with the heart thing. But that’s usually just when I walk up stairs, or try to hurry. No chest pain, thankfully. And no dizziness, no. Just… tired. And the leg. Mostly the leg.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you taking any medications currently for your atrial fibrillation, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. The doctor gave me some small white pills to take every day. I think they're supposed to slow my heart down, but I can't remember the name of them. And… that’s it, really. Just those little white pills. I take them with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, small white pills for your heart. Do you happen to know the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I’m afraid not. I just take them as the doctor told me. I’m very bad with remembering numbers. I'm sorry. I can bring the bottle next time, if that would help? It's in my handbag, but I don't want to rummage about now.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nixon. Bringing the bottle next time would be very helpful. Now, let's take a look at your leg. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Please do. I'm happy to show you. It's getting a little embarrassing, it's so big.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some swelling, as you mentioned, and it does appear slightly reddish, though as you said, it's hard to be certain with your skin tone. I’m going to check for pitting edema… Yes, there is some pitting edema present, meaning the indentation remains for a few seconds after I press. The leg feels warm to the touch, and I don’t detect any significant tenderness. I'm also going to check your pulses to see how the blood flow is in your leg. Your pulses are present, but slightly diminished on the left side compared to your right. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is a bit rapid, but there are no unusual sounds. Your lungs are clear. Based on this initial exam, it's concerning that there's swelling with some redness, and that the pulses are a little weaker on the left side. We need to investigate what's causing this. Given your history of atrial fibrillation, it could be related, but we need to rule out other possibilities, like a blood clot.
PATIENT: A blood clot? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is that why the pulses are weaker? And what does 'rule out' mean? I’m getting a bit worried now. I just want it to go back to normal.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nixon, and it's good you're expressing it. A blood clot, also known as deep vein thrombosis or DVT, can cause swelling and diminished pulses. It's a serious condition, which is why we need to investigate. "Rule out" means we'll perform some tests to determine if a blood clot is present, or if something else is causing the swelling. The weaker pulses could be a sign of a clot, but other things can cause that as well. It’s important not to jump to conclusions. We need more information. To start, I'd like to order a D-dimer blood test, which can help to identify if there’s a recent clot formation. Depending on the results of that, we may also need to do an ultrasound of your left leg to visualize the veins and see if there’s a blockage. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A blood test and… a scan? Yes, that sounds alright, if it will help find out what's wrong. I just want to feel better. Will the blood test take long? And will the scan hurt? I’m a little bit nervous now.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Nixon, and it's perfectly normal to feel that way. The blood test will only take a few minutes – a simple draw from your arm. As for the ultrasound, it’s completely painless. It uses sound waves to create images of your leg, and there’s no radiation involved. The technician will just apply some gel to your skin and move a probe around. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. While we're waiting for the test results, I recommend elevating your left leg as much as possible and avoiding prolonged standing or sitting. This will help to reduce the swelling. I’m also going to prescribe you a mild compression stocking for your left leg, which will further help with circulation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Elevate my leg and a stocking… yes, that sounds manageable. I can do that. I have a comfy armchair, so I can put it up easily. And a stocking sounds alright, as long as it’s not too tight. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or avoiding? Should I be worried about… anything specifically while I wait for the results?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Elevating your leg and the compression stocking are excellent first steps. As for anything else, please avoid any strenuous activity, as that could potentially worsen the swelling. The most important thing to watch out for while you wait for the results is any sudden, severe pain in your leg, or any new shortness of breath or chest pain. If you experience either of those, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. These could be signs of a more serious problem. Otherwise, try to relax as much as possible, and focus on keeping your leg elevated. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we should have the results back within a few hours. We'll schedule an ultrasound as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not making me feel silly about being worried. I'll try to relax, and I'll keep an eye out for those symptoms you mentioned. Just… one small thing. Will the results be sent to my regular doctor, too? I usually see Dr. MacIntyre.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. It’s my job to listen and address your concerns, and you’re absolutely not being silly. And yes, the results will be sent to Dr. MacIntyre as well. I’ll also make sure a copy is kept in your chart here at the clinic. We want to make sure everyone is on the same page regarding your care. Let me have the nurse come in and draw your blood. She'll explain the process and answer any questions you may have. After that, we can discuss scheduling the ultrasound. Is there anything I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel a little bit better now, just knowing what's happening. Please just let me know when the nurse is ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll let her know you're ready. We'll get this sorted out, Nixon. Just take a deep breath, and we'll take it one step at a time. She'll be in shortly.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Take care, and don't hesitate to let us know if anything changes. We'll be in touch soon. .
