DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor recently. It’s…different than usual, and not in a good way. I can’t really describe it, just…off.
DOCTOR: I see. That can be concerning, and it’s good you brought it to my attention. It's not embarrassing at all to discuss changes in your body. We all experience these things. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about this change?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started maybe a month or so ago? I always sweat a little, you know, especially with my job – it’s physical work, laying floors – but this is…stronger. And it doesn't seem to go away with just a regular shower. I use the same soap I always have, and I’m showering daily, sometimes twice if I'm really working hard. It’s just…persistent. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Purtee. Persistent odor despite good hygiene is definitely something we need to investigate. And a month is a reasonable timeframe to notice a change. You mentioned your job is physical labor. Does the odor seem worse after work, or is it present throughout the day, regardless of activity?
PATIENT: It’s definitely worse after work, yeah. Like, I can be smelling okay in the morning, get to the job site, and by lunchtime I can tell it’s starting. But even when I’m not working, it seems…a little bit there. Not as strong, but it’s not completely gone, you know? Like a faint undertone. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. A faint undertone even at rest is helpful information. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with this odor?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. I haven’t really been sick sick, but I have been more tired than usual, I guess. Just generally feeling run down. And…oh! My clothes have been smelling a little bit even after I wash them. Not terribly, but enough that I’ve started using more detergent. Does that…mean anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does mean something, Ms. Purtee. Increased fatigue and odor clinging to clothes even after washing are both potentially significant. To get a better picture, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if that’s alright with you. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: That’s fine. No, not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been controlled with medication for a while now. Other than that…just the usual aches and pains from the job, I suppose. Nothing major. I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Oh, and I’m divorced, if that matters. Not sure why that would, but…
DOCTOR: Divorce doesn’t directly matter medically, but thank you for sharing. It's good to have a complete picture. Controlled high blood pressure is good to know. And gallbladder removal long ago is also helpful. You're on medication for your blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. Been on it for about five years now. It seems to be doing its job, my doctor checks it regularly. I haven't changed the dosage or anything recently.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s good to know. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I sneeze a little bit in the spring sometimes, but nothing severe. No food allergies or anything like that. I can eat pretty much anything. I don’t take any other medications besides the lisinopril, either. Just that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or other medications. That simplifies things. Now, just to be thorough, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and she had heart problems later in life. My father was pretty healthy, actually, lived to be 85. He had high blood pressure too, but it wasn't as bad as my mother’s. And my brother…he has asthma, I think. That's about it, really. No one else in my family has had anything major, that I know of.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. That’s helpful. Diabetes and a history of hypertension in your family are good to be aware of. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I work a lot. Laying floors is pretty demanding. I don't drink or smoke, never have. I try to eat okay, but it's hard when you're on the go all day. Usually something quick and easy. I don't really have time for a lot of hobbies, honestly. Mostly just relaxing when I can. I live alone, so it's mostly just me. I try to get enough sleep, but some nights it's hard to wind down.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good sense of your day-to-day. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’d like to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. We’ll also do a quick neurological assessment, just to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m a little worried, honestly, but I trust your judgment. Go ahead. I just hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Purtee. We'll take things one step at a time. Okay, Ms. Purtee. Your vital signs are generally good, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Your neurological exam is also normal. I do notice a slightly altered body odor, as you described, which seems more prominent in your armpits. It’s not a strong odor, but it is different than what I’d expect. Given your symptoms and what I’ve found on the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One is bromhidrosis, which is an excessive or altered body odor. However, given the persistence of the odor despite good hygiene and the fatigue you’re experiencing, we should also rule out other causes. To do that, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel . These will give us a better look at your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. CBC and CMP, you said? Alright, let’s do it. I just want to feel normal again. Is there anything I should do before the tests? Like, should I stop taking my blood pressure medication?
DOCTOR: No, please do not stop taking your lisinopril. It’s important to continue taking your medication as prescribed. The tests will account for the medication you’re on. Just try to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks except water. We'll schedule you for a blood draw first thing tomorrow morning. The lab is right across the hall. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds good. Fasting isn't a problem. Tomorrow morning… okay. And then we’ll meet again to talk about the results? Alright. I appreciate you taking this seriously, Dr. Tosca. I was starting to think I was just imagining things.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. It's my job to take your concerns seriously, and you're not imagining things. It's always best to investigate these changes. Here's a lab requisition form. Just take this to the lab tomorrow morning. They'll take care of everything. And I’ll have my nurse schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve answered everything I was worried about. Thank you again, Dr. Tosca. I’ll see you next week, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get some rest, and I’ll see you next week.
