DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you're 27 years of age. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, 27. Look, it's this ringing in my ears. It's been happening for… well, I dunno exactly how long, but a while now. It's really annoying, you know? Just a constant ring. It makes it hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: A constant ringing, you say. And how would you characterize this ringing, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: Um… it's not like a phone ringing, exactly. More like… a high-pitched whine, sometimes. Other times it’s more of a buzzing. It changes, you know? And it's usually in both ears, but sometimes it feels louder in the left one. It’s just… there. Always. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: It is… adequately descriptive. And has anything specific caused this ringing, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: To be honest? No, not really. I mean, I work as a waiter, so I'm around loud music sometimes, but… I've been doing that for years. And it didn't just start after a loud night. I think it slowly got worse. I’m divorced too, if that matters? A lot of stress last year, I guess. I really don’t know what brought it on.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly contribute to… various symptoms. And you said this developed gradually?
PATIENT: Yeah, gradually. It wasn’t like bam, one day it was there. It just… slowly got louder and more noticeable. Like, at first I barely noticed it, just when things were really quiet. Now, I hear it all the time. Even when I’m trying to sleep. That's the worst part. It keeps me up.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this ringing been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. Maybe a little bit of dizziness sometimes, but I dunno if that’s related. I get tired easily, but I’ve always been a bit tired. Nothing major, nothing I’d really point to as being because of the ringing. No pain or anything like that. Just… the ringing. And being really annoyed by it, haha.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of ear infections, exposure to loud noises outside of your work, or any family history of hearing loss or tinnitus?
PATIENT: Ear infections? Not really, when I was a kid maybe one or two, nothing serious. Loud noises… I used to go to a few concerts, years ago. Nothing crazy. Family history… my grandfather on my mum’s side was a bit hard of hearing, yeah. But he was old, you know? It was just old age, I think. I don't know about tinnitus specifically. No one ever talked about it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief examination of your ears. I'll need to look inside to rule out any obvious causes, such as wax buildup or infection. If you’ll please have a seat.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. Sounds good. Hopefully it's not anything too bad. This ringing is really getting to me.
DOCTOR: I observe some cerumen—earwax—present in both canals, but no signs of infection or structural abnormalities. The tympanic membranes appear intact. "Tympanic membranes normal bilaterally. Cerumen present in both external auditory canals." The examination doesn’t reveal any immediate cause for your tinnitus, Mr. Dhanoa. We'll need to consider further testing to determine the underlying reason.
PATIENT: Okay, good to know it’s not something… obvious. What kind of testing are we talking about? And how long will that take? I got work tomorrow, you know. I really need to figure this out quickly.
DOCTOR: The standard procedure is an audiogram, a hearing test, to assess your hearing sensitivity at various frequencies. It’s a non-invasive procedure, usually takes about 30-45 minutes. However, given your work schedule, scheduling may be… difficult. The clinic's audiologist is booked for the next week. "Recommend audiogram. Scheduling limitations." In the meantime, I can offer some general recommendations to minimize potential aggravation. Have you considered using earplugs in loud environments, such as your workplace?
PATIENT: Ugh, a week? Seriously? That’s a long time to just… live with this ringing. Okay, fine. A week it is, I guess. Earplugs… yeah, I’ve tried a few times, but they’re uncomfortable. I end up taking them out. Is there really nothing else I can do? Like, any medicine or something to at least help with the noise? I’m starting to get headaches from concentrating so hard to hear.
DOCTOR: There are no medications specifically proven to eliminate tinnitus, Mr. Dhanoa. Some patients find relief with white noise machines or tinnitus retraining therapy, but these are typically managed by specialists. Addressing underlying stress and anxiety is also important. "Discussed lack of definitive treatment options. Recommended stress management." As for the headaches, over-the-counter pain relievers may provide temporary relief. However, chronic headaches warrant further investigation. I’ll write you a referral for a neurological consultation, just to rule out any other potential causes. It's best to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay, a referral… that’s… something, I guess. So, wait a week for the hearing test, try earplugs even though they're uncomfortable, and see a neurologist. That’s a lot. And stress management… easier said than done when you're trying to hear people talk, you know? Look, I appreciate you trying to help, but is this… common? Like, is this something a lot of people deal with? And will it ever go away? I just need to know if I’m going to be stuck with this ringing forever. Honestly, it’s really stressing me out.
DOCTOR: Tinnitus is, unfortunately, quite common, affecting approximately 15% of the adult population. The causes are diverse, ranging from noise exposure to age-related hearing loss, and, as we've discussed, sometimes the precise cause remains elusive. "Patient anxious regarding tinnitus. Reassured regarding prevalence." As for whether it will resolve… that is difficult to predict. In some cases, tinnitus is temporary, while in others, it becomes a chronic condition. The audiogram will help us determine the extent of any hearing loss and guide further management. I understand your anxiety, Mr. Dhanoa. However, dwelling on the potential for a permanent condition will only exacerbate your stress. We will proceed with the appropriate investigations and develop a plan accordingly. Here is the referral to the neurologist, and the information regarding the audiogram appointment. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything. Just… a week, huh? Okay. Thanks, Doctor. I guess I’ll… see what the tests say. .
