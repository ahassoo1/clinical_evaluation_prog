DOCTOR: Hi Jailenne, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Georgiou, nice to meet you too! Well, I’ve been getting chills lately, and it’s a bit worrying me. It’s not like a cold chill, you know? More… random.
DOCTOR: Okay, “random chills” – that’s helpful. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm, okay. Let me think… They just come and go. I could be perfectly fine, sitting and watching TV, and then suddenly I’m shivering. It doesn’t seem to be linked to being cold, because I’ll be warm enough. And it doesn't last long, maybe five to ten minutes, then it’s gone. It’s happened maybe… three or four times in the last week? I’m not sure, to be honest, I haven’t been keeping track.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four times in the last week, lasting five to ten minutes, and not related to temperature. That's good information. Do you notice anything else happening when you get these chills?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Let me think. No, not really. I don’t feel sick otherwise. No fever, no cough, no sore throat… Just the chills. Sometimes I feel a little tired afterwards, but I'm usually pretty tired anyway, if I'm honest. Work's been busy. But it's not like a with the tiredness, it's more like… it makes the tiredness a bit worse, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, no other accompanying symptoms like fever or cough, and it seems to exacerbate existing fatigue. And you mentioned work has been busy - what kind of work do you do, Jailenne?
PATIENT: I’m a Health Education Specialist. Basically, I go around and teach people about staying healthy – nutrition, exercise, things like that. It’s a lot of being on my feet and talking, and a lot of paperwork. It can be stressful, keeping everything organised, and making sure people actually take the information on board, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds like it could be quite demanding! Okay, let's see if we can get a better picture of what’s going on. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… Other changes? Let me think… Oh! Actually, yeah. I've been a bit more thirsty than usual, I think. Not like, constantly parched, but I'm definitely reaching for water more often. And maybe… losing my appetite a little bit? It’s hard to say for sure, because I'm not a big eater anyway. But food just doesn’t seem as appealing as it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst and a decreased appetite. That's helpful. Now, thinking a little broader, have you had any changes in your weight recently – either gaining or losing?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, actually. I think I’ve lost a little bit of weight. Not a lot, maybe a couple of pounds? I haven't weighed myself properly in a while, to be honest, but my clothes feel a little looser than they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we've got random chills, increased thirst, decreased appetite, and some weight loss. Now, let’s go through some general health questions. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty good with most things.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a multivitamin occasionally, if I remember. Nothing regularly. I try to get most of what I need from my diet, but I'm not always the best at that, haha.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was ages ago and I recovered fine. And I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, things like that. Nothing major since then. Oh, and I was divorced about two years ago, if that counts! It was a stressful time, but I’m doing okay now.
DOCTOR: I think we can safely say that divorce qualifies as a significant life event! But medically speaking, just the appendectomy and childhood illnesses. And how about your family – do any of your close relatives have any significant medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, my mum has type 2 diabetes. She’s been managing it for years now with medication and diet. And my grandfather, on my dad’s side, had heart disease. He needed a bypass operation a few years before he passed away. Nothing else really that I can think of. My dad's pretty healthy, and my siblings are too.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. That’s good to know. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I used to drink a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven't really been drinking much lately. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm not really into that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Alright, Jailenne, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I'll check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also take a look at your throat and feel your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Blood pressure is 128/82, which is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything sounds and feels normal so far, but based on your symptoms – the chills, increased thirst, decreased appetite, weight loss, and family history of diabetes – I'd like to run some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. If that's what you think is best, then definitely. I'm happy to get the blood tests done. Hopefully it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a hemoglobin A1c test. The A1c test will give us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll be able to take the samples. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and eat small, regular meals even if you don’t feel very hungry. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that all makes sense. Stay hydrated and eat regularly… I can definitely try to do that. And wait for the results. No, I don't think I have any questions right now, actually. Thank you for listening to me, Dr. Georgiou. I feel a bit better just getting it checked out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I could help. It's always best to get things checked out when you're concerned. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. If you experience any worsening symptoms before your results are back, like fever, severe weakness, or blurred vision, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic or go to the emergency room. Otherwise, I'll see you back here in a few days to discuss the results. Have a good day!
