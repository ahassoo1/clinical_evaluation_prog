DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels like… a tight squeezing.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A tight squeezing sensation… that does sound concerning. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It usually happens when I’m walking, like up a hill, or if I’m carrying something heavy. Not always, but often. It goes away if I stop and rest for a bit. Maybe five, ten minutes. It doesn’t go all the way up to my jaw, but it’s close, in my neck sometimes. And my left arm feels a little… funny, not really pain, just… heavy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Sherion. Thank you for describing it so clearly. So, it seems to be brought on by exertion, relieved by rest, and you're noticing some discomfort in your neck and left arm. How long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started maybe… three weeks ago? At first, it was just once or twice, and I thought it was just because I did too much in the garden. But it’s been happening more often lately. I’d say… maybe four or five times a week now. It worries my husband, you know. He made me come in. He always worries!
DOCTOR: That’s good of him to encourage you to come in. It’s always best to get these things checked out. Four or five times a week is definitely something we should investigate. Besides the chest discomfort, neck, and arm, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I have been a little more tired than usual, I think. But I'm 62, Doctor! Maybe that’s just getting old? And… I get a little short of breath sometimes, but that might be the heat. It's been very hot lately, hasn't it? No fever, no cough, no swelling in my feet. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: You're right to point out those things, Sherion. It's good to be aware of what might be normal for you. Fatigue can have many causes, and the heat certainly can contribute to shortness of breath. But we still need to rule out anything serious. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, the doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, so I take a pill for that, every morning. Just one. And… my cholesterol, he said that was a little high too, but he didn’t put me on anything for it. He said I could try to eat better. I try to eat better, but… My husband is a good cook, and he likes to make rich food! No diabetes, no nothing else that I know of. I go to the doctor for check-ups every year.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and slightly elevated cholesterol. And you see your doctor annually for check-ups, that’s good. Do you know what medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… the little white pill… I think it’s… Lisinopril? Yes, that’s it! Lisinopril. I always have trouble remembering the names of things. My husband helps me with that. He keeps the list.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. Good. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbing a tree, but that was it. Just a cast for a few weeks. Nothing serious. I’ve been very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Sherion. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had heart trouble when she got older. She had to have a… a pacemaker, I think it was. And my father, he had diabetes. He had to take shots. He didn’t like that very much. And my older brother, he had high blood pressure too, like me. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Sherion. A family history of heart trouble and diabetes does increase your risk. Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not to penicillin, not to bee stings, nothing. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky that way too, I guess. I don’t take many pills, just the one for my blood pressure. I like to stay natural, you know? If I can avoid it, I don’t want to take a lot of medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Sherion. No known allergies, just Lisinopril for your blood pressure. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Please, go ahead. I just want to know what’s going on. This chest pain… it worries me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. I’m listening to your heart now. It sounds… regular, but a little bit fast. Now I'm listening to your lungs. They sound clear, no wheezing or crackling. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 82. And your pulse is 88, which is a little on the higher side. Your pulse feels regular, but a bit stronger than usual. Finally, I’m going to check your extremities. Your extremities feel warm and your pulses are present. I don’t see any swelling. Based on this initial exam, Sherion, your heart sounds are regular but somewhat fast, your blood pressure is elevated, and your pulse is a little high. These findings, along with your symptoms and family history, suggest that we need to investigate further. I would like to order an EKG, or electrocardiogram, to check your heart’s electrical activity, and some blood work, including a complete blood count and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… serious. An EKG and blood work… Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. Please. I just want to know what’s going on. Is it my heart? I'm a little scared. But yes, please do the tests. What does the EKG… how does it work? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be scared, Sherion. We're just being thorough to get a clear picture of what's going on. An EKG is a very simple and painless test. We'll place a few small stickers, called electrodes, on your chest, arms, and legs. These electrodes detect the electrical activity of your heart and send the information to a machine. It doesn't involve any needles or electricity being sent into your body, it just records the existing electrical signals. It takes just a few minutes. The blood work will involve a small sample of blood being taken from your arm, and it will help us check your cholesterol levels, as well as other important indicators of your overall health. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood and get you set up for the EKG. Do you have any questions about either of those tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained it very well, Doctor. Stickers and a little poke… I can handle that. It's just… my mother, she was very sick. And my brother, he had heart problems too. So, I get worried. But if you think these tests will help, then yes. Let’s do them. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. It's completely understandable to be worried, given your family history. We're going to take things one step at a time, and we'll get to the bottom of this together. I'll let the nurse know you're ready, and she'll be in shortly. While we're waiting, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. Just… thank you. For listening to me, and for not making me feel silly. Sometimes I worry too much, I think. I'll just sit here and wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. It's my job to listen, and I assure you, your concerns are never silly. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions at all while you're waiting. I’ll check back in with you as soon as the results are available.
