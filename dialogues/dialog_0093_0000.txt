DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… fine, I suppose. I came because my legs just suddenly feel like jelly. It started a few days ago, after I had a really nasty cold. Not that nasty, you understand, but enough. I just… can't quite explain it. They feel weak, you know? Like I could fall over if I’m not careful. It’s very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Like jelly," you say. That’s a very descriptive way to put it, Ms. Firestone. And it began a few days after a cold, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. A few days. Not immediately with the cold, mind you. I felt better from the cold, and then this started. Honestly, I thought it would just… go away on its own. But it hasn't. And I do have a trip planned, you see. A very important one. It wouldn’t be good to be stuck somewhere.
DOCTOR: I see. And you mentioned this trip is important. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, it's a tour I'm leading, of course. I’m a tour guide, you know. Very reputable. It’s to… well, it doesn't matter where exactly. It's a small group, discerning clientele. They expect a certain level of… competence. And I can’t very well lead a tour if I can barely walk, can I? It's scheduled for next week. I really need to be on my feet.
DOCTOR: That certainly adds to the concern, Ms. Firestone. It’s good to know the timing of this issue relative to your trip. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you describe the weakness in more detail?
PATIENT: Well, it's… both legs, equally. It’s not like one is worse than the other. And it's not constant. Sometimes it feels almost normal, and then other times… well, like I said, jelly. It’s more noticeable when I’ve been standing for a while. Or if I try to go up steps. And… it’s hard to explain. It's not painful, exactly. Just… gone. Like the strength just isn’t there. Do you follow? It’s quite frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I follow perfectly, Ms. Firestone. Both legs, intermittent, more noticeable with standing and stairs, and not associated with pain. That’s very helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven’t felt sick, other than the cold, of course. No numbness or tingling. No fever, no aches… I haven’t dropped anything, haven’t stumbled… well, not badly. I suppose I’ve felt a little more tired than usual, but that could be anything, really. I do a lot, you know? Always on the go. It’s probably just that. I really don’t think it's much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And regarding your past medical history, Ms. Firestone, do you have any chronic conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. My blood pressure is always a little high, the doctor told me, but nothing that requires medication. And… well, I had a divorce, if that counts as a medical condition. A very stressful experience, I assure you. But otherwise, I'm quite healthy. I eat reasonably well, although I do enjoy a good glass of wine. And I get plenty of exercise, leading tours and all. Really, I think it’s just a temporary thing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Firestone. It sounds like you generally maintain a healthy lifestyle. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single surgery. I’ve always been lucky that way. And no hospital stays. I’ve always been able to handle things on my own. That is, until this. Honestly, I find all this questioning a bit… unnecessary. I just want to know if it’s safe for me to go on this tour. That’s all. It’s a very important tour, you understand. People are relying on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns and your desire to know if it's safe for your trip, Ms. Firestone. I assure you, I’m asking these questions to ensure I have a complete picture of your health so I can give you the best possible advice. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… I take a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if I’m feeling a bit achy, I’ll take ibuprofen. That's about it. Nothing regular, really. Just the basics. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. It always has side effects, you know? And frankly, I don’t think a few vitamins and painkillers are relevant to this leg weakness. It's just… peculiar. A temporary setback, I’m sure. It has to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none. Not a single allergy. I’ve always been quite robust, you see. I can eat anything, take anything. Really, I don’t think allergies have anything to do with this. It’s simply a weakness in my legs, after a cold. It’s not complicated. Honestly, Doctor, are you going to examine me, or just keep asking questions? I do have a schedule, you know. This tour… well, it's very important.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Ms. Firestone. I apologize if the questions seem excessive; I want to rule out any potential underlying causes. Now, I would like to perform a quick physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs, as well as listen to your heart and lungs. Will that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes, alright. Get on with it then. But please, be quick. I really don’t have all day. And I do hope you’ll tell me everything is fine and I can go on this tour. It really is… crucial. Don’t poke around too much, though. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. I will be as thorough yet gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, if you could just extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather… undignified. I lead tours, you know? I'm used to being in charge, not lying here like a… a specimen. Get it over with quickly, please. And don’t pull on them, I’m rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone, your range of motion appears normal. However, I am noticing some slight weakness in your legs when you resist my force. It’s subtle, but present. And your reflexes are a little diminished. Your sensation appears intact. Now, could you please sit on the edge of the table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Weakness, you say? Diminished reflexes? Honestly, Doctor, this is concerning. This has to be temporary. I simply cannot be sidelined for a tour. The clients… they’ll be so disappointed. And my reputation! It will be ruined. Is there anything you can give me? A shot? A pill? Something to make it all go away? Surely there's something. Don't tell me it's something serious, please. I don't have time for serious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your concerns and the importance of this tour. While the weakness is present, it’s not severe. However, diminished reflexes, combined with the weakness after a recent cold, warrants further investigation to rule out any potential neurological causes. It's unlikely to be something immediately life-threatening, but it's important to be thorough. I would like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, and inflammatory markers. I also recommend a nerve conduction study to assess the function of the nerves in your legs. In the meantime, I suggest postponing your tour for a week, if possible, to allow us to get these tests done and determine the underlying cause of your weakness. It’s best to address this before embarking on a physically demanding trip. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Postpone the tour? Postpone the tour? Are you serious? Absolutely not. That is completely out of the question. My clients have been planning this for months! The arrangements are all made! The hotels, the restaurants… everything! Do you have any idea the chaos that would cause? And my reputation… it would be devastated. Blood tests? Nerve conduction studies? That will take days! By then, the tour will be over! No, Doctor. I appreciate your concern, but I simply cannot do that. Is there anything – anything – you can give me now? A muscle relaxant? A vitamin injection? Something to tide me over until I return? I'll rest when I get back, I promise. Just something to get me through the next week. Please, Doctor, you have to understand. This is very important.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your concerns and the pressure you're under. However, prescribing medication without a clear diagnosis would be irresponsible. It’s crucial to identify the underlying cause of your weakness before starting any treatment. Since you are so strongly opposed to postponing the tour, and recognizing the potential disruption it would cause, I can offer a compromise. I will prescribe a multivitamin with B12 to address any potential deficiencies. I also recommend you take ibuprofen as needed for any muscle aches. However, I must strongly advise you to monitor your symptoms closely. If the weakness worsens, if you experience any numbness, tingling, or difficulty walking, you must seek immediate medical attention, regardless of the tour schedule. I also strongly recommend that you inform a colleague or trusted friend about your condition and ask them to be vigilant during the tour. I’m also going to provide you with a list of warning signs to watch out for. It's important to prioritize your health, Ms. Firestone, even amidst your commitments. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A multivitamin and ibuprofen… that’s… something, I suppose. Better than nothing. And I’ll tell my assistant, Elena, to keep an eye on me. She’s very efficient. Very well. I’ll take the multivitamin and the ibuprofen. And I’ll inform Elena. But I’m warning you, Doctor, if this doesn’t work, I’m holding you responsible. My reputation is on the line here. I suppose that’s all then? I have a great deal to do – packing, confirming arrangements… and reassuring my clients, who will undoubtedly be alarmed if they hear I was feeling unwell. Is there anything else? Or may I go? I really must be going now.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Firestone, that is all for now. I’ve documented my findings and the plan we’ve discussed. I’m sending the prescription to your usual pharmacy. Please, do not hesitate to seek immediate medical attention if your symptoms worsen. I’ve included a list of warning signs to watch for. Your health is paramount, Ms. Firestone. I wish you a safe and enjoyable tour. And please, do keep me updated on your condition. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care.
PATIENT: Very well. I shall keep you updated, if necessary. And I sincerely hope it won’t be.
