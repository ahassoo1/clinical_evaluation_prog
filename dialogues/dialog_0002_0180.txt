DOCTOR: Hi Hedy, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day. Just…tired. Really tired. And I…eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I need it sometimes. It's stupid, I know. Don't ask me why, I just do. Can we just…get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. No problem at all. We'll take things at your pace. “Really tired” and…a craving for dirt, you said?
PATIENT: Craving for…well, yeah. Dirt, clay, stuff like that. It’s embarrassing. And it's getting worse. I used to just…pick at it. Now I… I find myself actively looking for it. It's not like I’m going out of my way, but if I see it… I gotta have it. Honestly, I don’t even know why I’m telling you this. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Hedy. You're here, and that’s the important thing. It doesn't sound ridiculous to me. Sometimes our bodies do strange things, and it's good to figure out why. This craving for dirt…when did you first notice it, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Oh, geez. Years. Years ago, I guess. Maybe… ten years? More? Honestly, time all kinda blurs together. It started small, like…a little taste here and there when I was gardening. Now… now it's… frequent. Not every day, but… often enough to be worrying. My late husband, bless his soul, he’d give me funny looks. Said I was acting like a goat. He’s been gone five years now. Doesn't matter anyway. It's not like anyone understands.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your husband, Hedy. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for a long time. And you're right to want to get it checked out. This craving for dirt - is it associated with any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…feeling sick? No, not really. Just…tired. Really, really tired. Like I haven’t slept in a week, even when I have. And…sometimes my stomach feels a bit off. But that could be anything, right? I eat pretty bad, to be honest. Mostly just…whatever's easy. I don’t have the energy to cook. Oh! And sometimes I get… headaches. Dull ones. But again, who doesn't get headaches? I’m an old woman. Things ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, a bit of stomach upset, and occasional dull headaches… We’ll try to figure out what’s going on. Now, thinking about the tiredness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Pretty much. Some days are worse than others, sure. But… it's always there. Like a weight. I used to be able to…do things. Work, you know? I was a CNC programmer, good one too! Now… I mostly just sit. Watch TV. Try not to fall asleep. It's… embarrassing. I feel useless. And the energy thing... I really don't get why I am so tired. I sleep enough hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant tiredness despite getting enough sleep. That’s definitely something we need to look into. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history. Honestly, I barely remember what I had for breakfast. I've been to doctors before, of course. For… things. The usual old lady stuff. Arthritis, high blood pressure... but nothing serious. Nothing they ever really fixed. Just pills to…manage it, I guess. I don’t really keep track of what they give me. They all kinda feel the same after a while. No, I don’t think I’ve been diagnosed with anything major. Honestly, I just try to ignore things until they get really bad, then go get a pill. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad, Hedy, it just makes things a little harder to figure out sometimes. We'll work through it. Okay, arthritis and high blood pressure. Are you still taking medication for those conditions?
PATIENT: Yes. For the blood pressure, anyway. A little white pill. I take it every morning. The arthritis… not so much. It hurts, sure, but the pills made me feel… funny. So I stopped. My primary doctor... well, she kinda just shrugged when I told her. Said it wasn't a big deal. I haven't bothered with it since. It's mostly just in my hands. Makes it hard to… well, never mind. Doesn't matter. I don’t really do much with my hands anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're currently taking medication for high blood pressure, but stopped taking medication for arthritis due to side effects. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! I had my gallbladder out. A long time ago. Maybe… twenty years? More? It was… unpleasant. But I recovered. Other than that… I don't think so. No. Nothing else. Just the gallbladder. They told me I had stones. Sounded painful. It was painful. They took it out and… that was it. Nothing fancy. I'm not the type for fancy medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, no other surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… is there any history of medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ugh, family. My mother… she had the heart trouble. Passed when she was young. My father… he just… faded away. Old age, I guess. Lots of aches and pains, like me. My brother, he's still alive, but we don’t really talk. He’s…different. Doesn’t really do much either. As for medical conditions… I think there was some… diabetes on my mother’s side? Maybe? Honestly, I never really paid attention. They didn't talk about that sort of thing much. It's not something you brought up. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart trouble and possible diabetes on your mother's side. We'll make a note of that. Now, I'm going to ask about your lifestyle a little bit. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband used to, but he quit years ago. And alcohol? No. I don't like it. Makes me feel sick. My mother never drank either, so I never really got the taste for it. Honestly, I don’t really socialize much anymore. Just sit at home, mostly. Watch TV. Maybe read a book if I'm feeling up to it. It’s a quiet life. A very quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or alcohol. That’s good to know. Finally, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. Not that I know of. I get itchy sometimes, but I figured that was just old age. I haven’t had any really bad reactions to medications before. My primary doctor… well, she just gave me whatever she thought was best. I never really questioned it. No, I don't think I’m allergic to anything. Unless you count dust, maybe. But who isn’t allergic to dust? Honestly, I'm probably forgetting something, but I can't think of it right now. Can we just be done? I'm really starting to feel tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Hedy. Thank you for answering all those questions. I know it’s a lot, and I appreciate your patience. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with fatigue for a long time, and that craving for dirt is… unusual. Based on what you've told me, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and order some blood tests. The blood tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions, like iron deficiency or other vitamin deficiencies, which could be contributing to your tiredness. And the craving for dirt… that’s something called pica, and it can sometimes be a sign of iron deficiency, but we need to investigate further. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Honestly. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. The sooner I know, the sooner I can go home and…sleep. Yes, do the tests. Blood, exam… whatever you need to do. Just…be quick, okay? And tell me what's wrong, plain and simple. I don't understand all that medical mumbo jumbo. Plain and simple, Doctor. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Hedy. Plain and simple. That’s what I’ll do. Okay, let's start with a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your hands and skin. It won't take long. Your heart sounds a little fast, but nothing too concerning at this point. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but consistent with your previous diagnosis. And your hands… they do look a little dry and cracked. Okay, I’m going to check your fingernails now. Sometimes, changes in the nails can give us clues. They look a little brittle. And I see some…discoloration under a few of them. Not alarming, but something to note. Okay, that's all for the physical exam part. Now, I’m going to get the lab requisition for the blood tests. It will be a standard blood count, iron levels, and a few other basic tests. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Sounds…fine. Just get it done. Blood tests, whatever. I hope it doesn't take too long. I really just want to go home. And don’t give me a lecture about washing my hands or eating healthier. I know. Everyone always tells me. Honestly. I just want to sleep. Yes, do the tests. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Hedy. No lectures, I promise. Just getting the information we need. Here’s the requisition form. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll draw a few vials of blood. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – which usually takes a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe fatigue – please call the clinic immediately. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Blood tests, follow-up appointment. Call if something bad happens. Yes, I got it. Honestly, it's all a bit much. But…fine. I'll go do the blood tests. Thank you, Doctor. Or… whatever. I’ll see you later. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Hedy. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask the lab technician if you have any questions. And please, get some rest. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
