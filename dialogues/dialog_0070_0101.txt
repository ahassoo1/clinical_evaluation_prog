DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it's this headache I've been gettin'. Right at the back of my head, you see? Been botherin' me for... oh, let me think... about a week now, maybe a little more. Not constant, comes and goes, but when it's here, it's a right nuisance.
DOCTOR: I see. A headache at the back of your head for approximately a week, coming and going. That is bothersome. Can you describe the headache for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it's not a throbbing pain, not like a migraine, thank goodness. It’s more of a… a dull ache, a pressure, really. Like someone’s tightened a band around my head. And sometimes it feels like it’s travelin’ up the back of my neck a little. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense? I try to rub it, but that doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Popova. A dull ache and pressure, sometimes radiating up your neck. And rubbing it doesn’t provide much relief. Is there anything that seems to trigger the headaches – anything you've noticed that makes them worse?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, I think so. When I’m bendin’ over for too long, doin’ nails, especially, it seems to get worse. I’m a manicurist, you see, and spend a lot of time lookin’ down. Also, if I get really stressed, like if a customer is bein’ difficult… that’ll bring one on, sure enough. But not every time, mind you. It’s a bit unpredictable, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. So bending over for extended periods, particularly with your work as a manicurist, and stress can seem to exacerbate the headaches. And it’s not consistently triggered, it's unpredictable. Have you noticed anything that relieves the headache, other than rubbing it?
PATIENT: Well… lying down helps a bit. Just restin' quiet, with my eyes closed. And a nice cup of chamomile tea sometimes takes the edge off. Not a cure, you understand, but it calms me down, and when I'm calmer, it doesn't seem quite as bad. My wife, bless her heart, sometimes gives me a gentle massage on my neck and shoulders, and that feels good for a little while too. But mostly, I just wait it out, hoping it'll pass.
DOCTOR: That's good to know – rest, chamomile tea, and a gentle massage offer some relief. Let’s talk a bit more about your overall health. Have you had any other symptoms along with the headaches – things like vision changes, dizziness, nausea, or any weakness or numbness?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, nothing like that. No changes to my vision, no dizziness or sickness, and my hands and legs are workin’ just fine. I can still do a perfect French manicure, you know! Just the headache, really. And a little bit of tiredness sometimes, but I'm eighty-seven years old, Doctor, so a bit of tiredness is to be expected, I reckon. I sleep alright, though. Not as much as I used to, but alright.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Popova. No associated symptoms like vision changes, dizziness, nausea, or weakness is reassuring. And you sleep alright, despite being a bit more tired than you used to – perfectly understandable at eighty-seven. Now, have you ever had headaches like this before, or is this a new experience for you?
PATIENT: This is new, Doctor. I’ve had headaches in my life, sure, everyone does. But they were usually just a bit of tension, from worryin’ or not gettin’ enough sleep. Nothing like this pressure at the back of my head. This is different. I thought maybe it was just old age catchin’ up with me, but it’s been goin’ on long enough now that I figured I ought to get it checked out. And my wife, she insisted! She's a sensible woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: That's wise of you to come in, and your wife sounds very sensible indeed. Since this is a new type of headache for you, and it's been persistent, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s perfectly alright. I’ve got nothin’ to hide! Go ahead, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I might be a bit slow gettin’ up from the chair, though, just a warnin'. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Take your time, Mr. Popova. I’ll be gentle. Blood pressure is 140/90, a little elevated but not dramatically so. Pulse is 78 and regular. No tenderness to palpation on the scalp. There is some mild muscle tension in the upper trapezius muscles on both sides of your neck, and slight restriction in the range of motion when looking up and to the left. Neurological exam is grossly intact – your strength, reflexes, and sensation appear normal. No signs of fever. I’m listening to your heart and lungs now; they sound clear.
PATIENT: Hmm... Well, that doesn't sound too bad, does it? Just a bit of tightness in my neck, you say? I suppose I do spend a lot of time hunched over those nails. My wife always tells me to sit up straight, but it’s hard work when you’re focusin’ on tiny details. I’m glad you checked everything, though. Makes me feel better knowin' it’s not somethin’ serious. What do you reckon it is, Doctor? Just old age and bad posture?
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound like anything acutely alarming, Mr. Popova, which is reassuring. Based on your description and the exam findings, it's most likely a tension headache, potentially exacerbated by your work posture and occasional stress. The muscle tension in your neck supports that. However, to rule out other possibilities, and given the new onset of these headaches, I’d like to order a simple blood test – just a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. That will help us identify any underlying inflammation or other issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A blood test, eh? Well, I’ve never been one to shy away from a bit of needle-prickin’. If it’ll put my mind at ease, then yes, absolutely. I trust your judgment, Doctor. My wife will be pleased you’re bein’ thorough. Where do I go to get that done? And how long will it take to get the results? I’ve got a few customers booked in next week I wouldn’t want to cancel.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall, Room 3. The nurse will take a small sample of blood. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. The results typically come back within 2-3 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss the findings and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, as needed. Also, I’d like you to focus on maintaining good posture while you work – try to sit upright and take frequent breaks to stretch your neck and shoulders. Heat or ice packs can also be helpful. Do you have any questions about that, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen… I’ve got some acetaminophen at home, that’ll do for now. And I’ll try my best with the posture, though it’s easier said than done when you’re dealin’ with tiny things! And heat… yes, my wife makes a lovely warm compress, I’ll ask her to make me one. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment, Doctor. Thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. And thank you for takin' the time to listen to an old man’s worries. I appreciate it. I’ll go get that blood test done now.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Popova. It’s my pleasure. And don’t hesitate to come back if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take your time getting to the lab, and please let the nurse know if you feel lightheaded or unsteady at any point. I will see you in a few days.
PATIENT: Right then. Thank you again, Doctor. I will. Bye bye to you too!
