DOCTOR: Hi Carmaleta, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so… I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be… easy. My husband… well, he was a good man, and we always just… assumed it would happen. But now… I don’t want any problems, you know? Just… normal. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. It’s very common to want things to be straightforward, and it’s smart to be proactive. “Easy” isn't always guaranteed, but we can definitely do some things to increase your chances and make sure everything is working as it should. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? Oh, goodness. Honestly, I don't really keep track. They come… when they come. It’s been… a little irregular since… well, you know. Not terribly irregular, just… not like clockwork. I suppose they’re about… every month-ish? Is that helpful? Honestly, I never thought I’d need to know this stuff so precisely.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Carmaleta. Many people don't track cycles unless they're trying to conceive. “Month-ish” is a good starting point! Roughly how long would you say they typically are – from the first day of one period to the first day of the next?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, this is why I don't like doctors. All these questions! I don't know! Maybe… five to seven days? Between periods, I guess… two weeks? Three? It really varies. It’s not like I sit around with a calendar, marking things. Look, is this important? Are you going to tell me something’s wrong already?
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s not about anything being wrong yet, Carmaleta. It’s just information, like pieces of a puzzle. Knowing your cycle length helps us understand the timing of ovulation, which is when you’re most fertile. A typical cycle is around 28 days, but it varies a lot. Five to seven days for your period and then varying between two to three weeks sounds… a bit wide. It’s good to get a better sense of it. Do you experience any pain with your periods?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. Like, cramps. Normal cramps, I guess. Nothing I can’t handle. A little ibuprofen, and I’m fine. It’s not like I’m doubled over in agony. And sometimes… sometimes they're heavier than others. Does it matter if they're heavy? Honestly, I just want to know if I’m going to have trouble getting pregnant, not catalog every little thing about my period!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. You're right, we don't need to catalog everything, but knowing about the cramps and heavier flows does help us build a clearer picture. Heavy flows can sometimes indicate certain things, but it's not necessarily a cause for concern. To get a better understanding of your overall health, and rule out any potential issues that could impact fertility, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had the usual childhood things, you know, measles, mumps… nothing serious. And… I had a fibroid removed, maybe ten years ago? It wasn't big, the doctor said it wouldn't cause any problems, and it didn't. Other than that… I don't really get sick. I eat pretty well, I think. Look, is this fibroid thing going to matter? Because if it is, I don't know if I want to keep doing this. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know about the fibroid. Ten years ago is helpful information. While having a fibroid can sometimes affect fertility, the fact that it was small and removed a long time ago is a good sign. It’s unlikely to be a major issue, but we will definitely factor it in. To get a complete picture, could you tell me about any surgeries you’ve had, besides the fibroid removal?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I need a medical degree just to talk to you. Let me think… nothing else major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I suppose. And… oh, I had a C-section with my… with my daughter. That was… a long time ago now. Everything was fine, though. I recovered quickly. Is that going to be a problem? It was a perfectly normal delivery, as far as C-sections go.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils and a C-section. That’s helpful information, Carmaleta. C-sections can sometimes be a factor, but a previous C-section doesn't automatically mean you won't be able to conceive or carry a pregnancy successfully. We'll just want to consider it. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Honestly, my mother died young, of… something. I don't really remember. Cancer, maybe? And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And diabetes, maybe? Everyone in my family was… old, you know? They all just died of old age. It wasn't like anyone had any… weird illnesses. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to family history. It’s not like it's going to help me get pregnant now.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Carmaleta. It’s common not to have a detailed family medical history. Knowing about your mother’s illness and your father’s high blood pressure and diabetes is helpful, though. Just a few more questions, and then we can talk about physical exams and possible next steps. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen, when I need it. And… a multivitamin, sometimes. I forget to take it, honestly. It's just one of those things. Nothing else. I try to eat healthy, so I don't really feel like I need anything. Is that going to matter? Look, are you going to ask me about… everything I’ve ever done?
DOCTOR: No, Carmaleta, I promise I won't ask about everything you've ever done! Just trying to get a complete picture. Ibuprofen and a multivitamin, that's good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I eat everything. I've never had an allergic reaction to anything in my life. Honestly, I think I'm perfectly healthy. This is all just… a waste of time. I should have just gone and gotten a baby, instead of sitting here answering all these questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It can feel like a lot of questions, but it’s important to rule things out and get a good baseline before we move forward. It helps us make informed decisions. Okay, I think I have enough information for now. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, including checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a pelvic exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, the sooner this is done, the better. But if it's going to be uncomfortable, just tell me. I don't want any surprises. And I have an appointment later this afternoon, so please be quick.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. I’ll explain everything as I go, and we’ll take it at your pace. I’ll let you know if anything might be a little uncomfortable. First, let’s check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, just relax your arm for me… good. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope… take a few deep breaths… good. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, if you’re comfortable, we can move on to the pelvic exam. We'll assess your uterus, ovaries, and cervix. It might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Painful? You said it wouldn’t be painful! Now you’re saying it might be? Honestly, I don’t like this at all. Look, can’t you just… give me a pill or something? Skip the exam. I’ve had enough poking and prodding for one day. I just want to get pregnant, not have a medical investigation!
DOCTOR: I apologize for the confusion, Carmaleta. I didn’t mean to cause any alarm. “Painful” was a poor choice of words. It might feel some pressure or discomfort, but it shouldn’t be excruciating. Many women experience a bit of unease during a pelvic exam, and it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. You’re right, we could discuss other options. However, a pelvic exam allows me to directly assess your reproductive organs and identify any potential issues that might be impacting fertility. It’s the best first step to get a clearer picture. But I absolutely respect your wishes. We can skip the exam today. However, I strongly recommend getting some baseline blood work done to check hormone levels and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood work… I suppose that’s okay. As long as it doesn’t involve a lot of poking. And it has to be quick. I have a busy schedule, you know. I don't have time to sit around waiting for results. And honestly, if the results come back normal, I don't want to waste any more time on this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. We’ll keep it as quick and efficient as possible. The blood work will involve a standard set of tests to assess your hormone levels, thyroid function, and general health. It shouldn’t take long. I'll write you a lab order now. The results typically take 3-5 business days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them when they come back. In the meantime, if you’re trying to conceive, it’s helpful to take a daily prenatal vitamin with folic acid. And tracking your menstrual cycles, even roughly, can be beneficial. Do you have any questions about the blood work or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No. I think that's enough questions for one day. Just… get it over with. And please, don't call me if the results are normal. Just send me a message or something. I don't need a lecture about healthy habits. I’ve lived a long life, I think I know what I’m doing. Alright. Thank you for your time, Dr. Georgiou. I’ll… get the blood work done. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carmaleta. I understand your concerns, and I’ll respect your wishes. I’ll send you a message with the results once they’re available. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the meantime. And I wish you all the best in your journey to conceive. Have a good afternoon.
