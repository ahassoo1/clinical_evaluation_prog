DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Popova, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Aldine Popova. But please, call me Aldine. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Doctor… Overgaard, isn’t it? I was told you were the one to see about these headaches.
DOCTOR: Overgaard, yes. Ledarius Overgaard. Headaches, you say. Well, “headaches” is a rather broad term, isn’t it?
PATIENT: You're not wrong there, son. It’s right at the back of my head, feels like a tight band squeezing. Not a pounding, more of a… pressure. It’s been happening on and off for a few weeks now, but it's getting a little worse each time. Makes it hard to concentrate when I’m doing nails, you know? My customers don’t like it when I'm shaky.
DOCTOR: Nails, you say?
PATIENT: That's right. Manicurist and pedicurist, been doing it for… well, close to sixty years now. Started when I was a young man in Kingston, Jamaica. Good money, always kept me busy. Still does, mostly. But this headache… it's worrying me. Never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Sixty years... impressive. And you've never experienced headaches at all before?
PATIENT: No, not like this. I get a little tension sometimes, you know, from bending over all day. A little bit of ache in my shoulders, nothing a good rub couldn’t fix. But this is different. It's right at the back of my head, a constant pressure. And it seems to be… well, it's hard to explain. It gets worse when I’m really focused on something, like doing a complicated nail design. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It's... marginally helpful. Focus exacerbating the pain... right. Do you have any other symptoms alongside these headaches?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, sometimes my vision gets a little blurry when it's really bad. Not all the time, just for a few seconds at a time. And I’ve been feeling a bit tired lately, more tired than usual. I just figured it was my age, you know? 87 years will do that to a man. But maybe it's connected? It's hard to tell. I don't want to bother you with a lot of old man complaints.
DOCTOR: "Old man complaints?
PATIENT: Heh. Just an expression, Doctor. I don’t mean to take up your time. I just want to get to the bottom of this headache. It’s starting to interfere with my work, and my customers are very particular. And my wife, bless her heart, she worries something awful when I'm not myself. She keeps offering me tea, which is nice, but it doesn't seem to be doing the trick.
DOCTOR: Right. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness? No, not that I’ve noticed. My hands are steady enough for nail work, as you can see. I haven’t dropped anything, haven't stumbled… nothing like that. I walk to work every day, about ten blocks, and I manage just fine. I might be a little slower than I used to be, but that’s just age, like I said. Everything still works, you know? Just a little… creaky sometimes. Is weakness something I should be looking out for? You’re starting to worry me a bit now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's important to rule things out. And, frankly, given your age and this new onset of symptoms... it is concerning. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major. I had the flu a few times, like everyone does. And my knees started acting up when I was in my sixties, so I saw a specialist back in Kingston. He said it was arthritis, gave me some cream and told me to take it easy. Other than that… I’ve always been a healthy man, really. Good diet, plenty of sunshine. I don't drink much, and I've never smoked a day in my life. My wife always said I had strong constitution. She’s a good woman, that one. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Arthritis… and no other significant medical issues. Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed them. I always said, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I had a good friend, he went in for a hip replacement… never quite recovered properly. That scared me off, to be honest. I'd rather live with a little discomfort than risk something going wrong under the knife. I believe in letting nature take its course, as much as possible. Does that answer your question, Doctor? I hope I'm not rambling too much. I get a bit anxious when I'm at the doctor's office.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Right. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a bit… complicated. My mother, she lived to be 95, very strong woman. But her brother, he had something… with his mind, I think. He spent some time in a hospital, but we didn't talk about it much. It was a sensitive subject. And my father, he had high blood pressure, but he didn’t take care of himself. Too much rum, not enough rest. I always tried to be better than that. My wife's family, they were mostly healthy, as far as I know. Nothing serious that I can recall. Does that give you anything, Doctor? It’s hard to remember everything from so long ago.
DOCTOR: A history of potential neurological issues and hypertension… alright. Let's discuss your current medications and any allergies you might have.
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Not a single one. I pride myself on that. Always said I didn't want to be reliant on pills. As for allergies… well, I get a bit of a sniffle when the roses bloom in the spring, but that's just a mild reaction. Nothing serious. Never had any bad reactions to food or anything like that. I can eat anything, praise God. I still enjoy a good Jamaican patty now and then, though my wife tells me to go easy on the spice. Does that answer your question, Doctor? I'm starting to feel a little tired now, to be honest. This has been a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: No medications, no significant allergies… right. Alright. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic neurological assessment and check your vitals. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. My old bones aren’t as flexible as they used to be, you know. I’m ready when you are. Just hoping you can figure out what's causing this headache. It’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 160 over 95. A bit elevated. Now, let's check your pulse. 88, regular. Alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… slightly irregular, but not alarming. Now, I need you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head. Eyes tracking normally. Now, I want you to close your eyes and tell me if I'm touching you. Sensation intact. Now, I want you to squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Grip is… adequate, but slightly weaker on the left side. Now, stand up and walk for me, heel-to-toe. Gait is… slightly unsteady. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are… slightly diminished. Alright. That’s enough for now.
PATIENT: That all felt alright, Doctor. A little wobbly when I was walking, but I put that down to my age. I'm not as steady on my feet as I used to be. So, what do you think? Is it something serious? You’re making me a little nervous now, to be honest. My wife is going to be worried sick if you tell me there's something wrong.
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, your blood pressure is significantly elevated. Your gait is unsteady, and your reflexes are diminished. Your grip strength is also weaker on the left side. While it’s possible these findings are age-related, the combination of symptoms, especially the unsteady gait and weakness, is concerning. Coupled with your recent headaches and blurry vision, I suspect there may be a neurological component to your condition. I cannot definitively diagnose you without further testing. We need to rule out a number of possibilities, including a stroke, a transient ischemic attack, or a more insidious neurological condition. I’m going to order a CT scan of your brain, an MRI, and a full blood work-up to assess your overall health. We will also need to monitor your blood pressure closely.
PATIENT: A stroke? Oh dear. My wife… she lost her brother to a stroke a few years back. It wasn't a pretty sight. CT scan… MRI… blood work… it sounds… serious. Will… will I be able to go home after the tests? And how long will it take to get the results? My wife… she needs me to help her with the garden. And I have a customer appointment on Friday… I… I don't know what to say. This is… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, I understand your anxiety, and it's perfectly natural to be concerned. The tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. A CT scan and MRI will give us a detailed view of your brain, allowing us to identify any potential abnormalities. The blood work will assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms. Regarding going home, yes, you will likely be able to go home after the tests, unless something unexpected is discovered. We will inform you immediately if any urgent intervention is required. As for the results, we should have them within 24 to 48 hours. I will personally review them and contact you as soon as possible to discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. For now, I recommend you avoid strenuous activity and take it easy. Do not drive. I will write you a prescription for a medication to help lower your blood pressure. It's essential to start taking it immediately. I understand you have a customer appointment on Friday. However, I strongly advise you to reschedule it until we have the results of the tests. Your health is the priority. I will also provide you with a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They specialize in these types of conditions and can provide expert guidance. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s clear. Reschedule the appointment… blood pressure medication… see a neurologist… It's all… a lot to remember. Could you… could you please write all of that down for me? My memory isn't what it used to be, and I don't want to forget anything. And… … what exactly is a neurologist? What will they do? Is it… is it something serious if I need to see a specialist?
DOCTOR: “Here you are, Mr. Popova. This outlines everything we discussed. The medication is Lisinopril, 10mg daily. Take it with food, and let me know if you experience any side effects, such as dizziness or a persistent cough. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in disorders of the brain and nervous system. They will conduct a more thorough neurological examination, review your medical history, and order additional tests if necessary. They can help determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. Needing to see a specialist does not necessarily mean it's something serious, Mr. Popova. It simply means that your condition requires the expertise of a specialist. It’s a precautionary measure to ensure you receive the best possible care. We need to rule out any potential underlying causes of your symptoms, and a neurologist is best equipped to do that. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with you for next week to discuss the test results and formulate a long-term plan. In the meantime, please contact me immediately if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headache, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you… thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. And for writing it down… it helps a lot. I’ll… I’ll reschedule the appointment. And I’ll start taking the medication right away. I… I just hope it’s nothing serious. My wife… she wouldn’t know what to do without me. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Popova. Follow the instructions carefully, and don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. We’ll be in touch. .
