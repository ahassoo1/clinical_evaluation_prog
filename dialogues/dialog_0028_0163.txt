DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Good to see you, I suppose. Now, you’re 85…yes. Let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Memmolo, it's good to meet you as well. I believe the receptionist mentioned a diet review? I’ve been…experimenting, shall we say, with some rather novel eating plans. And I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I commit to anything…too enthusiastically. It’s all rather silly, really, but one reads things, you know. And I have a bit of time on my hands these days.
DOCTOR: A diet review. Yes. People and their…fads. Right. So, these “novel eating plans”…can you be specific?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, the first one, I stumbled across in an old magazine – a rather yellowed copy, actually – advocated consuming only foods that are the colour blue. Blueberries, naturally, were a staple. And…plums, when one could find them. It was…limiting. And frankly, not terribly sustaining. Then, there was the one that involved a great deal of cabbage soup. An awful lot of cabbage soup. I lasted three days. It…affected the atmosphere, if you understand. And most recently, I attempted a diet based entirely on foods that were popular in 1935. It was surprisingly difficult to source proper jellied eels. It’s all rather ridiculous, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you’ve been…self-experimenting with restrictive diets. Blue foods, cabbage soup, and…historical cuisine. And you want my opinion. Look, Mr. Vantine, with all due respect, this sounds…highly illogical. And potentially unhealthy. Let’s skip the culinary adventures and get to the point. Have you noticed any actual symptoms?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, symptoms. Quite right. I suppose I was rather rambling about the eccentricities of it all. Well, a bit of fatigue, naturally, with the blue diet. And… a certain…social awkwardness, due to the, shall we say, pungent aroma following the cabbage soup regime. But lately… well, my joints have been a little stiff, and I’ve been feeling rather…lightheaded upon standing. Nothing drastic, mind you. Just…not quite as spry as usual. It’s probably just old age, to be honest, but my daughter insisted I come and see someone. She’s a worrier, that one.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, joint stiffness, lightheadedness…and your daughter is concerned. Very well. Let’s get some basics. Any known allergies?
PATIENT: None that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been rather robust, you see. I recall, as a young man, consuming vast quantities of shellfish on a trip to the coast. No ill effects whatsoever. And I’ve always been able to tolerate…well, just about anything, really. Except perhaps bureaucracy. That gives me a rash. But no food allergies, no. I've certainly never had a reaction to anything I've eaten. I did once attempt to eat a particularly spicy pepper on a dare, but that was purely self-inflicted discomfort, not an allergic response.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the one, Doctor. A low dose of…let me see…ramipril, I believe it is called. For my blood pressure. The doctor – a rather young man, actually – prescribed it a few years ago. I take it every morning with my tea. And I’ve been quite diligent about it, I assure you. No other medications, no vitamins, no supplements. Just the ramipril, and a rather large quantity of Earl Grey.
DOCTOR: Ramipril. Yes. And your blood pressure is…controlled, according to the records. Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your joints. Please lie back on the examination table. And try to relax, if you can.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. Happy to oblige. Although, I must confess, examination tables have never been my favourite piece of furniture. Rather cold, aren't they? Do let me know if I'm making a dreadful racket. I've always been rather… creaky. One of the drawbacks of a long life, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds…regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, but a little…decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Joints…tenderness in both knees, some crepitus. Range of motion…slightly limited. Reflexes…a little sluggish, but within normal limits. Alright, Mr. Vantine. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. Temperature is normal. Your exam shows some mild osteoarthritis in your knees, which is not unexpected at your age. The lightheadedness and fatigue could be due to a number of things. The fact you have been doing these restrictive diets is concerning.
PATIENT: Concerning, you say? I suspected as much, to be honest. It's all rather foolish, really. My daughter will be vindicated, I suppose. So, what do you recommend, Doctor? Should I cease these… culinary experiments immediately? And is there anything I can do about this osteoarthritis? It’s not particularly painful, but it's… disconcerting. And frankly, I rather enjoy a brisk walk.
DOCTOR: Yes, cease the diets immediately. They are providing no nutritional benefit and could be exacerbating your symptoms. As for the osteoarthritis…it’s a common condition. We can try some over-the-counter pain relief – ibuprofen or naproxen. And I recommend gentle exercise – walking is good, but don't overdo it. I'll also order some blood work to rule out anything else. Vitamin D levels, just to be safe. Frankly, Mr. Vantine, I think the best thing you can do is eat a balanced diet and get regular, moderate exercise. And leave the culinary adventures to the professionals. I'll send the blood work order to the lab and schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A balanced diet and moderate exercise… rather mundane, perhaps, but undoubtedly prudent. And I shall certainly heed your advice regarding the culinary experiments. No more blue foods, no more cabbage soup, and definitely no more jellied eels. I appreciate your… candour, Doctor. And thank you for confirming my daughter’s suspicions. She’ll be pleased. Two weeks sounds fine. And if I may ask, do you happen to know a good restaurant with a reliably balanced menu? Just in case.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Vantine, I'm a physician, not a concierge. I can recommend a diet plan, not a dining establishment. I'll have the nurse print out some information on healthy eating before you leave. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that will be all. I believe you’ve covered everything admirably. And I apologize for taking up your valuable time with my… eccentricities. Thank you again for your guidance. And I shall endeavour to be a more sensible patient in the future. Perhaps I’ll take up stamp collecting instead. I appreciate your patience. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’m ready to dismount this… examination table.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will assist you. And please, Mr. Vantine, focus on your health. .
PATIENT: .
