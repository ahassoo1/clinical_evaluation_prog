DOCTOR: Bula and hello, Yamir. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. I… need check for referee. For fitness. I do sports, need make sure okay. I want quick check, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sports physical! That’s great you’re being proactive about your health. “Referee” – do you mean a referral for a more specialized sports medicine doctor, or are you needing a check-up for being a referee?
PATIENT: No, no referral. I am referee. For… soccer. And basketball sometimes. Need check me. To see if strong enough. Old now, you know? Thirty-one. Not young anymore for running.
DOCTOR: Thirty-one is definitely not old! But it’s smart to get checked out, especially with the running involved. So, a physical exam to make sure you’re fit to referee soccer and basketball. Absolutely. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General… hmm. I okay. No big problems. I… get tired sometimes. But everyone get tired, right? I have insurance, private. Lost wife two years ago. Sad time. But now… I work. Repair brick things. Hot work. That all.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Yamir. I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It takes a lot of strength to keep going after a loss like that. And repairing brick – that is physically demanding work. So, you mentioned getting tired sometimes. Is that new, or has that been a consistent thing?
PATIENT: Consistent, I think. Always tired after work. But… maybe more tired now. Hard to say. I don’t… I don't really check how tired. Just… tired. Is that bad? I just need to run, not fall down. That's all I care about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistently tired after work, and maybe a little more recently. It’s good you’re noticing the change. It’s not necessarily bad, but it's something we want to investigate a bit to make sure there isn’t an underlying cause. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No problems. Doctor check me before, for work. Always say okay. Strong man. I think. No asthma. No… what you say? Dee-ah-bee-tees? No. Never. Just… sometimes cough. From dust. Brick dust. Is all. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No prior diagnoses. Just a cough from the brick dust. That makes sense. And you said the previous work physicals were all clear?
PATIENT: Yes. Clear. They just… listen to my chest. Check my… arms. And say okay. Very fast. I hope this is fast too. I have things to do. People waiting. Need to finish job today.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re on a tight schedule, and I'll do my best to be efficient. This will be a bit more thorough than a quick work physical, just to make sure we cover everything for the demands of running as a referee. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. No surgeries. No hospital. I… broke arm when small boy. But that long time ago. Fixed with… cast. That's all. Never in hospital for anything serious. Just… little things. Like… flu maybe. Once. Very long time ago. I don’t remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No surgeries or hospitalizations, just a broken arm as a child and maybe a bout of the flu a long time ago. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family… my father… he had… heart problems. Old age. Very old. Mother… she okay. Still alive. Eighty years old. Strong woman. No… cancer, I don’t think. High blood… something? Maybe. I don’t really ask. Family not talk about these things. It bad luck to ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s common for families not to discuss health issues. So, your father had heart problems, and your mother is still alive and healthy, but there might be some history of high blood pressure on that side. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. I… sometimes itchy from dust. But not allergy. Just… dust. And sometimes… spicy food. But that not allergy. That just… spicy. I like spicy food. No medicine allergy. I don’t take much medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. And you don't take many medications. That's helpful. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I… sometimes drink tea. Green tea. For… energy. But that not medicine. Just tea. And sometimes… small drink. Beer. After work. But not every day. Not much. Nothing else. Nothing doctor needs to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Just green tea and occasional beer. No regular medications. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Never smoke. Bad for running. And bad for… everything. My father smoke. He cough a lot. I don’t like smoke. Never try. No.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. You've never smoked. That’s great. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I said… beer sometimes. After work. One or two. Not every day. Maybe two times a week. Sometimes less. I don't… I don’t get drunk. Just… relax. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, one or two beers a couple of times a week for relaxation. That's good to know. Alright, Yamir. That gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Quick, please. I have things to do. Fast. Let's go. I'm ready. Just… don't take long.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as efficient as possible. Let's start with your height and weight. Okay, you're 174 centimeters and 134 pounds. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, but I do hear a little bit of wheezing. Not alarming, but something to keep an eye on. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/85. A little elevated, but we'll monitor that. Let's take a look at your throat and ears. Everything looks normal there. And finally, I'll just quickly check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems generally okay, but that slight wheezing and elevated blood pressure are things we should address. Do you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No chest pain. No. Sometimes… hard to breathe when running. But that… always. From running fast. I'm not young. Old man, you know? Not like when I was twenty. I push myself too hard, maybe. But I need to run fast! That's my job. I don’t feel… sick. Just… tired. After.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath when running, which you attribute to pushing yourself and not being as young as you once were. And you feel tired afterward. Given that slight wheezing and your elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order a few simple tests just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I don't like tests. I have things to do. Can’t I just… run? I've been running for years. Always okay. I don't have time for tests, Doctor. I need to know if I can referee, not… sit in hospital. Fast answer. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Yamir, and I want to get you an answer as quickly as possible. These aren't extensive tests. Just a basic blood workup to check your overall health, including your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and a quick EKG – an electrocardiogram – to check your heart's electrical activity. It's a precaution, given the slight wheezing and elevated blood pressure, to make sure everything is functioning optimally. It'll give us a clearer picture and help me give you the most accurate advice about whether you're fit to referee. It would only take about 30 minutes, and we can schedule it for later today or tomorrow. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Thirty minutes… okay. But if everything okay, I can just… run? I need to know today. The league… they need answer. If tests take long, I lose job. Thirty minutes. No longer. And you promise tell me if I can run. Is that right? No maybe. Yes or no? That’s all I need.
DOCTOR: Yes, I promise. If the tests come back within a reasonable range, I will give you a clear yes or no answer today. Thirty minutes for the tests, and I'll do my best to have the results back to you as quickly as possible. I understand the league needs an answer, and I want to help you get one. We can do the blood work and EKG right here in the clinic. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Okay. Here is fine. Quick. Let's just… get it over with. I have things to do. Thirty minutes. No longer. You promise. Is that right? Just tell me yes or no. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are right. It shouldn't be that hard. And I promise. Thirty minutes, and I will give you a clear yes or no answer. Alright, let’s get started. The nurse will be right in to draw your blood and set you up for the EKG. It's just a quick, painless test where we put some stickers on your chest to monitor your heart's electrical activity. She’ll explain everything. While we wait for the results, is there anything else I can do for you or any other concerns you have?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just… hurry. I need answer. That’s all. Thank you. Thirty minutes. Don't forget. Thirty minutes.
DOCTOR: Of course. Thirty minutes. I won’t forget. We’ll get you sorted out as quickly as possible. Please just relax, and I'll let you know as soon as the results are in.
