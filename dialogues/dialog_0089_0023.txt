DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well, my chest… it hurts a little. Not all the time, but… yeah. It's my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… hard to say. It’s not a bad pain, you know? Like, it doesn't feel like something is broken. More like… sore? And kinda… heavy sometimes. It’s on both sides.
DOCTOR: Okay, “sore and heavy” on both sides. When did this start?
PATIENT: Uh… maybe a couple weeks now? I don't really remember exactly. Things been busy with work, you know? Roofers, it's hot out. I just thought it was muscles at first. But it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Right, roofing work… that definitely can strain muscles. Does anything specific make it worse?
PATIENT: Yeah, like… moving my arms around a lot. And sometimes, when I lay down. Not always, but sometimes. Lifting things… yeah, that makes it worse for sure. It's not like a sharp pain, just… more of the sore feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, aggravated by movement and sometimes when lying down. And you said it's been a couple of weeks. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No… not really. No fever, no… anything else. Just the chest pain. I haven't seen any… you know… lumps or anything. Just… pain. My wife didn't notice anything either.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no other symptoms, wife hasn’t noticed anything. Do you have any trouble breathing, or does it hurt when you breathe?
PATIENT: No, no trouble breathing. And no, it doesn't really hurt when I breathe. It's just… there. Like a dull ache, mostly. I can still do everything, you know? Work, lift things… just a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, no shortness of breath, pain doesn’t worsen with breathing. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I haven’t been to the doctor in a long time. Just… the usual colds and stuff when I was a kid. Nothing serious. I'm pretty healthy, I think. I work hard. I don’t have any… big problems.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant past medical history. Any surgeries at all?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had anything like that. Just… normal stuff. I broke my arm when I was little, but that healed up good. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom… she had… I don’t know the name… something with her heart, I think? When she was old. My dad was okay, he just… got old. No one else… I don’t really know much about their medical stuff. We don't really talk about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother had a heart condition, father was otherwise healthy. Let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. My wife doesn’t either. We both try to stay healthy. Work is hard, but we eat okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medicine. Maybe some pain relievers for headaches, but that's it. Nothing serious. Never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, no medicines. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache, like I said. But I don’t take anything every day. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your chest, that sort of thing. It will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… let me know if it's going to hurt.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mr. Bulaong, if you could lie back for me. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, your heart rate is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. I'm not hearing any unusual sounds in your lungs. Now, I'm going to gently feel your chest to check for tenderness. Okay, there's some mild tenderness when I press here on both sides, and here. No significant masses or deformities. Your ribs feel stable. Let's check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation. Blood pressure is 130/80. Oxygen saturation is 98%, which is good. Overall, the exam doesn't reveal anything immediately concerning, but the tenderness does suggest musculoskeletal involvement. Is it okay if I order a chest x-ray just to rule out anything more serious?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. If you think it's a good idea, then do it. I don’t want anything bad. So, a picture of my chest? Is that what you said? If it helps, then yeah. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to hurt.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, a quick x-ray of your chest. It doesn’t hurt, you’ll just stand still for a few seconds while the machine takes the picture. It’s just a precaution, to be sure. I’m going to have the technician come in and take that for you now. In the meantime, I’m going to document everything we’ve discussed. While we’re waiting for the results, it’s possible this is just muscle strain from your work. But we want to rule out anything else. We'll get the results back relatively quickly, and then we can discuss a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Muscle strain… that would make sense, I guess. It is hard work. I lift a lot of heavy stuff. So, if it's just muscle, what would you do? Like, what would I need to do to get better?
DOCTOR: Okay, good question. If it is muscle strain—and that's what I'm leaning towards at this point—then typically we recommend rest, ice, compression, and elevation – RICE. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help reduce pain and inflammation. We would also want to avoid activities that aggravate the pain. Depending on the severity, it could take a few days to a couple of weeks to heal. If the pain doesn’t improve with these measures, or if it gets worse, we would consider other options, like physical therapy. But let’s wait for the x-ray results first, to be sure. The technician should be in shortly.
PATIENT: Okay, rest, ice, pain relievers… yeah, I can do that. I can try to take it easy. Work is hard, but I can try. So, the picture will tell you if it's just muscle? That sounds good. I'm glad you're getting a picture. I just want to know what's wrong. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The x-ray will help us rule out things like fractures, pneumonia, or other issues that could be causing your pain. It’s a good way to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. That must be the technician now. They’ll explain the procedure to you, it’s very quick and straightforward. I’ll be right here, and we can discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Just try to relax. Is there anything else I can address for you before the technician comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just the picture. Yeah. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. Work makes it hard to get to the doctor, so… I'm glad I came.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I understand. That’s what I’m here for. Don't hesitate to let me know if anything changes or if you have any questions at all. Here's the technician now. I'll see you shortly.
PATIENT: Okay. Thanks again, Doctor.
