DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. GLAZEWSKI. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor GLAZEWSKI. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I received a letter regarding some results from a test… a GI Endo Test, I believe it was called. It said the results were… abnormal, and I wanted to discuss them with you. I confess, I’m a little anxious about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Denis. It's perfectly natural to feel that way when you receive unexpected test results. We'll go through everything together, and I'll do my best to explain it clearly. A GI endoscopy… yes, I see that in your file. Let's start with that. Do you recall when you had the endoscopy performed?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, perfectly. It was… let me see… July 12th, I believe. At St. Jude’s Hospital, with Doctor Ramirez. A very kind woman, Doctor Ramirez. She explained the procedure quite well beforehand, though I confess I was rather nervous during it. Everything happened so quickly.
DOCTOR: July 12th with Dr. Ramirez… excellent. That helps me locate the report. I see here that it did show some abnormalities. Now, before we dive into the specifics, can you tell me a little bit about why you had the endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. For several months – perhaps six, maybe seven – I’ve been experiencing… discomfort. A sort of burning sensation in my stomach, primarily. And, occasionally, some difficulty swallowing. It wasn't constant, you understand, but frequent enough to be… concerning. My primary care physician, Doctor Chen, suggested the endoscopy to investigate. He thought it might be something simple, but wanted to rule out anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning sensation and difficulty swallowing… and you said this has been going on for six or seven months?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. It tends to flare up after I eat, particularly if it's something… spicy. Or acidic, like tomatoes. Otherwise, it's more of a dull ache, a persistent uneasiness. It hasn't interfered too much with my daily life, but it’s definitely there, a constant reminder. I have adjusted my diet, of course, to try and mitigate it. Fewer tomatoes, less chili... one must make sacrifices!
DOCTOR: Dietary adjustments are a good first step, Denis. And you’re right to be mindful of those triggers. The report from Dr. Ramirez indicates some inflammation in your esophagus and stomach. Specifically, it mentions erosions and mild gastritis. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting alongside the burning and difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Oh, erosions… gastritis… those sound unpleasant. No, thankfully, I haven’t experienced any nausea or vomiting. Not at all. Though, on a few occasions, I have felt a bit… bloated after eating, and a strange fullness, even after only a small amount of food. It passes fairly quickly, but it’s… unsettling. And sometimes, a slight burping, but I attribute that to simply eating too quickly, perhaps. I am not a fast eater, but… well, one never knows.
DOCTOR: Bloating and a feeling of fullness… that’s helpful information. And the feeling of fullness even after a small amount of food is worth noting. The report does suggest the possibility of esophagitis, which can cause those symptoms. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool or vomit?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not at all. No blood in either, thankfully. I have been… vigilant, I suppose, checking after… well, you understand. Everything has been normal in that regard, thankfully. That’s one thing that has been keeping me calm, if you will. No visible blood, no concerning changes in… color, shall we say.
DOCTOR: That is very good to hear, Denis. No blood is certainly a positive sign. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I was diagnosed with mild hypertension some years ago, perhaps fifteen years now. It’s well-controlled with medication – a small dose of lisinopril, I believe it is called. Aside from that… I had a rather nasty bout of influenza a few years back, but fully recovered. And, of course, the usual aches and pains of getting older! But nothing… significant, nothing that would, in my estimation, be related to these current symptoms. I have always been fairly healthy, all things considered. My mother lived to be ninety-two, a testament to good genes, perhaps!
DOCTOR: Mild hypertension, well-controlled with lisinopril... good. And a history of influenza. It's always helpful to have a complete picture. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. None at all. Not even a tonsillectomy! I’ve been remarkably fortunate in that regard. I did fracture my wrist as a child – a rather silly accident involving a tree and a misguided attempt at climbing – but it healed cleanly with a cast. Nothing requiring… invasive procedures. I always considered myself rather clumsy as a child, but thankfully, no lasting consequences.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Denis. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of gastrointestinal issues – things like ulcers, Crohn’s disease, or colon cancer – in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… My paternal grandfather, I believe, suffered from what the doctors called “indigestion” – a rather vague diagnosis, as I recall. He lived a long life, however, well into his eighties. My mother’s side of the family… my grandmother did have some stomach problems later in life, but it was never definitively diagnosed. She simply… lost her appetite, and gradually weakened. No history of colon cancer, Crohn’s disease, or ulcers, to my knowledge. They weren't… forthcoming with medical details in those days. It was considered rather… private.
DOCTOR: I understand. Medical history wasn't always as openly discussed. Alright. And finally, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I am widowed, Doctor. My husband, Ricardo, passed away ten years ago. A very kind man, a carpenter. I live alone in a small house in the suburbs. I don't smoke, and I drink very little alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion. I used to be very active in the community – volunteering at the library, attending church events – but I’ve become a bit more… reclusive in recent years. It's… difficult, adjusting to life on one’s own. I do enjoy gardening, though – it keeps me busy and provides a sense of purpose. And I read… voraciously.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Denis. It sounds like you’ve had a full life, and you’re finding healthy ways to cope. Gardening and reading are excellent pursuits. Now, just to confirm, are you currently taking any other medications besides the lisinopril?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, just the lisinopril. A small dose, as I mentioned. I do take a multivitamin occasionally, but nothing regularly. I try to maintain a healthy diet – lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein – and that’s generally sufficient. I am not one for… unnecessary medication. I prefer to let nature take its course, whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Denis. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It's very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results from Dr. Ramirez’s endoscopy, it sounds like you likely have esophagitis and mild gastritis. The erosions indicate some inflammation in your esophagus, and the gastritis suggests inflammation in your stomach lining. Given your symptoms – the burning sensation, difficulty swallowing, bloating – these findings align with what you’ve been experiencing. Now, we need to determine the cause of this inflammation. The most common causes are acid reflux, Helicobacter pylori infection, or certain medications. I'd like to order a few tests to help us pinpoint the cause. Firstly, a stool test to check for H. pylori. Secondly, a blood test to rule out other potential causes. And finally, I’d like to consider a pH monitoring test to assess the amount of acid in your esophagus. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Yes, certainly. Those tests sound perfectly acceptable to me. I trust your judgment. I confess, I am a little anxious about the pH monitoring test – it sounds… unpleasant. But if it’s necessary, I will, of course, comply. I simply want to understand what is causing this discomfort and find a way to alleviate it. I appreciate your thoroughness and your willingness to explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: The pH monitoring test isn’t as unpleasant as it sounds, Denis. It involves inserting a small catheter through your nose into your esophagus to measure acid levels over a 24-hour period. It can be a little uncomfortable, but it’s generally well-tolerated. We’ll provide you with detailed instructions and support to make it as comfortable as possible. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend a few lifestyle modifications. Firstly, avoid foods that trigger your discomfort – spicy foods, tomatoes, caffeine, alcohol. Secondly, eat smaller, more frequent meals. Thirdly, avoid lying down immediately after eating. And finally, elevate the head of your bed by about six inches. We can also consider a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, to reduce stomach acid production. I'm thinking a low dose of omeprazole to start. We can assess your response and adjust the dosage as needed. I'll write out the orders for the tests and the medication. And I’ll also provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Silva, for a follow-up consultation once we have the results. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That all sounds… very reasonable, Doctor. Yes, a follow-up with Dr. Silva sounds excellent. And the lifestyle modifications… I can certainly manage those. Fewer tomatoes, smaller meals, elevating the head of the bed… it’s all quite sensible. And the omeprazole… if it can alleviate this discomfort, I am certainly willing to try it. Thank you, Doctor GLAZEWSKI. You have put my mind at ease. I feel much better knowing there are steps we can take to address this. Please, let me know if there is anything else I should be aware of, or any questions I should be asking.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could help. The most important thing is that we're being proactive and addressing this systematically. Here are the orders for the tests and the omeprazole prescription. I’ve also included a handout with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the pH monitoring test and a list of foods to avoid. Please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the test results and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Two weeks sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and your kindness. I truly appreciate it. I will be sure to contact the clinic if any questions arise. I believe that is everything, then? I don’t want to take up any more of your valuable time.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Denis. It was my pleasure. And remember, taking care of your health is never a waste of time. No, I think that’s everything for today. The nurse will escort you to the checkout desk. If you experience any worsening symptoms – severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, or vomiting blood – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Thank you for coming in today, Denis. Have a good day. And please, take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor GLAZEWSKI. You have been most helpful. I will certainly follow your instructions and contact you if any concerns arise.
