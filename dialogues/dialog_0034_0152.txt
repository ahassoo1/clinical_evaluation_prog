DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Seil. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter saying my cholesterol is a little high. The doctor I usually see… she’s retired now, and they sent me here. I think it said “hyperlipidemia” on the paper, but I don’t really know what that means, exactly. Just that it’s not good to have it high, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re right to be proactive about it. Hyperlipidemia simply means you have higher than optimal levels of fats – specifically cholesterol – in your blood. It is important to address, as high cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke over time. Okay, so the letter was regarding elevated cholesterol. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, that makes sense. Heart disease runs in my family, actually. My father… he had a heart attack when he was about 65. And my mother, she had high blood pressure for years. Other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy, I think. I had the flu a couple of times, and broke my wrist once when I was a teenager, but nothing serious. I've never been a smoker, and I don’t drink much – maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. I try to eat pretty well, mostly vegetables and fish, but… well, I do like my pastries sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Geho. Knowing your family history of heart disease is particularly helpful. And it's good to hear you generally maintain a healthy lifestyle. Pastries are allowed in moderation, of course! To continue building a complete picture, could you please tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies… let me think. I don't think I have any food allergies. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. And no allergies to any medicines either. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times, and some pain relievers for headaches, and I didn't have any problems with those. Oh! Except… I get a little itchy sometimes if I touch certain plants, like poison ivy. But that’s just a skin thing, not a real allergy, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Geho. A sensitivity to poison ivy doesn’t typically factor into medication considerations. So, no known drug or food allergies. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don’t take anything regularly. I used to take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because I don't get much sun, but I stopped that last year. I'll take an aspirin if I have a headache, and sometimes I use a cream for my knees if they bother me, but that's it. Nothing a doctor prescribed, just things you can buy at the store.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications currently. Just occasional over-the-counter remedies. Alright. Now, to get a clearer understanding of your cholesterol levels and overall health, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam and review your lab results from the letter. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. A physical exam is good, I guess. I haven’t had one in a while, actually. Hopefully everything’s still working okay!
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's perfectly alright. We'll just take a look and see. It’s good preventative care, and it’s often reassuring to have a baseline assessment. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, I'd like to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and briefly examine your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds good. Go right ahead. I'm ready when you are. You know, I always feel a little silly when someone listens to my heart. It never sounds like the ones on television!
DOCTOR: They rarely do! It's perfectly normal for it not to sound like a movie soundtrack. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Ears and nose are normal. Throat is clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Everything sounds and feels within normal limits on initial examination. Now, let’s take a look at the lab results from the letter to get a clearer picture of your cholesterol levels. One moment.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That's reassuring to hear. I was a little worried, to be honest. I always get nervous at the doctor’s office. What do the numbers say? Is it really bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, so your total cholesterol is 230 mg/dL. Your LDL cholesterol – that's the "bad" cholesterol – is 160 mg/dL. Your HDL cholesterol – the "good" cholesterol – is 45 mg/dL. And your triglycerides are 150 mg/dL. Based on these numbers, your total cholesterol is slightly elevated, and your LDL cholesterol is above the optimal range. Your HDL is a little on the low side, which isn't ideal, and your triglycerides are borderline high. These results do indicate hyperlipidemia, and it would be prudent to address it to reduce your risk of cardiovascular issues. Do you have any questions about those numbers?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Those don't sound very good, do they? Not very good at all. LDL is bad… right? And HDL is good? I remember something about that from a magazine, ages ago. So, what does that mean exactly? What do I need to do? Are you going to give me a pill? I really don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Ms. Geho, but it’s important not to panic. We can absolutely work with this. You’re correct, LDL cholesterol is often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, because it can contribute to plaque buildup in your arteries. And HDL cholesterol is "good" cholesterol, as it helps remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. The good news is that we often can make significant improvements with lifestyle modifications. Before we discuss medication, I'd like to explore those options. These include dietary changes – focusing on reducing saturated and trans fats, increasing fiber intake, and incorporating more omega-3 fatty acids. Regular exercise is also crucial, as it helps raise HDL cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol. I'd recommend starting with a heart-healthy diet and at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. We can schedule a consultation with a registered dietitian to develop a personalized meal plan. We can also discuss some resources for exercise programs in the area. If lifestyle changes aren't sufficient to lower your cholesterol to the desired levels, then we can consider medication. But let’s try these initial steps first. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable, actually. I can definitely try to eat better. I do enjoy cooking, so maybe I can find some new recipes. And I used to walk a lot more, before my knee started bothering me. Maybe I can start with shorter walks, and see how it goes. A dietitian sounds like a good idea too. Someone to give me a plan, instead of just saying “eat healthy.” That would be very helpful. So, no pills right now? That’s good. I’m still a little worried, but I feel a bit better knowing we have a plan. What kind of exercise is best? And are there foods I should definitely avoid?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's a very positive attitude, Ms. Geho, and I’m confident we can make progress. No pills right now – we’ll focus on these lifestyle changes first, and reassess in a few months. As for exercise, anything that gets your heart rate up is beneficial. Walking is a great starting point, and you’re right to start slowly if your knee is bothering you. Swimming and cycling are also low-impact options. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. Regarding diet, it’s best to limit saturated and trans fats, which are found in red meat, processed foods, fried foods, and many baked goods. Focus on incorporating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats – like those found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil. A registered dietitian can provide a more detailed personalized plan, but these are some general guidelines. I’m happy to provide you with a referral. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule that referral for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so clearly. I feel much less anxious now, knowing what to do. Maybe I can even make some new friends in an exercise class!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Geho. I’m glad I could help alleviate your anxieties. And that’s a wonderful idea about the exercise class – a great way to stay motivated and socialize! Okay, the referral to the registered dietitian is submitted. Their office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I'll also print out some resources about heart-healthy diets for you to take home. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to check your cholesterol levels again and see how you’re progressing. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Seil. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I really appreciate it. I'm going to go home and look up some healthy recipes right now. And maybe find a walking group.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Geho. It was a pleasure meeting you. That’s a wonderful attitude – a proactive approach is key. Please remember, small changes can make a big difference. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to seeing you in three months.
