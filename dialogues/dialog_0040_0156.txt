DOCTOR: Right. Jase Nahrwold, 20 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's… well, it's my stomach, I guess. It's been… not good. Like, a lot of diarrhea. It's been going on for a while now, and it's just… annoying, mostly. I can't really remember exactly when it started, to be honest. It feels like a long time.
DOCTOR: “Annoying,” right. Well, “a long time” isn’t terribly helpful, dear. Try to think. Was it before or after… say, the Fourth of July?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The Fourth of July… hmm. I think… I think it was before. Definitely before. We had a little barbecue with my husband’s family, but I don't remember feeling bad at the barbecue. Maybe a week or so before that? It’s… really hard to say. Everything feels kind of blurry. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Blurry, yes. Look, I need something concrete to work with. A week before the Fourth… so, around June 24th?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. June 24th… that sounds about right, maybe? Or a little after, perhaps. It wasn’t sudden, like I woke up one morning with it. It kind of… built up, slowly. And it hasn't really gone away, just… comes and goes. It’s pretty consistent though, if that makes sense. Like, most days I have some trouble.
DOCTOR: “Consistent trouble,” alright. And is it just diarrhea, or are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Um… Let me see… Sometimes my stomach feels really bloated and painful, like it’s all twisted up. And… sometimes I feel really tired. Just… really, really tired. Not like, can’t-get-out-of-bed tired, but just… wiped out. I don’t know if that’s related, though. I just figured it was from… everything.
DOCTOR: Bloating, pain, fatigue. “Everything,” you say?
PATIENT: Just… life, I guess. Work’s been a little stressful, trying to hit my sales numbers. And… well, I’ve always had a sensitive stomach, I think. My mum always said so. She said it might be… something to do with what I eat. I don’t know. I get confused about it all. It’s just… always something. Do you know what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, something is clearly going on. Let's try to narrow it down. Have you noticed anything specific that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s a hard one. I think… dairy maybe? Milk definitely doesn’t agree with me. And… sometimes spicy food. But then sometimes I can eat it just fine, so it's confusing! It’s not always the same thing. It’s like… my stomach just decides randomly what it doesn’t like that day. It’s really frustrating.
DOCTOR: Random, frustrating... right. And have you experienced any fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Um… no fever, definitely not. And I haven’t been sick, like throwing up. Blood… I… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It’s… it’s hard to tell sometimes, to be honest. I try not to look too closely. Sorry. That probably sounds gross.
DOCTOR: It’s… information. Okay. Let’s do a quick examination. I need to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll just feel around a bit. Nothing invasive, just to get a sense of things. Do you have any pain right now?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… alright. Actually, yeah, a little. Just… kind of a general ache, low down on my right side. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. It comes and goes though. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Right side ache… yes. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. And breathe normally, please. Anything?
PATIENT: Ow, a little there… That feels… a bit sore. Not terrible, just… sensitive. Everything else feels… okay, I guess. A little gassy, maybe. Sorry if that’s weird.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the right lower quadrant… yes. Okay. I'm going to order some blood work and a stool sample. We need to rule out a few things. It could be something relatively simple, or it could be something a bit more complex. Don't panic. We'll figure it out.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Blood work and… a stool sample. Right. What kind of “complex” things are we talking about? If you don't mind me asking, of course. I don't want to worry you, but… I've heard bad things about stomach problems.
DOCTOR: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. It could be irritable bowel syndrome, a food intolerance, or even just a persistent infection. More rarely, it could be something like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. But we won’t know until we have the results. I'll have the lab send the results to me, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay. IBS… Crohn’s… That sounds… scary. But you’re right, we don’t know yet. A follow-up appointment sounds good. Will the blood work tell us if it’s… something serious? If it is, can you… help me?
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us some clues. If it is something more serious, I’ll refer you to a gastroenterologist. They are the specialists in these matters. I don’t deal with those cases directly, frankly. Here. This has the contact information for a few good doctors in the area. Let’s get those tests done first. Don’t jump to conclusions, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. A gastroenterologist… Alright. No jumping to conclusions. Thank you, Dr. Osga. For everything. I'll get those tests done as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: Very well. Get it done promptly, and schedule that follow-up. And try to manage your stress. It likely isn’t helping. Next. .
