DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m considering. I believe it’s a clearance visit? My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I apologize if I’m a little… vague. But I understand it's to make sure I’m healthy enough for it?
DOCTOR: Yes, a pre-operative clearance. Perfectly understandable. We just need to establish a baseline and ensure there aren’t any hidden issues that could complicate things. So, let's start with the surgery itself. What type of surgery are you scheduled for, and with which surgeon?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that's a good question. It's… cosmetic. I think it's something to do with my face… honestly, the details are a bit blurry. The surgeon… I’m so sorry, the name is escaping me entirely. It was recommended by a friend, and everything was arranged quite quickly. Is it alright if I don't recall immediately? I can perhaps find the paperwork later?
DOCTOR: It's… less than ideal to proceed with a surgical procedure without knowing the specifics or the surgeon’s name, Ms. Brightful. However. We can certainly work around it. Let's focus on what you’re hoping to achieve with this surgery, and why you decided to have it done. That might jog your memory. What specifically are you looking to correct or improve?
PATIENT: Well… it’s about… how I look, naturally. After… everything, I suppose. It’s hard to explain. My husband… he always said I had a lovely smile. And I… I’d like to feel like myself again. I feel… worn, I think is the word. Not… fresh. I want to feel confident, like I did before. It’s silly, perhaps. It's not a life-or-death situation, I understand that. But it feels… important. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It makes some sense, Ms. Brightful. Though frankly, relying on cosmetic surgery to regain a sense of self is… a questionable approach. But that is neither here nor there. We still need to ensure you are a suitable candidate. Let's move on to your medical history, then. Do you have any current medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I… I haven't been to a doctor regularly since… well, since my husband passed. He always handled those things. I think I’m generally healthy. I eat reasonably well, though I haven't been exercising much lately. And I don’t smoke, never have. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, but nothing excessive. Is there anything specific you’re worried about?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known medical conditions. That's… a start. Have you ever had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, I believe. And… oh, yes! A minor procedure on my hand, years ago, after a kitchen accident. It was just a small cut, stitched up quickly. Nothing major, truly. And… that's all I can recall at the moment. I'm terribly sorry if I’m being unhelpful. My memory really is… patchy.
DOCTOR: It is… suboptimal to proceed without a complete history, Ms. Brightful. However. We will do our best. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally for a headache, and that’s about it. Honestly, I'm quite a plain person when it comes to all of that. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: No known allergies, no regular medications. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. My family… we didn’t really talk about medical things. My mother passed away when I was young, and my father… he wasn’t very forthcoming with information. I know my grandmother on my mother’s side had… something with her heart, I think. But I don’t know the details. And beyond that… I truly couldn’t tell you. I’m so sorry. Is it essential? I feel terrible that I can’t be more assistance.
DOCTOR: It is always essential to have a complete family history, Ms. Brightful. It provides crucial insight into potential risks. But, we will proceed. Let’s move on. And this may jog your memory. Tell me about your social history. Do you drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: I… I mentioned the wine with dinner, occasionally. It's not a habit, not at all. Perhaps once or twice a week, a small glass. I don’t drink to excess, I assure you. And I certainly don’t smoke or use any recreational drugs. I… I mostly enjoy quiet evenings at home, reading or watching television. Before… everything… my husband and I enjoyed going out to restaurants, but I haven't been much lately.
DOCTOR: Occasional wine, no smoking, limited social activity. Very well. Now, let's get to a physical exam. I need to check your vitals, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine the area where you intend to have the surgery. Please sit up and let me listen to your chest.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. I… I hope this isn’t too much trouble. I feel rather silly, being so unprepared, but I assure you, I don't usually operate like this. I simply… haven’t been to a doctor in a very long time. Please, just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright. Breathe deeply. Heart rate is slightly elevated… possibly due to anxiety. Lungs are clear. Skin is… well, it shows some expected signs of aging. No obvious lesions or abnormalities. Blood pressure is 135/85. A bit on the higher side. Reflexes are normal. Facial muscle strength is adequate. Overall… you appear physically healthy, Ms. Brightful, despite some concerning gaps in your medical history. We'll need to run some blood work to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good idea. I… I understand my history is less than ideal. I truly apologize for that. I just… I want to feel like myself again, and if blood work is what it takes, then I am happy to do it. I trust your judgement completely. Please, let me know if there’s anything else I can do, or any other information I should be trying to remember.
DOCTOR: It is not merely about remembering, Ms. Brightful. It's about taking responsibility for your health. But we will proceed as best we can. I will order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a coagulation profile. These will give us a good baseline. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours. Once I have those, we can discuss them and determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery. In the meantime, I recommend you attempt to locate the name of the surgeon performing the procedure and any documentation related to it. It is essential for informed consent and proper follow-up care. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I… I don’t think so. Just… thank you. For seeing me, and for being patient. I will absolutely try to find the surgeon’s name and any paperwork. I feel terrible that I haven’t already. I… I will do my best. 24-48 hours… alright. I will be in touch if I remember anything else, or if I locate the information. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please contact the office to schedule a follow-up appointment once the lab results are available. Good day, Ms. Brightful.
