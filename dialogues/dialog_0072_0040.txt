DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain I keep getting in my side, lower down on my back. And… the waterworks troubles, if you understand. It’s been happening on and off for a while now, but it feels worse lately.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks troubles,” alright. To clarify, Mr. Espinueva, are you experiencing difficulty starting your urine stream, or perhaps a frequent urge to urinate?
PATIENT: Oh, both, actually. It’s hard to get going sometimes, feels like it takes a moment. And then… not long after I’ve been, I feel like I need to go again. It’s quite bothersome, really. I haven’t been sleeping as well because of it.
DOCTOR: I see. And this pain in your lower back… can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, not really cramping. Just a constant, heavy feeling. Sometimes it’s worse than others, and it seems to come and go. It’s on both sides, though usually one is a little more troublesome than the other. I can’t really say why.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when did you first start noticing this combination of back pain and urinary issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s been a few years now, I think. Maybe… five or six years? It started slowly, just a little discomfort now and then. I didn’t think much of it at first, just old age, you know? But it’s definitely gotten worse, and more frequent, over time. My sister, she has something with her kidneys, and I wonder if it could be something similar.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about a potential kidney issue, given your sister’s history. However, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Let's delve a little deeper into your medical background. Do you have a history of any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me a few years back my kidneys weren't working at their best. He said something about little pockets… cysts, I think he called them. Polycystic, maybe? I don’t recall everything he said, to be honest. And I’ve always been a little on the bigger side, so my blood pressure can be a bit high sometimes, but I don’t take any medicine for it. Just try to watch my salt intake.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease... alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never been in hospital. No surgeries either. I've always been fairly lucky, health-wise, until this started. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years, nothing serious enough for a hospital visit. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long, long time ago, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother, she had trouble with her kidneys too, when she got older. Similar to my sister and me, I think. And my father, he had high blood pressure. That's all I can really remember, to be honest. We didn't talk about health much in my family. It wasn't something we were comfortable with, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to eat healthy, but other than that, I don’t take anything regularly. I used to take something for my joints, years ago, but I stopped. It didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t want to fill myself with too many pills.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, not at all. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's about it. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested in those, thank you very much. I prefer a good cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, Mr. Espinueva, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your abdomen, check your lower back for tenderness, and I'll need to do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie down on your back, we'll start with listening to your abdomen. Alright. I'm noting some mild tenderness in your lower back, particularly on your left side. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Your abdomen is soft to the touch, with normal bowel sounds. I’m also going to check your reflexes and sensation in your lower extremities. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and sensation is intact. No obvious weakness noted. Based on what you’ve told me, and my brief examination, your symptoms suggest a few possibilities – including possible kidney involvement, a urinary tract infection, or even a musculoskeletal issue. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some laboratory tests – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. We will also need to do a kidney ultrasound. Would you be able to provide a urine sample for me now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. A urine sample, you say? Yes, I can manage that. Where would you like me to… provide it?
DOCTOR: The bathroom is just down the hall, to your left. There's a specimen cup and instructions inside. Please bring the sample back to me when you're finished, and I’ll have the lab send it off. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. It may take a few days to get everything back. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. I understand about the tests and increasing my fluids. I’ll go and provide a sample now. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. Take your time. I'll be here when you return.
