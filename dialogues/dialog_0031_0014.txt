DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Oh, yes. It's about some papers, I think. My wife mentioned something about needing forms… for work. Something about time off? It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I believe it has to do with my… well, with needing some help with things. I think it's called… FMLA? Or maybe disability? She said paperwork was needed either way.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It sounds like you're needing assistance with medical leave, potentially either Family and Medical Leave – FMLA – or short-term disability. That’s perfectly alright; we can certainly sort that out. Before we focus on the paperwork, though, I'd like to understand why you might need leave. Could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with your health that prompted this discussion?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a tricky question. It's not one big thing, you see. It's just… bits and pieces. I've been feeling… not quite myself lately. Tired, mostly. Very tired. And a little… confused sometimes. My memory isn't what it used to be, that's for sure. My wife, bless her heart, she does most of the remembering these days. I went to see a specialist a while back, about my… well, about feeling off, but I don't rightly recall what he said. Something about… getting older, I think? It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been experiencing a gradual decline in your energy levels and cognitive function, and that you saw a specialist previously. It's not uncommon for these things to be a bit hazy in memory, especially when you're feeling unwell. To get a clearer picture, and to help with the necessary forms, could you tell me a bit more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? That’s a tough one. It wasn't sudden, you see. It was… gradual. Probably… oh, maybe six months ago? Or was it a year? It’s hard to pinpoint. I remember feeling alright last summer, I think. We took a trip to Tahiti, visited my family. But before that… well, I suppose I was starting to feel a bit more tired than usual. Not enough to really worry about, though. It just slowly… got worse. My wife would know better, she really would. She keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly six to twelve months of gradual onset of fatigue, and some memory difficulties. That’s helpful. Now, besides the fatigue and memory issues, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit… clumsier, I suppose. Dropping things more often. And my wife says I’ve been… quieter. Not as talkative as usual. I used to enjoy telling stories, you see, but I haven't felt much like it lately. Oh, and sometimes… sometimes I feel a little bit… sad. Just a general feeling of sadness, without any real reason. It comes and goes, though. It's probably just getting old, though, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re sharing all of this with me, Mr. Limtiaco. It’s important to get a full picture. While some of these things can be related to aging, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. Now, have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty with balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Hmm… physical symptoms. Let me see. Headaches, not really. Maybe a little bit of a dull ache sometimes, but nothing major. Vision changes… I wear glasses, you know, and I did get a new prescription a few months ago, but that was just because my old ones were outdated. Weakness… not really. I still manage to get around, though I do tire a bit easier. Balance… now that you mention it, I did stumble a couple of times recently. Nothing serious, just a bit clumsy, like I said. It's probably just my age catching up with me, Doctor. I really don’t want to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to make a fuss, Mr. Limtiaco, but it's my job to investigate these things thoroughly. Just to be complete, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… well, it’s been a bit off, I suppose. I don’t enjoy eating as much as I used to. Everything just tastes… bland. And I think I’ve lost a bit of weight. My wife keeps telling me I need to eat more, but I just don’t have much of an appetite. She’s a good woman, always looking after me. But yes, I’ve definitely lost some weight, though I don’t know exactly how much. It’s probably not much, just a few pounds.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a few simple tests to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'm just hoping it's nothing serious. Go ahead, whenever you're ready. I'll just sit here, won't I? Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit here on the table for me, that would be great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please let your arms fall loosely by your sides?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here you go. Just like that? Is that good? I always feel a bit silly doing these things, to be honest. I haven't had a proper check-up in… well, I can’t even remember when. My wife usually handles all these things. She’s the organized one in the family, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the other side. Okay, good. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but not dramatically so. Now, could you please close your eyes and point to your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Alright, closed my eyes. Pointing to my nose… is that right? Is that… close enough? I'm not very good at these things, Doctor. My hands don’t seem to want to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, there’s a slight deviation to the left. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes, but keep your head still?
PATIENT: Alright, following your finger… keeping my head still. Is that good? I’m trying my best, Doctor, but it’s a bit difficult. My eyes feel a little… tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. And finally, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright, standing up now… Walking a few steps… Is that alright? I feel a bit wobbly, Doctor. I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. You can sit back down now. Alright. Based on this brief exam, and what you’ve told me, there are a few things I’m concerned about. Your reflexes are diminished, your gait is unsteady, and you’ve reported some memory difficulties and changes in your cognition. These findings, taken together, suggest there may be a neurological component to your symptoms. I want to be thorough, so I’m going to recommend some further testing. Specifically, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an MRI of your brain. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions and get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An MRI? That sounds… serious. But yes, if that's what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. I trust your judgment. My wife will be concerned, of course. She always worries. But if it will help us figure out what’s wrong, then I’m willing to do whatever it takes. What do I need to do? And… will the results take long? I really don't want to worry my wife unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Mr. Limtiaco, but it's important to remember that an MRI is just a tool to help us gather information. It doesn't necessarily mean there's something serious wrong. We're just being thorough. As for what you need to do, the MRI center will contact you to schedule an appointment. They’ll give you specific instructions about preparation, such as fasting or removing any metal objects. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them with you and your wife. In the meantime, I'm going to write a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Anya Sharma. She's an excellent specialist, and I think it would be beneficial to get her opinion as well. I’ll also give you a list of resources for neurological conditions. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: A neurologist… that sounds… even more serious. But yes, if you think it's best. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… a lot to take in. I suppose I’ll just wait for the MRI center to call. And I’ll tell my wife. She’ll want to be involved, of course. She always is. And about the… paperwork I came in for? The FMLA or disability? Will we still be able to do that? I don't want to forget about that. My work… they’ve been understanding so far, but I need to get those forms filled out.
DOCTOR: Of course. We can absolutely still address the paperwork. Now that we have a better understanding of what’s going on, I can complete the necessary forms for either FMLA or short-term disability. Given your symptoms, and the need for further evaluation, I'll likely recommend short-term disability at this point. I'll have my assistant, Sarah, print out the forms and explain the process to you and your wife. She can also help you with any questions you may have. Before you go, do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful. Sarah, you say? Yes, that would be very helpful. My wife always appreciates a good explanation. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and patient. I appreciate it. I suppose I’ll just wait for the phone to ring. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. It was my pleasure. Remember, we’re here to support you through this. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Sarah will be right with you to go over the paperwork. Have a good day, and please give your wife my best.
PATIENT: .
