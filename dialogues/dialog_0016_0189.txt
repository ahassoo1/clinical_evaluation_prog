DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Lovely to meet you. Don't know why I had to come all this way, frankly. It's about my…well, it’s in the stool. Blood. Not a little bit, either. It’s unsettling, to say the least. A man my age shouldn't be dealing with this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Blood in the stool is definitely something we need to investigate, and you're right to get it checked out. It is unsettling, and we want to figure out what’s going on. To help me understand things better, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What do you mean, more about it? It’s blood! Bright red, mostly. Sometimes it’s…darker. Like old coffee grounds, I suppose. And it’s not every time, mind you. Just…sometimes. Been going on a couple of weeks now, maybe three. Honestly, I haven't been keeping track. A gentleman doesn't dwell on such things.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s helpful to know it’s not constant, and that you've noticed both bright red and darker blood. The difference in color can tell us a bit about where it might be coming from. When you say "sometimes," about how often would you estimate you're noticing blood in your stool over those few weeks?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Estimate? You want me to estimate bodily functions? Really? Let’s see…maybe…three or four times? Spread out, mind you. Not all at once. It’s not like a gusher, if that’s what you're thinking. More like…streaks. And I haven’t had any pain, if that matters. None at all. Although…my stomach has been a bit rumblier than usual, now that I think about it. Could just be the fish, though. I had salmon last week.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four times over a few weeks, streaks of blood, no pain, but some increased stomach rumbling. That's very helpful. And it’s good you mentioned the salmon – we’ll keep that in mind. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits along with this?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to, like any normal person. It’s not…irregular. Though, I suppose it has been a bit…softer than usual, lately. Not diarrhea, mind you, just…not as firm. And I have to go more often, maybe? I haven't been counting the trips, naturally. This is ridiculous. You're asking a man about his…movements!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if I'm asking overly personal questions. It is important information though, to help us figure out what’s going on. Softer stools and increased frequency, even if it’s not quite diarrhea, are things we need to consider. Now, have you noticed any fatigue or weakness lately?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Weakness? Well, I am eighty-eight years old, you know. A man doesn't bounce around like a young pup at my age. I get tired, naturally. But no more than usual, I suppose. I still manage my crossword puzzles, and I still yell at the television during the hockey games. Does that answer your question? And frankly, all this prying isn't helping my energy levels. It's unsettling. I thought doctors were supposed to fix things, not interrogate you about…everything.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to point that out, Mr. Rowbottom. I apologize if I’m making you feel interrogated. I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what might be causing this. It's good to hear you're still managing your crossword puzzles and hockey games – that's excellent! Let’s talk about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. And a broken wrist, fell off a ladder fixing the roof. Nothing serious. Oh, and a touch of the flu a few years back. The usual old man ailments, really. Never been a sickly fellow, though. And I certainly haven’t been to see a doctor much in the past…until now, of course. Frankly, I always figured it was best to just let things sort themselves out. Seems to have worked for eighty-eight years. But this…this blood is different. It’s…concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out, broken wrist, a bout of the flu – nothing major. That's good to know. And I understand your preference to let things sort themselves out – many people feel that way. You’re right though, this blood is something we need to investigate. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your tonsils out?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think…no. Just the tonsils. Never needed anything else. A tough old constitution, you see. I patched myself up after the wrist, too. A bit of plaster, a sling, good as new. Never been one for doctors poking and prodding. Waste of time, mostly. Although…my ex-wife tried to get me to have a prostate thing done years ago. But I refused. Never liked those examinations. Unnecessary, if you ask me. And clearly, I’ve managed without it all this time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries, and you declined the prostate examination years ago. Thank you for sharing that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no. I don't take anything. Never have. A little bit of fish oil now and then, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t go around popping pills like some of those folks on television. A healthy diet and a bit of exercise, that's all a man needs. And a stiff drink now and then, of course. But nothing prescribed by a doctor, no. Never been a fan of all those side effects they warn about. Ruins a good evening, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, just a bit of fish oil occasionally. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but that's just normal, isn't it? Nothing serious. I eat pretty much everything. A good steak, fish, vegetables… I don't fuss about with fancy diets or avoiding things. A man needs his sustenance, you see. A bit of chocolate now and then, of course. But no allergies, no. Never had a problem with that sort of thing. Quite the opposite, actually. I'm a fairly robust individual.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, goodness. Where do I even begin? My father lived to be eighty-five, a carpenter. Strong man, good hands. My mother…she passed away when I was young, breast cancer. Sad business, that. My brother…he had high blood pressure, I think. Nothing major, as far as I know. Honestly, we weren’t a family that talked much about illnesses. A bit of a stoic bunch, if you ask me. Everyone just dealt with things on their own. A lot of hard work, not a lot of complaining. That was the Rowbottom way. And frankly, I don’t remember much about their specific ailments, to be honest. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father lived to 85, your mother passed away from breast cancer, and your brother had high blood pressure. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. My father was a smoker, though. Killed him in the end, I reckon. Emphysema, or something like that. Nasty business. I always steered clear of it. Good lungs, you see. Need them for yelling at the hockey games. Always told my friends to avoid it too. Waste of money and ruins your health. Never understood the appeal. A good, clean life is the way to go. And a good whiskey, of course. But no smoking, never have, never will.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked. That's excellent. And now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Well, now you're talking. A good single malt, a nice scotch… that's a different story. A man enjoys a wee dram now and then. Keeps the cold away, you see. And it helps you relax after a long day. A glass or two with dinner, maybe a bit more on the weekends. Never gotten drunk, mind you. I'm a moderate drinker. Been enjoying a good whiskey for most of my adult life. It’s civilized, you see. And frankly, it helps with the crossword puzzles. But I don't make a habit of it. Just a bit of enjoyment, that's all. A good, healthy appreciation. Not a problem, mind you. A man deserves a bit of pleasure.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate alcohol consumption. Thank you for being honest about that. And finally, do you have any pets?
PATIENT: Pets? Goodness, no. Never been a pet person. Too much responsibility. Too much…fuss. Always thought they were a bit messy, if I’m honest. My ex-wife had a cat once. Horrible creature. Shed everywhere, scratched the furniture…a nuisance, if you ask me. I prefer a clean, orderly home. A bit of peace and quiet. A man needs his solitude. I get enough companionship from the television and the crossword puzzles, if you ask me. Never understood the appeal of all that animal hair and…smell. No, no pets. Never have, never will. A bit too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pets. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mr. Rowbottom. I appreciate your honesty. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a quick rectal exam. This is important to help us understand what might be causing the blood in your stool. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A…a rectal exam? Now hold on just a minute. A physical exam, I suppose, I can understand. Listening to my heart and lungs…fine. But a rectal exam? Good heavens, Doctor, that’s a bit much, isn’t it? Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn’t you just…order some tests? A bit of blood work, maybe? I’m an old man, Doctor, I don’t need poking and prodding in…well, there. That's a bit…invasive, don't you think? Honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize for making you feel uneasy. You are absolutely right to question it. A rectal exam is an invasive procedure, and I wouldn’t suggest it if it wasn’t medically necessary. However, given your symptoms of blood in your stool, it’s a crucial step to help determine the source of the bleeding and rule out any serious issues. It allows me to check for abnormalities, such as polyps or masses, that could be causing the bleeding. It’s a quick exam, and I will do everything I can to make you comfortable. We can certainly discuss alternative testing options, such as a stool test to look for hidden blood. However, a stool test can sometimes miss bleeding, and a colonoscopy might ultimately be necessary if the results are positive. Ultimately, the goal is to get to the bottom of this and ensure you receive the best possible care. If you are still uncomfortable, we can discuss ordering a stool test as a first step, and then reassess the need for a physical exam based on the results. What do you think?
PATIENT: Alright. Alright, Doctor. You make a…reasonable point. I suppose I trust your judgment. But I want you to know, I'm not happy about this. And if it's unpleasant…well, I'll let you know. And don't go poking around unnecessarily, understand? Quick and efficient. That's all I ask. A man has his dignity, you know. And just…be gentle, for heaven's sake. This is…not a pleasant prospect. Now, get on with it. But quickly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I completely understand your apprehension, and I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. I will explain each step as I go, and I will stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness or masses. Now, if you could lie on your side…we’ll proceed with the rectal exam. I’ll use lubricant and be as gentle as possible. Again, please let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort. Are you ready?
PATIENT: As ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Just…get it over with quickly. And no unnecessary poking, remember? I mean it, Doctor. I haven't spent eighty-eight years maintaining my…composure to have it disturbed now. Just be efficient. Quickly and efficiently. That's all I ask. And warn me if it's going to be…uncomfortable. Warn me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. That’s all done. I did not feel any obvious masses, and there was no evidence of significant pain. However, I did notice some mild tenderness and a small amount of blood on the gloved finger. This is not necessarily cause for alarm, but it does warrant further investigation. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Mild tenderness? Blood? That’s not…reassuring, is it? I knew I shouldn’t have come. A waste of time and…invasion of privacy, if you ask me. What does it mean, Doctor? Be plain with me. Is it…serious? Am I…do I need a colonoscopy? Don’t beat around the bush, just tell me straight. I’m an old man, I’ve lived a long life. I can handle the truth. And frankly, I’d rather know the worst than be left wondering. A colonoscopy…that sounds…unpleasant. Is that what you’re going to recommend?
DOCTOR: You are right to ask directly, Mr. Rowbottom. Given the tenderness I felt during the exam and the presence of blood, a colonoscopy is what I would recommend. A colonoscopy is the best way to visualize the entire colon and identify the source of the bleeding. It allows us to look for polyps, masses, inflammation, or other abnormalities that could be causing your symptoms. I understand your apprehension about it. It is a preparation and the procedure itself can be uncomfortable, but it's generally a safe procedure and is often life-saving. The preparation involves cleaning out your colon, which can be unpleasant. The procedure itself is performed under sedation, so you won't feel any pain. The doctor will insert a flexible tube with a camera into your colon to visualize the lining. We can discuss the preparation process in more detail and address any concerns you may have. We can also discuss alternatives, but a colonoscopy provides the most accurate diagnosis and is the best course of action in your case. Do you have any questions about the colonoscopy?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy…Good heavens. Cleaning out my colon… Sedation…It all sounds…undignified. And unpleasant. But…you said it’s the best course of action. And frankly, I’m tired of wondering. Tired of the discomfort and the uncertainty. Alright. Alright, Doctor. Do it. Schedule the colonoscopy. Get it over with. But I want all the details. The preparation…everything. I want to know what to expect. And I want it done as soon as possible. No delays. The sooner it’s over, the better. And make sure the doctor is…gentle. I’m an old man, remember? And I expect to be treated with respect. I suppose this is what happens when you reach eighty-eight years old. Everything starts to…fall apart. Just get it over with, Doctor. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns, and I will ensure you are fully informed and treated with the utmost respect throughout the entire process. The preparation will require you to follow a clear liquid diet for 24 hours prior to the procedure. You will also need to take a laxative to completely empty your colon. We will provide you with detailed instructions and a list of approved clear liquids. It's important to stay hydrated during the preparation. The procedure itself typically takes about 30-60 minutes. You will be sedated throughout the procedure, so you won't feel any pain or discomfort. The doctor will insert a flexible tube with a camera into your colon to visualize the lining. If any polyps or abnormal tissues are found, they will be removed for further examination. I will schedule the procedure with Dr. Abernathy, who is very experienced in performing colonoscopies. He is known for being gentle and thorough. The soonest available appointment is August 15th. Would that date work for you?
PATIENT: August 15th… alright. That’ll have to do. As long as it gets done. Just make sure everything is arranged smoothly. The preparation instructions…I want them clear and concise. No complicated medical jargon. And make sure someone can drive me home afterward. I’m not going to be in any condition to drive myself. And… what if they find something? What if it’s…serious? Don’t sugarcoat it, Doctor. I want to know what to expect. The worst-case scenario. I’ve lived a long life, and I’m prepared for anything. Just…be honest with me. That’s all I ask. Be honest. And…thank you, Doctor. For…for taking the time to listen and explain everything. I appreciate it. It’s…reassuring to know that I’m in good hands. Even if it involves a colonoscopy. Alright. August 15th it is. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I will ensure everything is arranged smoothly. I will provide you with clear and concise preparation instructions, and we will arrange for transportation home after the procedure. If any abnormalities are found during the colonoscopy, Dr. Abernathy will take a biopsy for further examination. The results of the biopsy will be available in about a week. If the results are concerning, we will discuss treatment options with you. These options may include medication, surgery, or other therapies. It's important to remember that not all abnormalities are cancerous. Many polyps are benign, and can be removed without any further treatment. We will monitor you closely and provide you with the best possible care, regardless of the findings. I'm glad I could reassure you, Mr. Rowbottom. You are in good hands, and we will take care of you every step of the way. I will have my nurse, Sarah, contact you to schedule the procedure and provide you with the preparation instructions. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. Just…get it scheduled. And…thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I suppose…I’ll see you on August 15th. Goodbye, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You take care, Mr. Rowbottom. We'll see you on August 15th.
