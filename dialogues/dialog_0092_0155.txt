DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a shaking. In my hands, mostly. Been happening for a while now, I reckon. Honestly, time kinda slips away these days. Don't remember exactly when it started, just that it’s… there.
DOCTOR: I understand. A shaking, primarily in your hands, that has developed gradually over time. That’s helpful to know. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this shaking?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. It's worse when I try to do things, you know? Like… holding a cup, or writing. It’s not constant, thankfully. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable. Other times… well, other times it's hard to even get a fork to my mouth. It doesn’t hurt, though. Just… frustrating. And embarrassing. I used to be good with my hands, always fixing things around the house.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s action-related – worse when you’re trying to perform tasks like holding a cup or writing, and it comes and goes in severity. And you haven't noticed any pain associated with it. That's good to know. Could you tell me if the shaking is present when you are resting your hands – just sitting there, not doing anything?
PATIENT: Resting… Let me think. Not usually, no. When I'm just… sitting, it’s calmer. It’s definitely more when I try to do something. Like… if I’m trying to tighten a screw, or… oh, buttoning my shirt. Things like that. I don’t think it shakes when I'm just… being. Does that make sense? I'm not good at explaining things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. It sounds like it's primarily a tremor that occurs with activity, which is a very helpful detail. Now, have you noticed anything else accompanying this shaking?
PATIENT: Accompanying… hmm. Well, my hands feel… weaker, maybe? Not like completely gone, but… it takes more effort to grip things, you know? And I’ve been a bit clumsy lately. Dropped a few things, bumped into furniture. Old age, probably. I don’t know if that’s related to the shaking, or just… me getting old. Honestly, everything feels a bit… off these days. It’s hard to say what’s new and what’s just… normal.
DOCTOR: Weakness and some increased clumsiness alongside the tremor. It’s good you’re bringing these things up, even if it's hard to pinpoint exactly what’s new. We'll try to sort through it all. Have you noticed any stiffness in your hands or joints, particularly in the mornings?
PATIENT: Stiffness… now that you mention it, maybe a little. It’s not awful, not like arthritis or anything, but they feel… tight sometimes when I first wake up. It loosens up after I get moving, though. Just takes a bit of… working through it. I figured it was just old age again. I haven't really paid much attention, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, some morning stiffness that improves with movement. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your overall health, if you don’t mind. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. Not really. Still eat about the same, I suppose. Maybe a little less, now that I think about it. It’s harder to cook for one, after the divorce. As for weight… I don’t weigh myself anymore. Too depressing, probably. I've definitely lost some weight, but I couldn’t tell you how much. I’m mostly skin and bones these days, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I understand. Changes in appetite and some unintentional weight loss. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, have you noticed any difficulties with your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance… I’ve stumbled a few times lately, more than usual. Thought I was just being clumsy again. It’s hard to say if it’s a balance thing, or just… me not paying attention. I don't feel dizzy, though. Just… off-kilter sometimes. It’s not enough to fall, but enough to… catch myself. It's probably nothing, honestly. I’m an old man. Things go wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unsteadiness, occasional stumbling, but no dizziness. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Jezik. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh boy. Let me think. The doctor told me years ago I had a bit of high blood pressure, but they put me on some pills, and I took them for a while. I stopped taking them, though. Didn’t feel like I needed them anymore. And… I had a bad gall bladder once, had to have it taken out. Other than that… not much, I don't think. I'm not one for doctors, never have been. I don't remember all the details, it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure, treated with medication in the past, and a previous gall bladder removal. That’s helpful. And you stopped taking the blood pressure medication some time ago. Do you know if you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, that I recall. I’ve taken all sorts of pills over the years, for aches and pains, colds, whatever. Never had a problem. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Though, I haven’t taken much lately. Wait… my skin gets itchy sometimes after I use certain soaps. But that’s not a real allergy, is it? Just… sensitive skin, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, but some skin sensitivity to certain soaps. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don't take anything. I tried some vitamins once, but they didn't seem to do anything, so I stopped. I prefer just… dealing with things as they come. No pills for me, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik, thank you for providing me with such a detailed history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I'd like to take a look at your hands, check your reflexes, and assess your balance and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. I'm not fond of doctors, but if it’ll help figure out what’s going on with my hands, I suppose. Just… try to be quick, alright? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’ll do my best to be as quick and thorough as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. I’m examining your hands now. I do observe a slight tremor at rest and more pronounced with movement, as you described. The tremor seems to be more noticeable on your right hand. Your grip strength feels slightly diminished. I’m also checking your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Finally, I’ll have you stand and walk a few steps so I can assess your balance and coordination. Your gait is a little unsteady, and you appear to have some difficulty with balance.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… what I’ve been feeling, alright. The shakiness, the unsteadiness… feels good to know you see it too, not just me imagining things. So… what does it mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m not one for fancy medical talk, so please, just tell me straight. What’s going on with my hands?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, based on what you’ve told me and the findings from my examination, the most likely possibility is that you’re experiencing essential tremor. This is a common neurological condition that causes a rhythmic shaking, typically in the hands, and often gets worse with activity. It’s not usually a sign of a more serious condition, but it can be bothersome. The diminished reflexes and mild balance issues could be related to the tremor, or simply a result of age-related changes. However, to rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will help us check for things like thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, and other conditions that can sometimes mimic the symptoms of essential tremor. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and to discuss possible treatment options, such as medication or physical therapy. Would you be open to those steps?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a neurologist… it just keeps going, doesn't it? Honestly, I just want it to stop shaking. But… alright. If it’ll help figure things out, I suppose. I don’t like it, but… I want to know what’s going on. So, yeah. Blood tests, neurologist… whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… try to make it quick, alright? I’m not getting any younger. And… can I still drink my coffee? I don’t want to give that up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. We’ll proceed with the blood tests. I’ll write you a requisition form, and you can take it to the lab at your convenience. As for the neurologist, I’ll prepare a referral for you. It may take a few weeks to get an appointment, but we’ll get it arranged. And yes, you can absolutely still drink your coffee. There’s no need to restrict caffeine unless it significantly worsens your tremor, which isn't typically the case. We'll monitor your symptoms and adjust your plan as needed. I'll give you a written summary of today's discussion, including the results of your blood tests when they come back, and the contact information for the neurologist's office. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… tired. And worried, I guess. But… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not making me feel like I’m just… losing my mind. I’ll get the blood tests done, and I’ll call the neurologist’s office. If I think of anything, I’ll give them a ring. I guess that’s all. And… try not to make me come back too often, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. We’ll take things one step at a time. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
