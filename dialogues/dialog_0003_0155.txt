DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I am Dr. Yackey. Please, have a seat. Now, I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well... it's this shaking. My hand... it just... trembles. Been happening for a while now, I think. Honestly, time… it all kinda blurs together, you know? It’s just… annoying, mostly. Makes it hard to do things. Especially with tools. I used to be good with my hands. Worked at the plant for… a long time. But the shaking... it’s getting worse, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “a while now” isn't terribly helpful, Mr. Jezik. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific... hmm. Geez, Doc, like I said, time’s a bit of a fog. Maybe… six months? Could be longer. It started real subtle, just a little quiver when I was trying to hold a wrench steady. Now it’s… well, it’s noticeable all the time, I suppose. Even when I'm just sitting. I don't know. Six months sounds right, give or take. Is that good enough? I really don’t remember dates too well, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Six months. Very well. And is this shaking limited to your hands, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Limited… huh. I… I think so. My legs feel a bit unsteady sometimes, but I just figured that was getting old. And… maybe a bit of nerves. I haven’t paid it much mind, to be honest. It's the hands that bother me. Definitely the hands. I haven’t noticed it in my feet or anything. Not that I’ve looked for it, really. Just the hands. It's like… they have a mind of their own, sometimes.
DOCTOR: And does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Well, concentrating does. Trying to do something delicate, like… screwing in a tiny screw, for example. Or… writing. That makes it really bad. And… stress, I suppose. Though, what doesn't make me stressed these days? Coffee, maybe? I used to drink a lot of coffee at the plant... but I don’t know if that does it. It’s hard to say. Everything just feels a bit shaky these days, you know? Not sure what makes it worse, specifically. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Do you have any other medical problems, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Medical problems… well, I had my gallbladder taken out years ago. A long time ago. And… … my blood pressure gets a bit high sometimes. The doctor at home used to give me pills for it, but… I stopped taking them. Didn’t feel like I needed them all the time. I’ve also got a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that's just old age, I figure. Nothing else that I can think of. Really. I’m not one for doctors, you see. Usually just try to tough things out.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not a one. Stopped taking the blood pressure pills like I said. Don’t take anything. I try to avoid all that stuff if I can. Never liked pills much. Just hoping you can figure out what's going on with the shaking. It's making life… difficult. And I really don’t want to end up needing help with things. I like being independent, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's have a look at your hands, Mr. Jezik. Please extend your arms. And could you please try to touch your finger to your nose?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. It’s… harder than it looks, Doc. The shaking's really bad today, isn't it? I usually can do it, but… not so much right now. See? It just… won’t stay still. It's like it has a mind of its own, I tell ya. I used to be steady as a rock, could do anything with my hands.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. There is a resting tremor present in both hands, more pronounced on this side. And there is also an intention tremor when reaching for your nose. I’m also noting mild rigidity. Now, could you please tap your heel against the floor with your foot?
PATIENT: Like this? It's a bit awkward. My knee’s been acting up, you see. Not sure if that’s making it harder. It feels… stiff, sometimes. It’s not as smooth as it used to be, that's for sure. Old age, I reckon. Is that what you wanted?
DOCTOR: Yes, that will be sufficient. Mr. Jezik, based on what you've told me and my brief examination, your symptoms are suggestive of a possible movement disorder. It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation. We'll need to rule out other causes. Now, I’d like to order some blood work, including a thyroid panel and a complete metabolic panel. And I’m also going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can perform additional tests, such as a DaTscan, to help determine the underlying cause of your tremor. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? And… tests? Like, what kind of tests? I don’t like tests, Doc. I’m not much for poking and prodding. And what's a… DaTscan? Sounds… complicated. I just want to know what's making my hand shake. Is it serious? I don’t want anything serious. I mostly just want to keep doing things, you know? And I don't want to have to rely on anyone. I really don’t like tests…
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your apprehension. However, it is important to determine the underlying cause of your tremor. A DaTscan is a non-invasive imaging test that helps us visualize the dopamine transporters in your brain. It can help differentiate between different types of movement disorders. As for whether it's serious… it’s too early to say. There are many potential causes, some more manageable than others. Without further investigation, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis. Now, I strongly recommend you follow through with the referral to the neurologist. They are the specialists in this field. Would you like me to provide you with a list of neurologists in the area?
PATIENT: Dopamine… transporters? No, no, that sounds… complicated. I just… I don't want to get all tied up in a lot of tests and procedures. I'm an old man, Doc. I just want to live out my days in peace. Is there anything… anything simpler we can do? Maybe some pills? Something to just calm the shaking down? I really don't want to see a specialist. And I certainly don't want to be poked and prodded. Just something to stop the shaking… please. I’m not sure I can handle all this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your reluctance, but attempting to treat your symptoms without a proper diagnosis is… irresponsible. While there are medications that can help manage tremors, they are often associated with side effects, and they may not be appropriate for all conditions. And frankly, prescribing medication without knowing the underlying cause would be a disservice to your health. I cannot, in good conscience, simply prescribe something to "calm the shaking down" without a thorough evaluation. Now, I strongly recommend you reconsider the referral to the neurologist. It is the best course of action. But if you absolutely refuse, I will document your refusal in your chart. However, I must advise you that without further investigation, your condition could worsen. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
