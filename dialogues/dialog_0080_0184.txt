DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Trendler, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Trendler. Kern Trendler. Look, I don’t have all day. I’m here 'cause… well, look at me. I used to be strong. Pile driver operator, you know? Now… not so much. I want somethin’ done about it. Not happy with how things look.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. I understand you're not feeling your best and want to get to the bottom of things. “Not happy with how things look” is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about what specifically is bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Everything! Look at these arms, all… floppy. And my stomach? Soft. Used to be hard as a rock, could take a punch, I tell ya. Now it jiggles. It’s… embarrassing. I wear shirts to hide it, even in this heat. Don't want people lookin’ at that.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're concerned about loss of muscle mass and changes in your body composition. That can be really frustrating, especially when you've been used to being strong and active. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. First, can you tell me how long you’ve been noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, a good long while now. Maybe… five years? Six? Hard to say exactly. Started slow, then it just… kept goin’. After my wife passed, things just weren't the same. Didn't have the appetite, didn't have the energy. Just… not the same. Used to cook big meals, now I eat a sandwich if I'm lucky. And I ain't been liftin' nothin' heavy since… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. Losing a partner is incredibly difficult, and it's completely understandable that it would affect your appetite and energy levels. That can have a big impact on your body. So, it sounds like these changes have been gradual over the past five or six years, and coincided with a significant life event. Aside from the loss of appetite and energy, have you noticed any other changes in your health?
PATIENT: Well… I get tired easier. Real easy. Used to be able to work all day, now I gotta sit down every hour. And my skin… it's droopy. Like an old man's. Not like it used to be. And my clothes don’t fit right no more. Everything’s too big. Even the strong shirts.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, changes in your skin, and clothes fitting differently… that gives me a bit more to work with. Have you noticed any muscle weakness, or difficulty with things like getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, or lifting objects?
PATIENT: Weakness? Of course weakness! I told you I ain't been liftin' nothin'! It takes effort to get outta this chair, you know. And the stairs? Forget about it. I take 'em slow, holdin' on tight. Don't want to fall and break somethin'. I used to run up those stairs two at a time! Now… slow and careful. Very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It sounds like you’re experiencing a noticeable decline in your strength and endurance. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else that your doctor has diagnosed?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Heart problems? Not that I know of. Had a bit of trouble with my back years ago, from the work, but that's all. Used to get it adjusted, but haven't been in years. I take somethin’ for my blood pressure, the doctor gave it to me a while back. Small pill, blue one. Can’t remember the name though. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, that’s good to know. A bit of back trouble in the past and medication for blood pressure. Do you remember when the doctor started you on the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Must be… ten years ago? Maybe a little more. After my wife got sick, things were stressful. The doctor said my pressure was too high. So he gave me the pills. I take one every mornin'. Don’t forget that one, important to keep that steady.
DOCTOR: Okay, ten years on blood pressure medication. That's good information. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had nothin' like that. Always been tough, never needed one. Hospitalized… once, when I broke my arm when I was a young man. Fell off a roof, tryin' to be a hero. But that was a long time ago. Small break, healed up quick. Didn’t need much doctorin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries, a broken arm when you were younger. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Can eat anything. Used to love my wife’s cookin’, she put everything in there. No problems with pills either. Never had a reaction to nothin’. I’m a tough man, remember?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the blue pill. That's it. Don’t bother with all those fancy vitamins and stuff. Waste of money, if you ask me. My wife used to take somethin’ for her bones, but I never got into all that. I eat a good sandwich, that’s enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmmph. My father lived to be old, eighty-something. Strong man, like me. Worked hard all his life. Mother died young, sickness I think. Had a brother, he was… well, he didn’t take care of himself. Didn’t live as long as he should have. Not much else to tell you. We weren't a family for visitin’ doctors, mostly just toughed things out.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father lived to a good age, your mother died young, and your brother didn’t take care of himself. Thank you for that information. Now, Mr. Trendler, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Look, I told you I ain't been feelin' well. What's the point of pokin' and proddin'? But fine, get it over with. Just don't take all day. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. I understand you’re short on time. I’ll be as quick as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is normal. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs sound clear, but you are breathing a bit shallowly. Your abdomen is soft. Muscle strength is noticeably reduced, particularly in your arms and legs. Your reflexes are a little slow. I'm also noticing some skin laxity, especially around your stomach and arms. Your gait is a bit unsteady. You are walking slowly and deliberately. Based on this exam, it seems like you are experiencing muscle weakness, reduced muscle mass, and some skin laxity. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. I think it's important to get some blood work done to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms. We should check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and complete blood count.
PATIENT: Blood work? More pokin’ and proddin’? Look, I’m an old man, not a science experiment. Is this really necessary? Can’t you just… give me somethin’ to build me back up? Like a strong tonic, or somethin’? I don't need to know why, I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I wish I could just give you a “tonic” to make everything better, but unfortunately, it doesn’t work that way. To figure out the best way to help you, we need to understand why you’re feeling this way. The blood work will help us rule out any serious medical conditions, like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies, that could be contributing to your symptoms. It's also important to consider that muscle loss can happen naturally as we age, but it can be accelerated by other factors. The blood work will help us identify if there’s anything we can do to slow down the process and improve your strength and energy levels. Think of it this way: it's like trying to fix a car without knowing what's wrong with the engine. We need to do some tests to get a clear picture of the situation before we can start making repairs. Would you be willing to let me order the blood work?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Do your pokin’ and proddin’. Get it over with. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And if it's somethin’ serious, I’m holdin’ you responsible. Just get it done quickly. I got a life, you know. A short one, at that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. I understand. I'll get the blood work ordered right away. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take too long. They’ll need about ten minutes of your time. Here’s the form. You’ll need to take this to the lab, and they’ll draw the samples. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to eat a balanced diet with plenty of protein, and engaging in some gentle exercise, like walking, if you’re able. Even small changes can make a difference. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just get this over with. I ain't askin' for much, just want to feel like myself again. That’s all. Balanced diet? I eat sandwiches. Exercise? I walk to the store. What more do you want from an old man? Just get the results back quickly, that’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. I’ll make sure the lab prioritizes your results, and I’ll call you as soon as they're available. It typically takes 2-3 business days, but I’ll do my best to expedite things. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe weakness, please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Here’s a phone number for you to reach me directly if you have any concerns. I’m going to have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, just to discuss the results and go over a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A week? Fine. A week is… acceptable. As long as you don’t keep me waitin’. And don’t expect me to be happy about it, understand? I ain’t got all day. Just… get it done. And send me the bill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment and go over the billing process. I'm going to leave you to it now. Thank you for coming in today, and I look forward to discussing the results with you next week. .
PATIENT: Hmph.
