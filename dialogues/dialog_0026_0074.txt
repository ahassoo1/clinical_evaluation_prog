DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Venna, please. It’s my blood pressure, I reckon. Been a little high lately, according to the machine at the pharmacy. Don't rightly know what all that means, but they said I should get it checked by a real doctor. Want to get it sorted quick, if you don’t mind. Old bones don’t like worryin’.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna, please do. It’s good you’re getting it checked. High blood pressure is very common, and we can definitely sort it out. “Reckon” is a good word – it’s always best to listen to your body and get things checked. Now, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the machine at the pharmacy showing a high reading?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… maybe a month ago now? I go to get my sugar-free cookies, you see, and they got one of them machines there now. First time, didn’t pay it much mind. But then it kept showin’ high, every time. That’s when I figured somethin’ wasn’t right. I don’t usually bother with machines, to be honest. Always felt a doctor’s ear was better than a cold piece of metal.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Venna. A doctor’s ear is often best. And it’s good you remembered it happening over the past month – that’s helpful. Do you happen to know what the numbers were reading on the machine, if you recall?
PATIENT: Numbers… oh dear. That’s where my memory gets a bit fuzzy. I think it was somethin’ like… 14 and 9… somethin’ like that? Or maybe 15 and 9? I don't rightly recall the whole thing. They looked awfully big numbers, though. That’s why I came in. It scared me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, 14 and 9, or possibly 15 and 9… that gives us a starting point. Those are a bit higher than we’d like to see. It's good you came in to get it checked; a little worry is always better than a bigger problem down the road. Now, besides the readings at the pharmacy, have you been feeling any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… well, now that you mention it… I’ve had a few headaches lately. Not awful, just… dull, behind my eyes, mostly. And I get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast. Thought it was just my age, to be honest. Old bones creakin', you know? I been drinkin' plenty of water, tryin' to help that, but it ain't done much.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches and some dizziness when standing up… those can sometimes be related to blood pressure, but they can also have other causes. It's good you’re paying attention to your body. Now, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Just my age, Doctor. Heh. No, not really. I had a bit of trouble with my sugar a while back, but that's under control now with my diet. I watch what I eat, mostly. And my arthritis flares up now and then, but that's just old livin’. No other fancy conditions, I reckon. I've been pretty lucky, all in all.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Venna. It sounds like you've been taking good care of yourself. It’s good the sugar is under control, and that you manage your arthritis. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbin' a tree, but that healed up just fine. And I had my tonsils out when I was young, but that was ages ago. Apart from that, no hospitals or surgeries, no sir. Been lucky there, too. I've always been a bit of a homebody.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Venna. No major surgeries or hospitalizations is excellent. Now, thinking about your family, is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – who has had high blood pressure, heart problems, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mama, she had a weak heart, I think. She wasn’t one for goin' to doctors much either, bless her soul. She just… slowed down over time. And my brother, he had somethin’ with his kidneys when he got older, I remember hearin'. But apart from that, not that I recall. We weren't a family for talkin’ about aches and pains much, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Venna. Many families aren’t. Still, that’s helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my arthritis, when it flares up. It's called… well, I forget the fancy name. Little white pills. And sometimes, when I'm feelin' run down, I take a vitamin D supplement, since I don't get out in the sun much. Apart from that, no, not really. I try to get most of what I need from my food.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis medication and occasional Vitamin D. That’s good to know. Now, just one more question about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Lord, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mama always said they were the devil’s sticks, and I always listened to her. And I don’t drink much either, just a little sip of wine with supper sometimes, if I'm feelin' fancy. I mostly just like sittin’ on my porch, bakin’ cookies and watchin’ the birds.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Venna. A healthy lifestyle like that is very important. Alright, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your overall health. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Long as it don't take too long. Old bones get stiff if I sit still too long. I'm ready when you are. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venna. I'll be as quick as I can. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, as we suspected, 158 over 92. Your heart sounds strong, but regular. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. And I'm noticing your pulses in your lower legs are a little bit weaker than I’d like. This could be related to age, or something else. I'm also going to listen to your abdomen and check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Weak pulses, you say? That don't sound good. Always been a bit cold in my feet, but I just figured it was the winter. What does all this mean, Doctor? Don't sugarcoat it, please. I'd rather know what I'm dealin’ with. Old lady’s nerves, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Venna, and I appreciate your honesty. Weak pulses can sometimes be a sign of something called peripheral artery disease, which means there's some narrowing of the arteries in your legs. It’s why you might feel cold in your feet. It doesn’t automatically mean anything serious, but we need to investigate further. Now, the elevated blood pressure and the weak pulses together suggest we need to consider a few possibilities. High blood pressure that isn't controlled can damage your arteries over time, and that could be contributing to the weaker pulses. It's also possible something else is going on. I want to run a few tests to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order a blood test to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. And I'd also like to do an ankle-brachial index – it’s a simple test that compares the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms. This will help us see how well the blood is flowing in your legs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Sounds like a lot of fuss. But alright, if you think it’s necessary. I reckon I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just… please explain everything to me, nice and slow. I don't understand all that fancy medical talk. And… how long will this take? And will it be painful? I don’t have much patience for pain these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venna. We’ll take things slowly, and I’ll explain everything in plain language. I understand it can be overwhelming. The blood test is just a routine check to see how your organs are functioning. It won’t take long – just a little pinch, like when you get your sugar checked. And the ankle-brachial index is very simple. I’ll use a small cuff to measure the blood pressure in your ankles and arms. It doesn’t hurt at all – it just takes a few minutes. The lab results usually take a few days to come back. Once I have those, we can discuss the results and come up with a plan. It’s possible we’ll need to start medication to control your blood pressure, and we might also recommend some lifestyle changes, like a healthy diet and regular exercise. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Manageable… I reckon so. I can handle pills, and I'm pretty good at watchin' what I eat. And I walk a little every day, even if it's just to the mailbox. So… pills and walkin'? That don't sound too bad. I just don’t want a lot of fuss. And… how much will all this cost? My insurance is private, but still. Old lady on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Venna. Pills and walking is a good start. As for the cost, let me check with the billing department to get you an estimate. The blood test and ankle-brachial index are usually covered by most insurance plans, but there might be a copay. I'll have my assistant, Sarah, give you a call tomorrow with the details. She's very good at explaining these things. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a low dose of a blood pressure medication called Lisinopril. It's a common medication with minimal side effects. We'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. I'll also give you some written instructions about how to take it. And I’ll write down some information about healthy diet and exercise. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, you say? I'll write that down. And Sarah will call tomorrow with the cost. That’s good. Hmm… let me think. What if I forget to take the pills? My memory ain’t what it used to be. And… what should I be lookin' for? Like, if somethin' goes wrong? I don't want to end up in the hospital, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Venna. It’s very important to be prepared. First, about forgetting the pills, the best thing to do is try to make it part of your daily routine. Take it with breakfast, or maybe with your evening tea – whatever works best for you. You could also set a reminder on your phone, or ask a family member or friend to help you remember. As for what to look out for, some of the common side effects of Lisinopril are dizziness, lightheadedness, and a dry cough. If you experience any of these, let me know right away. Also, if you notice any swelling in your ankles or feet, or have any difficulty breathing, that’s a sign to call 911. It’s very rare, but it’s important to be aware. I'll also write down all these things on a sheet of paper for you. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns at all. We’re here to help. Do you think you're ready to schedule a follow-up appointment so we can check on your progress?
PATIENT: Alright, a routine and a reminder. I can manage that. And I'll write down all the things to watch out for. Swelling and breathin' trouble... got it. A follow-up… yes, I reckon that’s a good idea. Just… not too soon. Give me a week or two? I like to take things slow, you know. Old lady bones don’t like bein’ rushed.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Venna. A week or two sounds excellent. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for August 16th, then. Sarah will call you tomorrow to confirm the time. In the meantime, please remember to take the Lisinopril as directed and keep me updated if you have any questions or concerns. I'm confident we can get your blood pressure under control and keep you feeling healthy and happy. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I reckon that’s all. You’ve been very patient with an old lady’s worries. Thank you kindly. And thank Sarah for callin’ tomorrow. I appreciate your help. Now, if you'll excuse me, I best get home and make myself some cookies. Gotta keep my strength up, you know!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. It was my pleasure. And please do make those cookies – a little bit of sweetness is always good for the soul. Don't hesitate to call if anything comes up. And have a lovely day. .
PATIENT: .
