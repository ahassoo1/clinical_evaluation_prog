DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Astore. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is good to meet you too. My weakness… it keeps getting worse, you see. It’s this… this MS thing the other doctors told me about. It’s making things hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore. Weakness getting worse… I understand. And it’s been diagnosed as Multiple Sclerosis by other doctors, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Some time ago now. They did tests and everything. I don't remember all the details, to be honest. It was a long time back, and my mind isn’t what it used to be. But they said MS, and it’s just… getting harder to do things. Things I used to do easy.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s very common to have trouble remembering details from past medical visits, especially when it was some time ago. We can certainly review what’s been going on now, and I can access records from other doctors if you're comfortable with that. To get a better understanding, could you tell me more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, please do look at the other records. That would be good. As for the weakness… it’s mostly in my legs. They just… feel heavy. And sometimes, it’s hard to… to keep my balance. I’ve tripped a few times lately. Not fall-down bad, but enough to scare my wife. It feels different each day, too. Some days it’s just tired, other days it’s like they don’t want to move at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness in the legs, feeling heavy, balance issues… and it varies from day to day. That's helpful to know. Do you notice if anything specific makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I think… when I get too warm, it gets worse. Hot days are hard. And being tired makes it much, much worse. After I’ve been on my feet for a long time, I really feel it. Resting helps, of course. And my wife helps me stay cool, bless her heart. She always has a fan nearby. But it doesn’t always fix it completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, heat and fatigue seem to be triggers, and rest helps. That’s good information. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, but it happens. And I get tired… really tired. Even after a good night’s sleep. It’s not like the normal tired, you know? It's… a deep tiredness. And my hands sometimes feel numb, like when they’ve been asleep. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Astore. Blurry vision, deep fatigue, and numbness in your hands… We’re building a good picture here. Do you have any trouble with your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: Oh… um… yes, actually. Sometimes it’s… harder to go. Not always, but more often now than before. I don't like to talk about it, but it’s the truth. My wife helps with that, too. She notices when I’m… struggling. It’s embarrassing, but… that’s just how it is.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Astore, and thank you for being so open with me. It’s important information. And there's absolutely no need to be embarrassed - these things are common with conditions like MS. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you had any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long time ago. And I broke my arm once playing football. But other than that… not much. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Just this MS thing now. And the usual aches and pains of getting old, of course! My wife keeps telling me to slow down, but I like to stay busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed, broken arm, and generally healthy otherwise. That’s good to know. Any family history of MS, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… a hard question. My family is… very big. And from a long ways away, Samoa. I don't really know much about their medical problems. My mother, she had… arthritis, I think. And my brother, he had some trouble with his heart when he was older. But no one I remember having anything like this. It feels like it just came on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and heart trouble in the family, but no known neurological conditions. And you said your family is from Samoa?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. My mother and father, they both came from Samoa many years ago. I was born here, but I still feel a strong connection to the islands. It’s a beautiful place. And they lived a very simple life, very close to the land. I try to remember those lessons, even now. Though things are very different here, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Astore. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see... I take something for my blood pressure. A small white pill. And sometimes, when my muscles get really stiff, the doctor gives me something for that too. But I can’t remember the names. My wife handles most of that. She keeps a list, I'm sure. I’m not very good with remembering pills. It's a bit embarrassing, but that’s the truth. I can ask her when I get home.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure and something for muscle stiffness, names unknown. We can certainly get a list from your wife or the pharmacy. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember the names. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. My legs aren’t as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore. If you could sit here for me, please. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little on the slower side, which can be common with MS. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength in your legs. Can you please lift each leg up, one at a time?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. There we go. It’s harder than it used to be, you know? Feels like there’s… weight holding it down. And that’s the other one. It’s… getting harder and harder, the older I get. I used to be very strong, you know? I played football in my youth. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you, Mr. Astore. And I appreciate you telling me about your football days. Now, I’m going to check your sensation in your legs. Just tell me if you can feel this when I touch you. Okay, sensation is a little diminished, particularly on the outer sides of your feet. Finally, I’d like you to stand up and walk for me, if you’re comfortable. Just a few steps will do. Okay, thank you, Mr. Astore. Alright, well, that gives me a good initial picture. It's consistent with your previous diagnosis of MS, and the symptoms you’re describing. It seems like the weakness and balance issues are progressing, and there’s some diminished sensation in your feet.
PATIENT: That’s what I was afraid of, Doctor. It just keeps getting worse. What does that mean? Is there… something you can do? I don’t want to end up in a wheelchair. My wife would never forgive me. I want to stay active, you know? Help around the house, maybe even take the grandchildren to the park. Is that still possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Astore. It’s completely natural to feel anxious about the progression of MS. And it's good you're thinking about what's important to you - staying active and being there for your family. The good news is that there are many things we can do to manage MS and slow its progression. We can’t cure it, unfortunately, but we can definitely work to maintain your quality of life. Based on your symptoms and the exam, I recommend we start with a few things. First, I’d like to order an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to get a clearer picture of the disease activity. This will help us determine the best course of treatment. Second, I want to refer you to a neurologist specializing in MS. They will be able to offer more specialized care and discuss different medication options. There are disease-modifying therapies that can help slow the progression of MS. Third, physical therapy will be very important. A physical therapist can help you strengthen your muscles, improve your balance, and teach you strategies to conserve energy. Finally, it’s important to focus on a healthy lifestyle. That includes a balanced diet, regular exercise , and getting enough sleep. Does that sound like a reasonable plan to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. I trust your judgement. An MRI… that’s alright. And a specialist… that makes sense. I want to do everything I can. Physical therapy… yes, I think that would help. And a healthy lifestyle… my wife would be happy to hear that. She’s always telling me to eat my vegetables! So, what do I need to do first? The MRI… where do I go? And how do I get to see the specialist? It’s just… a lot to take in, you know? My mind isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps you could give me something in writing? For my wife?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Astore. I completely understand. It is a lot to take in, and I’m happy to provide you with something in writing for your wife. Here you are. This summarizes everything we discussed: the MRI order, the neurologist referral information, and some general tips for managing MS. It also includes my contact information if you have any questions. For the MRI, you’ll need to go to Dorman Imaging, located at 123 Main Street. The phone number is 555-1212. You’ll need to schedule an appointment and let them know it’s for an MS protocol MRI, as per my order. For the neurologist, I’ve already sent a referral to Dr. Emily Carter at Pacific Neurology. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Their number is 555-1313. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment with me in about a month to discuss the MRI results and your progress. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense, Doctor. Dorman Imaging… 555-1212. Dr. Carter… 555-1313. I think I can remember that. My wife will help me keep track of it all, of course. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I feel… hopeful. It’s good to know there are things we can do. Is there anything else I should be doing now? Before the appointments? Any exercises I can start, or anything I should avoid? Perhaps a certain type of food? My wife is a good cook, but she does like to experiment. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. I'm glad I could help. For now, before your appointments, I recommend focusing on gentle exercise that doesn’t overexert you. Walking is great, as long as you’re comfortable and have good balance. Avoid getting overheated, and try to manage your fatigue. Short, frequent rests are better than pushing yourself too hard. As for food, there’s no specific diet for MS, but a healthy, balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is always a good idea. Staying hydrated is also important. It's best to avoid highly processed foods and sugary drinks. And yes, it’s always a good idea to be mindful of anything new your wife tries! We'll discuss this in more detail at your follow-up appointment. For now, focus on getting your appointments scheduled and taking things one step at a time. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I’ll get the appointments scheduled and let my wife know everything. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything.
