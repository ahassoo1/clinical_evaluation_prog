DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Al Corta. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Al Corta is fine, please. It’s…well, it’s my eyesight. It’s been going. Not suddenly, thankfully, but…diminishing. I suppose that’s the polite way to put it. It's rather inconvenient, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, Al, good to meet you. And thank you for clarifying. “Diminishing” is a good way to put it. It sounds frustrating, especially when it impacts your daily life. To get a better understanding, can you tell me more about how it’s been diminishing?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it's difficult to pinpoint precisely. Things just aren't as…sharp. As clear as they once were. I find myself needing more light to read, for one. And distances…judging distance has become rather tricky. I nearly walked into a lamppost last week. Not a good look. It’s not as if I’m asking for miracles, but it's…concerning. I’ve always had excellent vision, you see. It’s just…declining.
DOCTOR: I understand. Needing more light and difficulty with distance – those are definitely things we want to investigate. It's good you noticed these changes, and it's completely reasonable to be concerned, especially with a history of good vision. To help me get a clearer picture, can you tell me approximately when you first started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s…a good question. It wasn't a sudden event, as I said. Perhaps…six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It crept up on me, you see. I attributed it to…age, initially. One expects certain things at my age, doesn’t one? I suppose I simply…ignored it for too long. I really don't have an exact date, Doctor. Is that…problematic?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Al. It's very common for these things to develop gradually. Six months is a helpful timeframe, though. And you're right to consider age as a factor, but we still want to rule out other possibilities. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the blurring or difficulty with distance?
PATIENT: Well…let me see. No…flashes of light, no floaters. My peripheral vision seems alright, as far as I can tell. No pain, thankfully. No double vision. No…halos around lights. I do find my eyes get rather tired after prolonged reading, even with increased illumination. And…I seem to be squinting more often. Subconsciously, I suspect. It’s rather…unseemly, but I can’t seem to help it. Is that…significant?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Al. No flashes, floaters, pain, or double vision is good. The eye fatigue and squinting are significant, and they definitely point us in a direction. Now, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No major conditions. I had a bout of bronchitis a few years back, but that resolved itself. I’m…generally quite healthy, all things considered. I watch my diet, I get plenty of rest… well, as much as one can at my age. I haven’t seen a physician regularly in…quite some time, to be frank. I simply haven’t had the need, you see. I pride myself on…self-sufficiency. I suppose that was foolish. Should I have been more diligent? Perhaps. But I’ve always been…robust.
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you've been generally healthy and prioritize a good lifestyle. And it's not foolish to be self-sufficient, but you're right, regular check-ups are important. We'll get things sorted out. Do you have any family history of eye problems – things like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s another good question. My mother…she wore glasses towards the end of her life. Cataracts, I believe. Nothing dramatic, as I recall. My father…he was a rather stoic man. Didn't discuss such things. I don't recall any other family members having…significant eye issues. Nothing that was ever…mentioned, at least. I come from a large family, you see. Keeping track of everyone's ailments is…a challenge. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Al. Family history of cataracts is helpful to know. Now, just a couple more questions before we do a quick exam. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’m rather averse to medication, to be frank. I believe in letting the body heal itself, whenever possible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s…perfunctory. Nothing regular. No prescriptions, no over-the-counter remedies. I find fresh air and a healthy diet are far more effective. I realize that sounds…old-fashioned. But I’ve always been…resilient.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Al. I respect your preference. Alright, let's do a quick exam. I’m going to check your visual acuity, your peripheral vision, and look at the health of your eyes. It won’t take long. Could you please follow me over to the exam chair?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Lead the way. I trust this won't be…uncomfortable? I haven’t had my eyes examined in…decades, as I recall. I do hope you have a comfortable chair. My joints aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Al. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. We’ll take it slow. I’ll do my best to make it as easy as possible. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels strange or painful. First, let’s start with your visual acuity. I’m going to have you read letters on this chart. Can you see this chart clearly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can see the chart. Though it is…rather small. It's a little blurry, to be honest, but I can discern the letters. I suspect my eyesight is…declining faster than I realized. I do hope this isn't something…serious. Is it permissible to ask what you suspect, at this juncture? I dislike surprises, you see.
DOCTOR: It's alright to be concerned, Al. And I understand your preference for knowing what to expect. We’ll have a clearer picture after the full exam. Okay, let’s start with your right eye. I'm going to cover your left eye. Can you read the smallest line you can on this chart?
PATIENT: Ugh. This is…difficult. The bottom lines are…quite indistinct. I can make out… perhaps the third line from the bottom? Everything is rather…fuzzy. I apologize for the trouble. My eyesight truly isn’t what it once was. Is this…concerning? This feels…significant.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Al. That gives us a starting point. Now, let’s try your left eye. Cover your right eye, please.
PATIENT: Even worse, Doctor. Significantly worse. I can barely make out the first few letters on the top line. Everything is…a blur. This is…disconcerting. I must confess, I’m starting to feel rather anxious. Is this…a common occurrence? Are you seeing anything…alarming? I do hope I haven’t neglected this for too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Al. I understand your anxiety. What we're seeing indicates a reduction in your visual acuity in both eyes. It's not uncommon for vision to change with age, but the degree of change warrants further investigation. Now, I'm going to check your peripheral vision. I’m going to have you look straight ahead and tell me when you see a light appear in your side vision.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I must confess, I always had excellent peripheral vision. Hunting, you see. It requires…awareness. I do hope this isn’t…too difficult. This is…rather unnerving, to be honest. I dislike feeling…vulnerable.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Al. Your peripheral vision is slightly constricted, but within acceptable limits for your age. Now, I’m going to use an ophthalmoscope to look at the back of your eyes. It doesn’t hurt, but I’ll need to get close. It allows me to see your retina, optic nerve, and blood vessels.
PATIENT: Ugh. That's…uncomfortable. A little bright, perhaps? But I’m attempting to remain still. Proceed, Doctor. I trust you are seeing something…informative? This is…rather intrusive, to be frank. I do hope this isn’t a sign of…something serious. I dislike feeling…probed. Do you require me to…blink? Or should I remain perfectly still?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Al. You did very well. It’s important to keep your eye still during the examination. What I’m seeing suggests some mild age-related changes in the retina, which is common. Your optic nerves appear healthy, which is good. I’m also seeing some small drusen, which are tiny deposits under the retina. These are common with age and don’t usually cause problems, but we'll want to monitor them. Based on the examination, it appears you have age-related macular degeneration in its early stages. This is a common condition that affects central vision. Your visual acuity is reduced, as we already determined, but the condition appears to be relatively mild at this time. Does that make sense, Al?
PATIENT: Macular…degeneration? Is that…serious, Doctor? I’ve always prided myself on my…vigorous health. My eyesight is…was…essential. Will I…go blind? I must confess, that is a rather…alarming prognosis. Drusen? This is…unacceptable. I do not…appreciate this news. Is there…anything…that can be done? Anything at all? I refuse to accept this…deterioration. Explain…in layman’s terms, if you please. I dislike medical jargon. I do not…understand these terms. This is…distressing.
DOCTOR: I understand your distress, Al. It’s certainly not the news anyone wants to hear, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is a condition that affects the central part of your vision, the part you use for reading, driving, and recognizing faces. It's a common condition, particularly as we age. It doesn’t typically cause complete blindness, but it can lead to reduced central vision, making it difficult to do those things. The drusen we saw are tiny deposits under the retina, and they’re a sign of early AMD. They can sometimes cause a little distortion in your vision, but often don’t cause any noticeable symptoms at first. Right now, you're in the early stages, which is good. We won't be able to restore your vision at this point, but we can take steps to slow down the progression of the condition and protect your remaining vision. There are certain vitamins and minerals that have been shown to be helpful, specifically a specific formulation called the AREDS2 formula. We can also discuss lifestyle modifications, like protecting your eyes from sunlight with sunglasses, and quitting smoking if you smoke. We’ll also want to monitor your vision regularly with eye exams to check for any changes. Does that make sense, Al?
PATIENT: Vitamins, you say? AREDS2? I suppose that’s…something. But vitamins alone…to combat this…deterioration? It seems…insufficient. Sunglasses? I already protect my eyes from the sun. I am…a practical man. This feels…defeatist. So, I am…destined to lose my vision gradually? Is that…the prognosis? There is…no cure? No…treatment? I refuse to accept this…passivity. I have always been…self-reliant. This…diagnosis…is unacceptable. And what about…driving? I enjoy driving. It is…essential to my independence. Will I be…unable to drive? That is…a significant concern. I must confess, this news…has shaken me. Is there…another specialist I should consult? Someone with…more…optimistic prognosis?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Al. It’s completely natural to feel shaken by this news, and I truly wish there was a simple cure. Unfortunately, there isn’t one at this time. The AREDS2 formula is the most effective treatment we have, and it has been shown to slow the progression of the condition in many people. It’s not a cure, but it can help preserve your vision for longer. As for driving, that’s a very important concern. Right now, you're still able to drive, but we'll need to monitor your vision regularly. If your vision deteriorates to a certain point, you may no longer be able to drive safely. We can discuss this further as your condition progresses. And yes, I absolutely recommend a consultation with a retinal specialist. They are experts in conditions like macular degeneration and can provide a more detailed assessment and discuss all of your treatment options, including potential injections or laser therapy. It’s always good to get a second opinion, and they may have access to more advanced treatments. I can provide you with a referral. Would you like me to schedule a referral for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A referral. Immediately. I must explore all…avenues. I refuse to…succumb to this…deterioration passively. A retinal specialist. The sooner the better. I trust you have a…reputable recommendation? Someone with…a proactive approach? I am…a man of action. I will not…resign myself to this…fate. And what about…daily life? Reading, for instance. I enjoy reading. Will I be…unable to read? Will I require…assistive devices? This is…distressing. I trust you have…resources available? Information regarding…adaptive strategies? I am…a pragmatic man. I will adapt, but I require…guidance. This…diagnosis…has disrupted my…entire existence.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Al. I understand your need for information and resources. I have a referral to Dr. Evelyn Hayes, a highly respected retinal specialist in the city. She’s known for her proactive approach and expertise in managing macular degeneration. I'll get that sent to the front desk for you right away. Regarding daily life, reading may become more challenging as your condition progresses. There are several assistive devices available that can help, such as magnifiers, large-print books, and electronic reading devices. We can also discuss software that can enlarge text on your computer or tablet. The low vision rehabilitation services at the city hospital have specialists who can assess your vision and recommend the best devices and strategies for you. I'll provide you with their contact information as well. Here's a list of resources I’m giving to the nurse to hand you: Dr. Evelyn Hayes’ contact information: 123-4567 Low Vision Rehabilitation Services at City Hospital: 987-6543 The American Macular Degeneration Foundation Website: [https://www.macular.org/] We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one month to discuss your referral appointment with Dr. Hayes and see how you’re doing. Does that sound acceptable, Al?
PATIENT: Acceptable. One month. Very well. I trust these…resources…are legitimate? I dislike wasting my…time on…ineffective strategies. And the AREDS2 formula? Dosage? Specific brand? I require…precise instructions. I am…a methodical man. I do not…appreciate ambiguity. I believe that is…all for now. I trust you have…documented everything…accurately? This…diagnosis…has been…disconcerting. I will…await Dr. Hayes’ assessment. And I expect…a thorough evaluation. Thank you, Doctor. Though I…hesitate to express gratitude…given the circumstances. I will…take my leave now. I have…much to consider.
