DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you too. Well, to put it simply… I feel like I need a bit of a… a restart, I suppose. A jumpstart. I’ve just been feeling… not quite myself lately, and I thought it best to get it checked out. I’m getting on in years, you know, and things just… slow down.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not quite myself” can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me more about what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… It's not one big thing, you understand. It's more like… little things adding up. I tire easily, even after a good night’s sleep. And my memory… well, it isn’t what it used to be. I forget where I put things, or what I was just talking about. Nothing serious, I don’t think. But it’s enough to make me feel… unsettled. I used to be so sharp, you know, with my students. Now… I worry sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue and memory concerns… and you’ve noticed this gradually, rather than something sudden?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s exactly right. It hasn’t been a sudden thing, thankfully. It’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose. Over the past… oh, maybe six months or so? It’s hard to say precisely. Things just feel… a little duller, a little slower. And I find myself needing to write things down constantly now, just to remember appointments or what I need from the store. It wasn’t like that before.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has this been impacting your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Well… yes, a little. I don’t teach anymore, not full-time. But I still volunteer at the elementary school, helping with reading. And sometimes… sometimes I struggle to recall the children’s names, or the stories we were working on. It’s embarrassing, really. And I used to love gardening, but I find myself getting tired after only a short time now. I have to take frequent breaks. It’s… frustrating. I like to do things, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is impacting your quality of life, which is important. Now, let’s talk a bit about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My appetite… it comes and goes, to be honest. Some days I eat very little, other days I feel quite hungry. And yes, I believe I’ve lost a little weight. Not a significant amount, but enough that my clothes feel a bit looser. I haven't been trying to lose weight, that’s for sure. I enjoy my food! Mostly Chamorro dishes, of course. My daughter keeps telling me I need to eat more.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some changes in appetite and unintentional weight loss. And are you having any difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: That’s another good question. Sleep… it’s not as sound as it used to be. I don’t have trouble falling asleep, usually. But I wake up several times during the night. Sometimes it’s just to use the restroom, other times… I don’t know. I just wake up. And then I have trouble getting back to sleep. I wouldn’t say it’s keeping me up all night, but it’s not a restful sleep, you understand. I’m often a bit tired when I wake up, even after getting a full eight hours.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any fevers, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No fevers, chills, or anything like that. I haven't felt sick in that way, not at all. It's more just… this overall feeling of being run down, and a little forgetful. Nothing specific, you see. Just… off. I do get a little achey sometimes, in my joints, but I chalk that up to getting older. My mother had the same thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think... Well, I take a small dose of medication for my blood pressure – Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And I take a daily Vitamin D supplement, my daughter insisted on that. She said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. And occasionally, if my joints are particularly achey, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s about it, really. Nothing major. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, Vitamin D, and occasional ibuprofen. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. And I’m not allergic to anything else either, not food or anything like that. My daughter always asks me that, too, but no, no allergies. I’m quite plain in that respect.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, years ago – oh, maybe twenty years or so – I was diagnosed with mild arthritis, in my hands and knees. That’s why I sometimes take the ibuprofen, when it flares up. And I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered fully from that. Other than that… nothing major. I’ve been generally quite healthy, all my life. I always said it was the Chamorro food! My father lived to be 95, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and a past history of pneumonia. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’ve never had any surgeries. Not a single one. I always avoided them if I could. I didn't like the thought of being under the knife. Thankfully, I’ve never needed any. Just the usual doctor’s visits and check-ups, nothing more serious than that. My mother always said I was too stubborn to let anyone operate on me!
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or dementia?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm. My father, as I said, lived to be 95, but he did have some heart trouble towards the end of his life. He had to be very careful with his diet. And my mother had arthritis, quite badly, like me. As for dementia… well, my aunt, my mother’s sister, did develop some memory problems as she got older. It was very sad. But other than that… not really. We were a fairly healthy family, all things considered. We Chamorros are a strong people, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I always believed in taking care of myself, and that means staying away from those things. My husband didn't drink much either, so it just wasn't part of our life.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Ms. McNabb. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your memory and reflexes. It’ll just take a few minutes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead, please. I’m ready when you are. I’ve always been good at following instructions. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and do a few simple memory tests. Could you please tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… Today is… August… the 2nd. Yes, August the 2nd. And the year… is it 2025? Yes, I believe it is 2025. I think. It feels strange sometimes, you know, keeping track of the years. They seem to go by so quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s good. And can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that’s a good question. Let me think… We’re… Oh, dear. I know we're in the suburbs… near… near the hospital, I think. But the name of the city… it's slipping my mind. It starts with a… a ‘S’ I believe. Is that… San Mateo? No, that doesn’t sound right. Oh, dear, I apologize. I used to know all these things so easily.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's alright, Ms. McNabb. Don't worry about it. We're in Santa Clara. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I’ll say them, and then I'll ask you to remember them later. The words are: apple, table, and penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… and penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. I think I can remember those. They're… everyday words, aren't they? Apple, table, penny. Yes, I’ve got them. Hopefully. It's just… staying focused, you know? Things wander a bit these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, I’m going to do a brief assessment of your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, my. A bit wobbly, I’m afraid. There we go. One… two… three… four. It’s a little difficult, you know, with my arthritis. It makes my knees feel… stiff. But I can manage. I think. Just a bit slow, that's all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. McNabb. That was helpful. Okay, based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, you are experiencing fatigue, memory difficulties, and some changes in sleep. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your gait is a bit unsteady, likely related to your arthritis. The mini-mental state exam is showing some mild deficits in short-term recall, but nothing that immediately suggests a severe problem. It’s important to rule out some possible causes. I'd like to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels, Vitamin B12, and a complete blood count. We’ll also do a urine analysis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to do them. I trust your judgment. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? To feel like myself again. Blood work and a urine analysis… yes, that’s perfectly alright. When can we schedule those?
DOCTOR: Okay. Excellent. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and collect a urine sample right away. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. It’s possible these are just age-related changes, or related to your arthritis, but it’s important to rule out other potential causes. We’ll also want to monitor your blood pressure. I'm going to prescribe you a medication to help lower it. I’m going to prescribe Lisinopril 10mg once daily. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, is that the same medication I was already taking? I thought I was already on Lisinopril… but perhaps the dosage is different? Yes, if that’s what you recommend, Doctor, then I’ll take it. I just want to be sure I understand everything correctly. Could you just explain the difference in dosage to me, please? I don't want to mix anything up.
DOCTOR: You are correct, Ms. McNabb. You are already taking Lisinopril. My apologies for the confusion. The previous dosage was 5mg, I’m increasing it to 10mg daily to better control your blood pressure. It’s the same medication, just a higher dose. The nurse will explain how to take it, and will give you instructions on what to do if you experience any side effects, such as dizziness. It’s very important to stay hydrated while taking Lisinopril, and to avoid getting up too quickly from a sitting position. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make much more sense, Doctor. Thank you for clarifying. The same medication, just a higher dose. And to be careful with dizziness and staying hydrated. I can remember that. I do appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It puts my mind at ease, you know? I just get a little flustered sometimes, with everything going on. When should I expect the results from the blood work, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay. You should receive a call from the clinic within 3-5 business days with the results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please call the clinic immediately. And please schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results and adjust your treatment plan as needed. The nurse will help you schedule that before you leave. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You’ve been very thorough and have answered all my questions. I’m just glad to be getting this checked out. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. It's a comfort to know I'm in good hands. I’ll wait for the nurse to schedule that follow-up appointment, and I'll be sure to call if anything changes. Have a good day, Doctor Alzoubi.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. McNabb. You too. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. The nurse will be in shortly. .
