DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sachar. I'm Dr. Sink. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, I received a letter about getting certified for home health, or hospice care, and I wanted to understand if I qualify. It’s a bit confusing, to be honest, and I'd like to know more about what that even means for someone like me.
DOCTOR: Home health or hospice… yes. A letter, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It came last week, I believe. It had a lot of information, about different levels of care, and… well, truthfully, it was a bit overwhelming. I wasn’t sure which part applied to me, or even if it applied. I just want to make sure I understand everything properly. I’m divorced, and… I don’t have insurance, so I’m worried about costs too, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Not insured…right. Well, those letters are often… broadly distributed. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need either service. Let’s start with you. What’s been going on with your health recently?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s mostly just been feeling tired, Doctor. Really, really tired. And a bit achy, all over. It's been going on for a few months now, and it’s making it hard to… well, to do much of anything, really. It’s affecting my work, you see. I do pressing, at a textile place… requires a lot of standing and being on my feet. It's getting harder and harder each day. Is that something you need to know more about?
DOCTOR: Tired…achy…textile work…standing. Yes, that’s…helpful. And has this tiredness come on suddenly, or gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, Doctor. Definitely gradually. It didn't just appear overnight. It started… I think maybe around February? Just a little more tired than usual. And then it just kept… building. At first I thought it was just stress, honestly. Things have been… difficult, after the divorce, but it hasn't gotten better with time. It's just… gotten worse.
DOCTOR: And any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and aches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I've been a bit short of breath sometimes, especially when I’m walking up stairs. Not always, but enough to notice it. And… I’ve lost my appetite a little. Food just doesn’t taste the same, you know? And honestly, I haven’t been sleeping very well either. I toss and turn a lot. But other than that, I don’t think so. It’s mostly just feeling… worn out, Doctor. Really, really worn out.
DOCTOR: Right. Short of breath, loss of appetite, trouble sleeping… Let's get a quick physical exam done. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here we go. Let me know if you need me to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: 79 kilograms. Alright. And your height is listed as 165 centimeters… is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct, Doctor. 165 centimeters. It hasn’t changed in a very long time! I haven’t grown since… well, a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Good. Let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. In… and out… is that alright? I’m a bit nervous, if you don’t mind my saying so. I don't usually go to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are… within normal limits. Lungs… slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. And do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’ve noticed. I haven't seen any swelling, but I haven’t really been looking for it, if that makes sense. I usually wear closed shoes for work, so maybe I wouldn't notice right away. Would it be very obvious? Should I check when I get home?
DOCTOR: It can be subtle. We'll just do a quick visual check. No significant edema. Alright. Now, let’s check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. I hope this isn't too bad. I don't do well with… well, anything medical, really. I just want to know what’s going on, you see.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Alright. I’m going to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. That will give us a better idea of what’s going on. Is there anything else you think is important for me to know?
PATIENT: Oh… blood work. Okay. I don’t really have any allergies, Doctor. And I don't take any medications regularly. Hmm… let me think. I guess… I have been feeling a little bit down lately, more than usual, but I thought that was just because of everything. I haven’t been sleeping well, so I'm constantly tired and stressed. Is that something the blood work will show? Or is that more of a… mind thing? I really don't know what’s going on, Doctor. I just feel so… drained.
DOCTOR: No allergies, no medications… feeling “drained.” The blood work will rule out some of the physical causes for your symptoms. We can discuss your mood further, if the results are normal. For now, let's get the lab order sent over and you can go get that done. Do you know where the lab is located?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. I’ve never had blood work done before. Is it far from here? I don’t have a car, so I’d have to take the bus. And I’m not very good with directions, if I'm being honest. Could someone maybe… point me in the right direction? Or tell me which bus to take? I really don't want to get lost.
DOCTOR: The lab is about fifteen minutes by bus, number 23. It's on Elm Street, next to the library. I’ll print you a map and directions. And frankly, if the blood work doesn't show anything obvious, you may want to consider speaking with a therapist. But let's get the tests done first. Don't worry too much. It's probably just… a lot of things. Here’s the lab order and the directions. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. Fifteen minutes on the number 23 bus… I can manage that, I think. And thank you for the directions. I appreciate it. Yes, a therapist… I suppose I could think about that. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll go get the blood work done now. Goodbye.
