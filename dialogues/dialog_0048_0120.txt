DOCTOR: Right. Carmaleta Villarreal, 43 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I just...want to make sure everything’s alright, you know? I want to have a baby, and I don't want any trouble getting pregnant. It should be easy, shouldn't it? I lost my husband a few years back, and…well, it’s time. Just want to get it done.
DOCTOR: “Easy” is a relative term, Ms. Villarreal. A lot of factors come into play. Losing your husband… that’s… difficult. But yes, wanting to start a family is a perfectly reasonable goal. Let's get some information down, shall we?
PATIENT: Look, I appreciate you saying that, but I really don’t want to dwell on…that. It was a while ago. I just want to know if I can have a baby, without, you know, a whole lot of fuss. Is that too much to ask? I have private insurance, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Insurance is… helpful, yes. But it doesn't change the underlying biology. Right. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Ugh, illnesses? Not really. Just…the usual. Colds, flu…nothing serious. I think I had chickenpox when I was a kid. Honestly, I don't remember much, to be perfectly frank. It was a long time ago. Is this really necessary? I mean, I feel fine.
DOCTOR: "The usual" doesn't really tell me much, Ms. Villarreal. We need to rule out anything that could affect your ability to conceive. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Hmm… I don’t think so. Maybe for my tonsils when I was little? It was…ages ago. A really long time. They just took them out, I think. That's all I remember. Look, I'm not a sickly person. I just want to know if I'm okay to try. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Right. Tonsillectomy. Any surgeries other than the tonsils?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Look, I’m telling you, I’ve been pretty healthy. I eat reasonably well, I don't smoke, I don’t drink much… I just want a straightforward answer. Is there a test I can take? Or something? This is honestly a waste of time, digging up things from when I was a child.
DOCTOR: A test is coming, Ms. Villarreal. But I need a complete history first. It’s…standard procedure. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think? And my grandmother… something with her heart, maybe? It was a long time ago, and honestly, we didn’t really talk about health much. Is this going to take all day? I have things to do. Really. It’s just…a baby. Surely it’s not that complicated.
DOCTOR: “Surely” is rarely applicable in medicine, Ms. Villarreal. High blood pressure and heart condition… alright. Any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Not that I know of. Nobody really talked about that either. Look, I’m just not a medical person, okay? I don’t remember details. I just want to know if I have a problem. Not what my grandmother ate 50 years ago! This is… incredibly frustrating. Can we just get to the test?
DOCTOR: Alright. Fine. Let's skip the detailed history for now. We'll do a basic physical exam and some preliminary blood work. But understand, without a complete history, it’s difficult to assess your risk factors. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. Hurry it up, please. I really don't have all day. This is uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Blood pressure is 130/80. Weight is 130 pounds, height is 164 centimeters. BMI is within normal range. Now, I need to draw some blood for routine tests – complete blood count, thyroid function, and some hormone levels.
PATIENT: Hormone levels? See, this is what I was afraid of. Is something already wrong? Just… get it done. I don't like needles. Honestly, this is a terrible experience. Are you sure this is necessary? Could I just… take a vitamin or something? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Vitamins are not a substitute for medical evaluation, Ms. Villarreal. These tests are standard for assessing fertility. Alright. That’s done. You might feel a little discomfort at the puncture site. We'll send these off to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. Do not start taking any vitamins or supplements before we discuss the results. It could interfere with the testing.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just...call me when you have something. Don't bother with the details. I’m really not interested in a lecture. Just tell me if I can have a baby, yes or no. .
