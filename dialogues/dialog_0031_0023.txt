DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um... my chest hurts. Not all the time, but... yeah, it hurts. It's like... a pain. In my chest. Like, where a woman would... you know. It’s weird for a man to have this, right?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned when experiencing chest pain, Mr. Bulaong. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Chest pain can have many causes, and we want to figure out what's going on with you specifically. You mentioned it's not constant, and you described it as being in the area where a woman might experience pain… could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Okay. It's… hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain. More like… a heavy ache. And it feels… under my nipple. Both sides, sometimes. Not at the same time, but… both. I don't know if that makes sense. I work on roofs, you know? Maybe it’s from that? Lots of moving around… pushing… stuff.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. A heavy ache, sometimes under the nipple on both sides… and you're a roofer, so physical work is involved. That’s important information. To get a better understanding, could you describe when this pain occurs?
PATIENT: Um... it's not after work, not really. Sometimes it's just... there. In the morning, maybe? Or when I'm resting. It doesn't really seem to get worse when I'm working. And it’s not like… a muscle pain. It’s… deeper. I don’t know. It’s hard to say when. It just… happens. Is this normal for a man? I haven’t told my wife yet. She would worry.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re addressing this now, Mr. Bulaong. And it’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned and hesitant to worry your wife until we have some answers. Chest pain is always worth investigating, regardless of gender. The fact that it occurs even at rest is noteworthy. To help me narrow down the possibilities, let's go through a bit more detail. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the pain, even occasionally?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? Not that I know of. Like, nothing I do makes it start. It just… is. Sometimes I feel… a little tired, but I always feel a little tired. I work hard. I haven't changed anything… what I eat, or how much I sleep. Maybe if I sleep on my side, it feels… different? But not worse, just… different. I don't know if that makes sense. It’s hard to remember. I don’t pay attention to these things usually.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bulaong. It’s not always easy to pinpoint these things. Sleeping on your side sometimes alters the sensation – that’s good to know. Now, let’s broaden the scope a bit. Aside from this chest pain and fatigue, have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Um… I guess… I have been sweating a little more. But it's hot, you know? August. And maybe… a little bit of weight loss. But I work so hard, maybe I'm just… burning more calories. I haven’t really noticed… I haven’t been weighing myself. My wife does that, and I don’t pay attention. Nothing… serious, I don’t think. Just… tired, and a little sweaty. And the chest pain, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased sweating and some weight loss alongside the fatigue and chest pain. It's good you're sharing this information with me, even if it seems minor. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I haven't really been to the doctor much. Just for check-ups when I was a kid. And maybe a broken arm once, when I was little. But no… nothing serious. No conditions. No heart problems. My wife keeps telling me I need to go to the doctor more, but I always feel fine. Mostly. Just tired, like I said. And now this chest pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior medical diagnoses, just a broken arm as a child. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I eat okay. I try to. My wife cooks good food. I don’t drink much, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. I don’t smoke. Never have. Is this… bad? Am I… sick? I just want to know if it's something serious. I have a family… a wife and kids. I need to be strong for them.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Mr. Bulaong, and wanting to be strong for your family is very commendable. It's good you're being proactive about this. We’re still gathering information, and I’m not going to jump to any conclusions at this point. To help me further assess your situation, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... my father... he had high blood pressure. That's all I know. And my grandmother... she had something with her stomach. But I don't know what. She passed away a long time ago. No… no one had heart problems that I know of. My wife says her mother had… arthritis? But that’s not serious, is it? I don't think so. Mostly, everyone is okay. That's why I don't know much about family history. We don't talk about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your father with high blood pressure, and your grandmother with a stomach condition, and your wife's mother with arthritis. That gives us a little to work with. And that’s perfectly alright that you don’t have a lot of details – many families don’t discuss medical history in detail. Finally, let’s talk about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any medications. Never have. I don't like taking pills. And no allergies. I can eat anything. I'm pretty lucky that way. I try to stay healthy. That's why I don't really go to the doctor. I thought I was okay. Until this chest pain started. I just want to know what's wrong, Doctor. I need to go back to work… I need to provide for my family.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bulaong. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It's very helpful. Given your description of the chest pain – a heavy ache, sometimes under the nipple, not related to exertion, accompanied by fatigue and some sweating – and your family history of high blood pressure, I want to do a thorough examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your chest to see if I can identify any tenderness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to know what’s wrong. And I want to get back to work. Is… is it something bad? Should I be worried? My wife will be so scared if I tell her.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious, Mr. Bulaong. I want to assure you that we’re taking this seriously, and we will do everything we can to determine the cause of your pain. The examination will help me narrow down the possibilities. It's too early to say whether it's something serious – that's what the examination and potentially some tests will help us determine. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please remove your shirt so I can listen to your heart and lungs and feel your chest. I'll explain everything as I go.
PATIENT: Okay. Here. Is this okay? It's a little cold in here.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is perfect, Mr. Bulaong. Thank you. And I apologize for the temperature; I'll make it a bit warmer. Now, I'm going to gently feel your chest to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Alright, and now I’m listening to your heart with the stethoscope. Your breathing sounds clear. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I did detect a very faint murmur. It's subtle, but worth investigating. And I did not feel any significant tenderness in your chest wall. Given your symptoms, family history and these findings, I’d like to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a cardiac enzyme level. I also recommend an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay... that's... a lot. Blood tests, EKG, X-ray… Is it… is it bad? The murmur… what does that mean? My wife is going to kill me if I have heart problems. She keeps telling me I need to take care of myself. Is this… expensive? I don't have insurance. I just want to know if it's something serious. And if I need to stop working.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bulaong. It is a lot, and it's natural to feel anxious. A murmur doesn't automatically mean there's a serious problem. It simply means there’s an unusual sound when listening to your heart. It can be caused by a variety of things, some harmless, some requiring further investigation. That’s why we need to do the tests. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health, and the EKG will check for any irregularities in your heart’s electrical activity. The chest X-ray will help rule out any lung problems that could be contributing to your symptoms. Regarding the cost, I understand you don't have insurance. I will speak with our billing department to see if we can offer a discounted rate or a payment plan. We can also explore options for financial assistance programs in the area. Don’t worry about that right now. Our priority is getting you a diagnosis and making sure you receive the appropriate care. It’s too early to say whether you need to stop working. We need the results of the tests before we can make any recommendations. I would advise you to avoid strenuous activity until we have more information, but we’ll discuss this further once we have the results. Would you like me to go over the details of the tests again, or do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No... I think I understand. Tests, see what's wrong, maybe not working hard. I just... I don't want to worry my wife. She's already stressed. Can you... write down what I need to do? The tests, where to go, what to expect? And... maybe how much it will cost? Just a rough idea? I guess... I guess I'll do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to be healthy for my family.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bulaong. Here's a list of the tests we’ve discussed, along with the locations and phone numbers. Tests to be completed: Complete Blood Count : [Lab Name & Address & Phone Number] - Measures different types of blood cells. Fasting not required. Metabolic Panel: [Lab Name & Address & Phone Number] - Checks kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. Fasting for 8-12 hours is required. Cardiac Enzymes: [Lab Name & Address & Phone Number] - Detects heart muscle damage. Fasting not required. EKG : [Imaging Center Name & Address & Phone Number] - Records your heart’s electrical activity. No preparation needed. Chest X-Ray: [Imaging Center Name & Address & Phone Number] - Provides an image of your lungs and heart. No preparation needed. Regarding the cost, it's difficult to give an exact figure without knowing the specific pricing at each facility. However, as a rough estimate, the tests could range from $500 to $1500 total. I will have the billing department contact you with more precise quotes and explore potential assistance programs. They can also discuss payment options. I understand your concern about worrying your wife. You don’t need to share the details of the tests right away. We can discuss the results together, and you can decide how much information you want to share with her. Do you have any questions about the tests or the logistics?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’ll schedule the tests tomorrow. And I’ll call the billing department. Thank you again, Doctor Rakosky. I’ll see you… when the results are back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I’m glad I could help. Yes, please schedule the tests at your earliest convenience. And as soon as we have the results, my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don’t hesitate. I’ll be here to discuss the results with you and develop a plan together. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: .
