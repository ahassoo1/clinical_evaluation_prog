DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Doctor… Bakan, right? Yes. My nails. They’re… not right. They look funny. I don't remember how they got funny, just that they are. It's bothering me. They used to be nice.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Thut, Bakan is correct. And I understand your nails are what’s concerning you. “Not right” and “funny” – could you describe that a little more for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… they're kinda thick, I think. And yellowish. Not a pretty yellow, like sunshine. More like… old. Like old tea. I don’t paint them or anything, never have. I just… noticed. It's probably nothing, but my sister always said I should pay attention to these things. She's very particular.
DOCTOR: I see. Thickening and a yellowish discoloration… that’s helpful, thank you. And you’ve noticed this developing over what period of time, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… I don’t know. A while, definitely. Not yesterday, that's for sure. Maybe… a few months? It’s hard to say. I don't really look at my hands, you know? Not unless something's wrong with them. I have important things to do. It's not like I'm sitting around admiring my nails.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Thut. Many people don't regularly examine their hands closely. A few months of gradual change is useful information. Now, have you noticed any pain or discomfort in or around your nails?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Just… ugly. They feel normal. Maybe a little rough, like sandpaper, but that’s probably just from washing dishes. I do a lot of dishes. My husband… well, he used to do them, but… never mind. No pain, though. Definitely no pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain or discomfort, just a change in appearance and some roughness. Have you noticed any changes to the skin around your nails – any redness, swelling, or flaking?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… No, I don't think so. The skin is…skin. It gets dry in the winter, like everyone else's, but nothing special. I put lotion on sometimes. Not always, though. I forget. Is this important? Are my nails really that bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you are noticing these things, Ms. Thut, and I appreciate you sharing the details with me. It's important to investigate changes like this. To get a better understanding, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam of your hands and nails. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam. Well… I suppose so. As long as you’re not going to poke me too hard. And don't take too long, I have an appointment later. It's with my hair stylist. She’s very busy.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Thut. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I'll be mindful of your time. I’m observing a thickening of the nails, particularly on both the big toes and index fingers, with a yellowish hue. The texture is somewhat rough, as you mentioned. The nail beds themselves appear normal in color, and I don’t see any signs of inflammation around the skin. It's difficult to tell without further testing, but these findings are consistent with a fungal infection of the nails, also known as onychomycosis.
PATIENT: Fungus? Oh, dear. Fungus? Like… in the basement? I keep a very clean house, you know. I don't have fungus. That's…disgusting. Are you sure? Maybe it’s just old age. My mother's nails weren't very pretty either.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Thut. It’s certainly not a reflection of cleanliness, and it’s a common condition. It’s not the same type of fungus you’d find in a basement. This type thrives in warm, moist environments, and can often be acquired in public places like showers or swimming pools. To confirm the diagnosis, we would need to send a small sample of your nail clippings to a laboratory for analysis. This will tell us definitively if it is a fungal infection and, if so, what type of fungus is causing it. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: A lab? You want to send pieces of my nails to a lab? That sounds…invasive. And what if they lose them? Or someone looks at them? I don't like the sound of that at all. Can't you just… tell me what to put on them? Some kind of cream, maybe? I read about those things in magazines.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Thut. It’s a reasonable concern, and we can certainly discuss alternatives. However, without a confirmed diagnosis, it’s difficult to recommend the most effective treatment. There are many different types of nail conditions that can look similar to a fungal infection, and the wrong treatment could be ineffective or even worsen the problem. The lab analysis is a relatively simple procedure. We would simply trim a small portion of the affected nails – just a tiny amount – and send it off for testing. The samples are handled with strict confidentiality, and are used solely for diagnostic purposes. If you’re still uncomfortable with that, we could consider a trial of an over-the-counter antifungal cream, but it's important to understand that these creams are often less effective, and can take a very long time – many months – to show results. Would you like me to explain the lab procedure in more detail, or discuss the potential benefits and limitations of a trial of over-the-counter treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is all so complicated. Months? I don't have months! I have a luncheon next week and I can't have ugly nails. Look, just… give me something. Anything. A strong polish, maybe? Something to hide them. And tell me it’s not fungus. That’s all I ask. I really don’t want to think about fungus. And I’m already late for my hair appointment.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and concern, Ms. Thut, and I apologize that this is more complicated than you anticipated. While I respect your wishes, I must emphasize that simply hiding the appearance of the nails without addressing the underlying cause is not a long-term solution. However, given your concerns about time and your desire to avoid a confirmed diagnosis at this time, I can prescribe a topical antifungal medication that you can apply to the affected nails. It's important to note that this medication may not be as effective without a confirmed diagnosis, and it will require consistent application for several months to see results. And there's no guarantee it will work. I will also provide you with instructions on proper nail hygiene to help prevent the spread of any potential infection. Before I do that, though, I want to make sure you understand the potential risks and benefits, and that you’re aware of the importance of following the instructions carefully. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Risks? Honestly, I don’t even want to know about risks. I just want this over with. Fine, give me the stuff. But if it doesn’t work, I’m blaming you. And if my hair stylist is mad because I’m late, you’re paying for it. Just… write down the instructions, and make them short. I have a very busy life, you know. And I don’t have time to be reading long medical papers. Just the basics. Please.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Thut. Here you are. This is a prescription for a topical antifungal medication called ciclopirox. Apply it to the affected nails once daily, after cleaning and trimming them. It’s important to file the surface of the nail gently to allow the medication to penetrate. Continue the treatment for at least six months, even if the nails appear to be improving. I’m also providing you with a handout on proper nail hygiene. Please read it when you have a moment. It's important to keep your nails clean and dry, and to avoid sharing nail clippers or files. I understand your concerns about your hair appointment, and I apologize for any inconvenience. I’ve documented our conversation and your decision to proceed with treatment without a confirmed diagnosis. Do you have any further questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just… tell me where to pick this up. And make it quick, I really need to go. I have a life, you know. A very busy life. Thank you. Or… whatever. Just… goodbye.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Thut. You can pick up the prescription at the Suburban Pharmacy, located just down the street. They should be able to fill it right away. I wish you all the best, and I hope the treatment is effective. If you have any concerns or if your condition worsens, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Goodbye, and have a pleasant day. .
