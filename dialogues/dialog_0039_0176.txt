DOCTOR: Hello, Ivette. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It's been… let me think… more than two days now, at least. Really annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: More than two days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, since… Monday, I believe. Monday afternoon, after I had lunch with my sister, Layla. We went to that new Mediterranean place downtown. It started right after, while we were paying the bill. It was just a couple at first, then they kept coming… and coming… and coming. It's still happening now, you see. There! See?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. And they've been pretty constant since then, you said?
PATIENT: Pretty constant, yes. Not every second, but… several times an hour, easily. It's making it difficult to concentrate at work, and frankly, it's embarrassing. I manage events, you know? Lots of talking, lots of smiling… hard to do with hiccups! I tried drinking water quickly, like people say, holding my breath… nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Drinking water, holding your breath… good first steps. And it's interfering with work, which is understandably frustrating. Now, besides the hiccups themselves, have you noticed anything else going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. No fever, no stomach pain… I’m eating normally, sleeping alright… Everything feels normal, except for these pesky hiccups. I haven't taken anything for them, didn't even think to, to be honest. Usually hiccups just… go away. It's just unusual for them to last this long.
DOCTOR: Right, usually they do resolve on their own. And no other symptoms at all… no nausea, no vomiting, no heartburn?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Honestly, Doctor, it's just the hiccups. It's like someone is tapping me from the inside. It’s just… irritating. And a little worrying, now that it’s been so long. I haven't had hiccups for this long since I was a child, and even then, my mother knew exactly what to do – a spoonful of sugar, I think it was. But I don’t have a mother anymore to tell me these things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule things out. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead. I’m ready. It's probably nothing, but you’re right, it's better to be sure. It’s just… these hiccups are driving me crazy!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ivette. Heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to speak of, and I don't feel anything unusual. Blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. Everything seems normal on the physical exam. Now, let’s talk about some possible causes. Sometimes hiccups can be caused by something simple like eating too quickly or drinking carbonated beverages. But since they've been going on for this long, we might want to consider a few other things, just to be safe. Have you had any recent illnesses, even a mild cold?
PATIENT: No, no recent illnesses. Not even a sniffle. I've been very careful, especially with everything going around. And I didn’t eat anything unusual at lunch with Layla, just… a normal Mediterranean platter, with hummus and falafel and… oh! And baklava, of course. But I eat baklava all the time. Hmm… well, I did have a bit of a stressful week leading up to the lunch, actually. Planning this big gala event… lots of deadlines, lots of difficult clients. But I wouldn't say it was that stressful. You know? Just… work.
DOCTOR: Right, just work. Okay, stress can sometimes contribute to hiccups, though usually they resolve when the stressor is removed. We could consider a few possibilities. Sometimes, persistent hiccups can be related to nerve irritation or, rarely, underlying medical conditions. Since you're otherwise healthy and the physical exam was normal, I'm not overly concerned, but it’s worth investigating further. I'd like to order a simple blood test, just to rule out any electrolyte imbalances or other issues. It’s a standard panel, nothing too invasive. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I’d rather be sure. Blood test is fine. I don't mind a little prick if it helps get rid of these things. So, where do we do that? And how long will it take to get the results? I have that gala to plan, you see, and I really need to focus.
DOCTOR: Perfect. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so we can do it quickly. It’ll just be a standard draw, and it should only take about 10-15 minutes. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. I'll have my nurse schedule you for that now, and we can go over the results when they come back. In the meantime, try to relax as much as possible. Deep breathing exercises can sometimes help. And if the hiccups become really bothersome or you develop any other symptoms – like shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain – please don't hesitate to call the office or go to the emergency room. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just dismissing it as silly hiccups. Deep breathing, I can definitely try that. And I will keep an eye out for anything else. 24-48 hours… I can manage that. Let me know when I can schedule the blood test, please. Thank you again.
