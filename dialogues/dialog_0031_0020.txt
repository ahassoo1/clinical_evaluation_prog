DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is Rakosky, yes? Very nice to meet you too. I am here for… a check-up, I think? The lady on the phone… she say something about a talk with you, from my home. A remote… evaluation? I am not so good with the new things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, Rakosky is correct. And yes, it sounds like you had a telehealth visit recently with one of our nurses. They often do preliminary evaluations and sometimes recommend an in-person visit for a more thorough assessment. So, to clarify, you’re here today for a follow-up to that remote evaluation?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. The… the nurse, she ask many questions. About my… how do you say… feelings? And my… body. Everything is okay, I think. But she say… it is better to see you, just to be sure. Is that correct? I do not want to waste your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Benites. It's quite responsible of the nurse to recommend a follow-up, and it's never a waste of my time to ensure our patients are doing well. So, let's start with the “feelings” she asked about – can you tell me a little more about what prompted that visit and what, if anything, has been concerning you?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… my husband, he… he passed away last year. It is… difficult. Sometimes I feel very sad, and sometimes… nothing at all. Just… empty. The nurse, she ask if I am sleeping well. I sleep, yes. But not… good sleep. I wake up many times. And I do not have much… energy, you know? Everything feels… heavy. It is hard to explain. Is this… normal? After something like this?
DOCTOR: It absolutely is normal, Ms. Benites. Losing a husband is an immense loss, and grief manifests in many different ways. The sadness, the feeling of emptiness, the sleep disturbances, the lack of energy – all of those are very common responses to such a profound loss. It sounds like you are experiencing a natural, though very difficult, grieving process. To help me get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little more about when these feelings started?
PATIENT: Well… it started right after… after he was gone, of course. At first, it was… very bad. I could not eat, I could not sleep. Everything was just… dark. It is a little better now, but… it does not go away completely. Maybe a few good days, then… back again. It has been… almost a year now. I just want to feel… like myself again, you know? I used to enjoy… gardening. Now… I do not even want to look at the garden.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been through a very challenging year, Ms. Benites, and it's understandable that you haven't fully returned to your previous self. The fact that you had a period of being unable to eat or sleep, and that these feelings have persisted for almost a year, is important information. While grief can take time to process, it’s also important to rule out other factors that might be contributing to how you’re feeling. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sadness and fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my… my stomach, it hurts. Not all the time, but… when I am very worried, it hurts. And I have… I have no appetite, like you said. I eat only when I have to. And… sometimes my hands, they shake a little. Just a little. Is that… normal? I used to be very strong. I worked in the garage with my husband for many years.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Benites. The stomach pain and loss of appetite are certainly things we should discuss further. And the shaking hands is also something I want to explore a little more. To get a better understanding, could you describe the stomach pain?
PATIENT: It is… a dull ache, mostly. In the middle of my stomach. Sometimes it is worse after I eat, sometimes not. It is not… sharp pain. Just… uncomfortable. And… I sometimes feel a little… dizzy, when I stand up too fast. Not often, but… it happens. And… I am always tired. Even when I sleep. Is this something… serious, Doctor? I worry too much, maybe.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re sharing all of this with me, Ms. Benites. It's always best to voice your concerns. The combination of symptoms you're describing – the stomach pain, dizziness, fatigue, loss of appetite, and shaking hands – warrants a closer look. To help me narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had… high blood pressure, a few years ago. But the doctor, he gave me pills, and it was okay. And… my knees, they are bad. From working in the garage. I have arthritis, he say. But… that is all, I think. Nothing serious. I do not take many pills, just for the blood pressure. And sometimes, for the pain in my knees. Is that important, Doctor? Do you think it is something… different?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful information, Ms. Benites. Both high blood pressure and arthritis can have overlapping symptoms, so it’s important to know about them. And the medications you’re taking are also important. Could you tell me the names of the medications you’re currently taking, and what dosage you take of each one?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. For the blood pressure… I think it is… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. The doctor, he gave me a white pill. I take one every morning. And for the knees… I take Ibuprofen. When it hurts. Sometimes two, sometimes three a day. The blue pills. I do not take it every day, only when I need to. Is that… enough information, Doctor? I am sorry if I am… confusing.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Benites. You’re doing perfectly fine. This is all very helpful. Lisinopril and Ibuprofen… Okay. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes. I had… a hysterectomy, many years ago. When I was young. And… I had surgery on my knee, a few years ago. They fixed it, when it was bad. But that is all, I think. Nothing else. Is that important, Doctor? I worry about… side effects, from the pills. My friend, she had a bad reaction to a pill, once. It was very scary.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Benites. Both the hysterectomy and the knee surgery are relevant. And I understand your concern about medication side effects – it's always wise to be cautious. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother, she had… heart problems, when she was old. She had to have… a pacemaker, I think. And my father, he had… diabetes. He was very sick, at the end. And… my sister, she had… cancer. Breast cancer, I think. But that is all, I think. Nothing else. It makes me worry, you know? About my health. It is hard to… stay positive, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Benites. That's important information, and it's understandable why you’re concerned about your health. Knowing about the heart problems, diabetes, and cancer in your family helps us to be more thorough in our assessment. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And I do not drink alcohol either. My husband, he used to drink a little beer, sometimes. But I never liked it. It makes me… dizzy. And… I worry too much, you know? So I stay away from things like that. Is that… good? I try to eat healthy, mostly. And I used to walk a lot, but… not so much now. I get tired.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Benites. Not smoking and not drinking alcohol are both very positive. And trying to eat healthy is also a good step. Now, before we proceed to a physical exam, just one last question. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. I eat everything. And I have never had a reaction to a pill. I think. I worry too much, you know? I always check, before I take something new. But… I do not have any allergies. I think. Is that… okay? I just want to be sure. Is it okay to ask what you are thinking, Doctor? What could be wrong, you think?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, it’s perfectly okay to ask. It's good that you’re so careful. And you’ve given me a lot of helpful information, so thank you. Based on what you’ve told me – the grief, the fatigue, the stomach pain, the dizziness, the shaking hands, your history of high blood pressure and arthritis, and your family history – there are a few possibilities we need to explore. It could be related to your grief and stress, which can manifest in physical symptoms. It could also be related to your high blood pressure, even if it's currently controlled with medication. And we need to rule out other potential causes, such as anemia, thyroid problems, or vitamin deficiencies. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… alright. I trust you. I just want to feel… better. I want to be myself again. Please, do what you need to do. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Benites. Thank you for your trust. We'll take things one step at a time. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and I don’t hear any unusual sounds in your lungs. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today – 140/90. And your pulse is 78, which is normal. Now, let's check your thyroid. I don’t feel any obvious swelling in your thyroid gland. Finally, I'd like to do a quick neurological exam – just to check your reflexes and coordination. Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination seems good. Everything seems within normal limits so far, Ms. Benites, but we'll need to do some blood work to get a more complete picture. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a basic metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: That sounds… good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work… is that painful? I do not like needles very much. But I will do whatever you need me to do. Is it a lot of blood?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Benites, it's not painful. It's just a quick pinch, and it's over very quickly. The amount of blood we take is very small – just a few vials. It's usually no more than what you'd give when you have your routine check-up. Our phlebotomist is very skilled, and they'll do everything they can to make you comfortable. We can also use a smaller needle if you prefer, and they’ll let you know when they’re about to insert it. We want to make this as easy for you as possible. I’ll have the order ready for you to take to the lab. It's located just down the hall. Do you need me to write down the directions for you?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I think I can find it. Just down the hall, you say? I am… a little nervous, but I will do it. I want to know… what could it be? What are you looking for with the blood work? I know you do not want to worry me, but… I like to know things. It helps me… feel more in control.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Benites. It's perfectly natural to want to know what we're looking for. I don't want to cause you unnecessary worry, but I want to be transparent. With the complete blood count, we're checking for anemia – a low red blood cell count, which can cause fatigue and weakness. We’re also looking at your white blood cell count to rule out any infection. The thyroid panel will check your thyroid function. An underactive or overactive thyroid can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, weight changes, and mood swings. The basic metabolic panel will check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar levels. And the vitamin D level will check for a vitamin D deficiency, which is common and can also cause fatigue and weakness. Essentially, we’re trying to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it's important to get a complete picture. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that makes sense. Anemia, thyroid… vitamins. It is a lot to think about. But I understand. So, you are just… checking things. Making sure nothing serious is happening. And… what happens after the blood work? How long does it take to get the results? Will you call me, or… do I have to call you? I am not very good with computers, you know. I prefer the telephone.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Ms. Benites. We’re just checking things to make sure nothing serious is happening. The results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back from the lab. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available, and I will call you directly with the findings. I won't ask you to check a patient portal or anything like that. I know you prefer the telephone, and that's perfectly fine. If the results are normal, I’ll discuss a plan to address your grief and help you feel better. If anything is abnormal, I'll explain the findings in detail and discuss the next steps. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. You will call me. And you will explain everything. That… that makes me feel much better. Thank you. Is there anything else I need to do today? Or… can I go now? I want to go home and… rest. Maybe take a nap.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. No, there’s nothing else you need to do today. Just go to the lab when you have a chance, and they’ll take care of the blood work. Yes, you can go home now and rest. Please take care of yourself and try not to worry too much. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Benites.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
