DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Hilber. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well… it’s my water. I’m havin’ trouble… gettin’ it all out, when I need to go. It just… stays there, sometimes. It’s a little uncomfortable, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with complete bladder emptying, which can certainly be uncomfortable. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not always happenin’. Some days it’s fine, and others… not so much. It feels like… like a dam holdin’ back too much, but not a painful dam, just… full. And I gotta… push a little harder, sometimes. It’s been goin’ on for maybe a month or so now, I reckon. I don't really keep track of days too well, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. Intermittent difficulty is important to note. And the sensation of needing to push harder… that’s helpful information as well. About a month, okay. Has this been gradually getting worse, or has it been fairly consistent since it started?
PATIENT: It's been gettin' a little worse, I think. At first, it was just once in a while, and I didn't think much of it. Now... it's happenin’ more often. And it takes a little longer each time to… finish, you could say. It doesn’t hurt, mind you, just… takes effort.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual worsening over the past month. And no pain, just increased effort. Have you noticed any other changes along with this, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I’ve been drinkin’ about the same amount of water, maybe a little less in the heat. I haven’t been… well, I haven’t been sleepin’ as good lately. I get up a couple times a night to… you know. But I figured that was just gettin’ older.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant change in your fluid intake, and you've been experiencing some nighttime awakenings to urinate. That's important to note. Has there been any blood in your urine, or any unusual odor?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no blood. And it smells… well, it smells like water. I don't know how to explain it. It doesn't smell any different than usual. I always try to drink plenty so it shouldn't smell bad, you know?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, no change in odor or appearance. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well… I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor gave me some pills and it went away. I don’t take them anymore. Aside from that… not really. I used to be pretty healthy, worked on the boats for a long time. Strong as an ox, I was.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was managed with medication and is currently resolved. Do you remember the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… no, Doctor, I don’t. I never was good at rememberin’ names. It was a little white pill, I think. Just one a day. The doctor at the clinic back home… he took care of it. I don’t recall the name, I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Hilber. We can look that up in your records if they were transferred over. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbin’ a tree. Had to go to the hospital for that, got a cast and everything. And my wife… she had some surgeries a few years back, but that was her. I haven't had any surgeries myself, not since the arm.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood broken arm, no other surgeries. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she lived to be a good age, but she had some trouble with her kidneys when she got older. My father… he was a strong man, but he had a weak heart, I think. My wife’s family… they were pretty healthy, as far as I know. Nobody had any… water problems, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of kidney issues in your mother and heart problems in your father. No family history of urinary issues. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take nothin’ right now. I used to take some vitamins, a multi-vitamin, but I stopped a while back. Didn’t seem to be doin’ much good, so I figured I’d save my money.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I can eat anything, take anything, as far as I know. My wife used to be allergic to bee stings, but that was her. I’ve never had a problem with anythin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for that information, Mr. Hilber. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll be checking your abdomen and I may need to do a quick neurological exam to assess your reflexes. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. Your abdomen is soft, but I did note some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen when I pressed here. Your reflexes are normal. I am also going to check your prostate, if you are comfortable with that. It’s a quick exam and can help rule out some possible causes. Would you prefer I don't?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I’ve never had that done before. I don’t mind, if it helps. My wife always said I should get checked, but… I never did. If you think it's important, then go ahead. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your trust, Mr. Hilber. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but it doesn’t feel particularly concerning at this time. It’s possible this is contributing to your difficulty with urination. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for any infection or other abnormalities. I’d also like to check your post-void residual, which measures how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. This will help us determine if your bladder is emptying completely. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Checkin’ things, I reckon. Yes, that’s fine. A urinalysis and… the other thing. Whatever you need to do to figure it out. And if it helps other people down the road, then all the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the nurse draw a urine sample after our conversation. The post-void residual can be done quickly with a bladder scan right here in the office. While we wait for those results, are there any other concerns or symptoms you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. I’m just… tired of feelin’ like I can’t get everything out, you know? It's a little embarrassing, to be honest. But I appreciate you listenin’ and takin’ the time to figure it out.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Hilber. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. It’s important to address these concerns, and we will work through this together. Once we have the results from the urine analysis and the post-void residual, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – water is best – and trying to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. We can also discuss some pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegels, which can help strengthen the muscles that support your bladder. Would you like me to write you a referral for a urologist as well?
PATIENT: A urologist? Well… is that necessary? I don't want to go jumpin’ to specialists if we haven’t figured out what’s goin’ on yet. Maybe we should wait on the tests, see what they say first? I don't like the sound of more doctors, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable request, Mr. Hilber. I agree. Let’s hold off on the referral for now. We'll review the results from the urinalysis and post-void residual and then determine if further specialist evaluation is necessary. If your post-void residual is significantly elevated, or if the urinalysis reveals an infection or other abnormality, then I would strongly recommend seeing a urologist. But for now, let's focus on getting these initial results and discussing them. The nurse will be in shortly to collect your urine sample. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything. I appreciate your patience and explainin' things so clearly. I feel a little better just knowin’ you’re lookin’ into it. And I appreciate you not pushin’ me to see another doctor right away.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. That's my job. We'll take things one step at a time. I'll be back as soon as we have the results from the lab. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. .
