DOCTOR: Hi Carla, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itch… this skin itch. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's just… annoying, you know? It’s all over, really. Not terrible, but constant.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Constant itching can be really disruptive. Okay, so it's an all-over itch, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty much. Not exactly all over... it's worse on my arms and back, I think. And sometimes my legs. It doesn't seem to be… well, I haven't noticed any bumps or anything, just… itchy skin. It’s not like a rash, more of a feeling, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. So, it's more of a generalized itch, primarily on your arms, back, and legs, without any visible rash or bumps. And how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably a couple of months ago, maybe three? It wasn’t bad at first, just every now and then. But it’s gotten more consistent lately, like I said. It doesn't keep me up at night or anything, but it’s just… there. Constantly needing to scratch.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months, gradually getting more consistent. And has anything changed around the time it started?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… Well, I did start using a new laundry detergent, I guess. A different brand, one my daughter recommended. She said it was better for sensitive skin, but… maybe it’s not sensitive enough for my skin? I don't know. Apart from that, not really. No new soaps, no new lotions… nothing comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a new laundry detergent around the time it started. That's definitely something to consider. And have you tried anything to relieve the itching so far?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Mostly just lotions, regular lotion, you know? And I’ve tried some of those anti-itch creams, the ones you get at the drugstore. They help a little, for a little while, but it always comes back. Nothing seems to really stop it. I’ve been trying not to scratch too much, but it’s hard!
DOCTOR: I understand, that sounds frustrating. Okay, lotions and over-the-counter anti-itch creams with limited relief. Before we move on, can you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not really. I haven’t noticed anything else. No fever, no fatigue, no weight loss, no changes in my appetite… Just the itch. Sometimes my skin feels a little dry, but I put lotion on it, so I figured that was it. I don’t have any other pains or anything like that. Just… itchy skin. Sorry, I wish I had something more helpful to tell you!
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly fine, Carla. It's helpful to know what isn't going on as well. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. Other than that… no, not really. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything else. My doctor always said I was pretty healthy for my age, knock on wood. I did have a gallbladder removed years ago, but that was ages ago, and I haven't had any problems with it since.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled high blood pressure and gallbladder removal years ago. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And that's it. Just the Lisinopril. I try to keep it simple, you know? I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My daughter always asks me if I'm allergic to shellfish, but I've eaten shrimp and lobster my whole life and never had a problem. I don't have any known allergies to medicines either, to the best of my knowledge. I've never had to rush to the hospital or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… hmm. My mother had arthritis, pretty bad towards the end. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. But other than that, not much that I can think of. No one in my family really had skin problems, or anything like this itch. They were mostly healthy people, as far as I know. It's just me with this… annoying itch.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and heart problems in your parents, but no significant skin conditions in the family. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… oh dear. Well, I'm retired now. I used to be a political scientist, worked at the university for many years. I’m divorced, been on my own for a long time. I have one daughter, she lives nearby, thankfully. I don't smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. I like to read, and I enjoy spending time with my daughter and grandkids when they come over. That's pretty much it. I keep a pretty quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired political scientist, one daughter, non-smoker, occasional glass of wine. That gives me a good picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll just take a look at your skin to see if I can get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, you can figure out what's causing this itch. It's just… bothersome, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm not seeing any obvious rashes, bumps, or lesions. Your skin appears generally healthy, just a little dry in some areas. I'll gently palpate your skin to check for any thickening or unusual textures. No significant thickening or tenderness. Okay. And just to get a complete picture, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Okay. One last thing, I’m going to check your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Okay. Everything seems normal from a basic physical exam. It's possible this is a case of dry skin exacerbated by something like a new laundry detergent, but because it’s been persistent, I'd like to run a couple of blood tests just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. I’d rather be safe than sorry, I suppose. Blood tests are okay. I’m not crazy about needles, but if it helps figure out what’s going on, I’m willing. What kind of tests are you thinking about? And will my insurance cover them? Oh wait… I don't have insurance. Is it going to be very expensive?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about the cost, and I apologize for not bringing that up sooner. I completely understand. I’m thinking we should check a Complete Blood Count to look at your overall blood health, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone level to rule out any thyroid issues. Those are the most likely culprits, given your symptoms. As for the cost… it's difficult to say exactly without knowing the lab's current rates. However, I can ask the lab to give us a price estimate beforehand, and we can discuss options if it’s a concern. We may be able to find a more affordable lab, or potentially qualify you for a patient assistance program. I also have a social worker on staff who can assist you with navigating these types of costs. Would you like me to proceed with getting a price estimate from the lab?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. A price estimate would be great. And if there’s a way to make it more affordable, or if the social worker can help, that would be wonderful. I really appreciate you thinking of that. I just want to get this itch figured out, you know? It’s… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand. Okay, I’m going to put in an order for the blood tests now, and I’ll have the lab contact you directly with a price estimate. They’ll likely need some basic insurance information, but they can work with you if you’re uninsured. I’ll also make a note to have the social worker reach out to you after your appointment to discuss potential assistance options. In the meantime, I recommend switching back to your old laundry detergent, just to see if that makes a difference. And continue using a good moisturizer. If the itch worsens or you develop any new symptoms like fever or fatigue, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and understanding. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and not dismissing it as “just dry skin.” I’ll switch back to my old detergent right away. And I’ll wait for the lab to call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Carla. I’m happy to help. It’s important to me that you feel heard and that we address your concerns thoroughly. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I’ll have the nurse give you a printout of your blood test orders and some information about our social worker. Have a good day, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this itch soon!
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too. Bye now!
