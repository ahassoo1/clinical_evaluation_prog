DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re 74 years of age. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, seventy-four. Though I don’t feel it, most days. I’m here…well, my daughter suggested I look into getting one of those…medical marijuana cards. She says it might help with the…discomfort. Honestly, I was quite hesitant, but she’s very insistent. I’ve never…well, you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana, hmm. I see. And this “discomfort,” as you put it…could you elaborate on that for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not something I generally discuss, Doctor. It's…a woman's trouble, if you catch my meaning. The aches and pains just…won’t leave me alone, especially at night. It's interfering with my sleep, and frankly, my patience. My husband, bless his soul, is a wonderful man, but even he has his limits when I'm…restless. It’s just…uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. And my daughter reads all sorts of things online, about how this marijuana can help. I just don’t know…it seems rather…undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitancy, Ms. Ranells. It’s a significant change, and you’re right to be cautious. We’ll certainly discuss all options. When you say “aches and pains,” could you be more specific about where you’re experiencing them?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly…down there, naturally. And it radiates. It goes into my lower back, sometimes even up my legs. It's a dull ache, mostly, but it flares up. Especially after…activity. Or even just sitting for too long. And as I said, at night. It’s just…persistent. It's not a sharp pain, more like…a heavy, dragging sensation. Honestly, it’s quite bothersome. And my daughter says it might even help with…well, with the hot flashes. Though I haven’t admitted to her how bad those are. It’s all rather embarrassing to talk about, frankly.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been…gradual, you see. Years, really. But it’s gotten significantly worse in the last…six months, I'd say. After my granddaughter was born. All the excitement, running around…I think that aggravated it. It was lovely, of course, but…my body wasn't quite prepared. Before that, it was just…occasional discomfort. Now it's…almost constant. And the sleep is suffering terribly. I used to be able to sleep through anything. Now…well, let’s just say my husband has learned to sleep with a nightlight.
DOCTOR: And have you had any other medical evaluations for this discomfort?
PATIENT: Well, I saw Dr. Hamilton, my gynecologist, about five years ago. He did…you know…the usual examination. He said everything was…normal for my age. He suggested some creams, but they didn’t do much good. I stopped using them after a while. Frankly, I don't like putting all sorts of things there. And I haven’t bothered with anyone else. What’s the point if they’re just going to tell me it's “normal for my age”? I’m a practical woman, Doctor. I don’t like wasting time and money on things that won’t help. That’s why I’m…reluctantly considering this marijuana. My daughter insists it's a different approach.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ranells. It's discouraging when concerns aren't addressed satisfactorily. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, just to get a clearer picture. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I have a touch of high blood pressure, though it’s well-controlled with medication. I take Lisinopril, I believe it's called. And I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. No problems since then, thankfully. Other than that…nothing major. I used to have terrible migraines, but they’ve subsided in recent years. I attribute that to my daughter. All the worry! Though she doesn’t need to know that. I don't want to make her feel guilty. I'm otherwise quite healthy, for my age. I walk every morning, and I try to eat a balanced diet. Though I do indulge in a glass of wine with dinner. A good Cabernet Sauvignon is essential, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril for hypertension, cholecystectomy twenty years ago…and occasional wine. Noted. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I’ve never even had poison ivy. Which is fortunate, considering how much time she spent gardening. Honestly, Doctor, I'm quite a robust woman. It’s just…this discomfort is rather…persistent. And it's interfering with my quality of life. My daughter keeps saying this marijuana might help me regain some normalcy. I just…I'm skeptical. It seems so…unconventional.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Ms. Ranells. Now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I take a multivitamin, every morning. A basic one, nothing fancy. And I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever – Ibuprofen – when the discomfort is particularly bad. But I try to avoid it, if possible. It upsets my stomach. Other than that…no. No supplements, no herbal remedies, nothing at all. I don't believe in all that…alternative medicine. Just good old-fashioned common sense, and a bit of willpower. And a glass of wine, of course. That helps with the aches and pains, too, you know. Though I shouldn't admit that to a doctor, I suppose. It's probably not a very good remedy. Still, it helps me relax. And relaxation is essential, especially at my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Multivitamin, occasional Ibuprofen… Noted. Now, before we discuss your daughter’s suggestion, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Oh, dear. I haven’t had one of those in…well, years. I suppose it's necessary, if you want to…properly assess the situation. Very well, Doctor. Proceed. Though I must warn you, I'm not particularly flexible. And I bruise easily. Just…be gentle, if you would. And please, don't make me get undressed completely. I still have some dignity, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Ranells. We will proceed with your comfort and dignity in mind. I'll just need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll perform a gentle abdominal exam, and a neurological assessment of your lower extremities. You may remain fully clothed for most of it. I’ll need you to simply lie down on the examination table, if you’re able. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. Within normal limits, considering your age and history of hypertension. Now, can you tell me if you have any difficulty with balance or walking?
PATIENT: Oh, my. This table is rather…firm. And cold. But very well. I suppose I can manage. Difficulty with balance…no, not exactly. But I’m a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, especially if I get up too quickly. And my legs…they feel a bit heavy, occasionally. Like lead weights. It's not a constant thing, but it happens. Mostly after I’ve been sitting for a while. Or after I've been walking for too long. My daughter keeps telling me I need to do more exercise. But honestly, Doctor, sometimes just getting through the day is exercise enough. I just don't have the energy for much else. Still, I manage. I'm a practical woman. I always have been. I just wish this discomfort would go away. It's…exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Occasional unsteadiness, heavy legs…I’m noting that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Breathing is normal. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness or discomfort. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. No masses palpated. Slight tenderness in the lower quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your lower extremities. Please relax your legs while I do this. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups. No sensory deficits detected. Alright, Ms. Ranells. The physical examination is complete. Overall, your findings are consistent with some lower abdominal tenderness and occasional lower extremity heaviness. However, there are no significant abnormalities detected.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t as bad as I feared. Thank goodness. So, everything is…normal? Or mostly normal? I must admit, Doctor, I'm not very good with all these medical terms. 5/5, 2+…it all sounds rather confusing. Lower abdominal tenderness, you say? That’s hardly surprising. It’s where all the discomfort is, of course. And the heaviness in my legs…well, that comes and goes. It’s probably just old age, I suppose. Still, I appreciate you checking. It’s reassuring to know that nothing is…seriously wrong. Now, can we please discuss this marijuana? My daughter is quite insistent, and frankly, I’m running out of patience. Perhaps it’s worth a try, if nothing else is working. Though I still have my reservations, you understand. It just seems so…unconventional.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells. The findings are not alarming, but do indicate some discomfort requiring attention. Now, regarding your daughter’s suggestion of medical marijuana… it's a complex topic. While there is some evidence suggesting it may alleviate chronic pain, particularly neuropathic pain, the research is still evolving. It’s also important to understand the potential risks and side effects. In your case, without a definitive diagnosis, it’s difficult to say whether medical marijuana would be the most appropriate course of action. The lower abdominal tenderness could stem from a variety of causes – musculoskeletal issues, gynecological concerns, even digestive problems. Before considering medical marijuana, I’d like to recommend some further investigation to determine the underlying cause of your discomfort. Would you be open to a pelvic ultrasound and some blood work to rule out any underlying conditions?
PATIENT: A pelvic ultrasound? And blood work? Oh, dear. That sounds…invasive. And frankly, Doctor, I’m not very fond of needles. I haven’t had a proper blood test in…well, decades. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, if the physical examination didn't reveal anything serious, perhaps we can just skip all the tests and try the marijuana. My daughter says it’s perfectly safe. And she’s very good at researching these things. I understand you want to be thorough, Doctor, but honestly, I'm not sure I have the energy for all this. I’m a practical woman, and I don’t like wasting time and money on things that may not be necessary. If the marijuana might provide some relief, perhaps it’s worth a try. And if it doesn’t work, well, we can always stop. But all these tests…it just seems like a lot of trouble. Is there no other way? Perhaps a different kind of pain reliever? Or some sort of…therapy? I'm not very keen on needles, you understand. And frankly, I'm a bit apprehensive about all this invasive testing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, I understand your apprehension, and I want to assure you I would never recommend tests without a clear rationale. However, it's crucial to have a definitive diagnosis before considering any treatment, even one as seemingly benign as medical marijuana. Without knowing the underlying cause of your discomfort, we risk masking a potentially serious condition. And while medical marijuana may provide some relief, it doesn’t address the root problem. It’s also important to consider potential drug interactions and side effects, which can vary depending on the individual and the underlying condition. The pelvic ultrasound is non-invasive and will provide valuable information about your reproductive organs. The blood work will help rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. Perhaps we can start with the blood work. It’s less invasive and will give us a better understanding of your overall health. If the results are normal, we can then discuss the possibility of a pelvic ultrasound. If both results are normal, we can explore other treatment options, including a consultation with a pain management specialist. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work…very well. I suppose that’s…less objectionable than a pelvic ultrasound. Though I still don't like needles. And frankly, the thought of having my blood poked and prodded is rather unsettling. But if it’s necessary to rule out something serious, then I suppose I can manage. Just…please be gentle, Doctor. And don’t take too much blood. I tend to get faint easily. And please, explain everything to me beforehand. I don’t want any surprises. And if the results are normal, can we finally discuss this marijuana? My daughter says it might help with my sleep, which is suffering terribly. And frankly, I'm running out of patience. I just want some relief, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? And if the marijuana doesn’t work, well, we can always stop. But please, let’s not drag this out any longer. I'm a practical woman, and I don't have time for endless tests and procedures. Just…let’s get this over with. And if the marijuana is an option, can we at least explore it? My daughter has been researching different strains and dosages, and she seems very confident that it might help. Please, Doctor. Let’s at least consider it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells. We will proceed with the blood work, and I assure you I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything beforehand, and we will take it slow. And yes, if the results are normal, we will absolutely discuss the possibility of medical marijuana. I’ll write you a requisition for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. These tests will provide a good baseline assessment of your overall health. Once you have the results, please bring them back to me, and we can discuss them and explore your treatment options. I will also provide you with a referral to a pain management specialist, just in case further investigation is needed. And yes, we will discuss your daughter's research on medical marijuana. I am always open to learning from my patients, and I will consider all options before making a recommendation. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: That…that sounds reasonable, Doctor. Blood work, then the results, then a discussion about the marijuana. And the pain specialist, just in case. Yes, that sounds…acceptable. I suppose I should schedule an appointment to bring the results back. And perhaps a consultation with this pain specialist, if needed. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And I appreciate you considering my daughter’s research. She’s very knowledgeable about these things, and I trust her judgment. No, I don’t think there’s anything else for today. Just…please send me the requisitions for the blood work. And perhaps a little information about this pain specialist, just in case. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time. And I look forward to hearing from you soon. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I need a cup of tea. This has been rather…exhausting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Ranells. My nurse will provide you with the requisitions and some information about the pain specialist before you leave. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we will explore all options before making a decision. Your well-being is my top priority. You take care now, and do enjoy your tea.
PATIENT: .
