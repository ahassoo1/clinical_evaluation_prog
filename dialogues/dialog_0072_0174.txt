DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. My name is Dr. Hembrey. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s… difficult to explain. I just feel… down. Very down. And it's been going on for too long, I think. I suppose that’s what you’re here for, isn’t it? To figure things out. I’d like that very much.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Feeling down” for a prolonged period certainly warrants investigation. It is what I’m here for, Mrs. Derasmo. Can you elaborate on that feeling?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes. Well, it's not sadness, exactly. Not like when my husband… passed. It’s more… a heaviness. Like I’m wading through mud all the time. And everything feels… pointless. I don’t enjoy my hobbies anymore. I used to love skiing, even at my age, but now… it just feels like effort. And I have no energy for anything. I mostly just… sit. Is that helpful? I'm not very good at putting things into words.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mrs. Derasmo. It sounds like you're experiencing a loss of interest in things you once enjoyed, accompanied by a persistent lack of energy. A loss of interest is a key symptom. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. Sleep is… sporadic. Some nights I can’t sleep at all, just lie there staring at the ceiling. Other nights I sleep too much, and still wake up feeling exhausted. And my appetite… well, it comes and goes. Some days I can barely eat a thing. Other days I just… snack. Nothing proper, just biscuits and things. Nothing like I used to cook. I used to make the best jollof rice, you know. But I haven’t felt like cooking in months.
DOCTOR: Sporadic sleep and changes in appetite… alright. And have you been experiencing any difficulty with concentration, or have you noticed any feelings of restlessness or agitation?
PATIENT: Concentration… oh dear, yes. I forget things constantly. Names, where I put my keys… even what I was saying mid-sentence sometimes! It's terribly frustrating. And restlessness… not so much agitation, no. More like… a vague unease. Like something isn't right, but I can't put my finger on it. It’s just… uncomfortable. I don’t feel anxious, exactly. Just… off.
DOCTOR: Okay. Loss of interest, sleep disturbances, appetite changes, difficulty concentrating, a vague sense of unease… Now, Mrs. Derasmo, have you experienced any significant life stressors recently, aside from the loss of your husband, which I understand was some time ago?
PATIENT: Significant stressors… hmm. Let me think. My son, he’s having trouble with his business. It’s a restaurant, and things haven’t been going well. He doesn’t say much, but I can tell he’s worried sick about it. And my daughter… well, she’s always been a bit… dramatic. She’s going through a difficult patch with her marriage, and she calls me constantly. It's not that I don't want to help, but it's exhausting. I try to be supportive, you know? But it all adds up, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you are carrying quite a bit of emotional weight, trying to support both of your children. Let’s move on to a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I have arthritis in my knees, which is why I don't ski as much as I used to. And I had a touch of pneumonia last winter, but I recovered fully. Other than that… no, not really. I’ve always been a fairly healthy woman, all things considered. I try to eat well, even if my appetite has been off lately. And I used to be very active.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis and a previous bout of pneumonia, noted. And any past surgeries, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I've been lucky in that regard. Never had to have anything… cut open. I’ve always tried to avoid hospitals if possible.
DOCTOR: No prior surgeries, good. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis medication, Naproxen. And sometimes, when my knees are particularly bad, I take Paracetamol. That's it, really. Oh, and I take a Vitamin D supplement. My doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine last winter.
DOCTOR: Naproxen for arthritis, Paracetamol as needed, and a Vitamin D supplement. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m quite careful, you know. I don't go trying new things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Derasmo, thank you for providing me with that information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again. Honestly, I’m tired of feeling this way.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Let's begin. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths in and out, please. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I'm going to do a brief cognitive assessment, just to get a baseline of your memory and concentration. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… let me see. It’s… August 2nd, 2025. Yes, that’s right. August 2nd, 2025. It’s my grandson’s birthday next week, you know. He's turning ten.
DOCTOR: August 2nd, 2025, correct. Good. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me see... What are the words?
DOCTOR: Table, chair, and pen. Please try to remember them, and I'll ask you to recall them later. Now, can you tell me what brings you the most joy in life, when you are feeling well?
PATIENT: Table, chair, pen... Right. Oh, goodness. What brings me joy… that's a nice question. When I’m feeling well… it's spending time with my family, I suppose. My children, my grandchildren. And… cooking for them. I used to love cooking. Making a big pot of jollof rice, and everyone gathered around the table. Those were good times.
DOCTOR: Spending time with family, and cooking. Alright, Mrs. Derasmo. Now, let me ask you to recall those three words I asked you to remember. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see… Table… chair… and… hmm. It’s on the tip of my tongue. Was it… book? No, that's not right. I'm terribly sorry, Doctor. I can't seem to recall the third word. I’m usually very good with things like that, but my memory hasn’t been the best lately.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mrs. Derasmo. Memory lapses can happen. Based on the information you’ve provided, your symptoms, and this brief assessment, I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'll also order a more comprehensive cognitive assessment to get a clearer picture of your memory and concentration. Would you be open to discussing a referral to a mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or therapist?
PATIENT: A psychiatrist or therapist…? Hmm. Well… I’ve never really thought about that before. Talking to someone… I don’t know. I’ve always been a private person. But… if you think it would help… then yes, I suppose I’m willing to try anything at this point. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mrs. Derasmo. It’s a big step. I truly believe that talking to a professional could provide you with valuable support and coping strategies. I'll write a referral for you to a highly-regarded therapist in the area who specializes in geriatric depression. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low dose of an antidepressant medication. It may take a few weeks to see a noticeable difference, and we'll monitor your progress closely. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of your blood tests and how you're feeling. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Medication… yes. Are there side effects? I don't want to feel worse, you know. And what sort of therapist are you recommending? Is she… strict? I don’t want someone telling me what to do. I've lived a long life, and I know my own mind.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Mrs. Derasmo. All medications have potential side effects, but the medication I'm prescribing has a relatively mild side effect profile. Some people experience mild nausea, sleep disturbances, or decreased appetite initially, but these usually subside within a week or two. We will discuss these potential side effects in detail, and I will monitor you closely for any adverse reactions. As for the therapist, her name is Dr. Anya Sharma. She specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns. She’s known for being a very compassionate and understanding practitioner who works with her patients, not at them. She facilitates discussion and helps you develop coping strategies—she will not simply tell you what to do. I have confidence you will find her approach suitable. I will also provide you with a pamphlet outlining coping strategies for depression and a list of local support groups. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any other supplements I am unaware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies, as I said before. And no other supplements, just the Vitamin D. Honestly, Doctor, I just… I feel like I'm getting old and falling apart. It’s not just the sadness, it’s the forgetfulness, the lack of energy, the feeling of being… useless. It’s frightening.
DOCTOR: It’s not falling apart, Mrs. Derasmo. It’s a normal part of life to experience changes as we age, but that doesn’t mean you’re useless, or that you have to simply accept feeling this way. We’re going to address these symptoms, and I’m confident we can improve your quality of life. I'm going to write you a prescription for Sertraline, 25mg, to be taken once daily. I’ll also provide a list of potential side effects, and my office number should you have any concerns. We’ve scheduled your follow-up appointment for August 16th. Please remember to bring the results of your blood tests with you. Here is the referral for Dr. Sharma, and the information regarding local support groups. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor. And patient. I appreciate that. I’ll… I’ll try the medication. And I’ll see what Dr. Sharma is like. I suppose there’s nothing left to do but wait and see.
DOCTOR: That's right, Mrs. Derasmo. We'll take things one step at a time. And please don't hesitate to contact my office if anything comes up before your follow-up appointment. We're here to support you. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you on August 16th.
