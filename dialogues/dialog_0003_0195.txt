DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I am Dr. Yackey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Honestly, it's nothing serious. I just… well, my daughter thinks I need a little… pep talk, you could say. She said I should get one of those cards from a doctor, can you believe it? A “Get Well” card. Like I’m sick sick. It’s just… things haven’t been the easiest lately, that’s all. And she thinks a card from you will… help. It sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, well… sometimes a little reassurance can be helpful, I suppose. Though typically, we reserve official medical documentation for… actual medical issues. But, I understand your daughter has concerns. Let’s try to be… thorough, shall we?
PATIENT: Thorough? Oh, I'm always thorough. It’s just… I don’t have anything to complain about, really. My back aches a bit from the work, of course. But that's just… life. I've been assembling those little… whatchamacallits… the electronic parts, for years. It’s honest work. My daughter worries too much. She’s a good girl, but… dramatic. Honestly, I just want a card. A nice one. With flowers, maybe. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Electronic parts assembly... and back pain. For how long have you been experiencing this back pain, Ms. Micucci?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Since… well, since I started the assembly work. Must be… fifteen years now? Maybe more. It comes and goes. It's not like it stops me from doing anything. I still cook, I still clean, I still do everything around the house. It’s just… a dull ache, mostly. I take some… you know… the little white pills. Ibuprofen, I think. My neighbor gives them to me. She has a big bottle. They help a bit, but it always comes back. It’s just… part of getting older, isn’t it? Don't tell me I need to stop working! That's all I do all day.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen… from a neighbor. Right. And are you experiencing any pain besides the back pain?
PATIENT: Oh, well… now that you mention it… my hands get a little… stiff sometimes. Especially in the mornings. It makes it harder to… you know… pick up the tiny screws. They’re so small! I drop them all the time. It's not painful painful, just… difficult. And my fingers… they tingle a bit. Not all the time. Just when I'm… really concentrating. It's probably just… from using my hands so much. It makes sense, doesn’t it? I mean, I’m not a young woman anymore. Everything starts to ache eventually. Honestly, I just wish I could get that card already. It's really not a big deal.
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the hands, tingling… and for how long have you noticed this hand discomfort, Ms. Micucci?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Hmm… let me think. The stiffness… that's been happening for… maybe a year or so? It got worse a few months ago, I suppose. And the tingling… oh, I don't know… maybe six months? It's not constant, like I said. It comes and goes. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. I have a lot on my mind. I have to remember to pick up my granddaughter from school tomorrow, and I promised my neighbor I'd help her with her garden… and then there's the cooking, and the cleaning… It’s a busy life! Really, I'm perfectly fine. Just… a bit tired, maybe. But who isn't tired these days? Is this going to take much longer? I'd really like to get that card, you know. For my daughter's peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, you've mentioned back pain for fifteen years, hand stiffness for a year, and tingling for six months. This isn’t simply “tired.” While I appreciate your… resilience, it’s my professional obligation to investigate these symptoms further. Do you have any other complaints?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're making it sound like something’s terribly wrong! Honestly, I just wanted a card! But fine, fine… if you must know… my sleep hasn't been the best lately. I wake up a lot during the night. I toss and turn… I think about everything I have to do the next day. And… well, sometimes I feel a little… breathless. Especially when I climb the stairs. But it’s probably just my weight. I haven’t been eating as well lately, with everything going on. It’s not like I’m sick sick. It’s just… a lot. And you're making me nervous now! Are you going to tell me I need to stop working? Because I need to work. It's all I have. Honestly, it's all a bit much. Can we just… forget I said anything about the sleep and the breathlessness? And get the card?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I understand your… reluctance. However, sleep disturbance and breathlessness, combined with your existing complaints, warrant a more thorough assessment. Do you have any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're really scaring me! Heart problems? Diabetes? No! Absolutely not! My mother lived to be eighty-five, perfectly healthy, except for her arthritis. I get a bit winded sometimes, but that's just because… well, I'm not as young as I used to be! And I don't go to the doctor regularly, honestly. I don’t like doctors. They always poke and prod and make you worry about things. I just take a few pills when I need them, and I get on with my life. Honestly, I think my daughter is overreacting. She worries too much. She wants me to be… perfect. But nobody's perfect! And I really, really want that card. Can we please just focus on that? Is it too much to ask for a simple card? I feel like I'm being interrogated!
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I understand your… preferences. However, given your symptoms and lack of regular medical care, I'm going to order some basic blood work and an EKG to rule out any underlying issues. We will also need to check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation. After that, and only after that, will I consider writing a note. This is for your own well-being, Ms. Micucci. It’s my professional responsibility. I’ll have the nurse come in to start the process. And please, try to relax. It’s not an interrogation. It’s… preventative medicine.
PATIENT: Oh… oh, goodness. Now you’re really scaring me. Blood work? An EKG? I don’t like needles! And what if something is wrong? I just wanted a card… This is ridiculous! I’m perfectly fine! This is all my daughter’s fault. She’s going to make me sick with worry now! Honestly… I… I think I need to sit down. This is just… too much. But fine… fine. Do what you have to do. But I’m telling you, it’s all a waste of time. And I still want the card after all of this. It's the principle of the thing, you know? My daughter… she’s going to feel terrible when she finds out you’ve made me this upset. Just… please be gentle. And hurry up, please. This is awful. Absolutely awful.
