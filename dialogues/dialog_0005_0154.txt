DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hello Doctor… Don-ate, is it? Yes. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. Been botherin’ me. Again. It feels…uncomfortable. I don’t rightly remember all the details, but it happens now and then. I just want it fixed, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” alright. And you’ve had this issue… on and off for a while?
PATIENT: Yes, on and off. A long while. Honestly, Doctor, I couldn’t say how long. Years, I suppose. It comes and goes. It’s… annoying. I’ve tried drinkin’ lots of water, I think. And… avoiding coffee? Maybe. It’s hard to keep track. It’s not like it’s new, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. Years. And when it is happening, can you describe what "uncomfortable" feels like, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… it burns, a little. When I… go to the bathroom. And I feel like I need to go all the time, even when I just have gone. It's… urgent, you see? And sometimes… a little pain, low down. But it doesn’t last long, usually. I’m not one to complain, Doctor. Really, I’m not. I just want it to stop happening.
DOCTOR: Burning with urination, frequency, urgency… and some lower abdominal discomfort. Alright. And is this happening more often lately, or about the same as usual?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Hmm. I think… maybe a little more? Yes, I believe so. It's hard to say for sure, you understand. Things get… mixed up sometimes. But I feel like I’ve been to the bathroom more these past few weeks than usual. It’s… disrupting things. I like to garden, and… well, you can imagine. It’s inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… goodness. I… I don’t think so. I try not to look, if you understand. It’s… unpleasant. I haven’t noticed anything obvious. But… I suppose I couldn’t say for certain. It all looks… the same to me, really. I'm sorry. Is that helpful? I don’t mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: It's alright. Okay. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. And just to be clear, this is a fairly common problem, so don’t be embarrassed. We’ll figure it out.
PATIENT: Oh. An exam… right. Well… I suppose that's necessary. I’m not fond of doctors, if I’m honest. But… if you think it's best. Just… try to be quick, alright? I have tomatoes that need staking. Is there a gown or something? I don’t want to get dirt all over everything.
DOCTOR: There's a gown right there. You can change behind the curtain. I’ll be right outside. We’ll just take a look, check your abdomen, and do a quick urine sample. It'll only take a few minutes. And yes, we'll try to be quick. Tomatoes are important.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. These things are… flimsy. Alright. A urine sample… yes. I remember that part. It's… awkward, but necessary, I suppose. Just… let me know when you’re ready. And please, hurry. The sun doesn’t wait for anyone. I’ll… be in here. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. When you’re ready, just let me know, and we’ll get this sample. Try to catch mid-stream, if you can. And don't worry about being perfect. Just do your best. I’ll be right outside.
