DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I ain’t one for small talk, Doc. Been… bleeding. From down there, if you gotta know. Not a pleasant experience, let me tell ya. It started a couple days ago, just thought it was somethin' I ate, but it ain’t stoppin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bleeding isn’t comfortable, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. A couple of days ago… can you describe the bleeding for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What am I, a poet now? It’s… red. Obviously. And it’s comin’ out of… well, you know. It’s not like a fountain, thankfully, but it’s enough to ruin a perfectly good pair of shorts. And it smells… like, well, like blood. Is that helpful? Honestly, I don’t know what you want me to say. It’s bleeding, Doc. What's there to describe?
DOCTOR: Right, you're right. Sorry, that was a bit… clinical of me. Let's try this differently. Has it been constant since it started, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, mostly. Worse when I, uh… move around a lot. Or after I eat somethin’ spicy. Though, to be honest, everything seems to make it worse lately. It’s not like a steady drip, thank goodness. More like… bursts. And it’s dark, you know? Not bright red like when you cut yourself. Darker. Like… old pennies, maybe? Is that what you wanted to know? I really don't enjoy talkin’ about this, Doc.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark blood and related to activity and diet... that's helpful. Have you noticed any pain associated with the bleeding?
PATIENT: Pain? A little. It's not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. Low down. Gets worse when I gotta… well, you know. Go to the bathroom. And honestly, just feelin’ generally weak. Like somethin’s drainin’ me. Not just the blood, if you get my drift. It’s hard to explain. It just feels… off. Been sleepin’ terrible too, keepin’ me run down. Don’t know if that’s connected or not.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weakness and poor sleep alongside the bleeding and ache… I see. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Now you’re askin’ about… Look, I ain’t here to discuss my bathroom business with a stranger, Doc. I came in ‘cause I’m bleedin’. What does that have to do with anything? I mean, it's probably just somethin’ I ate. Everything gives me heartburn these days, maybe it’s that. I don’t need a full inventory of my… digestive system. Seriously. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: Okay, you're right. My apologies, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's step back. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've had… tummy troubles, sure. Heartburn, indigestion, the usual. But nothin’ like this. Not bleedin’. My wife… well, she always said I was a sturdy fella. Good constitution, she called it. That was before… before she passed. But I’ve never had anything like this. And I’ve lived a long life, Doc. A long, mostly healthy life. This is new. And frankly, it’s worryin’ me. Not just the bleedin’, but the weakness. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gentz, and I apologize for the line of questioning. It's important to rule things out. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't take nothin'. Never have. Always believed in lettin' the body heal itself. My wife, bless her soul, she was the one for pills and potions. I just… didn’t like takin’ ‘em. Waste of money, if you ask me. Maybe a little antacid now and then for the heartburn, but that’s it. Absolutely nothin’ else. Don't even own a bottle of vitamins. I eat alright, mostly. Just… nothin’ else. Plain and simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Now, there was that time when I was a kid, broke my arm fallin’ out of a mango tree. But that was… sixty years ago? And a hernia repair when I was in my forties, but that was… quick. In and out. That’s about it. Nothin’ major. Nothin’ recently. Definitely nothin’ that would be causin’ this. I'm tellin’ ya, Doc, somethin' ain't right. It just feels… different. And I don't like different.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent surgeries. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. My father… he was a strong man, but he had… problems with his stomach. Always complainin’. Never went to the doctor, stubborn as a mule. Died young, actually. Heart attack, they said. Mother… she lived a long life, but she had high blood pressure. And my sister… she had some kind of… cancer, I think. Lung cancer. But that was years ago. Everyone on my side of the family was stubborn and didn’t bother with doctors, honestly. Not much history to tell ya, Doc. Mostly just… tough folks who ignored their aches and pains ‘til it was too late. That’s the truth of it. I'm startin' to feel like I'm tellin' you my life story here. What does all this even matter? I came in ‘cause I'm bleedin’!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Gentz. I'm asking about family history to see if there are any patterns that might be relevant. But we can move on if you’d prefer. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a brief digital rectal exam. Is that okay?
PATIENT: A… what now? Listen to my… tummy? And a… a what exam? Look, I appreciate you tryin’ to help, Doc, I really do. But I ain't comfortable with… pokin’ and proddin’. Especially not… down there. I came in for a simple question, not a full-blown… investigation. I’m a private man, and I don’t appreciate bein’ put in this position. Honestly, I think I’d rather just… go home. Maybe it’ll stop on its own. What’s the point of all this, anyway? It's just blood, Doc. Old men bleed sometimes. It ain’t exactly a crisis. I’m not stayin’ for no pokin’ and proddin’. I’m leavin’.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, please sit down. I understand your discomfort, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel uneasy. However, to properly assess what’s causing the bleeding, a physical exam is crucial. I assure you, everything will be done with the utmost respect and discretion. The rectal exam is important to rule out potential sources of bleeding, like hemorrhoids or more serious issues. Without it, I can’t provide you with an accurate diagnosis and recommend the appropriate treatment. I'm concerned about the dark blood and your reported weakness. If you absolutely refuse the exam, I cannot confidently diagnose the cause of your bleeding and I strongly advise you to seek a second opinion from another physician. I will document your refusal, but I cannot proceed further without at least attempting to determine the cause. I want to help you, but I need your cooperation. Would you reconsider?
