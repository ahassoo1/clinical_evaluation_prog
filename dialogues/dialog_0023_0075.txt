DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – for the sleep apnea, you see – and it does help, mostly. But I still find myself nodding off during the day, sometimes. It's a bit… unsettling, to be honest. Especially when I’m trying to grade papers.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Daytime sleepiness, even with the CPAP machine… unsettling is a good way to put it. And how long has this been going on, despite using the machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it's been… well, I started using the machine properly, I’d say about six months ago now. And it was much better right away, a real difference. But this little bit of sleepiness crept back in, maybe three or four months ago? It’s not every day, and it's not for long, but it's enough to worry me. I don’t want to fall asleep while I’m driving, you understand. That's the biggest thing.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. And would you describe this sleepiness as… a sudden urge to sleep, or more of a general feeling of fatigue?
PATIENT: That's a good question. It's... more of a sudden thing, I think. Like a wave comes over me. Not like I’m just tired all the time, though I do get tired, naturally, at my age. But this is… a quick, almost overwhelming need to close my eyes. It happens even if I’ve had a decent night’s sleep. Sometimes, when I’m sitting quietly, like reading, it’s easier to happen, I’ve noticed.
DOCTOR: I see. And you said grading papers. Does it happen specifically when you're focused on a task, or is it more random?
PATIENT: That's interesting you ask that. It seems to be worse when I'm really concentrating, yes. Grading papers is a good example. Or if I'm working on a lecture, preparing something for my students. It's not when I'm watching television, thankfully! It's definitely linked to… mental effort, I would say. Though like I said, it's not every time. Just… often enough to bother me. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it does. We need to rule out some things. Have you had any changes in your medications recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. My medications have been the same for… oh, goodness, I don’t know, five or six years now, I suppose. Just the usual things for my blood pressure and a little something for my arthritis. Nothing new, I assure you. And I always take them as prescribed. I’m very careful with that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Good. And any new symptoms alongside the sleepiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I mean, I get a little forgetful sometimes, but that's just age, isn't it? <chuckles softly> I wouldn't say anything new has popped up. Maybe a little bit of… well, sometimes my legs feel a little restless at night. Not every night, and it's not terribly bad. It's just a slight… uncomfortable feeling, hard to explain. Is that relevant? I don’t know if that’s connected.
DOCTOR: Restless legs… could be. Now, let’s talk about your CPAP machine. Do you know what your AHI is currently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. AHI… that's the apnea-hypopnea index, isn't it? Honestly, Doctor, I leave that to the technicians. They tell me the machine is working, and they adjust the settings. I just know they said it was… good enough, when they checked it last. I don’t really understand the numbers, or what a good number is. They sent me a report, but it's all technical jargon to me. I trust them to handle that part, if that makes sense. Is it important I know that number?
DOCTOR: It would be helpful, yes. It tells us how effectively the machine is treating your sleep apnea. We need to verify that the machine is properly controlled. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any other possibilities. We'll check your heart and lungs, neurological function, and do a brief check of your reflexes. It won't be extensive, but it’s a good starting point. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. It's better to be thorough, I always say. Just let me know what I need to do. <adjusts his glasses> I suppose I should probably unbutton my coat, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. If you'll just have a seat and unbutton your coat. I'll listen to your heart and lungs first. <begins washing hands> Now, breathe deeply for me…
