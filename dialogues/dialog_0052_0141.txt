DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Brendan. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching. It’s… everywhere, really. Been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad. Not terrible, but… constant.
DOCTOR: Constant itching, you say. A few weeks in duration. That certainly sounds bothersome, Brendan. To help me understand what might be causing this, could you describe the itching in more detail?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not… like a rash, at least not one you can see. It feels… deep. Under the skin, almost. And it comes and goes, but it’s always there, even if it’s just a little tickle. It's worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. It doesn’t really seem to matter what I’m wearing either. Cotton, wool… doesn’t make a difference.
DOCTOR: “Deep” itching, not associated with a visible rash, worse at night, and not relieved by clothing changes. That’s helpful information. Do you notice any specific areas that are more affected than others, or is it truly all over?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly on my back, I think. Hard to reach, of course. And my legs. My arms are okay, mostly. My stomach is… not bad. It's just… it feels like it's inside more than on me, you know? Like a bug crawling under the skin, but there's never anything there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Brendan. It sounds quite distressing. “Inside” itching is a very specific description. And localized to your back and legs, primarily. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this itching?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever. No… changes in my bowel habits. No weight loss, though my appetite hasn't been great lately. Just… tired. I’ve been sleeping poorly, naturally, with the itching, so I'm always a bit worn out. Oh! And… I have been more thirsty than usual, I suppose. Not dramatically, but I find myself reaching for water more often.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no change in bowel habits, no weight loss, fatigue, and increased thirst. Thank you for sharing those details. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I have… had some trouble with my kidneys in the past, a few years ago. Nothing major, the doctors said it was just age-related. I see a specialist for it, Dr. Volkov, but it’s been stable for a while. Other than that… I had the usual childhood things, you know? Chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. And my wife… she passed away last year, and she had… well, she had some heart trouble. It's been a rough year.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Brendan. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult. And thank you for mentioning your kidney history and seeing Dr. Volkov. That's important information. Could you tell me specifically what the diagnosis was regarding your kidneys, if you recall?
PATIENT: It was… chronic kidney disease, stage three, I think. Something like that. Dr. Volkov said it was slowing down, but… it needs to be monitored. We do blood tests every six months. He said it wasn't causing any problems, just needed to keep an eye on it. And, he’s the one who said it was probably just age-related. I take a small pill every day for it, Losartan, I think it’s called. And I try to watch my salt intake.
DOCTOR: Losartan for chronic kidney disease, stage three, monitored by Dr. Volkov, with attention to salt intake. Excellent. Now, besides Losartan, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just the Losartan. Oh, and I take a multivitamin sometimes. Not every day, just… when I remember. It's one of those cheap ones from the drugstore. And… sometimes I take fish oil, for my joints. They ache a bit, you know? Old age creeping in. Again, not every day, just when I feel particularly stiff.
DOCTOR: Intermittent multivitamin and fish oil. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife was allergic to shellfish, but I’m fine with it. I eat it all the time. No trouble with penicillin, or any of those common ones. I’ve had all the shots, too, when they offered them.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I'm retired now. Used to work as a dispatcher. Mostly for trucks, coordinating deliveries and all that. Lived in this town my whole life, really. Don't travel much anymore. Mostly just stay home, read books, watch a bit of TV. And… I used to garden a lot, but it's hard to bend over these days. I don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don't smoke. Never have.
DOCTOR: Retired, former dispatcher, long-time resident, enjoy reading, used to garden, occasional glass of wine, and a non-smoker. That provides a good picture. Now, Brendan, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything else you feel is relevant for me to know about your condition?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, it's probably nothing, but I did start using a new laundry detergent a few weeks ago. Around the same time the itching started. It's… a scented one. I switched because the old one was discontinued. Maybe that’s it? It seems silly, I know.
DOCTOR: That is not silly at all, Brendan. New exposures are always important to consider. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Alright, now I’d like to perform a physical examination. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88, and your pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let's take a look at your skin. I’m going to examine the areas where you mentioned the most itching. I don’t see any rash, redness, or visible lesions on your skin. There are some areas of dryness, but nothing that seems immediately concerning. I'll gently palpate your skin to check for any unusual texture or thickening. Your skin feels normal in terms of texture and temperature. No palpable masses or abnormalities. Finally, I’ll check your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged.
PATIENT: Okay. Does that mean you don't know what it is? Everything feels the same, but this itching is driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Brendan. The physical exam didn’t reveal any obvious cause for the itching. That doesn’t mean we don’t have a direction to go, it just means it's a bit more complex. Given your history of chronic kidney disease, the itching could be related to that, even if your kidney function has been stable. It can sometimes cause pruritus, or itching, as a symptom. However, the timing with the new laundry detergent is also concerning, and we shouldn’t rule that out. To be thorough, I’d like to order some blood tests. We’ll check your complete blood count, kidney function, liver function, thyroid function, and also some inflammatory markers to rule out other possibilities. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests are fine. If it is the detergent, I can switch back. But it’s good to rule things out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I agree. It’s always best to be thorough. I’m ordering a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to assess for inflammation. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend switching back to your previous laundry detergent, just to see if that makes a difference. Also, I’m going to give you a prescription for an antihistamine, specifically cetirizine. It may provide some temporary relief from the itching while we wait for the blood test results. Would you like me to explain any of that further?
PATIENT: Cetirizine… isn’t that for allergies? I don't have allergies, as we said. But, alright, I'll try it. If it helps, great. If not, well, we'll know. And yes, please, explain the blood tests again. Just to be sure I understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Cetirizine is an antihistamine, and you're right, it's often used for allergies. However, it can also help with itching that isn't allergy-related by blocking histamine, a chemical that can contribute to pruritus. It's worth trying, even if you don’t have classic allergy symptoms. Now, regarding the blood tests, the complete metabolic panel checks your kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. We've already discussed your kidney function, and it's important to rule out any changes. The complete blood count checks your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, which can indicate inflammation or infection. The thyroid-stimulating hormone checks your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause itching. And finally, the ESR and CRP are inflammatory markers. Elevated levels can suggest there's inflammation somewhere in your body. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… much clearer, thank you. Kidney, liver, blood count, thyroid, and inflammation. And the cetirizine might help while we wait. Okay. I think I've got it. How long will the blood tests take? And when should I call you with the results?
DOCTOR: The blood tests should take around 24-48 hours to come back. The lab will typically contact me with the results. I will then review them and call you directly, usually within a day or two of receiving them. So, you should expect a call within three to five business days. In the meantime, if your itching becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms, such as fever, jaundice, or significant fatigue, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor Shely. You’ve been very thorough, and… patient with me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. I understand how frustrating persistent itching can be, and I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Here's a copy of your lab orders and a prescription for the cetirizine. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon.
