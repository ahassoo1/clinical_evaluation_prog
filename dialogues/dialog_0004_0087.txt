DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. That's what the nice lady on the phone said. Medicare wants some things checked, I guess. Honestly, it all feels a bit fuzzy. I don’t really keep track of these things anymore. Just want to get it done and over with, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Medicare does have periodic wellness checks they require. It’s…efficient, I suppose. Let's start with a little more detail, though. Are you currently experiencing any specific symptoms – anything at all that’s bothering you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Not that I recall, no. I feel…old, naturally. But that's just getting on in years, isn't it? Everything aches a little, but… that's always been the case. I wouldn’t say anything’s bothering me particularly. Is there something specific I should be looking for? My memory isn't what it used to be, so maybe I missed something.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll take things slowly then. By "aches," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Well… my knees, mostly. They creak when I stand up. And my back… stiff. Used to work at the power plant, you know. Lots of bending and lifting. Probably something from that. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Gets worse when it rains, strangely enough. Honestly, I probably just need to rest more. It's hard to explain… It's just old.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll document that as generalized joint discomfort, likely musculoskeletal in origin, exacerbated by weather. Now, beyond your joints, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… weight… Oh dear. I haven’t really been paying attention to either, to be honest. I eat when I’m hungry, I suppose. And I haven't stepped on a scale in… well, a very long time. I probably haven't gained much weight, but I wouldn’t swear to it. Does it matter? Is something wrong if I haven't been keeping track? I just want the lab work done, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: It's helpful information, Mr. Croonquist, to establish a baseline. Significant changes in appetite or weight can be indicative of underlying issues, even if they aren't immediately serious. But we'll proceed. Let's move on to your bowel habits. Have you noticed any changes in your regularity, or the appearance of your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That’s a… personal question, isn't it? Look, Doctor, I’m an old man. Things aren’t what they used to be. Regularity… is a good word, I suppose. It happens. I haven't been paying attention to… the appearance. Is this really necessary for the lab work? I feel like we're getting a bit off track here. Medicare didn’t mention anything about this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, I assure you, these questions are standard procedure. A comprehensive assessment is vital, even for a routine wellness check. Changes in bowel habits can be early indicators of certain conditions. However, if you are truly uncomfortable discussing this further, we can proceed without detailed specifics. But I must document that you declined to provide this information. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. No fever, no chills… night sweats? Sometimes I get a little warm at night, but that's just the blanket, I think. Old house, doesn’t hold the heat well. Look, I really don’t understand why all this is necessary. Are you sure there isn't just a simple form I can fill out? This is… a lot. I just want to get the lab work done and go home. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, with all due respect, I am attempting to gather a complete medical history to ensure the lab results are interpreted accurately. A simple form will not provide the necessary detail. Now, let's try a different approach. Have you noticed any changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Urinary habits? Oh, for goodness sake. I… go to the bathroom, Doctor. More often than I used to, probably. That’s just… getting older, isn’t it? What exactly are you looking for? I’m starting to feel like I’m back in school being quizzed on things I don’t understand! Just… let me get the lab work done. I really don’t think all this questioning is helping. I feel perfectly fine, just a bit… old. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. I will proceed with the lab work as requested, despite your reluctance to provide a complete medical history. However, please understand that the results may be more difficult to interpret without a more thorough understanding of your overall health. We will start with a blood draw and a urine sample. The nurse will be in shortly to assist you. Some patients…
