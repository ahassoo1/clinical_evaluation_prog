DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Smetak, was it? A lovely name. Um… well, it’s a bit silly, really. I need to know my… my blood type. It’s for some paperwork, you see. My son… he said I needed it. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I can’t rightly recall why exactly, but paperwork… yes.
DOCTOR: Yes, paperwork can certainly be a reason. No worries at all, Darl, it’s not silly at all. We can absolutely check your blood type for you. Just to be thorough, while we're at it, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, my health… Well, I’m… seventy-nine. That’s a start, isn’t it? I get a bit tired, you know, and my knees aren't what they used to be. Used to be a rigger, you see, climbing all over things. Not much climbing these days. I have a bit of trouble sleeping sometimes, but nothing… terrible. And I think that’s it. Mostly just old, Doctor. Old and… forgetful. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Seventy-nine years is quite a life! And being a rigger – that sounds physically demanding. It's good to know about the fatigue and knee trouble. And the sleep… is it difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Hmm… I think… staying asleep, mostly. I fall asleep alright enough, but I wake up a lot during the night. Then I lie there… thinking. Or trying to think. It's all a bit muddled, really. I don't mind it too much, though. Gives me time to… well, I don’t remember what it gives me time to do! It's just… not very restful, that's all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Waking up frequently during the night can be very disruptive. It's good you’re able to find some peace with it, though. Now, have you had any significant medical issues in the past – anything you’ve been treated for, like heart problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a tricky one. I… I had something, years ago. A bad cough, I think. And I was in the hospital for a little while. But what for… that escapes me. I don’t remember ever being told I had… those things you mentioned. Heart… diabetes… no, I don’t think so. I used to be very active, you see. Climbing all those towers. Wouldn't have been able to do that with… with those problems. But honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Darl. It’s perfectly alright. Memory can be like that. Knowing you were active in the past is good information, though. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, I remember that much. A very scary doctor! And… I think… yes. Something with my knee. Years and years ago. After… after a fall. But it was a very long time ago. I don’t remember the details. They fixed it, though. Mostly. It’s why it bothers me now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, so tonsils as a child and a knee surgery sometime in the past. Do you know approximately when that knee surgery was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one, Doctor. Let me see… I was still working, I think. I had my son, Miguel, when I was quite young… so it must have been after that. He’s… sixty-something now? Yes, sixty-two, I believe. So, a long time ago. Perhaps… forty years ago? More? It’s all very hazy. I’m afraid I’m not much help with dates, am I? I was always better with ropes than calendars.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Darl. It’s helpful to have a general timeframe. Knowing it was around forty years ago gives us a starting point. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother… she lived a long life, thankfully. But she had… something with her stomach, I think. It was a long time ago. And my father… he was a strong man, a fisherman. But he died young. A heart attack, I think. Yes, a heart attack. And my sister… she had cancer, many years ago. Very sad, that was. It's a bit of a gloomy topic, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is, but it's important information. Knowing about those conditions helps us understand your overall risk. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… I take a little something for my knees, sometimes. When they’re really bothering me. It’s a white pill, I think. And… oh! And a little something to help me sleep, occasionally. A blue one, that is. Not every night, mind you. Just when I really can’t get to sleep. As for allergies… I don’t think so. Nothing I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. But honestly, Doctor, I can’t be certain. It’s been a long life!
DOCTOR: Alright, medications for your knees and sleep as needed. That's good to know. Now, just to finish up with the background information, would you mind telling me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Oh, that’s a simple one, Doctor. I mostly stay at home these days. I enjoy reading, when my eyes allow. And I like to watch television. I don't go out much anymore, my knees you see. And I don’t drink or smoke. Never have. I used to walk a lot, when I was younger, of course. Now, it’s mostly… quiet. A peaceful life, mostly. Not very exciting, but it suits me.
DOCTOR: That sounds very pleasant, Darl. A peaceful life is a good life. Alright, now that I have a better understanding of your health history, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. It’s been a while since anyone poked and prodded me, to be honest!
DOCTOR: Alright, just take some deep breaths for me, please. In… and out… good. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little bit of a murmur, which is common with age. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now let's check your blood pressure. 140/85. A little elevated, but not overly concerning. And finally, let’s take a look at your knees. Some tenderness on the inner side of both knees, and a bit of swelling. Range of motion is limited, with some crepitus. It seems like you have some osteoarthritis in both knees, which is not surprising given your history. Everything else looks within normal limits.
PATIENT: Oh, my knees, you’re surprised? They’ve been giving me trouble for years, you know. Osteo… what was it? It doesn't sound very pleasant. So, it’s just old age, then? That's what I figured. What about the blood type? Is that something you can tell me now? I did come in for that, after all!
DOCTOR: You’re right to remind me, Darl! My apologies. It’s easy to get caught up in the details. Yes, you came in for your blood type. We'll need to draw a small sample of blood for testing. It should only take a few minutes. While we're waiting for the results, I’d like to discuss some options for managing your knee pain. We can try some over-the-counter pain relievers, physical therapy, or, if that's not enough, we could consider some injections. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, injections sound a bit scary, Doctor. I'd rather not, if possible. Pain relievers and… what was the other one? Therapy? Yes, that sounds much nicer. Gentle exercises, perhaps? I wouldn't want to overdo it, you know. And as for the blood… how long will it take? Is it a lot of blood? I don't like the sight of it, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Darl. We can absolutely start with pain relievers and physical therapy. No injections unless absolutely necessary, and we'll go at your pace with the exercises. As for the blood test, it’s just a small vial, and you won't even see the needle. The phlebotomist will take care of everything. It should only take about ten minutes to get the results back. Let me call her in now. "Hi Maria, could you please come in and draw some blood for Darl Nini in exam room 2?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That sounds much better. A gentle pace is good. I appreciate you listening to my concerns. I’m not a fan of needles, as you can imagine. It's silly, I know, but… well, some things never change, do they? I’ll just sit here and try not to think about it.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Darl. Many people feel the same way. I’ll be right here if you need anything. Just focus on taking some deep breaths, and it will be over before you know it.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Maria, this is Darl Nini. She’s just going to need a small blood sample. Maria is very good at this, and it won’t take long. .
