DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been… forgetting things. Little things at first, but it’s getting worse, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Forgetting things, you say. A rather vague complaint, Ms. Heidenthal. Could you be more… specific?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay, let me think. Like… I’ll go into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and… the word I want just vanishes. It’s not all the time, but it happens enough that I noticed. And recently, I had to ask my neighbor what day it was… twice. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Right. So, intermittent memory lapses. And you find this… distressing. Have you noticed any other changes, Ms. Heidenthal?
PATIENT: Changes? Not really… I mean, I’ve been a little more tired lately, maybe? But I figured that was just… life, you know? I haven't felt sick or anything. And no headaches, if that matters. I just keep thinking I'm getting old, but it seems like it's happening fast.
DOCTOR: “Tired” is not a diagnosis, Ms. Heidenthal. Now, let’s attempt a bit of a structured inquiry. Do you have any difficulties with tasks you’ve always found easy?
PATIENT: Tasks… hmm. That’s a good question. I… I used to be really good at following recipes, baking especially. But the last few times, I’ve gotten totally confused, like I can’t follow the steps in order. Or I’ll forget an ingredient. It's small things, but frustrating. And I manage the finances for my little rental property, and I've had to double-check everything several times lately.
DOCTOR: Right. So, difficulties with executive function… mildly concerning. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, before we proceed further, let us establish some foundational information. Do you have any history of medical illness?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, and a broken arm once. Nothing serious. I see the dentist regularly, obviously! And I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was all pretty straightforward. No… major stuff. I don’t really take any medications, either. Just vitamins.
DOCTOR: Vitamins. Of course. Any family history of… neurological issues?
PATIENT: Neurological issues… That’s a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… she got really confused towards the end of her life. The doctors said it was old age, I think. But she didn’t really get a proper diagnosis, if that makes sense. She just… faded away. My mother never talked about it much. I don’t know if that counts?
DOCTOR: "Faded away" is not a clinical observation, Ms. Heidenthal. Now, let us proceed with a brief physical examination. I require you to follow my instructions precisely. We'll start with a neurological assessment. Please follow my finger with your eyes. Do not move your head.
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. Is this alright? It's a little… blurry without my glasses.
DOCTOR: You should have mentioned you require corrective lenses, Ms. Heidenthal. This is rather… inefficient. Please retrieve your spectacles. We cannot conduct a proper assessment with compromised visual acuity. And while you are at it, tell me if you experience any dizziness or balance issues.
PATIENT: Oh! I am so sorry. Here we go. Yes, much better. No dizziness or balance problems, thankfully. I can usually tell when I'm getting a cold, and sometimes I get a little lightheaded when I stand up too fast, but that's it. Is this better? Should I just… follow your finger again?
DOCTOR: Yes. Follow my finger, Ms. Heidenthal. Smoothly, and without hesitation. Now look at my nose. Now look at my finger. Repeat. Pupil response appears… normal. Now, I require you to stand and walk a straight line.
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is that alright? I feel a little silly…
DOCTOR: Adequate, but slightly unsteady. Now, sit. I require a brief cognitive assessment. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… let me think. Today is… August… the 2nd? Is that right? Yes, August 2nd. And the year is… 2025. I think. I really hope that's right. It's hard to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. What are the words?
DOCTOR: Apple. Table. Penny. Now, repeat them back to me. Do not anticipate.
PATIENT: Um… Apple… Table… and… Penny? Was that right? I’m trying to remember them, but they feel… slippery. I think I got them. Is that what you wanted?
DOCTOR: Adequate. For now. Ms. Heidenthal, based on this cursory assessment, your symptoms suggest mild cognitive impairment. However, it is far too early to draw definitive conclusions. We must rule out other potential causes. I recommend a full blood workup, including a Vitamin B12 level and thyroid function tests. Additionally, I suggest a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation, including an MRI of the brain. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… serious. Mild cognitive impairment? An MRI? Yes, I… I have questions. What could cause this? And… what does it mean? And what is a neurologist going to do? It's just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, your anxiety is understandable. However, dwelling on hypotheticals is unproductive. Mild cognitive impairment can be caused by a multitude of factors, including age-related changes, Vitamin deficiencies, thyroid disorders, and… other, more concerning conditions. The neurologist will conduct a series of tests to determine the underlying cause. The blood workup will rule out some of the simpler possibilities. As for what they will do… they will assess your cognitive function, order imaging studies, and formulate a treatment plan, if necessary. I am prescribing you a multivitamin, and scheduling the aforementioned blood work and referral. Do not delay these appointments. Here is the lab requisition form and the referral information. I expect a prompt follow-up. Next patient. .
