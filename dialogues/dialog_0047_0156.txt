DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Press. Um… it’s my stomach, I think. It’s been… well, not good. Lots of, you know… diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… annoying, mostly. I’m not sure why though. I feel okay otherwise, just… constantly needing to go. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. “Annoying” is a perfectly valid way to describe it. A bit of diarrhea can certainly be disruptive. And you said “a bit”?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Not a bit bit. More like… a lot of bits. For, like, weeks now, I guess? It’s hard to say exactly how long. Time kind of… blurs. I just know it's not normal, and it's getting old. Is that… helpful? I don’t really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say. Right. Well, that is… considerably more concerning than a fleeting upset. We’ll need to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Do you have any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no throwing up… sometimes I feel a little queasy, like maybe before it happens, but it doesn’t usually… stick around. Just the… urgency, and then… well, you know. It's mostly just the diarrhea. I’m not really getting sick otherwise, just… tired of dealing with it. I'm trying to remember if anything started it, but… honestly, I can’t recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I think… maybe? It's hard to say for sure. I haven't really… looked closely, if that makes sense. I just… go, and then flush. I don’t usually pay attention. Is that… bad? Should I be looking? I feel a little silly even talking about this.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Jase. It’s important information. While it’s not strictly necessary to scrutinize everything, noticing blood or mucus can be quite helpful in determining the cause. Alright. Let's move on. Have you travelled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Travelled? Not really… not in a long time. Just around here, you know? Little trips to visit family, things like that. Nothing exciting. Everything’s been… pretty local for a while now. I don’t think it’s from anything I ate or anything like that, if that helps? I eat pretty much the same things all the time.
DOCTOR: And what do you typically eat, Jase?
PATIENT: Um… well, my husband does most of the cooking. Lots of rice and chicken, I think? We eat a lot of curries, Pakistani food mostly. And bread, definitely lots of bread. I try to eat vegetables, but… I'm not a big fan, honestly. Nothing too fancy, just normal food. I don't really have any allergies or anything that I know of. Is that… helpful? I feel like I'm not being very clear.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. We’ll get there. So, a fairly standard diet. Let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, right! Um… I take a multivitamin, sometimes. And… I think I had some antacids a few weeks ago when my stomach was really bad, but I ran out of those. And… that’s it, I think? Oh, wait! My doctor put me on something a while back for… something with my stomach. It was years ago though, I can't remember the name. It didn’t really help, so I stopped taking it. It was a small pill, I think. Does that… matter? I’m terrible with names and pills.
DOCTOR: Years ago… and you don’t recall what it was for, or the name?
PATIENT: No, I really don't. It was… a long time ago, and I wasn’t really paying attention to what he said, I think. I just remember taking it, and then stopping because it didn’t seem to do anything. My husband might remember, but he's at work right now. He usually handles all the… medical stuff. I’m just here because… well, it’s been going on for a while. I just… kept hoping it would get better on its own. Does that make sense? I feel bad not knowing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ll try to work with what we have. Let's move on to family history. Are there any digestive issues – like Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That’s a good question. I… honestly, I don’t really know. My family… we don’t really talk about… health stuff much. My mom had… something with her stomach, I think, when she was older, but I don’t know what it was. And my dad… he was always pretty healthy. I think my grandmother had some issues too, but I don’t know what. I'm sorry, I'm not much help. I wish I knew more. It's just… not something we talked about.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don't smoke, I don't drink, and definitely no drugs. I'm not really into any of that. I just… try to take care of myself, you know? I eat my food, I try to get enough sleep, I just… this stomach thing is really frustrating. It's just getting in the way of things. It makes it hard to go anywhere, and I worry about… accidents. I’m sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jase. It sounds like you've been dealing with this chronic diarrhea for weeks, with no clear cause that you're aware of. Given the duration and the lack of response to previous, unknown medication, we need to investigate this further. I'm going to need to do a physical examination, and then I’ll order some stool samples to rule out any infections or parasites. After that, depending on the results, we may need to consider a colonoscopy to rule out any structural issues. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Oh… wow. That sounds… intense. Um… I guess so? If we have to. I'm just… a little nervous, to be honest. I'm not really good with… procedures. But if it will help figure out what's wrong, then… okay. What will the stool samples involve? And… is the colonoscopy very painful? I just… I don't like surprises. Is it going to be expensive? My insurance is Medicare, I think. I'm sorry, I'm asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to ask questions, Jase. A colonoscopy is often necessary to get a definitive diagnosis. The stool samples are quite straightforward – you’ll be given a container and instructions on how to collect a small sample. It's not pleasant, but it's not invasive. As for the colonoscopy, it’s performed under sedation, so you won’t feel any pain during the procedure itself. You may experience some cramping and bloating afterwards, but that’s usually manageable. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover a significant portion of the procedure, but there may be some co-pays or deductibles involved. We have a billing department that can provide you with a more detailed estimate. First, let's proceed with the physical examination. I'll listen to your abdomen, palpate it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities, and check your overall condition. This will give me a better initial assessment. If you could lie down on the examination table, please.
PATIENT: Okay… okay, that sounds… better, I think. Sedation is good. And I guess… a physical exam is fine. Okay, here we go. Just… let me know if anything feels… weird. I just… I’m not really a fan of doctors, if that makes sense. Not that you're doing anything wrong, it's just… the whole thing is a little stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll take it slowly. Now, I'm just listening to your bowel sounds. Can you tell me if you're experiencing any pain anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: Um… not really pain, exactly. More like… cramping. It comes and goes, mostly on the lower left side, I think. It’s not terrible, just… uncomfortable. And sometimes it feels like… pressure, like I need to go, even when I don't. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. It's not constant, though. Sometimes my stomach just feels… empty and gurgly. Ooh, that's a little tender there, on the left side. Not awful, just… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here?
PATIENT: That’s… okay. Not painful, just… feels a little empty. Like there's nothing there. I haven't been very hungry lately, I guess. I keep trying to eat, but… it doesn't really stay down for long. It just… goes right through. It’s frustrating. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is somewhat tender to palpation on the lower left side, as you noted. There’s no significant guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Your bowel sounds are slightly hyperactive, consistent with your reported diarrhea. Overall, the physical examination doesn’t reveal any immediate cause for concern, but it doesn’t rule anything out either. Now, I’m going to order those stool samples. The lab will provide you with instructions on how to collect them. It’s important to follow those instructions carefully to ensure accurate results. I'll also write you a referral for a colonoscopy. The endoscopy department will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Stool samples… okay. And the colonoscopy appointment… will they tell me how to prepare for that? I’ve heard… things. About needing to… clean out. I just… I'm a little worried about all of this. It feels like a lot. And I don't want to be a burden. My husband already does so much. I just… want this to be over.
DOCTOR: Yes, the endoscopy department will provide you with detailed instructions on the bowel preparation – the "cleaning out," as you put it. It’s not pleasant, I won’t lie, but it’s a necessary step to ensure a clear view during the colonoscopy. And you’re not a burden at all, Jase. It’s my job to help you, and I understand your anxieties. Here’s the referral for the colonoscopy and the requisition for the stool samples. The endoscopy department will contact you within a few days to schedule the appointment. If you have any questions or concerns about the bowel preparation, don't hesitate to call my office, or you can contact the endoscopy department directly. We're going to get to the bottom of this, Jase. Let's start with the stool samples, and then we’ll see what the colonoscopy reveals. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Dr. Press. You've been… very patient. I just… I really appreciate it. I’ll… get these stool samples done as soon as I can. And I’ll call if I have any questions. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome. Get the samples done as soon as possible. We'll review the results and proceed from there.
