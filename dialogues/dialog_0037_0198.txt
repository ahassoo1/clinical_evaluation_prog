DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’m Liza, by the way… and I’ve been reading a little about mindfulness and meditation. I was hoping to talk about it, see if it might be helpful for me. I just feel… scattered sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Liza, I understand. It’s good you’re proactive about exploring options. Mindfulness and meditation can be very beneficial. To get a better understanding of how they might help you specifically, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by "scattered"?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s hard to explain. It's not like I'm anxious or anything. It’s just… my mind jumps around a lot. Like, I’ll be trying to focus on something – a task at work, even just watching a movie – and suddenly I'm thinking about what I need to make for dinner, or remembering something that happened last week. Or I’ll start one project and then get distracted and start another, and then another. I finish things, eventually, but it feels… inefficient, I guess. And sometimes, it just feels tiring, always having so many thoughts swirling around. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Liza. It sounds like you’re experiencing difficulty with sustained attention and some cognitive restlessness. That’s very common. It’s good you’re able to articulate it so clearly. Before we focus solely on mindfulness, I want to rule out any other potential contributing factors. Just to get a complete picture, have you noticed this happening for a long time, or is it a more recent change?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time, definitely. Probably… well, as long as I can remember, really. Though, it maybe gets worse when I’m stressed. Work can be… demanding. Signal and track switches aren’t exactly calming, you know? Lots of responsibility. But even when things are quiet, it’s just… there. It’s not debilitating, I just… manage it. I just thought maybe there was a better way to manage it than just… pushing through.
DOCTOR: Okay, a long-term pattern, potentially exacerbated by stress. That’s helpful to know. And you’re absolutely right – proactively finding strategies is a great approach. To get a better understanding of the overall picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Nothing major, really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, measles, mumps… nothing serious. A broken arm once, when I was a kid, climbing a plum tree. I’ve been pretty healthy, honestly. I see the doctor for my yearly checkups, and I have Medicare, so they keep an eye on things. No chronic conditions, no surgeries. And I don’t take any regular medications. My blood pressure is usually a little high when I’m at the doctor’s office, because I get nervous, but it's fine at home. Oh! I did have a bout of pretty bad insomnia a few years back, but that cleared up on its own after a few weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, no surgeries, no current medications, and a history of transient insomnia. That's all very helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I live in the city, so there’s always dust and pollen, but nothing bothers me particularly. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I think I’m pretty lucky, health-wise. I just wish my brain would quiet down a little!
DOCTOR: You do sound quite healthy overall, Liza. And it's good you haven't experienced any allergies. Now, just a few questions about your family history… Are there any family members—parents, siblings, grandparents—who have experienced issues with anxiety, depression, ADHD, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she was always a worrier, definitely. Not diagnosed with anything, but she was always anxious about things. Small things, mostly. My grandmother on my father's side… she had some periods of being very sad, after my grandfather passed away, but I don't think it was ever anything serious. They just… grieved. And my brother… he's a bit… restless, I guess you could say. He has trouble sitting still, and he changes jobs a lot. He's never been officially diagnosed with anything, either. They all just… are, you know? It’s not something we really talk about, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Liza. A family history of anxiety, potential mood issues, and restlessness—even without formal diagnoses—is useful information. Now, just to round things out, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, um… social history? What do you mean exactly? I’m single, never married. I have a few friends from work, we sometimes go out for coffee or a movie. I don’t have a lot of family nearby. I keep in touch with my brother on the phone. I don’t really have any hobbies, to speak of. I like to read, sometimes. And I like to walk, when the weather is nice. I don’t drink or smoke. I used to go to the theatre more, but it’s hard to make the time these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, single, a few friends, limited hobbies, no substance use. That gives me a good picture. Just a few more clarifying questions before we proceed. Are you currently employed, and if so, what do you do?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I’m a Signal and Track Switch Repairer. It’s… a lot of responsibility, making sure the trains run safely. It’s mostly outdoors, which I like, but it can be stressful, like I said. Long hours sometimes, and you have to be very careful. Everything has to be just right. It’s not a glamorous job, but it’s… steady. I’ve been doing it for… oh, goodness, almost twenty years now. It keeps me busy, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Twenty years—that’s a significant commitment. And it does sound like a demanding job, requiring a high level of concentration and attention to detail. Okay, Liza, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a much clearer picture of your overall health and well-being. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I haven’t had a full physical in… well, probably a year. Everything’s usually fine, but it’s good to check, I suppose. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Great. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, take a look in your ears and throat, and do a quick neurological assessment – check your reflexes and coordination. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/88, but that’s not uncommon when patients are in a clinical setting, as we discussed. Let’s take it again after we’ve settled in a bit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Now, just going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Coordination appears intact. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. There are no immediate red flags. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure warrants monitoring.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to know. I always get a bit nervous at the doctor’s, so I’m not surprised about the blood pressure. So, what does all this mean? Do you think mindfulness might help me, or is there something else I should be looking into?
DOCTOR: Based on our conversation and the physical exam, I believe mindfulness and meditation are a reasonable starting point. Your symptoms – difficulty focusing, cognitive restlessness – don’t present as a classic picture of any specific medical condition at this time. However, given the family history, it's important to approach this systematically. We can explore mindfulness techniques, and I can provide you with resources for guided meditation. We can also discuss behavioral strategies to help improve focus and manage stress. However, given your mother's history of anxiety and your brother's restlessness, it would be prudent to screen for underlying anxiety or ADHD traits. This isn’t to say you have those conditions, but it will give us a clearer picture. I'd like you to complete a brief questionnaire, the GAD-7 for anxiety, and the ASRS-v1.1 for adult ADHD. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I mean, it’s good to rule things out, isn’t it? I don’t mind filling out questionnaires. It’s better to know for sure. So, where can I find these… GAD-7 and ASRS things? Are they online, or do I need to get them from the nurse? And what happens if they do show something?
DOCTOR: Excellent. They're both short questionnaires, and the nurse can provide you with printed copies, or I can email you links to online versions. If the questionnaires suggest a potential for anxiety or ADHD, it doesn’t necessarily mean a diagnosis. It simply indicates that further evaluation might be helpful. We can discuss options, which could include a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist for a more comprehensive assessment. They can provide specialized testing and recommend appropriate treatment strategies if needed, such as therapy, coaching, or medication. For now, let’s focus on getting these questionnaires completed. And in the meantime, I can provide you with some resources for mindfulness exercises to get you started. I also want to emphasize that these are tools to help you manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life, regardless of any formal diagnosis. Would you like me to email you the links now, or would you prefer the printed copies from the nurse?
PATIENT: Emailing the links would be great, thank you. That way I can do them at my own pace, when I have a quiet moment. And yes, the mindfulness exercises would be wonderful. I'm eager to try something, anything, to feel a little less… scattered. What kind of exercises do you recommend for beginners? Something simple, maybe? I don’t want to get overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I've just emailed you the links to the GAD-7 and ASRS questionnaires. For beginners, I recommend starting with simple breath awareness exercises. Find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed. Sit comfortably, either in a chair or on the floor. Close your eyes gently, and focus your attention on your breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body. Don't try to control your breath, just observe it. When your mind wanders – and it will – gently redirect your attention back to your breath. Start with just five minutes a day, and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. There are many guided meditation apps available that can also be helpful. Headspace and Calm are two popular options. I’ll also print you out a handout with some basic grounding techniques you can use when you’re feeling overwhelmed. These involve focusing on your senses – what you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch – to bring you back to the present moment. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect, actually. Five minutes a day seems very doable. And I’ve heard of Headspace, I think. I’ll definitely look into it. Thank you so much, Doctor. I feel much better already, just having a plan. Is there anything else I should be doing, or anything I should be aware of? Any warning signs I should look out for?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. I’m glad I could help. For now, focus on the questionnaires and the mindfulness exercises. Monitor your symptoms – are they improving, staying the same, or worsening?
