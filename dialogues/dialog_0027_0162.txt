DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Bloating. Honestly, it’s just…bloating. Been happening for a while now. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, but my wife – God rest her soul – she'd always tell me to get these things checked. So here I am. Can we just…get this over with?
DOCTOR: I understand, sir. It’s good of you to come in, even if it’s… belatedly. “Bloating,” you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, bloating. Like…my stomach feels full of air or something. Uncomfortable, you know? It comes and goes. It’s not…painful, exactly. Just…present. Look, I eat normal. Work hard, eat hard. Pile driving isn’t exactly a desk job. I don't know why I'm bloated, that’s why I’m here. Are we going to do tests or what? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. “Normal” eating… could you describe a typical day of meals for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Look, I eat. Breakfast is usually…something. Toast, maybe. Sometimes eggs if I’m feeling fancy. Lunch is a sandwich, usually from the deli near the job site. Dinner…whatever my wife used to make. Now? Takeout mostly. Pizza, burgers…you know. Regular stuff. I don’t sit around counting calories or anything. Is this important? Because I really don’t remember what I had yesterday, specifically.
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, sir. Just trying to get a complete picture. No need to be precise, just a general sense. And…how about drinks?
PATIENT: Water, mostly. I drink a lot of water when I'm working. Gotta stay hydrated, right? Sometimes…soda with lunch. Not every day, but sometimes. And…I used to have a beer with dinner. Not anymore, though. Not much of a point anymore. Look, I'm not a complicated guy, Doc. I work hard, I eat, I drink water. I don't know what else you need. Is this bloating something serious? Because I don't have time for…serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. No, sir, I understand. We're not assuming anything is serious. Just gathering information. Have you noticed if anything specifically seems to trigger the bloating?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like, does something make it worse? Hmm… honestly? Not really. It just…happens. Sometimes it’s after I eat, sometimes it isn't. Sometimes I wake up feeling bloated, sometimes I don't. It’s random. I told you, I don’t pay attention to this stuff. I swing a hammer all day, I don’t catalog my stomach gas. Can we just…skip this part? It's a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, sir. We can move on. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Look, are we really doing this? I’m a pile driver, not a…a gastroenterologist. You want to know about…that? Honestly, it’s…regular. Normal. Everything goes in, everything comes out. What else do you need to know? I'm starting to regret coming here. This is all very…invasive. Can we get to a solution, please? Are you going to give me something for it, or what?
DOCTOR: I apologize, sir. I understand your frustration. It’s just important to rule things out. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your abdomen, and feeling for anything unusual. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. I have a job waiting for me. And honestly, don't poke too hard. I'm a pretty tough guy, but still. Don’t need anything broken on top of being bloated. Just…hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. Just relax. Deep breaths. I’m not going to poke hard, I promise. Abdomen is soft, no guarding or tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, though a bit…hyperactive. No masses palpated. Okay. Everything feels…within normal limits, physically.
PATIENT: Hyperactive? What does that mean? Look, is something wrong with me or not? I'm not a doctor. Just tell me straight. Is this something serious I need to worry about? Because I got bills to pay and a job to do, and I don’t have time for…whatever this is. This is ridiculous. I knew I shouldn't have come. .
DOCTOR: Sir, "hyperactive" just means your bowel sounds are a bit louder than usual. It's not necessarily a cause for alarm. It could be related to the bloating, or simply a result of your diet and activity level. However, given the persistent bloating and the hyperactive sounds, I’d like to order a simple blood test to rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. And potentially a stool sample, just to be thorough. Would that be acceptable?
