DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Honestly, it's about my foot. It’s been giving me trouble for weeks now. A sore, really. A nasty one, and it just won’t go away. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my heel. I've tried everything, or so it seems.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a sore on your foot that’s not healing… alright. And how long exactly have you been dealing with this sore, Louine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started… well, it was right after my grandson left for college. He left in June, so… must be close to two months now. Two months and a bit, maybe. It was just a little red spot at first, and I didn’t think much of it. Now look at it! It’s quite deep, you know. And painful when I walk.
DOCTOR: Two months… yes. And you said it started as a small red spot. Has it changed in appearance at all since then?
PATIENT: Oh, changed? Heavily. It got bigger, of course. And redder. Now it's… well, it's sort of… raw-looking. And there’s some… discharge, I suppose you’d call it. A bit of pus, sometimes. It’s not a pretty sight, I can assure you. And it smells… unpleasant. I keep it covered, of course, but still. It’s worrying, really. I’ve never had a sore that wouldn’t heal before.
DOCTOR: Alright, a worsening sore with discharge and odor… that does warrant a closer look. Have you noticed any swelling or redness around the sore itself, Louine?
PATIENT: Well, yes. Now that you mention it, there is some redness around it. Not a lot, mind you. But it’s definitely not just the sore itself that's red. And sometimes, when I’ve been on my feet too long, it feels warm to the touch. Not feverish, but… warmer than the rest of my foot. I wouldn’t say it's swollen, exactly. But it is… firmer, perhaps? Around the edges. Do you understand what I’m trying to say? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. Redness, warmth, and firmness around the sore. That’s helpful. Now, have you had any fever or chills with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Certainly not. I take my temperature regularly, you know. Always have. Just a habit. And no chills either. I’ve felt a bit tired lately, maybe. But that's just old age catching up with me, I suspect. I’m 89, you know. Things start to ache and… well, you get tired. But no actual fever. And I haven’t been shivering or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever or chills. And you've been keeping an eye on it, which is good. Now, Louine, do you have diabetes, or any other medical conditions that affect your circulation or healing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, diabetes. Type 2. Been managing it for… oh, goodness, nearly 20 years now. I take my medication regularly, of course. Metformin, I think it is. And I try to watch what I eat, though it's hard with all the good food around! And… let me think… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but that's under control now. Doctor said it was just stress. It’s a long list, you know, when you get to my age. But diabetes is the main one, I suppose. It’s always the diabetes.
DOCTOR: Alright, diabetes, managed with metformin, and a history of high blood pressure, currently controlled. That's important information. Now, I'm going to take a look at your foot, Louine. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine the sore?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. Just a moment. It’s getting harder to bend over, you know. Everything’s a bit… stiff these days. There we go. Be careful, now. It's not a pretty sight. And it might smell a bit. I warned you.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see it. It's a fairly deep ulcer, Louine, located on the plantar surface of your heel. There is some surrounding redness and inflammation, as you described. I do notice some purulent drainage. The area is warm to the touch. I’m going to gently palpate around the area to check for any deeper infection… …There is some tenderness, but I don’t feel any significant warmth extending further up your foot. Your pulses in your foot feel normal, which is good. We’ll want to get this cultured to determine the specific bacteria causing the infection. It appears you have a diabetic foot ulcer, and it may be complicated by a localized infection.
PATIENT: Localized infection… Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? A culture… is that painful? I don’t like needles, you know. And what does "complicated" mean? Is it serious? I always worry about losing a limb. My cousin Ethel, she had trouble with her feet, and… well, let's just say it didn’t end well. Are you going to have to cut it off? Be honest with me, Doctor. I can handle the truth. Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Louine, it's understandable to be worried, especially given your cousin's experience. Let's take things one step at a time. A “culture” involves taking a small sample of the drainage from the sore to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. It will involve a quick swab, and it shouldn’t be very painful – more of a brief pinch, really. “Complicated” simply means that it's not a straightforward infection, and we need to identify the cause to ensure we treat it effectively. The vast majority of diabetic foot ulcers do not require amputation. However, it's crucial to address this infection promptly and aggressively to prevent complications. Right now, it's too early to say definitively what needs to be done. The culture results will guide our treatment plan. We’ll likely need to start you on a course of antibiotics. We'll also need to offload pressure from your heel to allow the ulcer to heal. I'll refer you to a podiatrist who specializes in diabetic foot care. They can provide specialized wound care and help with offloading techniques. I will also order some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels and assess your overall health. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… a podiatrist… blood tests… It’s a lot, isn’t it? I suppose that's better than losing my foot, though. So, this podiatrist… they won't just cut it off, will they? Are they good? I don’t want some young doctor fresh out of school poking around. I prefer someone experienced. And what about these blood tests? Will they make me tired? I already feel weak as it is. And how long will it take to get the results? I hate waiting. It makes me anxious. Honestly, I just want this all to be over with. Is there anything I can do? Besides taking the antibiotics, of course. Any creams? Anything I can soak my foot in? Something to help it heal faster?
DOCTOR: Louine, I understand your anxieties. Let me address your concerns one by one. The podiatrist I’ll be referring you to is Dr. Ramirez. She has over 20 years of experience in diabetic foot care and is highly respected in the community. She is not someone who jumps to amputation. Her focus is on conservative treatment and wound healing. I would never refer you to someone I didn't trust. Regarding the blood tests, they'll check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and white blood cell count – standard tests to assess your overall health and guide our treatment plan. They shouldn't make you significantly tired, but you might feel a little weak afterwards. It's best to drink plenty of fluids and rest for a bit. The results typically take 24-48 hours. As for what you can do at home, keep the wound clean and dry, as instructed. Do not soak your foot, as that can worsen the infection. We'll discuss specific wound dressings with the podiatrist. Avoid putting weight on your foot as much as possible. And most importantly, take your antibiotics as prescribed. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a special shoe, a diabetic slipper, that will help reduce pressure on your heel. We need to work as a team—you, me, and Dr. Ramirez—to get this under control. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: A special shoe… and no soaking. Alright. It’s just… it’s all so much. I remember my mother always soaking my feet when I was a child. It always felt so good. But I suppose times have changed. And Dr. Ramirez… 20 years, you say? That’s reassuring, I suppose. And you'll call me when the blood tests are back? And the podiatrist… how soon can I see her? I don't want to wait weeks. The longer this sits, the worse it'll get, won't it? And… are these antibiotics going to upset my stomach? I have a sensitive constitution, you know. Everything always makes me nauseous. Honestly, I just want a simple answer, but I suppose there aren’t any simple answers, are there?
DOCTOR: No, there aren't always simple answers, Louine. I understand your concerns. I will personally call you as soon as the blood test results are back, likely within 48 hours. I’m also going to have my nurse, Sarah, schedule an appointment for you with Dr. Ramirez today. She’ll do her best to get you in as soon as possible, hopefully within the next few days. Regarding the antibiotics, they can sometimes cause stomach upset. If you experience nausea, try taking them with food, and let me know right away. We can prescribe something to help with that. I'm going to write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a prescription for the diabetic slipper, and a list of instructions. Sarah will explain everything to you. We will monitor your progress closely. Remember, we're a team, and we'll get through this together. I will also review your medication list to ensure there are no interactions. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
