DOCTOR: Hi Emiliano, welcome in! I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aloha, Doctor. Good day to you too. My…foot is bothering me. A sore, you see. It no heal good. Been long time now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that isn’t healing. I understand. And how long has it been bothering you, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe… three, four months now? Maybe longer. Time gets away from old man like me, you know. It started small, like a little cut, but it just…stayed. And got bigger. It hurts to walk, especially barefoot.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months. That is a while for a sore to stick around. And it started as a small cut that grew bigger and is now causing pain with walking, particularly barefoot. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not a sharp pain, unless I put a lot of weight on it. Like when I try to walk on the grass, or the sand. Then it really stings. And sometimes, at night, it feels…warm. Like it’s burning a little. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with a stinging sensation when you put weight on it, especially on grass or sand, and some warmth at night. That’s helpful. Do you notice any redness or swelling around the sore?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes, a little redness. Not much, but it's there. And… yes, it’s a little puffy around it. Not big puffy, but…different from the rest of my foot. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a balloon, just…softer there.
DOCTOR: Alright, some redness and a little puffiness. Okay. And have you noticed any drainage or pus coming from the sore at all?
PATIENT: Drainage? Now you sayin'… I think… sometimes. A little bit. It’s not a lot. Just a little wetness, you know? And it smells… not good. Sorry to tell you, but it no smell like roses.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little drainage that smells unpleasant. That’s important to know. Have you tried anything to treat it yourself – like bandages, creams, or soaking it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I try. I put bandages on it. Clean it with soap and water every day. My wife, before she passed, she used to put some ointment on it, I forget what kind. Now I just use regular lotion. I soak it in warm water sometimes, but it no seem to help much. It just… stays the same. Maybe a little worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've been cleaning it, using bandages and tried some ointment previously, but it hasn't improved. I appreciate you telling me everything. Now, I’d like to take a closer look at your foot if that’s alright. Would you mind removing your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Aloha. Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Anything to get it better. Here you go. Be careful, it’s a little tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see it. It’s on the plantar surface – the bottom – of your foot, near the base of your fifth toe. It looks a bit deeper than a simple scrape, and there’s some surrounding redness and… a little bit of hardened skin, or callus, around the edges. I also see some drainage. The skin feels warm to the touch, which is consistent with what you’ve told me. Does this hurt when I touch it here?
PATIENT: Aie! Yes, Doctor, that’s tender. Not so bad just touchin', but when you press… ouch. It’s a throbbing ache now. Like someone’s hammerin’ inside my foot. Please be gentle. It’s been botherin’ me for so long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I’ll be as gentle as possible. It does sound like it’s inflamed. Given the length of time it’s been present, the redness, drainage, and your description of the pain, I’m concerned about a possible infection, or potentially a developing ulcer. To be sure, I'd like to get a quick test to check for infection. We can do a swab of the drainage right here in the office, and send it to the lab. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Swab? Like… takin’ somethin’ from the sore? Is it gonna hurt bad? I no like needles. My wife, she always did the doctorin’ for me. She always knew what to do. But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, then yes. Do what you gotta do. Just… be quick, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your hesitation. It’s a very quick swab, like gently wiping the area with a cotton swab. It shouldn't hurt much more than a little pinch. We'll send it to the lab, and they'll tell us if there are any bacteria causing an infection. It's important to know so we can treat it properly. While we wait for the results, I'm also going to check your pulses in your feet and ankles to make sure the circulation is good. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Pulses… yes, okay. Circulation. Good. My wife, she always said good circulation is important. Just… hurry, okay? I no like bein’ poked and prodded too long. And… will it cost much, this testin’? I got Medicare, but… you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll be as quick as possible. Medicare should cover the swab test – we'll verify that with your insurance information, but it’s a standard test. Let me just get everything set up. I’m going to gently clean the area first, then take a quick swab. It might feel a little cool. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. Okay, all done. That shouldn’t take more than a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I want you to keep the area clean and dry, and avoid putting a lot of weight on it. Do you have any open wounds at home that might be infected?
PATIENT: Aie! That was quick. Not so bad. No, Doctor, no other wounds. Just this one stubborn sore. I try to keep it clean, like you said. But it’s hard, you know? I like walkin’ barefoot in the grass… I no understand why it no heal. Is it bad? You think it's a serious infection?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It was quick, and you were very patient. And I understand wanting to walk barefoot - it's nice! As for whether it's serious, it's hard to say definitively without the lab results. The redness, drainage, and the fact that it hasn’t healed after several months do suggest an infection is possible, but we need to know what kind of infection. It's important to rule out anything serious, especially given your age, and to make sure it doesn’t spread. We'll know more once we get the results back. To be on the safe side, I’m going to write you a prescription for a topical antibiotic ointment to use in the meantime, just to help prevent any further infection. And I'd like to see you back in a few days to discuss the results and make a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Aie. Antibiotic… ointment. Okay. Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. A plan. I like a plan. And… thank you. You been very nice to old man like me. When should I come back? And… will I need to take pills, too? My stomach, it no always agree with pills.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emiliano. I’m glad I could help. We’ll start with the topical ointment, and see if that helps. We can discuss pills if the lab results indicate they’re necessary, but let’s try the ointment first. As for when to come back, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for three days from today, on August 5th. That will give the lab time to process the results, and we can discuss them then. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Aloha. August 5th… yes, that works. Thank you again, Doctor. You make old man feel a little better. I go home now. And try not walk barefoot, like you say. Mahalo. .
