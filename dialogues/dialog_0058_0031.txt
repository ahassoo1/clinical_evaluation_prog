DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. It’s been botherin’ me for a few days now, and I remembered you know I have… that heart thing. The one where my heart beats a bit funny sometimes. I thought I should come get it checked, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Right, the arrhythmia. Okay. So, this swelling… is it in your whole leg, or just part of it?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. It’s mostly in my calf, I think. And my ankle is a bit puffy too. It’s not… painful exactly, more just… uncomfortable. It feels heavy, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Heavy, alright. And when did you first notice this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three days ago? It was just a little bit at first, and I thought it was maybe from walkin’ too much. But it’s gotten bigger each day, so I figured it was best to come in. I don’t rightly remember doin’ anythin’ different to cause it.
DOCTOR: And you haven't had any injuries to your leg recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no injuries. I haven’t tripped or bumped it or anythin’. I’ve been keepin’ an eye on it, and there's no bruises or nothin' like that. Just… swellin’. It’s a bit worryin’, to be honest, since it’s the leg and all. And with my heart…
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a look. If you don’t mind, could you go ahead and lie down on the table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if there’s anythin’ you need me to do. I’m not very good at explainin’ these things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just going to feel around a bit. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Hmm… it is warmer than your right leg. And definitely some pitting edema here around your ankle. How about any shortness of breath or chest pain lately?
PATIENT: No shortness of breath, Doctor. And no chest pain either. My heart does flutter sometimes, like you know, but it doesn’t hurt. It just… feels like it’s beatin’ too fast. I’ve gotten used to it, I suppose. But the leg… the leg is new. It’s just… warm and puffy. Is that bad? I don’t understand all this medical stuff, and I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me. No, it's not a bother at all. It’s good you’ve been aware of your heart rhythm. Okay, calf feels… slightly firm, but not acutely tender. Checking for any abnormal sounds. Hmm… pulses feel normal, though. Let’s listen to your heart again. Rate is a bit elevated, irregular as usual.
PATIENT: Alright. I understand… irregular is usual. Is the leg… is it somethin’ serious, Doctor? Could it be the heart causin’ it, or somethin’ else? I don’t want to end up in the hospital, if I can avoid it. I have a bit of a fear of hospitals, you see.
DOCTOR: Well, swelling in one leg, especially with your history of arrhythmia, could be related to the heart—specifically, it could be a sign of heart failure causing fluid retention. However, it could also be a blood clot—a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. That's what we need to rule out first. We're going to need to get an ultrasound of your leg to see what’s going on. I’m also going to order a D-dimer blood test. That’ll help us determine if there's a clot present. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An… ultrasound? And a blood test? Is that… is that very painful? I don’t like needles much, to be honest. And what if it is a clot? What happens then? I’m gettin’ a bit flustered now, I’m afraid. Is it serious? I just want to know what’s goin’ on. And if it's somethin’ I should be very worried about.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, let's take a breath. The ultrasound is completely painless—it’s just a gel and a probe moving over your leg. As for the blood test, it’s a small prick, yes, but quick. Now, if it is a clot, it can be serious. It's why we need to rule it out or confirm it quickly. If it is a DVT, you'd likely need blood thinners—medication to prevent it from getting bigger and traveling to your lungs, which would be a serious emergency. But we don’t know that yet. That’s why we are doing these tests. We’re just gathering information right now. I'll get the orders sent to the lab, and they’ll let you know when you can go get it done. Do you have any questions about where to go for the tests?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… the blood thinners… are those… painful? And will I have to stay in the hospital? You see, I get very anxious in hospitals. If I have to go, I’ll need to… well, I’ll need someone to come with me. And I don’t have anyone who can come right away. This is all a bit much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Look, the blood thinners themselves aren't painful – they're usually pills, and some people might experience minor bruising. As for the hospital, we're not talking about that yet. Most DVTs are treated with outpatient medication. If you were to need hospitalization, it would be to start the medication and monitor you closely, but that’s not our assumption right now. Let’s just get the tests done first, alright?
PATIENT: Alright… tests first. Yes, tests first. Could you… could you write down where I need to go, Doctor? My memory isn’t what it used to be, and I don’t want to get lost. And… and how long it might take? Just so I know. And… is there anythin’ I should do before the tests? Like, should I drink lots of water, or not eat anythin’? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Here. This has the address for the imaging center and the lab. The imaging center is first; the ultrasound usually takes about 30-45 minutes. The blood test will be quick—about 15 minutes. As for preparation, just drink normal amounts of water. Don’t fast. I’m going to order these tests, and I want you to go as soon as possible—within the next few hours if you can. They will call you with the results, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Imaging center first, then the lab. Drink water, don't fast. And… they’ll call me. What if… what if it's bad news? Who should I call? I don’t have many family members left.
DOCTOR: Look, let’s not jump to conclusions. We haven’t even done the tests yet. If the results are concerning, the lab will contact me directly, and I will contact you. Don't worry about finding someone to call right now. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, just focus on getting the tests done. Do you have transportation to get there?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I walked here. It’s not a very long walk, but… well, I don’t know if I can walk back with the results, if they’re… bad. And I don’t have money for a taxi. I’m sorry to be a bother. I didn’t mean to cause so much trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, I’ll write a note for the clinic front desk to give you a ride home after the tests, regardless of the results. It’s not ideal, but it’s what we can do. Now, please, go get the tests done. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can figure out what's going on. Here’s a note for the front desk. Please, just go.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you… thank you very much. I… I’ll go now. I hope… I hope everything is alright. .
