DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this… shaking. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. Been happening for a while now, getting… worse, maybe? Honestly, time just… slips away, you know? Hard to say exactly when it started. I just want to get it sorted, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Shaking, you say. And it's mainly in your hands. Getting worse… alright. Now, when you say "a while," could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. That’s… difficult. Months, I suppose. Maybe six? Or was it eight? I really can’t put my finger on it. It comes and goes, you see. Sometimes I don't even notice it until someone points it out. It's… frustrating. I used to be good with details, working with the water systems and all, but… now? Not so much.
DOCTOR: Right. Months… comes and goes. And it’s more noticeable when others point it out. Is it worse with anything in particular?
PATIENT: Worse… let me think. Hmm. Holding things, mostly. A cup of coffee, a tool… anything that needs a steady hand, really. It doesn’t bother me much when I’m just… resting. But try tightening a bolt and… well, it’s not a pretty sight. Used to be able to do that blindfolded, practically. Now? I'm afraid I’d make a mess of things. Is this helping? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Jezik. You're not rambling. It is helpful. So, shaking when holding things... Now, besides your hands, have you noticed any shaking anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. Maybe a little… tremor in my leg sometimes, but I figured that was just old age creeping in. It's not constant, nothing like what I’m noticing with my hands. I mostly notice it when I'm trying to sit still, I guess. But honestly, it’s hard to tell. I just want to get this sorted, Doctor. It’s interfering with things, and… I don’t want to become a burden.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little tremor in the leg when sitting still. We'll make a note of that. Now, have you noticed anything else that’s been going on at the same time as the shaking?
PATIENT: Anything else… oh, goodness. Now you’re asking… Well, I’ve been a bit… tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. But I’m seventy-nine years old, Doctor! Tiredness comes with the territory, doesn't it? I'm also a little… stiff sometimes, especially in the mornings. But again, that could just be… well, you know. I really can’t say. It's hard to pinpoint things when everything’s a bit… hazy, to be honest. Am I being helpful at all?
DOCTOR: You’re trying, Mr. Jezik. We'll get there. Tiredness, stiffness… alright. And how is your appetite?
PATIENT: My appetite? Oh, it’s… alright. Not fantastic, mind you. I don’t eat as much as I used to, but I don’t really want to, either. I used to enjoy a good hearty meal, but lately… it just doesn't appeal. It's like… the flavors aren't as strong, if that makes sense? I haven’t lost any weight, not that I’ve noticed, but I haven't been particularly hungry lately. Is this taking long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: No, it's not taking long. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, or your bladder control?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking… personal questions. Honestly, Doctor, I… I don't really talk about these things. Everything’s a bit… irregular, if I’m being truthful. But again, at my age? Isn't that to be expected? Look, I came in about a shaking hand, not… everything else. I just want to know if there’s something wrong with my nerves, or something, and if you can fix it. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your discomfort. But these things are important. Now, are you experiencing any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: Swallowing… no, not really. Everything goes down alright, as far as I can tell. My voice… hmm. My daughter said I’ve been a bit… mumbling lately. But she’s always telling me things, you know? Sometimes she says I’m hard to hear, but I think it’s her ears. Honestly, Doctor, I just feel… old. Everything’s slowing down, things aren’t working like they used to. Is that what this is all about? I’m just… getting old?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never have been much for taking pills. Always tried to stay healthy, you know? Fresh air, good food… though, as I said, my appetite’s been off lately. Never really needed anything, until… well, until now. I don't like the idea of being dependent on something, if you know what I mean. Is there anything else you need to ask, Doctor? I really would like to get this sorted if possible, and get on with things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. It'll just be a few basic things to get a better sense of what's going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and examine your hands and legs. If you could just sit up here for me, please. We'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. An exam. Okay. Blood pressure, you say? Alright. Just let me know if it’s going to… hurt. I don’t have a high pain tolerance these days. I suppose it’s necessary. Just get it over with quickly, if you don’t mind.
