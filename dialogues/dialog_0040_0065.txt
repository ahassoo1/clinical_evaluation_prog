DOCTOR: Right. Reneisha Selbitschka, 41. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Osga. It’s…well, it’s my weight. I’ve gained a significant amount, and I haven’t changed anything about my diet or exercise. It’s rather unsettling, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes. Quite. I weigh… well, the number isn’t important, precisely, but it’s a good deal more than it was just a few months ago. And it wasn’t a gradual thing, either. It seemed to happen rather quickly. I’m usually very mindful of what I eat, and I keep active with my work. It's just… puzzling.
DOCTOR: "Mindful," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. As an orderly, I’m constantly on my feet, lifting and moving. And at home, I prepare all our meals—my husband and I both prefer to eat simply, mostly vegetables and lean proteins. Nothing excessive. I truly haven’t altered our habits, which is why I’m concerned. It’s not as though I've started indulging in sweets or anything of the sort.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long ago did you notice this… rapid weight gain?
PATIENT: Approximately three months, Doctor. Perhaps a little longer. It began sometime in late April, I believe. I initially dismissed it as a fluctuation, but it hasn’t leveled off. It’s continued to climb, steadily, each week. It’s… worrisome, particularly as there’s no discernible cause.
DOCTOR: Three months... Okay. Any other symptoms accompanying this weight gain?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I haven't noticed any changes in my energy levels, thankfully. No excessive thirst, no changes in my skin, no… unusual fatigue. Just the weight. It's a bit disconcerting to feel… different, without being unwell, if that makes sense. I'm not sick, but I am heavier.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. And are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any regular medication. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, perhaps, but nothing prescribed. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. That’s why this is so baffling. My husband keeps telling me I'm simply getting 'comfortable,' but I know my body, and this isn’t natural for me.
DOCTOR: Right. Any family history of… weight issues?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother… she always struggled with her weight, yes. But it was always attributed to emotional eating, and she wasn't particularly active. It wasn’t a sudden gain like this. My father was quite thin, very active, a farmer, really. So, it’s… difficult to say. It wasn’t a consistent pattern in our family, no. Mostly just my mother, and her struggles were quite different than this.
DOCTOR: Okay. And… any recent changes in your routine?
PATIENT: Routine? No, not really. I work the same hours, at the hospital, five days a week. My husband and I still go for walks on Sundays, weather permitting. We haven’t traveled anywhere, no new stressors… honestly, everything has been remarkably consistent. It's precisely because nothing has changed that I’m so concerned, Doctor. It feels… off.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. Just to rule things out. Blood pressure first.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I appreciate your thoroughness. I’m just… eager to understand what’s happening. It's causing me a good deal of anxiety, to be frank.
DOCTOR: 130 over 80. Not terrible. Heart rate is… 72. Regular. Let’s listen to your lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. I’ll do my best to remain still. I’m a bit anxious, as you know, so if I fidget, please do let me know. I just want to get to the bottom of this, Doctor. It’s… unsettling to feel unwell without a clear reason.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, abdomen. Just going to feel around a bit. Soft. No tenderness. A little… fullness, perhaps, but nothing alarming.
PATIENT: Yes, I suppose I have gained some weight around my midsection, but I hadn't thought it significant enough to mention without the overall gain. It is good to hear everything else seems normal, though. I confess, I was quite worried it might be something more serious. I really do appreciate your attention to detail, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. Well. Given your history, and the physical exam… it's likely just weight gain. But given the speed of it, we should rule out a few things. I'm going to order some blood work. Thyroid, basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I’m relieved you’re taking it seriously. I'd prefer to rule everything out, certainly. Will you contact me with the results? I’m rather busy with my work, so a phone call would be most convenient. And, if you wouldn’t mind, could you explain the results to me in plain English? I don't have a medical background, and I’m easily confused by jargon.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. We'll call you with the results. And I'll… try to keep it simple. It'll take a few days for the lab to get back to us. For now… try to maintain your current diet and exercise. And if the weight continues to increase rapidly… come back and see me. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Thank you for your time and attention. I truly appreciate you taking my concerns seriously, and I will await your call with the results. I’ll be sure to monitor my weight closely, as you suggested. Hopefully, it's something simple.
DOCTOR: Right. You can schedule a follow-up appointment when you're ready. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
