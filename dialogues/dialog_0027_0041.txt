DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s been getting harder to do things, you see. My strength, it’s… going. I have this… this sickness, the Multiple Sclerosis. And it’s just… getting worse, slowly. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're concerned about a worsening of your Multiple Sclerosis symptoms. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Just to clarify, when you say it's getting harder to do things, can you give me some specific examples?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s right. It is getting harder. Hmm… well, standing for long is difficult now. I used to be able to stand all day, helping with the athletes, but now… maybe ten, fifteen minutes and my legs… they shake. And walking… it's slower. I stumble a little more. Even getting up from a chair takes effort. Little things, you know? But they add up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, increased difficulty with standing and walking, with some instability and stumbling, and more effort needed to get up from a chair. Have you noticed any changes in your balance specifically?
PATIENT: Balance… hmm. Yes, I think so. It's hard to explain. It's not that I fall often, but I feel… unsteady sometimes. Like the room is moving a little, even when it isn't. I have to concentrate more to stay upright. My wife, she notices it too. She says I wobble a bit when I turn my head quickly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you’re experiencing some balance issues, which is consistent with what you’ve described. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – things like vision changes, numbness or tingling, weakness in any specific parts of your body, or any problems with coordination?
PATIENT: Vision… not really, no. Not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes things seem a little blurry, but I thought that was just my age, you know? Numbness… a little, sometimes in my feet, but it comes and goes. It's not constant. And weakness… mostly in my legs, I think. But it’s hard to say if it’s just the legs, or if it’s everything. Coordination… that’s a good question. I haven’t really thought about it. I still try to do my exercises, but… it takes more effort.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, intermittent numbness in your feet, some fatigue and effort with exercises, and blurry vision which you attribute to age. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. You mentioned Multiple Sclerosis – do you know when you were diagnosed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It was… oh, a long time ago now. Maybe twenty years? It was after I hurt my back playing football. They thought it was just a bad injury at first, but then the numbness started, and… they did some tests. It was a shock, of course. I’ve been seeing a neurologist ever since. I can give you his name if you like.
DOCTOR: That would be very helpful, yes. And have you had any other significant medical conditions or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, that was a long time ago. And… oh, I broke my arm a few years back, playing with my grandson. Nothing major, really. And I have high blood pressure, the doctor has me on medicine for that. That’s about it, I think. I see my regular doctor every six months for check-ups.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal, broken arm, and high blood pressure managed with medication. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife always checks when they give me new medicine, just to be safe, but I’ve never had a problem. I can eat anything, thank goodness! My wife is a wonderful cook, and I enjoy a good meal.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And what medications are you currently taking for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe it’s called… Amlodipine. Yes, Amlodipine, five milligrams, once a day. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for aches and pains, but that’s only when I need it. Here, this is it. My wife keeps track of everything, you see. She's very organized.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, Amlodipine 5mg daily. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Hmm... What do you mean, Doctor? I'm married, as I mentioned. Been married to my wife, Leilani, for fifty years now. We have four children, and ten grandchildren. I'm retired now, used to be an athletic trainer. I enjoy gardening, and spending time with my family. I go to church every Sunday. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. So, happily married, retired athletic trainer, active in your community and family. Do you currently smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I've never smoked a day in my life. My wife wouldn’t allow it! And I don’t drink much alcohol either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. Nothing more than that. I always believed in taking care of my health. That's why I became an athletic trainer in the first place, you see. Helping others stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s excellent. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll check your reflexes, strength, and balance. I'll also do a neurological exam to assess your coordination. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your reflexes are a little brisk, but within normal limits for your age. Strength is 5 out of 5 in all extremities, although slightly reduced in your lower legs. Okay, your balance is somewhat impaired, as you mentioned. You do exhibit some instability, especially when turning quickly. I’m noting a slightly wide-based gait. Coordination is slightly diminished bilaterally. There is some mild dysmetria, meaning you have some difficulty with accurate movement. Okay, that concludes the quick physical exam.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That sounds… about right, I suppose. I do feel unsteady sometimes, and my legs… they don't always do what I want them to. Is it… is it getting worse? What do you think? Is there anything we can do?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore. Based on your history and the physical exam, it does appear your Multiple Sclerosis symptoms are progressing. The diminished balance, reduced coordination, and slight weakness in your legs are consistent with this. It's not necessarily about a sudden, dramatic worsening, but a gradual accumulation of symptoms, which is typical for MS. Now, it’s important to remember that MS affects everyone differently. We need to figure out the best way to manage your symptoms and slow down the progression as much as possible. Given that you are already under the care of a neurologist, the first step is to communicate these findings to him. He will be the best person to determine if any adjustments to your current treatment plan are needed, potentially including medications or therapies. I am noting the changes I observed today in your chart to provide a clear picture to your neurologist. In the meantime, there are things we can do to help support you. Physical therapy can help with balance, strength, and coordination. Occupational therapy can assist with adapting your daily activities to make them easier. Regular exercise, as tolerated, is also important. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a physical therapist?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a referral to a physical therapist would be wonderful. Thank you. That sounds… sensible. I’ve been trying to do my exercises, but it’s getting harder. Maybe someone who knows what they’re doing can help. And… is there anything I can do besides the exercises? Anything to help with the… the wobbliness, you know? I don’t want to fall. That’s my biggest worry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Preventing falls is very important. Here are a few things you can do: Home Safety: Make sure your home is well-lit and free of tripping hazards like rugs or clutter. Consider installing grab bars in the bathroom. Assistive Devices: A cane or walker can provide extra support and stability. Slow Movements: Take your time when standing up or changing positions. Vision Check: Make sure your vision is up-to-date. Awareness: Be mindful of your surroundings and avoid uneven surfaces. I’m also going to write a note to your primary care physician recommending they review your medications to ensure none are contributing to your balance issues. Sometimes certain medications can have side effects that worsen stability. I'm going to provide you with some educational resources on Multiple Sclerosis and fall prevention. This will include websites and support groups. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's very helpful. Thank you for all of this. The information about the home safety and the slow movements… that makes sense. I will definitely talk to my wife about that. And I appreciate you writing to my other doctors. I suppose… I just want to stay as independent as possible for as long as I can. That’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. I think that's everything for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. It’s completely understandable that you want to maintain your independence. We’ll work together to help you do that. I’ll get the referral to the physical therapist and the educational resources sent to you today. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and please, be careful.
