DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. Thank you for seeing me. I have… a problem with my ear. It is leaking something. A discharge, yes? It started maybe three days ago.
DOCTOR: A discharge from the ear, starting three days ago. Alright. And is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left ear, Doctor. The right ear is… fine. No problem there. It is only the left one that is leaking. It is not painful, but… uncomfortable. Like something is inside.
DOCTOR: Not painful, just uncomfortable, a feeling of something inside. And would you describe the discharge, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Hmm. How to describe… it is… clear. Not blood. A little bit thick, maybe. Like… water, but not exactly water. It does not smell, if that is important. I clean it with a tissue, but it comes back.
DOCTOR: Clear, slightly thick… no odor. And you’ve been cleaning it with tissues. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… correct. My hearing in that ear… it is not as good. Things sound… muffled. Like someone is speaking far away, even when they are close. I have to ask people to repeat themselves. It is small, but I notice.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing in the left ear, requiring repetition. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or dizziness alongside this ear issue?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. And no dizziness. Everything spins normally, yes? I feel… steady. Just the ear is the problem. And the hearing. No other sickness. I do not feel… unwell, besides that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent ear infections, or any trauma to the ear – perhaps bumping it, getting something in it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No infections. Not that I remember. And no bumping. Nothing went in my ear. I have been careful. I work with… students, yes? So I am careful not to hurt myself. It just… started. A few days ago. Like I said.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Very well. I’d like to take a look at your ear, if you don't mind. Let’s have you lie back on the examination table, and we’ll get a better view. I'll need to use an otoscope.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. I will lie back. An… otoscope? Is that to look inside? I am ready when you are. I trust your judgement, yes? Just tell me if it will be… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, an otoscope allows me to visualize the ear canal and eardrum. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but if you feel any pain, please let me know immediately. Okay, Mr. Radillo. I'm going to gently insert this instrument into your ear. Relax your head. Alright… I see some cerumen – earwax – present, and the ear canal appears slightly inflamed. The tympanic membrane, or eardrum, is… retracted and appears cloudy. There’s a small amount of clear, yellowish discharge visible. I also note some slight redness around the outer ear canal. It doesn't appear there is a foreign body present.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I felt a little… pressure. But no pain, no. Cloudy? Retracted? What does that mean? Is it… serious? I am a bit worried now. It sounded fine before, but now… cloudiness does not sound good.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Radillo, “cloudy” and “retracted” simply mean there’s some fluid build-up behind the eardrum and that it’s not moving as freely as it should. It indicates some inflammation, likely an acute otitis media – a middle ear infection, though without fever, it's atypical. The discharge we're seeing suggests the eardrum may have a small perforation, a tiny hole. It's not immediately life-threatening, but it does require treatment to prevent potential complications – such as persistent hearing loss, or, rarely, spread of the infection. We'll need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a tympanometry test to assess the function of your middle ear. And, given your atypical presentation, a complete blood count to check for any underlying issues.
PATIENT: A hole? In my ear? That… does not sound good, Doctor. A test? And blood? I do not like the sound of blood. What will the test tell you? And if there is a hole… can it be fixed? I am a teacher, yes? I need to hear my students. I worry about… losing my job. Perhaps… I should have just waited it out. But you said… complications. What kind of complications? Please, explain… slowly. I am getting… anxious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Radillo, please try to remain calm. A small perforation, if that is what it is, is often quite treatable. The tympanometry test is a simple, painless procedure. It measures how well your eardrum and middle ear are moving. It won’t involve any needles, just a small probe inserted into your ear. As for the blood test, it’s simply to rule out any underlying systemic infection. We need to know if this is just an ear infection, or if something else is going on. Complications, in rare instances, can include chronic hearing loss, persistent ear drainage, and, very rarely, spread of the infection to surrounding tissues. However, with prompt treatment – usually antibiotics and, in some cases, a short course of steroids to reduce inflammation – the vast majority of patients recover fully. We will address this systematically. I'll have my nurse draw the blood now, and we’ll schedule the tympanometry test for tomorrow morning. Once we have the results, we'll have a clearer picture of what's going on and formulate a treatment plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… yes. That… sounds better. Needles… I still do not like the sound of needles, but… if it helps. Tomorrow morning? That is… alright. I have class in the afternoon, yes? But I can rearrange things. So, blood, and a test. And then… antibiotics, maybe. And… no more complications. Is that correct? And you will… fix the hole, if it is there? You are a doctor, yes? You fix things. Please… tell me again. Slowly. The hole, the antibiotics, the test. And what happens next. I just… need to understand. Before I… panic.
DOCTOR: Mr. Radillo, let’s go through it one more time, very slowly. First, the nurse will draw a small amount of blood to check for any underlying infection. Then, tomorrow morning, you’ll undergo a tympanometry test – a simple ear function test that won’t involve needles. Once we have the results from both tests, we’ll know exactly what’s causing your ear issue. If there is a perforation, a small hole in your eardrum, it often heals on its own with antibiotics and a course of steroids to reduce inflammation. In some cases – rarely – it may require a more specialized procedure, a tympanoplasty, to surgically repair it. But we're not at that stage yet. For now, we’ll start with antibiotics to clear up the infection and monitor your progress. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to re-evaluate your hearing and the status of your eardrum. Is that… sufficiently clear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… is clearer. Blood, test, antibiotics. Follow-up. One week. No surgery… yet. If it does not heal… what happens then? Is the surgery… painful? And will I be able to hear… afterwards? I teach… young children. They… need to see my face. And they need to… understand me. Please, Doctor. Be honest. If the worst happens… can you fix it? Can you make me… hear again?
DOCTOR: Mr. Radillo, you are jumping ahead significantly. Let's address one step at a time. As I’ve said, the vast majority of perforations heal with antibiotics. If, and only if, it doesn't heal, we would discuss a tympanoplasty. The surgery itself is performed under general anesthesia, so you won’t feel any pain during the procedure. There will be some discomfort afterwards, but it’s manageable with pain medication. And the vast majority of patients experience significant improvement in their hearing. The success rate is very high, but no surgery is without risks. I assure you, my priority is to restore your hearing to the best of my ability. But dwelling on worst-case scenarios before we even have the test results is… unproductive. Let's focus on getting the treatment started and see how you respond. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any immediate questions about the blood draw itself?
PATIENT: No… no more questions about the blood. Just… the surgery. You said… risks. What kind of risks? And… will my face… look different afterwards? I have a… photograph of my family. I would not want to… frighten them. I am sorry. I am being… difficult. It is just… I worry. About everything. About my job, about my family, about… being able to hear again.
DOCTOR: Mr. Radillo, as I said, we are getting ahead of ourselves. The risks associated with a tympanoplasty are relatively rare. They can include infection, bleeding, and, in extremely rare cases, nerve damage that could affect your balance. As for your face, no, the surgery does not alter your appearance in any way. It’s a procedure performed inside the ear. There may be some minor bruising or swelling around the ear, but that will resolve within a week or two. You will not look any different. I understand you’re worried. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious about your health. But I assure you, I am a highly skilled surgeon, and I will do everything I can to ensure a positive outcome. For now, let's focus on the blood draw and the tympanometry test. My nurse will be with you shortly. I believe that is all we can discuss at this moment.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. All. Thank you. For… explaining. And for your… patience. I will… wait for the nurse.
