DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. Well, I’m hoping you can help me understand what shots I might need. My grandson… he’s trying to get his wife’s mother to come visit from overseas. She needs to come to the United States, and I believe there are requirements for vaccinations. I’m assisting with the process, and I want to be sure we have everything correct. It’s a little confusing, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Skarbek. It is often confusing navigating those requirements. It's good you're being proactive. To clarify, you're not seeking vaccinations for yourself, but trying to determine what vaccinations your grandson’s mother-in-law will require for entry into the United States?
PATIENT: That's right, Doctor. I’m not traveling myself. My grandson is handling most of the paperwork, but he asked me to come speak with someone since I’m… well, I’m good at reading things carefully. And I like to be certain. He mentioned something about needing proof, and I want to make sure we get the correct ones. It's just… a lot of information online.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s wise to verify information, especially when it comes to international travel requirements. To give you the most accurate advice, could you tell me the country she’s traveling from?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. She is coming from… let me see… Ukraine. Yes, that's correct. Ukraine. It’s been difficult for her, with everything going on there, and we just want her visit to be as smooth as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ukraine. That does add a layer of complexity, given the current situation. Let me see… for entry into the United States from Ukraine, the CDC currently recommends routine vaccinations – tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and influenza. However, given her origin, it’s highly likely she will need documented proof of those vaccinations, and potentially others depending on her age and medical history. Do you happen to know her birthdate?
PATIENT: Her birthdate… let me think. My grandson has all the paperwork, but I don’t recall offhand. I believe she was born in… 1952. Yes, I’m fairly certain it’s 1952. That would make her… oh, goodness, she’s a few years older than me. She’s 73, I believe. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. At age 73, she would likely need proof of a recent tetanus booster, and verification of measles, mumps, and rubella immunity – either through documented vaccination or a blood test showing antibodies. Given her age and potential for exposure, we should also consider influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. Do you know if she has had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a good question. I don’t believe so. She hasn’t travelled outside of Ukraine in many years, and with everything that’s been happening… I doubt she’s had much chance to see a doctor, let alone get shots. She mentioned something about difficulty accessing healthcare, but I'm not sure of the specifics. Would a blood test be necessary, then? I'm a little worried about putting her through too much trouble if it isn't absolutely needed.
DOCTOR: Given her lack of recent vaccinations and difficulty accessing healthcare, a blood test to verify immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella is prudent. It’s best to be certain before she travels, to avoid any complications. It also ensures she meets all entry requirements. We can order those tests today. In addition to those, I recommend she receive an influenza vaccination as soon as it's available this fall, and a pneumococcal vaccination to protect against pneumonia. Would you like me to schedule an appointment for her to come in for those tests and vaccinations?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Yes, I think that would be best. An appointment would be very helpful. It's good to know we're doing everything we can to keep her safe. What does that entail? Will it be a long visit? I try to avoid being out too long these days, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It won't be a long visit, thankfully. It will primarily involve a standard blood draw, which typically takes about 15-20 minutes. We'll also need to review her medical history, so it's helpful if you can gather any information about past illnesses or allergies. And it's important to discuss the potential side effects of the vaccinations, so she can make an informed decision. I have availability next Tuesday afternoon, at 2:00 PM, or Thursday morning at 9:30 AM. Would either of those times work for her?
PATIENT: Hmm... Thursday morning at 9:30 sounds better, I think. That gives her the afternoon if she needs to rest. And yes, I'll gather any information I can about her medical history. She mostly tells stories about her garden, but I'll ask more specifically. That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient with me. It’s a relief to have someone explain things clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. I’m glad I can help. So, that’s Thursday at 9:30 AM. Please bring any medical records she has, and a list of any medications she's currently taking. The lab will need her insurance information, as well. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. Insurance… yes, I have her card here. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better about this now. It's a worry off my mind, and hopefully, hers too. I appreciate your time.
