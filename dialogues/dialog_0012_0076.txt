DOCTOR: Hi Clarke, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs, see? They’re on my shins, and they’re… painful. Red, and kinda hard. Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, painful, red, hard bumps on your shins. And you said they’ve been bothering you for a little while – can you tell me roughly how long is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… a couple of months, I guess? It started with just one, and I didn’t think much of it. Then another one popped up, and another… now there’s quite a few. Not too many, but enough to be annoying, you know? Especially when I’m walking.
DOCTOR: I see. So they’ve gradually increased in number over the past couple of months. And they cause pain when you walk?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Not like, a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache, especially if I press on them. And sometimes after I’ve been on my feet all day at work, they get really sore. Work is… mostly moving boxes and stuff, you know? Physical labor.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache, worse with pressure and after physical activity… moving boxes at work. That gives me a little more information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bumps?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really. No fever or anything like that. They don’t itch, thankfully. Just… painful. I haven’t noticed any swelling around them, just the bumps themselves being… bumpy. My wife, she looks at them sometimes, but she doesn’t seem too worried. She just tells me to put some cream on, but it doesn’t really help.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no itching, no swelling. The cream isn’t helping, which is good to know. Have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve had my share of scrapes and bruises from work, of course, but nothing like this. These bumps are… different. Harder, and redder, and they just don’t go away. I’m a little worried, to be honest. I’m not a young man anymore, you know? 71 years old. Things take longer to heal.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Clarke. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, overall health… Well, I’ve got a little bit of arthritis in my hands, mostly. Makes it hard to open jars sometimes. And my blood pressure’s a little high, but the doctor has me on pills for that. Other than that… I think I’m okay. I try to eat right, mostly Filipino food, you know? Rice and fish and vegetables. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Clarke. The arthritis and high blood pressure are helpful to know. And thank you for letting me know about your Medicare. Let me just take a quick look at your records here… Okay, I see the diagnosis for hypertension and osteoarthritis. Any allergies to medications that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think… Hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to any pills before. I’ve taken a lot of different things over the years for aches and pains. My wife always double-checks when I get a new prescription, and she hasn’t said anything about allergies. She’s pretty good at remembering that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I’d like to take a closer look at those bumps on your shins, if that’s alright with you. I’ll need to do a quick physical exam. Would you mind if I took a look?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Go ahead. Anything to figure out what’s going on. They’re right here, see? They’re kinda hard to see with my pants on, but… there you go.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see them now. They are raised, reddish-brown, and appear to be quite firm. There are approximately… six to eight bumps on each shin. They are tender to the touch, but there's no warmth or redness extending beyond the bumps themselves. No visible drainage. Based on what I’m seeing, Clarke, these bumps could be a number of things. One possibility is stasis dermatitis, which can sometimes happen with slight circulation issues, but the lack of significant warmth or drainage makes that less likely. Another possibility, given your work, is a form of contact dermatitis or even a mild form of shin splints with associated inflammation. However, we need to rule out other causes. I’d like to order a simple blood test to check your inflammatory markers and rule out any underlying conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood test… oh. Okay. Sounds… thorough. I mean, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… I don’t like needles very much. But if it will help figure out what’s going on with my legs, then yes, go ahead. What do I have to do?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Clarke, and we'll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. The blood test will just give us a clearer picture of what's going on internally. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll take a small sample of blood – just a few vials. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes. While we’re waiting for the results, I'd also like to recommend applying a topical corticosteroid cream to the bumps twice daily. It can help reduce inflammation and relieve some of the discomfort. I’ll write you a prescription for that now. In the meantime, if the pain worsens significantly, or if you notice any fever, swelling, or pus draining from the bumps, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Topical cream, okay. I can do that. And if it gets worse, I’ll call. That sounds good. No, I don’t think so. Just… how long will the blood test take to get back? I got some errands to run, and my wife is expecting me for dinner. I don’t want to keep her waiting too long. She makes a really good adobo, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, and the adobo sounds wonderful! The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. We can either give you a call with the results, or you can schedule a quick follow-up appointment to discuss them in person. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh, a call would be best, Doctor. I don't want to have to make another trip all the way here if I don’t have to. And my wife can drive, but she doesn't like it very much. She gets nervous. So, a phone call is perfect. Just let me know when I can expect it. And thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clarke. I'm glad I could help. I’ll make a note to have the lab results faxed to us, and our nurse will give you a call as soon as they are available – likely within 48 hours. In the meantime, try to rest your legs when possible and apply the corticosteroid cream as directed. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Yoshino. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit. I appreciate you taking the time to look at my legs. I'll see you, or rather, talk to you soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clarke. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and enjoy that adobo!
