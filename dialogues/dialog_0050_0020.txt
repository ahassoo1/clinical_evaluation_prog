DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay to call you Doctor? I am here for… the talk on the computer, yes? My daughter, she make the appointment for me. I don't… feel so good lately, but I not sure what is problem.
DOCTOR: Yes, “Doctor” is perfectly acceptable, Ms. Benites. And it sounds as though your daughter scheduled this appointment because you haven't been feeling well. That’s quite sensible of her. Could you elaborate on what you mean by “not feeling so good”?
PATIENT: Hmm… it is hard to say. Just… tired, mostly. Always tired. And my back… it hurts a little. Not all the time, but when I bend over, you know? Like when I… garden. I like garden very much, but it is more difficult now. Also, my hands… they feel stiff sometimes. Like old lady hands, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Tiredness, back pain, and stiffness in your hands. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. When did this tiredness begin?
PATIENT: Oh… that is good question. Maybe… six months ago? It come slowly. At first, I think just old age. I am 57, you know? But now… it is every day. Even after I sleep. It is… strange. I used to have much energy. I work in garage, fixing cars. Is hard work. But now… Not so easy.
DOCTOR: Six months of progressive fatigue, even after adequate sleep. And you mentioned you work in a garage, fixing cars – that’s quite a physically demanding profession. Has this fatigue interfered with your ability to do your work, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. I have to take more breaks. My son, he help me now. He is good with cars, but… he have his own job. I worry about not being able to do my work. I like my work very much. It keeps me busy, you know? And… it pays the bills. Now, I am slower. And sometimes… I drop things. Tools, mostly. It is not good.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the fatigue is impacting your work performance, and you’ve noticed some difficulty with dexterity – dropping tools. Aside from the fatigue and the hand difficulties, have you noticed any other changes in your health over the past six months?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… I think I am more… forgetful, maybe? Not big things, you know? Like where I put my glasses. Or what I eat for breakfast. Small things. My daughter, she say I repeat myself sometimes. But I think everyone does that, yes? Is old age, maybe. And… I not sleep so good. I wake up many times in night. Is hard to fall asleep again.
DOCTOR: Increased forgetfulness and difficulty sleeping. These are all things we need to consider, Ms. Benites. Now, let’s talk about your back pain. You mentioned it occurs when bending over. Is there any pain when you’re sitting, standing, or lying down?
PATIENT: No, not when I sit or lie down. Just… when I bend. Like when I pull weeds in garden. Or pick up something heavy. It is… a sharp pain, but it goes away quickly. Not all the time, you understand. Sometimes, I forget about the pain. But when I do too much… it comes back. Also, sometimes my legs… they feel a little numb. Not always, but sometimes.
DOCTOR: Sharp back pain with bending, occasional numbness in the legs. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, unexplained weight loss, or changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No chills. I eat… okay, I think. Maybe a little less than before, but I not worry about weight. And… no changes with… going to the bathroom. Everything is normal there. I hope that is okay to say. Is private question, yes?
DOCTOR: Perfectly acceptable, Ms. Benites. These are necessary questions. Now, let’s review your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My doctor… he say my blood pressure was a little high, maybe ten years ago? But he give me pills, and it was okay after that. I not take pills now. And… no, no diabetes. No arthritis. Just… old age. I have been healthy most of my life. I work hard, you know? But now… something is different.
DOCTOR: History of hypertension, well-controlled with medication in the past. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And I never been in hospital. Not even for broken bone. I am lucky, I think. My mother, she had surgery on her hip. But I… never. I try to be careful. I work with cars, you know? Is dangerous job sometimes. But I always… be careful.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother… she have heart trouble. And my father… he have trouble with his memory when he get old. Very forgetful. Like me, maybe? But they both… live long life. My mother, she was 85. My father… 90. They were strong people. From Czech, you know? We are strong people.
DOCTOR: Family history of heart disease and memory issues. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Just… sometimes I take something for my headache. But not every day. Just when it is bad. Is over-the-counter. You can buy in store. I not remember the name. And… no vitamins. No supplements. I try to eat healthy. But… not always easy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never been allergic to anything. Is good, yes? I can eat anything. I like many foods. Czech food is very good. My daughter, she make good Czech food. But… enough about food. Is something wrong with me, Doctor? I worry a little.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Benites, it sounds as though you’ve been experiencing a constellation of symptoms – fatigue, back pain, hand stiffness, forgetfulness, and sleep disturbances – over the past several months. Now, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is good. Physical… is okay. I trust you, Doctor. Please, do what you need to do. I want to know what is wrong. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat here on the examination table. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your back and hands. Your blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let's examine your back. Please lie flat on your stomach. I note some mild tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region. No radicular signs. Range of motion is slightly limited, with discomfort on forward flexion. Now, let’s examine your hands. I observe some mild stiffness and reduced grip strength in both hands. Reflexes are within normal limits. Alright, Ms. Benites. Thank you for your cooperation.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That was… okay. Is it bad? Is something serious wrong? My hands… they feel a little sore now. I worry about not being able to fix cars anymore. Is my work… is it over?
DOCTOR: The examination revealed some tenderness in your lower back and mild stiffness in your hands. Your reflexes are normal, which is reassuring. Based on your symptoms and the physical examination, it's difficult to determine a definitive diagnosis at this time. However, your symptoms could be indicative of several possibilities – osteoarthritis, perhaps, or potentially early signs of a more generalized musculoskeletal condition. The fatigue and forgetfulness require further investigation as well. To rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order some blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to assess kidney and liver function, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a vitamin D level. We should also consider imaging of your lower back – an X-ray to assess for any structural abnormalities. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh… many tests. Blood work… and X-ray. Is it… expensive? I have Medicare, but… sometimes they don’t pay for everything. And I worry about radiation from the X-ray. Is it safe? Also… what if they find something bad? I am getting scared now, Doctor. What if… what if I can’t work anymore? Is that what you think?
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, I understand your concerns. The tests are necessary to get a clearer picture of what's going on and to rule out any serious underlying conditions. Medicare should cover most of the costs, but we have a billing department that can assist you with any financial concerns. As for the radiation from the X-ray, the amount is very minimal and the benefits of obtaining a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. Now, let's not jump to conclusions about being unable to work. It's far too early to say. We need to see the results of the tests first. But based on what you’ve described, it’s unlikely to be a catastrophic condition. We can then discuss possible treatment options – physical therapy, medication, or other interventions – to help manage your symptoms and keep you as active as possible. Do you consent to the blood work and X-ray?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, yes. Blood work and X-ray. If you think it is necessary. But please… be careful with the X-ray. And please, tell me everything, Doctor. Do not hide anything. I want to know what is wrong, even if it is bad. I trust you, Doctor. Just… please help me. I want to keep working. I need to keep working.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Benites. I assure you, I will explain everything to you in detail, and we will discuss all of your options. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood samples now, and then we'll schedule the X-ray for tomorrow morning. After the results are back – which should be in a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest and avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. Just… please hurry with the tests. I want to know what is wrong. And thank you for listening. It helps to talk about it. .
DOCTOR: Very good. My nurse will be with you shortly. I’ll see you again after the results are available.
