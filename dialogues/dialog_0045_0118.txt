DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Billman, it’s… a certification, I believe. Something to do with my… work. It’s all rather bureaucratic, you understand. One has to keep up with these things, though tiresome as they are. Honestly, I can’t recall the specifics. It’s a yearly thing, isn’t it? Something about ensuring I’m still… capable.
DOCTOR: Capable… right. Let me pull up your file here. Oriley… Venard Oriley… Okay. Yes, here we are. Yearly recertification physical. Look, I’m a family doctor. I treat everything from sniffles to…well, recertifications. I need you to be a bit more specific, though. What kind of certification are we talking about?
PATIENT: Goodness. Specifics. Really. It involves… assessing my senses, I suppose. Eyes and ears, predominantly. It’s… healthcare related. I am a healthcare practitioner, you see. All rather…technical. I wouldn’t trouble you with the details. It's something my employer requires, and frankly, I find the entire process demeaning. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: “Demeaning,” huh?
PATIENT: One is expected to maintain a certain standard, naturally. But to be subjected to… tests… as if my years of experience are of no consequence. It’s a modern affliction, I assure you. A great deal of paperwork, too. Utterly unnecessary paperwork. Honestly, I’d rather be… well, never mind. Let’s just say I’m here to fulfill a requirement, Doctor. Is that adequate for your… purposes?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Oriley, I understand you find this frustrating. But frankly, “years of experience” don't rule out changes in vision or hearing. It's responsible practice to assess these things periodically. Are you experiencing any changes in your senses?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… one does get older, doesn’t one? Things aren’t quite as sharp as they once were, naturally. But that's simply the passage of time. I wouldn't call them changes so much as… a natural decline. Is there a specific symptom you're looking for? Because I’m really not one for dwelling on… infirmities. Perhaps a slight ringing in the ears occasionally. But who doesn’t get that, these days? It's the noise, you know. The incessant noise.
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ears, okay. And you said your vision isn’t as “sharp” as it used to be. Any blurry vision?
PATIENT: Blurry? Occasionally. When reading… fine print, perhaps. Or at a distance. It's… difficult to say definitively. I don’t spend a great deal of time scrutinizing things, you see. I have more important matters to attend to. It’s not debilitating, if that’s what you’re asking. Simply… a slight lack of clarity. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not entirely certain why I'm having to explain all of this. Shouldn't this simply be… assessed?
DOCTOR: Yes, it should be assessed. That’s why you’re here. Alright, let's do a quick visual and auditory exam. I need you to read the letters on this chart, starting with the top row. And then we'll test your hearing with these headphones. It’ll be quick.
PATIENT: Must I? Really. Very well. But I assure you, Doctor, this is a complete waste of both our time. “P… T… F…” Is that correct? Honestly, the lighting in here is atrocious.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Okay, next row. And please, try to relax. It makes things easier.
PATIENT: “L… D… G…” Good heavens. Are you certain this chart is calibrated correctly? It's remarkably… indistinct. Honestly, I have better things to do than decipher blurry letters in a poorly lit room. Is there a reason you’re not simply… accepting my assurance that my vision is adequate? I am, after all, a professional.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, your profession doesn’t negate the need for a basic assessment. And frankly, your performance on this exam is… concerning. You misidentified several letters. We need to get a proper reading. I'm not going to guess at your vision. Please, just read the letters. If you’re having trouble, we can adjust the lighting. But we need accurate information.
PATIENT: Concerning? Honestly, Doctor, I find your tone rather… condescending. I came here to fulfill a bureaucratic requirement, not to be subjected to a lecture on my perceived inadequacies. This is preposterous. I think I've wasted enough of my time here. I believe I’ll take my chances without a "proper reading." Good day. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I understand your frustration, but refusing a basic assessment isn't going to make this requirement disappear. More importantly, it could be detrimental to your health and the health of others. I strongly recommend we finish this exam, or I can provide you with a referral to an ophthalmologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. But I will not simply sign off on a recertification without some indication of your current sensory function. It’s my professional responsibility to ensure you are fit to practice. This isn’t about your years of experience, it's about responsible healthcare.
