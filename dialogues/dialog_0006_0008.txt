DOCTOR: Uh, hello. Good to see you. I'm Dr. Gorga. Now, what brings you in today, Mr. GuerreroloLopez?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Hello Doctor. It’s… my ear, I think. Feels blocked. Full, you know? It’s been… a bit of a bother. Not painful, exactly, just… there. Honestly, I can’t really say when it started. Things… slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm, blocked, you say. And not painful, just a feeling of fullness. Right. Okay. And is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, I think. Yes, definitely the left. Sometimes I get them mixed up, sorry. It’s… difficult to be sure. It feels like there's cotton wool in it, perhaps? Or… water, maybe? I really couldn’t say.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cotton wool, fullness… not painful. Okay. Have you noticed any hearing loss with it?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… hmm. That's a good question. I haven't tried to listen for it, if that makes sense? My wife… she used to tell me when the television was too loud, but… well, she’s gone now. So… I don’t really know. Maybe? It’s quiet, that’s for sure. But quiet could just be… quiet.
DOCTOR: I see. Okay. And have you had any dizziness, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… no, not ringing. Dizziness… sometimes. A bit unsteady on my feet, but that’s just getting old, I reckon. I trip over things, you know? Nothing… serious. It’s just… me being clumsy, probably. I wouldn’t say it’s connected to the ear, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. No ringing, some dizziness that you attribute to clumsiness… Okay. Have you ever had any ear infections, or any problems with your ears in the past?
PATIENT: Ear infections… goodness. That was a long time ago. When I was a boy, I think. Something with… pus, maybe? Honestly, Doctor, my memory is terrible. I’ve had so many doctor’s visits over the years, it’s all a blur. I wouldn’t be surprised if I had an ear infection, but I couldn’t tell you for sure. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm not being very useful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. These things happen. We'll get there. Okay. Let's just take a quick look at your ear, if you don't mind. Just want to rule a few things out. Can you sit up and face me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Sit up… right. Do you need me to… tilt my head or anything? I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just… quickly, if possible? I have… things to get back to. Though I can’t remember what, exactly.
DOCTOR: Just relax, please. I’ll just take a quick peek. Okay… hmm. A little bit of wax build-up, some redness. The eardrum looks… slightly cloudy, but I can see it moving. No obvious signs of infection. Now, I’m going to gently puff some air into your ear. Tell me when you feel it.
PATIENT: Right, puff air… yes, alright. Gently, you said? My wife… she always said I had sensitive ears. There! Yes, I felt that. A little tickle, maybe? It wasn’t… unpleasant. Is that good or bad? I really don’t know these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, the eardrum is responding to the air puff, which is good. It indicates it's functioning. The cloudiness and redness suggest some inflammation, possibly from wax build-up or a mild irritation. It doesn’t seem like a severe infection, but… We should probably get this wax removed. It can affect your hearing and cause discomfort.
PATIENT: Wax removal… yes, alright. Sounds sensible. As long as it's quick. I… I don't like things lingering. Will it hurt? My wife… she used to handle all these medical things. I’m… not very good with them. Is there a charge for this, by the way? I should probably ask that.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't hurt. We'll use a gentle irrigation technique, just warm water. It might feel a little strange, like a pressure in your ear, but it’s usually very well-tolerated. And yes, there is a charge, but I’ll have the nurse explain the costs to you after. We’ll just get this taken care of now, okay?
PATIENT: Alright. Warm water… pressure. Yes, okay. As long as it's over quickly. I suppose… let’s get it done, then. Though I really wish I could remember what I was supposed to be doing this afternoon. Is there anything I need to do? Close my eyes? Hold still? Tell me, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Just sit back and relax. I want you to stay perfectly still, and if you feel any discomfort, let me know immediately. You don’t need to close your eyes. Just look straight ahead. I’m going to gently flush your ear with the warm water. Now, this might feel a little cool at first… just breathe normally. Tell me if anything changes, okay?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, that is cool. And… sort of sloshy? It feels… strange. A little dizzy, maybe. But… not awful. Just… odd. Is it supposed to feel like this? I really don’t like this sensation. Please hurry, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. It's normal to feel a little dizziness and fullness. We’re almost there, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Just a little bit more. I’m seeing some wax coming out now… good. Okay. All done. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… different. Lighter, maybe? It’s still a bit… wet, and sort of echoey, but… yes, definitely lighter. Not so full. I think… I think I can hear you a little clearer now. Is that… is that right? It’s hard to tell, you know. I’m not sure if it’s actually better, or if I’m just expecting it to be better.
DOCTOR: It is better, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. I can tell. And I can hear you much clearer now, too. Okay. The wax was impacting your hearing. We’ve removed it. I’m going to prescribe you some ear drops to help prevent future build-up. And if you experience any pain, dizziness, or hearing loss, come back immediately. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Ear drops… yes. Good. No, I… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I’m glad that’s over. Though I still haven’t the faintest idea what I was supposed to be doing this afternoon. Is the nurse going to explain the payment now?
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will handle the payment and go over the aftercare instructions with you. Just give me a moment to finish up these notes. Here's the prescription. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. And try not to worry about what you were doing this afternoon. Sometimes it just comes back to you. .
