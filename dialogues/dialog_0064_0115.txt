DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin, you see. It’s gotten rather yellow. It’s a bit unsettling, frankly. I believe… something about the liver? The young man at the front desk mentioned it, but my memory isn’t what it used to be. I just want to get to the bottom of it quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Yellowing of the skin… that's called jaundice, and it can be related to the liver, you're right to think that. But there are other possibilities as well. It’s good you came in to get it checked. Now, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I first notice? That's a tricky one. It feels like… a few weeks, perhaps? It started subtly, I think, and I just dismissed it as a trick of the light. But it’s become quite noticeable now, and my daughter insisted I come see someone. She worries terribly. I… I really can’t pinpoint a date, I'm afraid. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Annelle. Memories can be… elusive. A few weeks is helpful to know. And it’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in. Has the yellowing been getting worse steadily, or has it come and gone?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… steadily, I think. A little worse each day, perhaps. Not dramatically, you understand. But if I look in the mirror, it’s… more obvious. And I feel… tired, Doctor. Very tired. Not just physically, but… a general weariness. I haven’t been eating much either, which is unusual for me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Annelle. A gradual worsening of the yellowing along with fatigue and loss of appetite… those are all things we need to investigate. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Oh, my… changes in… well. Let me see. I suppose… my stool has been rather pale, yes. Not normal. And the urine… now that you mention it, it is a bit darker than usual, isn’t it? Like… tea colored, perhaps? I hadn’t really paid attention before. Is that… bad? I truly apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No, please don't apologize at all, Annelle. You’re doing just fine. It's perfectly alright. These things are easily overlooked. Pale stools and darker urine are important clues. Now, have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, no, thankfully, no pain. Not a bit. And I haven’t been sick, no vomiting at all. Just… the tiredness, and not wanting to eat. And this… yellowing, of course. It’s unsettling to look at, I must admit. I’ve never been ill like this before. And I’m rather anxious to know what’s causing it, if you don’t mind me saying. I have a luncheon to attend next week, and I’d prefer not to… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Annelle. It's natural to be anxious when something new and unsettling is happening. And wanting to feel your best for the luncheon is perfectly reasonable. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Then, I think we should order some blood tests to check your liver function, and perhaps a few other things. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests, a physical exam. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this sorted out, if you don’t mind. The sooner, the better, really. I do hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Annelle. If you'll just have a seat here on the table, we'll get started. I’ll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some slight tenderness in the upper right quadrant. It's not sharp, but it’s worth noting. Now, let's get those blood tests ordered.
PATIENT: Oh… that didn't hurt, exactly, Doctor. Just… a bit uncomfortable. Yes, the upper right side. It's been a little… tender there for a few days, I suppose. I just thought it was indigestion. Blood tests, you say? Very well. When will I know the results? I do have that luncheon to consider, you see. And I promised my daughter I'd call her after this appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Annelle. It’s good you mentioned the tenderness. It's helpful information. The lab should have the results back within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as we have them. We can discuss the results over the phone, and schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. Now, while we wait for the results, it might be a good idea to avoid alcohol and fatty foods. That will give your liver a little rest. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. No, not that I know of. I haven't taken anything regularly for years, except for a little something for my arthritis, but that was ages ago. And I haven't had any reactions to anything. No, none at all. Honestly, Doctor, I just want this over with. It's all rather unsettling, and I'm starting to feel quite flustered. Is it alright if my daughter, Miriam, calls later to check on me? She worries so.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Annelle. It’s perfectly alright for Miriam to call. In fact, it’s good that you have someone to support you. Now, just to be thorough, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My medical history… that’s a long story, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life, you see. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, but that was ages ago. And as I mentioned, arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. I don’t see specialists regularly, and I haven’t been hospitalized in… well, I honestly can’t remember. It’s been decades, certainly. Is that helpful? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. I truly apologize for being so vague. I just… want to know what’s wrong, and get it sorted out. Is there anything else you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Annelle. Gallbladder removal and arthritis… good to know. It’s alright if you don’t remember everything. We’ll take it one step at a time. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a tricky one. My mother lived to be a good age, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses. My father… he passed away when I was young, I'm afraid. And I had several siblings, but we’ve all grown old and… well, most have passed away now. I don’t recall any family history of liver problems, but honestly, Doctor, I didn’t pay much attention to these things when I was younger. It's a bit sad, really. Is this important? I feel rather overwhelmed with all these questions.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Annelle. Don't worry about remembering everything. It's common not to have detailed family history information. It's good you've told me what you do recall. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. Just one glass, and not every night. Is that alright? I’m starting to feel a bit anxious, Doctor. I truly hope these blood tests don't reveal anything too serious.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Annelle. One glass of wine occasionally is perfectly fine. And please try not to worry. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll figure out what's going on. Now, finally, do you work, or have you worked in any professions that might have exposed you to chemicals or toxins?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. I was a teacher for many years, elementary school. Lots of children, lots of books, but no chemicals or toxins, thankfully. And I’ve been retired for quite some time now. Just gardening, and spending time with my daughter and grandchildren. A quiet life, really. Honestly, Doctor, I can't imagine anything that would be causing this. I just want to feel better, and get back to my routine. Is it alright if I go now? I'm starting to feel quite tired.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Annelle. You’ve been very helpful. We've covered everything I need for now. The nurse will come and take a little blood sample. Then, you’re free to go. Remember to avoid alcohol and fatty foods while we wait for the results. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as we have them, within 24 to 48 hours. Please don’t hesitate to call if you feel any worsening of your symptoms. Get some rest, and try not to worry. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I appreciate your patience and reassurance. Yes, I will try to rest. And I will avoid alcohol and fatty foods. I truly hope it’s nothing too serious. And thank you again for being so understanding. .
