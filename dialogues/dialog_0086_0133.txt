DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, I need some papers signed, really. Just a verification of some health forms. It's for... well, it doesn't matter what it's for, exactly. Just need them officially stamped, if you can do that. I'd like to get it over with quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Papers, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. I brought them with me. Let me just… ah, here we are. They're a bit crumpled, sorry. I’ve had them for a while.
DOCTOR: Right. These are…quite basic. But, alright. Before I just…stamp everything, I do need to ask a few routine questions. It's policy, you understand. Just to make sure nothing has changed since these were originally filled out. It's a liability thing, really. So, have you seen any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just my usual check-up with old Dr. Ramirez, but that was…oh, goodness, must be a year ago now. He retired, you know. Lovely man. Nothing wrong wrong, just getting old like the rest of us. I haven’t needed to see anyone else since then. Why do you ask? Is something wrong with the forms?
DOCTOR: No, no, the forms themselves are fine. It's just…standard procedure. We need to have a current medical history. A year is…quite a bit of time in medicine. Have you been experiencing any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Well… I get a little tired quicker than I used to, I suppose. But that’s just getting old, isn’t it? And my knees… oh, my knees ache something awful when the weather changes. But that’s been going on for years. Nothing new. Honestly, I feel pretty much the same as always. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: "Pretty much the same" is…vague. And knee pain, even if it's chronic, can indicate underlying issues. Have you noticed any swelling in your knees?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. Not really. Maybe a little, sometimes. But I just figured it was water weight. I do stand a lot, you know. I'm pretty tall, so it's not like my feet don't get tired. It's hard to tell, really. I don't examine myself that closely. Is this really necessary to get these papers signed? I just need them verified, like I said. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Melvenia. I can’t just sign off on things without a basic assessment. It’s… irresponsible. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Nothing like that. My heart’s always been strong as a bull, thankfully. I haven't felt dizzy, and I can breathe just fine. I walk up and down stairs all the time! I don't understand why you're asking all these questions. It feels like you're trying to find something wrong with me. I just need these forms signed, and I'd really appreciate it if we could just get it done. I have errands to run. Is there a fee for all this questioning?
DOCTOR: Look, Melvenia. I’m trying to provide proper medical care. You came to a doctor. And, yes, there is a fee for my time, whether I'm simply signing a form or conducting a full examination. Now, let’s try this one more time. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. My appetite is fine. I eat. I don't starve myself. And my weight… well, it fluctuates a little, doesn't everyone’s? It goes up and down. Nothing drastic. Look, Doctor, I'm a perfectly healthy woman. I just need these papers signed so I can get on with my day. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Are you going to sign them or not? I don’t think I’ve ever been grilled like this just to get a form verified!
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia. Clearly, you're not interested in a thorough assessment. And frankly, I don't have time to argue. However, I must document that you’ve declined a full medical history and examination. I’ll sign the forms, but I strongly advise you to see a physician for a proper check-up. It’s been a year, and that’s far too long. I'm going to make a note here that you were advised to seek further medical attention. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just hurry up, please. I have things to do. And no, that's all. Thank you. Let's just be done with this. I'm not sure I want to come back here again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here you are. And as I said, I strongly recommend a follow-up appointment with a physician. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
