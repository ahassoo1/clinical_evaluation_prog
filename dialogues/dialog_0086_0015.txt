DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham, nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is… my sinuses, I think. They feel… not good. It’s been a little bit now. I don’t remember exactly how long, but a while. I just feel… stuffed up, mostly. And a little bit of… pressure? It is hard to say.
DOCTOR: “A little bit of… pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like… behind my eyes, maybe? Not a bad bad pain, but… uncomfortable. It’s hard to explain. I do not remember what made it start. Maybe the weather? We had some rain, yes?
DOCTOR: The weather, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe. Or… work? I work with… the drills, you know? Rotary drills. It is… dusty, sometimes. But I wear a mask, always. I think. It is hard to remember all the details, Doctor. Everything feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Right. Dusty work, wearing a mask... and a little bit of… fuzziness, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The fuzziness is… not all the time. Just… remembering things. Dates, mostly. And sometimes… words. It is not so bad, but… it worries my husband. He said I should come see you, just in case. He worries a lot. He is a good man.
DOCTOR: Dates and words... I see. And how would you rate this stuffiness and pressure on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Oh… one to ten? Hmm. Let me think… It is not a ten, definitely not. Maybe… a three? Four, on a bad day? It does not keep me from work, you know? I just… feel tired. And the stuffiness is annoying, that is all. It's not a sharp pain, Doctor. More like… a heavy feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any fever, cough, or sore throat accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No cough. And… no sore throat. Just… the stuffiness and the… fuzziness. I do not feel sick, exactly. Just… not myself. It is hard to describe. I hope I am not making it confusing.
DOCTOR: No, it is a bit confusing, Ms. Boham. Let's try to be a little more precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, I am sorry, Doctor. I will try. It is just… I don't always remember things clearly. But no, no cough. No fever. Just… the pressure, and the feeling of being… stuffed up. It is mostly in my face, I think. Around my nose and eyes. Does that make sense? I do feel a little tired, all the time now, but… I don’t know if that is from work, or the sinuses. Or… something else.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick look. If you don't mind. Just a basic exam to see what's going on. Could you sit up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Of course. I hope it is okay that I am not wearing much makeup today. I did not think I would need it, coming to the doctor. I just wanted to… get this checked out.
DOCTOR: Hm. Ears look clear. Now, let me take a look at your throat… open wide. Throat is a little… unremarkable. Not much redness. Now, let's feel your sinuses. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. A little… here. And maybe… a little here. It is not a sharp pain, but… I feel it. It is a… pressure, mostly. Like pushing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. So, stuffiness, some tenderness in the sinuses, a little fatigue… and this… fuzziness. It sounds like a sinus infection, potentially. Though, it’s not entirely typical. Have you had sinus infections before?
PATIENT: Oh… sinus infections? I… I don’t remember, Doctor. Maybe? I have been sick before, of course, many times. But I don't remember if it was this before. It could be, yes? My husband, he always knows these things. He says I get… congested sometimes, when the weather changes. But I don’t remember if it was ever this bad. Is it bad, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily something to be overly worried about. However, the memory issues are a little… concerning. It could be related to the congestion, but we shouldn't rule anything out. I'm going to order a basic blood test to check for inflammation and rule out any other potential causes. We'll also do a CT scan of your sinuses, just to get a better look. It's a precaution, understand?
PATIENT: Oh… a blood test and a… CT scan? Yes, Doctor. That sounds… serious. Is it very expensive? We… we don’t have much money. My husband works very hard, but… medical bills are… difficult. And will the scan… will it hurt? I get… nervous with these things, you know? I just want to feel better, and… I don’t want to cause too much trouble. Is it something very bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Ms. Boham. It's a standard procedure to get a clear picture of what’s going on. As for the cost… well, that’s something you'll need to discuss with the billing department. I can’t give you an exact figure. The scan itself is painless. You'll simply lie on a table while the machine takes some images. Look, I understand your concerns, but we need to rule out any serious issues. It’s better to be safe than sorry. I’ll write the orders now. We’ll get the tests scheduled as soon as possible.
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. Yes, I understand. Testing is good. Safe is good. Thank you. My husband will… he will be glad we are being careful. He worries so much. Can you… tell me what to expect, with the scan? Just… so I am not surprised, you know? And where do I go, to have it done? I do not want to get lost.
DOCTOR: The CT scan will be at City Imaging, just down the street. Here’s a slip with the address and phone number. They’ll have you lie on a table inside the machine—it’s a large, donut-shaped device. It’s open on both ends, so you won’t feel closed in. It’s quick, usually less than ten minutes. They may ask you to remove any metal objects, like jewelry. Do you have any metal implants?
PATIENT: Oh, metal implants? No, Doctor. No implants. Just… my teeth. And maybe… an old filling? I don't remember exactly. No big metal things, no. City Imaging… down the street, you said? That is good. I can walk there, yes? And it is quick? That is very good. Will they… will they tell me the results, or do I come back to you? I get very confused with these things, Doctor. I don’t want to forget anything.
DOCTOR: The results will be sent directly to me. You don’t need to worry about that. Come back for a follow-up appointment next week, and we’ll discuss them then. I'll have the receptionist schedule that for you before you leave. In the meantime, if you develop a high fever, severe headache, or any changes in vision, go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. Next week. And emergency room… for fever, headache, or vision changes. I will remember. My husband will remind me, too. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I… I hope it is nothing too serious. I just want to feel better, and… get back to work. Is there anything else I need to do, before I go? Anything at all? I don't want to forget something important.
DOCTOR: No, that’s all for now, Ms. Boham. Just try to get some rest, and drink plenty of fluids. And try not to worry too much. The receptionist will take care of scheduling your follow-up. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
