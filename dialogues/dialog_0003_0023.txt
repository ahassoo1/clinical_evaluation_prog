DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, my chest… it hurts. Not all the time, but… yeah, it hurts. Like, in my breast. It’s… strange.
DOCTOR: "Breast," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Sorry if that sounds… weird. It’s not… a big pain, but it’s there. Sometimes more than others. It feels… kinda sore, like after working hard. But I didn’t do anything hard to my chest. You know?
DOCTOR: Right. Soreness. And how long has this… soreness been occurring, Mr. Bulaong?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a week? A little more than a week, I think. It started… after we fixed Old Man Hemlock’s roof. It wasn’t bad then, just a little ache. But it’s been getting… more noticeable, I guess.
DOCTOR: And you assisted with roof repairs?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. I am a roofer. That's what I do. Me and my partner, we did the whole thing. Old Man Hemlock’s roof was… tricky. Lots of climbing. Is that… bad? Does that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Climbing, yes, potentially. We’ll need to ascertain the nature of this discomfort. Can you describe the pain more precisely?
PATIENT: Precise… okay. It’s not a sharp pain. More like… a heavy ache. And it's not always there. Sometimes I don’t feel anything at all. It feels… kinda inside, not just on the skin. And… sometimes it goes up into my armpit a little bit. Does that make sense? I don't know about… precise. It just hurts.
DOCTOR: “Heavy ache…radiating…” Alright. And is this pain worsened by any particular activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Like I said, climbing doesn’t seem to make it worse now. Maybe it was bad after, but not while I’m doing it. It doesn’t hurt when I lift things. It just… is. Except maybe… when it's really hot. Then it feels… worse. Like everything is sore.
DOCTOR: Heat sensitivity… Well, let's proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with auscultation of your chest, and then palpate the area you've described.
PATIENT: Okay. Auscul… what now? You want me to lie down? On the table? Is that gonna hurt? I don’t like doctors touching me too much. No offense, Doctor. It just… makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Auscultation simply means listening with a stethoscope, Mr. Bulaong. It's a standard procedure. And no, it shouldn't cause any discomfort. I assure you, I'm a professional. Please, lie down. We need to rule out any pulmonary issues. It's a necessary step.
PATIENT: Pulmonary… okay. Sounds serious. You think it’s my lungs? I guess… if you think so. Just… be gentle, okay? And tell me what you’re doing. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be listening to your lungs with this instrument to assess your breathing. Please take deep, slow breaths through your mouth. Deep breath… and again… Now, I’m hearing clear bilateral breath sounds. No wheezing, no crackles. Now, I’m going to gently press on your chest to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yeah, that’s it. Right there. Not terrible, but… yeah, that hurts. It feels… kinda like a knot. Not a hard knot, but… like something’s… swollen, maybe? Sorry, I don’t know medical words. Just feels… bumpy.
DOCTOR: A slight area of tenderness with some underlying…subtle fullness. Not particularly concerning, but we should document it. I'm going to need to examine your axillary lymph nodes now, Mr. Bulaong. Please relax your arm.
PATIENT: Okay, arm relaxed. Like this? That’s my armpit, right? Is that where the bumpy things are? It feels… weird when you poke around in there. It doesn’t hurt hurt, but… tingly. And a little… sore. Like I’ve been using it too much. But I haven’t. Mostly just… roofs. Is this bad, Doctor? Are you finding something?
DOCTOR: Palpable, slightly enlarged, but non-tender lymph nodes in the axilla. Again, not overtly concerning at this time. Given your occupation and the nature of the discomfort, it’s likely musculoskeletal in origin, possibly exacerbated by recent physical exertion. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I am going to order a complete blood count and a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Blood count and… a picture of my chest? What are you trying to rule out? Is it… serious? Like, cancer or something? My wife… she worries a lot. And I don't want to scare her. It just feels like sore muscles, that’s all. Is a picture really necessary?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, it is standard practice to investigate any new onset of discomfort, particularly when it involves palpable abnormalities. We are not immediately diagnosing cancer. The X-ray will allow us to assess your lungs and surrounding structures. The blood count will provide information about your overall health and rule out any underlying infection. It's a precautionary measure, not a cause for alarm. I understand your wife's concerns, but we need to gather information before we can provide an accurate assessment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I guess… I guess so. But I don't like hospitals. And I don't like pictures. And I really don't like them poking around in there. It just… makes me feel weird. Okay, fine. Blood and picture. But… can we do it quickly? And can I bring my wife with me next time? Just… for support. It would make me feel better.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will arrange for you to have the blood work and chest X-ray done as soon as possible. You may bring your wife with you for follow-up. I'll have the receptionist schedule the appointments. We'll discuss the results at that time. Now, I will provide you with a referral slip and instructions for the blood work. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. Even though I'm nervous. I… I appreciate you explaining things. And arranging the appointments. Okay. I’ll go see the receptionist now. Thank you again. .
