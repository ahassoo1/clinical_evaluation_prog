DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start us off, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Yeah, well, I’m trying out for a team. Need to get checked out, you know? Physical and all that. Hope I pass!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lamark. A pre-participation physical, good idea. We want to make sure you're in the best shape possible. Before we get started, could you tell me a little more about the team you’re trying out for?
PATIENT: It’s a… well, it’s a sort of… traditional Mongolian wrestling team. They’re putting together a group to compete in a few tournaments around the state. Not professional or anything, just for fun, really. And bragging rights, of course.
DOCTOR: That sounds fantastic, Lamark! A great way to stay active and connect with your heritage. Okay, to get a good baseline, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had a primary care physician before?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Not for a long time, anyway. I usually just… tough it out if something’s wrong. And then it usually goes away.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many people put things off. That’s why you’re here today, and that’s a great first step. Alright. So we’ll need to cover quite a bit then. Let’s start with any major illnesses or surgeries you've had in the past. Even things that seem minor – did you ever have chickenpox as a kid?
PATIENT: Chickenpox… yeah, I think so. When I was little, back in Mongolia. It was a long time ago, I don’t remember much. No surgeries though, thankfully. Never broken anything, either. Just the usual bumps and bruises from… well, wrestling.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No surgeries or broken bones is excellent. And how about any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My father… he had some heart trouble later in life, I think. And my grandmother… she had diabetes, maybe? Honestly, I don’t really know a lot about my family’s medical history. We weren’t big on talking about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history openly. Okay, we’ll make a note of the potential heart trouble and diabetes. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to stay away from pills if I can. Just… lots of tea. And maybe some traditional remedies my aunt sends me from Mongolia, but nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. That's good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My aunt sends me all sorts of… interesting things. Never had a reaction yet.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Always thought it was a bad idea. Especially for someone who needs to breathe a lot.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just… occasionally. With friends. Maybe a beer after a good wrestling match. Nothing heavy. I don’t really have a sweet tooth for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, I just want to ask about any current symptoms you might be experiencing – any pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, or anything else that's been bothering you?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing really. I mean, I get a little sore after wrestling, but that’s normal. Just the usual aches and pains. Everything feels pretty good, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright, Lamark. Let's proceed with the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Just get it over with, eh? I got some training to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 140 over 90. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but I do note some mild decreased breath sounds at the bases. Alright, now let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Throat is clear, ears are normal. Pulse is 78 and regular. Okay, Lamark. That completes the physical exam. Overall, you seem to be in reasonably good health. However, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and I noted some mild decreased breath sounds in your lungs. I would like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Uh… what kind of tests? I was hoping to just get a thumbs-up and get back to training. I really don’t have a lot of time for… all that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Lamark. The tests I’m suggesting are just some basic blood work – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. These will give us information about your overall health, kidney function, and electrolytes. And a chest X-ray to get a better look at those decreased breath sounds I noticed. It's better to be safe and rule out anything serious. It will give us a baseline for your health so we can keep track of it. It’s not a definitive diagnosis or anything, just preventative care. It’ll take about an hour to get the results and we can discuss them. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Ugh… fine. But you gotta promise to get them done quickly. I have a team counting on me. And tell me honestly, is this going to stop me from wrestling?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Lamark. I promise to expedite the tests as quickly as possible. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so the blood work should only take about an hour. The X-ray will also be done promptly. And to answer your question honestly, I don't anticipate these tests stopping you from wrestling. It's more about gathering information so we can ensure your health and safety. If anything were to show up, we can discuss it and make an informed decision together. Right now, it’s a precautionary measure. Okay, let’s get the lab order and X-ray requisition written up. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and send you to radiology. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Just… let’s get it over with. The sooner I’m back to training, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here are the lab order and X-ray requisition. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. After that, she will give you instructions on where to go for the X-ray. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… try to be quick, okay? .
