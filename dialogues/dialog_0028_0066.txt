DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Mastrantonio, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Jamill Mastrantonio. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Doctor… Memmolo, is it?
DOCTOR: Memmolo is fine. Let’s not waste time with pleasantries. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a… popping sensation in my back. It’s not constant, more like a click or a pop when I move in certain ways. It doesn’t really hurt, but it’s definitely noticeable and a little unsettling, to be honest. I work on trains, you see, a lot of bending and reaching… I wondered if that might have something to do with it.
DOCTOR: A “popping sensation,” you say. Trains… bending and reaching. Yes, well, manual labor often leads to… complaints. Is it localized?
PATIENT: Localized? Hmm. It seems to be… mostly in the lower back, on the left side, I believe. Though sometimes I feel it a bit higher up, closer to my shoulder blades. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, if that makes sense. It doesn't radiate down my legs or anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: “Vague” is what that sounds like, Mr. Mastrantonio. Fine. Any recent injury?
PATIENT: No, no recent injury at all. Nothing that I can recall. I’m quite careful with my work, as one has to be. It just… started gradually, a few weeks ago, as I said. Not a sudden thing. I did lift a rather heavy electrical panel a month or so back, but I’ve lifted heavier before without issue.
DOCTOR: And you expect me to deduce the cause from that?
PATIENT: Well, no, not expect, Doctor. I was simply providing information. I thought perhaps my occupation might be relevant, given the physical nature of the work. I don't know what causes these things, that's why I came to you. Is there anything specific you'd like to know? Perhaps if I describe how it happens?
DOCTOR: Very well. Describe precisely when it occurs. Be specific. What movement precipitates this… popping?
PATIENT: Okay, let me think. It usually happens when I twist my back while bending over. Like, if I’m reaching for a tool on the floor, and I have to rotate my torso at the same time. Or when I’m getting up from a crouched position. Sometimes it happens just when I stretch my back, reaching upwards. It doesn't happen every time, mind you. But those are the situations where I notice it most often. It’s… a brief clicking sound, and sometimes I can feel it as well, a little shift in my back. Not pain, just… a sensation.
DOCTOR: And your medical history?
PATIENT: I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. No major illnesses or surgeries. I have private insurance, with the Havana Healthcare Group, if that’s what you mean. I had a bout of the flu a few years back, and a sprained ankle playing dominoes, but nothing serious. I see my primary care physician, Dr. Alvarez, for annual check-ups. He’s quite good, though he’s not a specialist in… backs, obviously. Do you need me to provide any records?
DOCTOR: Dominoes. Very well. Any family history of… skeletal issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother had arthritis in her hands, towards the end of her life, but I don’t believe it was… a genetic condition, more a result of age and hard work, she was a seamstress. My father… he was quite robust, never really had any significant health problems. As far as I know, there wasn’t any history of back trouble or skeletal issues on either side of the family. Though, truthfully, we didn't discuss such things much. It wasn’t really the custom.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look. Stand up, if you would.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know what you'd like me to do.
DOCTOR: Bend forward, touch your toes. Don’t strain yourself, but give me a reasonable range of motion. I'm observing your posture.
PATIENT: Alright. Just like this? It’s a bit stiff, as you can see. I haven’t done this stretch in a while. There we go. How does that look?
DOCTOR: Noted. Slight forward flexion restriction. Observe asymmetry in lumbar paraspinal musculature. Now, twist to your left. Slowly. I need a controlled movement.
PATIENT: Rotating now... just like this? It feels… a little tighter on this side. A slight discomfort, but not pain. Is this what you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. That's sufficient. It’s likely a mild muscular imbalance. Overuse. Your occupation, predictably. I’ll prescribe a muscle relaxant and suggest physical therapy. Do not ignore the exercises they give you. I expect improvement within a few weeks. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A muscular imbalance… so, it's not anything serious? Just from the work? I was concerned it might be… a slipped disc or something more significant. And the physical therapy… is there anything specific I should be looking for in a therapist? A certain specialization, perhaps? And how often will I need to go? I just want to make sure I’m doing everything right. It’s just… I have a rather demanding schedule.
DOCTOR: “Slipped disc” is a laymen’s term, Mr. Mastrantonio. And you’re wasting my time with details. Any licensed physical therapist will suffice. Focus on core strengthening and proper lifting techniques. Twice weekly for four weeks should be adequate. If it doesn’t improve, then you can consider a specialist. Here’s the prescription. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Alright. Core strengthening and proper lifting techniques. I'll be sure to ask the therapist for specifics. I suppose that's… acceptable. Just one last thing, if you don’t mind. Will the muscle relaxant have any side effects? I operate heavy machinery at work, and I wouldn't want anything that might impair my judgment or coordination.
DOCTOR: Drowsiness is possible. Read the pamphlet. If it impairs your ability to operate machinery, stop taking it and contact me. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
