DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… well, it’s just this tiredness. A dreadful tiredness. It comes and goes, you see. Not like being a bit sleepy. It just… takes it out of you. I haven't the energy to do much these days. It’s… bothersome.
DOCTOR: "Tiredness," right. It's a vague complaint, you know. Lots of things can cause that. When did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start? That's a tricky one. It feels like… well, a long time now. Months, certainly. Perhaps longer? My husband, Tenzin, he might remember better. He keeps track of these things. I just… feel it. It's hard to pinpoint a date, you know? I’ve been a commercial diver my whole life, always busy. Maybe it’s just… getting old?
DOCTOR: Commercial diver, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. Well, was a commercial diver. I haven’t been in the water for… oh, a few years now. Retired, you see. But I was a good one. Best in the business, some said. Hard work, though. Very hard work. Lots of… lifting and… maneuvering things. It’s not like today’s divers with all their fancy equipment. We did it the proper way, back then.
DOCTOR: Proper way, hm?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Proper. No computers telling you what to do, relying on your own strength and skill. None of these youngsters know what real work is. It’s all… gadgets and gizmos. We didn’t need all that. Built character, it did.
DOCTOR: Right, well… besides the tiredness, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My muscles ache sometimes. Not all the time, but… a dull ache. Mostly in my legs, I suppose. And… oh dear, this is difficult. I forget things, you know. Simple things. Where I put my glasses, what I was just saying… It’s very irritating, I assure you. Tenzin says I repeat myself, too. But he’s always exaggerating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Muscle aches and… forgetfulness. Do you have any difficulty with balance, Ardelle?
PATIENT: Balance? Well… not exactly difficulty, no. But I'm not as steady on my feet as I used to be, naturally. A bit wobbly, perhaps. I have to be careful on uneven ground. These old bones aren’t what they once were, you see. I wouldn’t want to go tumbling, now would I?
DOCTOR: And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is… alright. Not as robust as it was, mind you. I don’t crave things like I used to. Tenzin makes lovely meals, though. He’s a very good cook. I eat what he puts in front of me. Don’t want to disappoint him, you see.
DOCTOR: Are you experiencing any changes in your bowel habits, Ardelle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about… well, really! Is that necessary? I mean, one comes to the doctor for tiredness, not… that. I suppose… everything is… regular enough. Don't go making a fuss about things that are perfectly normal. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s move on. Any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, dear. Nothing like that. I sleep quite well, actually. A bit restless sometimes, but no sweating or… shivers. I'm a warm person, you see. Always have been. No need for extra blankets.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a few years back. Can’t recall the name, now. A small white pill. I take it every morning. And sometimes, Tenzin gives me a herbal tea for my joints. But that’s all. Nothing fancy, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But don't go poking and prodding too much, dear. I'm an old woman, you know. My bones are delicate. And be quick about it, please. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Another one… Good. Lungs sound clear, a little bit of crackling on the bases but nothing concerning for someone your age. Heart rate is regular, a slight murmur, but that’s not unusual. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but consistent with your medication. Pulse is 78. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but that's to be expected. Alright. Everything seems… relatively normal. It sounds like you're just experiencing some typical age-related changes, Ardelle. Fatigue, muscle aches, a bit of forgetfulness. It's not uncommon.
PATIENT: Hmph. I told you it was just getting old! All this fuss for nothing. I’ve been perfectly capable my whole life, and I’ll continue to be, thank you very much. Is that all, then? Can I go home now?
DOCTOR: Well, not nothing. Your blood pressure is a little high, even with medication. And the fatigue… we need to rule out other things. I'm going to order some blood work. Just routine stuff – a complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function, and Vitamin D levels. We'll also do a basic cognitive assessment, just a short questionnaire to get a baseline of your memory. It's just to be thorough. And honestly, fatigue can be a symptom of many things. We want to be sure it's just age-related. I'll have the lab results back in a few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment then. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? Honestly! I've had enough poking and prodding for one day. Must you put me through all this? I suppose… if you insist. But I haven’t got all day for appointments, you know. Tenzin needs my help with the garden. And I have my bridge club on Thursday. Just get it over with quickly, dear. And don’t expect any miracles from these results. I’m perfectly fine, I tell you. Perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, here’s the order for the blood work. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll draw a few vials of blood. It shouldn't take long. And I'll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you when the results are back. We'll discuss them then. Alright, well, if you don’t have any other questions, you’re free to go. Get some rest, and try not to overexert yourself.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Just fine. I’ll go. Don’t bother calling if the results are nothing. Honestly, all this fuss for nothing. Young doctors these days…no respect for experience.
