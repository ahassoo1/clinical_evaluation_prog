DOCTOR: Hello Lacreasha, welcome. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Right. The… nails. They just look… funny. Not good funny. Like, changed. I don't know how they changed, just… did. They weren't like this before, I promise. It's probably nothing, but figured I should get it checked. You know, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your nails… they’ve changed in some way, and you’re wanting to get it checked out. Can you describe what’s different about them?
PATIENT: Ugh, describe? It's hard to describe! They're… not shiny anymore? And kinda… thick? Not like really thick, but… not normal. And maybe a little bit yellow? I don't paint them or anything. Never have. Honestly, I don't know what else is different. That's why I'm here, isn’t it? It just looks… off.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. It's helpful you're noticing these changes – loss of shine, some thickening, and a yellowish tint. It is good you came in to get it checked out. Do you notice this on all of your nails, or just some of them?
PATIENT: Oh, all of them, I think. Yeah, all ten. Maybe some are worse than others, but… all of them. Definitely all of them. I mean, I don't stare at my nails all day, you know? But when I noticed one looked funny, I looked at the others and… yeah. All bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, all ten nails showing these changes. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort with your nails?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. Maybe a little… sensitive? If I bump them, it kinda stings. But no pain, pain. It's not like that. Just… ouch if I hit them on something. I'm not doing anything with my hands that would make them hurt, if that makes sense. I'm not a builder or anything.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. No significant pain, just some sensitivity when bumped. Now, have you noticed any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Skin? Hmm... let me see. No. Not really. Maybe a little… red sometimes? But I think that’s just from washing my hands so much. You know, gotta keep clean. I haven't noticed anything different different, if that makes sense. It’s probably just normal skin. I don't have any… stuff growing around them or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant changes to the skin around the nails, just some occasional redness you attribute to frequent hand washing. And just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I just came about my nails. I don't… feel sick, if that's what you mean. No cough, no fever, no nothing. Just… funny nails. Honestly, I don't know what other symptoms I'd even be looking for. Is something wrong? Are my nails, like, bad bad?
DOCTOR: No, no, it's good you're telling me this. It's helpful to know you haven't been experiencing any other symptoms. Let's take a look at your nails. Can you hold your hands still for a moment?
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry up, okay? I have things to do. Not important things, but things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do see some thickening and a yellowish discoloration, as you mentioned. The texture is a little rougher than normal, and there appears to be some mild pitting on a few of the nails. It doesn't appear to be actively inflamed. Do you have any history of fungal infections, like athlete’s foot or ringworm?
PATIENT: Fungal? Oh, goodness no. Never had anything like that. I keep myself very clean! That sounds… awful. No, definitely not. My husband… well, my late husband, he got something on his foot once, but I kept far away from it. It was terrible. No, I’ve never had any fungus. You sure that’s what it is? Doesn't look like fungus to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It's good to know you haven’t had any previous fungal infections. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, it could be a fungal infection, but there are other possibilities. A common one is psoriasis, which can affect the nails. It can also be caused by trauma to the nail bed, even minor injuries you might not recall. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to take a small sample of the nail clippings to send to the lab for a fungal culture. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Lab? Clippings? Oh, goodness. You're going to cut my nails? I just got them… well, I don't get them done, but they’re my nails! And what if it isn't fungus? Then what? You'll just have… bits of my nails in a lab somewhere? I don't know… Is it really necessary? Can't you just… tell me what it is by looking at them?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about having a sample taken. The culture is the most accurate way to determine if a fungus is present. It's a very small clipping – just a tiny piece from each nail, and it won't cause any pain or discomfort. It’s a standard procedure, and the lab will analyze the sample to identify if any fungal organisms are present. If it’s not fungus, then we can explore other possibilities, like psoriasis or other nail conditions. Knowing what it isn’t is just as important as knowing what it is. We can also discuss topical treatments if you'd prefer to try those first, but without knowing the cause, we’re just guessing. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And gentle. And don’t take too much. I don’t want to be left with… stubs. What exactly happens? Do I feel anything? And what about the results? How long does it take? I have a bridge club meeting next Tuesday, and I don’t want to be missing that.
DOCTOR: Okay, it's very straightforward. I'll simply trim a tiny piece from the edge of each nail – just enough to get a sample. It shouldn't cause any discomfort at all - it's similar to trimming your own nails. I'll file the edges smooth afterwards so there are no rough spots. See?
PATIENT: Hmmph. It did hurt a little. But… okay, fine. Just get it over with. And hurry up! Don't want to be late for my appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, all done. See?
PATIENT: Well, they look okay, I guess. A little shorter, but okay. And no, it didn't hurt too bad. Now what? Do I just… take this jar home with me? What do I do with it? And when will I get the results? I really need to know before Tuesday.
DOCTOR: No, you don't take the jar home. I'll send this to the lab right away. They'll analyze it for any fungal organisms, and the results usually take about 7-10 business days to come back. I understand you're concerned about Tuesday, and I'll do my best to expedite the process. I can also put a note in the lab request to prioritize your sample. However, I can't guarantee a faster turnaround time. In the meantime, we can discuss some general nail care tips and some over-the-counter treatments that might provide some temporary relief. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Tips? Treatments? Oh, goodness. I guess… anything is better than just waiting. What kind of tips? And what about those treatments? Do they smell? I can't stand strong smells.
DOCTOR: Okay, some simple tips first. Keep your nails trimmed short and clean, and avoid using harsh chemicals or detergents. Wear gloves when doing dishes or cleaning. Make sure your shoes aren’t too tight, which can cause trauma to the nails. Also, try to keep your hands as dry as possible. As for treatments, there are several over-the-counter antifungal creams and liquids available. Most of them have a mild scent – nothing overpowering, but I can recommend some brands that are fragrance-free if you prefer. We also have some topical oils that can help moisturize and strengthen the nails. Here are a few brochures with more information about nail care and treatment options. And I’ll write you a prescription for a fragrance-free antifungal cream to start with, just in case. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But if that cream smells bad, I’m not using it. And I don't want anything sticky. I hate sticky things. So, I just… wait for the results and use this cream? And then what? What if it is fungus? Do I have to take pills? Oh, goodness, I hate pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sticky creams, I promise! I'll write you a prescription for a cream that's specifically designed to be non-greasy and odorless. And you're right to ask about pills. If the culture confirms it's a fungal infection, the treatment will depend on the severity. Mild cases can often be managed with topical creams, like the one I'm prescribing. However, more severe cases may require oral antifungal medication. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let's focus on using the cream as directed and keeping your nails clean and dry. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I guess not. Just… hurry up with those results, okay? And no pills if you can help it. Thank you, Doctor. I hope I don't have anything serious. And please, no strong smells. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lacreasha. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to get you those results as quickly as possible. And I promise, we'll avoid any strong smells! Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and enjoy your bridge club meeting next Tuesday! .
