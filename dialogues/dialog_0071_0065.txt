DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s my weight. I’ve gained quite a bit recently, and I haven’t changed anything about my diet or exercise. It’s rather perplexing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, weight gain… and you haven't noticed any changes in what you're eating or how active you are?
PATIENT: No, sir, none at all. I eat the same things I always have – mostly potatoes, cabbage, a little bit of meat when my husband can get it. And I walk to the market most days, like always. It’s just… appearing. It’s very strange. Perhaps it’s nothing, but I thought it best to have it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long ago did you start noticing this weight gain, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It began sometime in March, I believe. Yes, March. Around the time the weather started to warm up, actually. It was very gradual at first, barely noticeable, but now… well, now my clothes feel quite snug. It’s been about five months, then. Five months of… expansion, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Five months. Alright. And has anything else changed during that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. No, not really. My husband, Darius, is still working at the factory. Our daughter, Elina, is still away at university. Everything at home is… normal. Though, I have been feeling rather tired lately. More tired than usual, perhaps. But I attributed that to the heat. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Fatigue could be relevant, yes. Okay. Just to get a clearer picture, have you experienced any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: No, not precisely. I sleep soundly enough, I think. Perhaps a little too soundly? Darius says I snore a bit more, but he always says that. He’s a sound sleeper himself, so I don't know how accurate that is. It's not that I'm having trouble sleeping, just… a deep sleep, if that makes sense. I feel quite groggy when I wake up, though. Perhaps that’s the same thing?
DOCTOR: Okay, deep sleep and grogginess. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your skin – dryness, paleness, anything like that?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, perhaps. My skin does feel a little drier than usual. And I haven't been spending much time in the sun, naturally, but I don't think it’s that pale. I am Lithuanian, you see. We are not known for our sun tans. But yes, drier skin. And… I seem to be feeling cold more easily. Even in the summer, I’ve been needing a shawl.
DOCTOR: Okay, drier skin, feeling cold… And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… that is a rather personal question, Doctor. I… I suppose I have been a little… constipated, if you must know. It hasn't been severe, but it’s certainly more frequent than it used to be. It’s quite uncomfortable, to be honest. I assumed it was the lack of fresh fruit, but… perhaps it is connected?
DOCTOR: It very well could be connected. Alright. Just a few more questions, then we'll do a quick physical exam. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I hadn't thought to mention it, but now that you ask… my ankles do feel a little puffy at the end of the day. Especially if I’ve been on my feet a lot. I thought it was just… the heat. Or perhaps my shoes are too tight. It’s not severe, Doctor, just… noticeable. I can still get my shoes on, but it’s snugger than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Reneisha. Thank you for answering my questions so thoroughly. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and take your blood pressure. Just routine things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. I appreciate your thoroughness. Please, proceed. I want to get to the bottom of this, if possible. It's just… unsettling to feel these changes without knowing the cause. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up on the table for me, please. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Very well. Please, do. I will try to breathe as normally as possible. It's a bit chilly in here, though. Perhaps I should have brought a thicker shawl.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… a little muffled. And your breathing is a bit shallow. Okay. Now, I'm just going to check your thyroid gland. It's located in your neck, right here. Does that feel tender?
PATIENT: It’s a little… uncomfortable, yes. Not painful, exactly, but… sensitive. It feels… swollen, perhaps? I am not accustomed to being touched there, so it’s difficult to say definitively. But it does feel different than usual. A bit… firm. Is that normal, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily normal, no. It could indicate an enlargement. Alright, now I’m just going to take your blood pressure. Hmm… 140 over 90. A little elevated. And your pulse is 68, regular. Now, let me just take a look at your ankles. Yes, there’s some slight swelling here. Definitely some pitting edema. Okay. Thank you. That’s all for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings from the exam, I suspect we’re dealing with hypothyroidism – an underactive thyroid. However, we need to run some blood tests to confirm this. Would you be willing to have some blood drawn?
PATIENT: Hypothyroidism… I’ve never heard of it. An underactive thyroid… Is it serious, Doctor? And blood tests… yes, I suppose I can manage that. Though, I dislike needles immensely. But if it’s necessary to find out what’s wrong, then yes. Please, proceed. Just… be gentle, if you would? And could you explain what the tests will be looking for? I prefer to understand these things, if possible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s understandable to be apprehensive about needles. I'll make sure they're as gentle as possible. As for hypothyroidism, it's quite common, and usually manageable with medication. The thyroid gland regulates your metabolism, so when it's underactive, it can cause a lot of the symptoms you’ve been describing – weight gain, fatigue, constipation, dry skin, feeling cold, and swelling. The blood tests will measure your TSH – thyroid-stimulating hormone – and your T4 levels – thyroxine. These are key indicators of thyroid function. If your TSH is high and your T4 is low, it strongly suggests hypothyroidism. I'll also order a basic metabolic panel to rule out other potential causes. It’s a fairly routine procedure. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood now. It will only take a few minutes. While we wait for the results, I'll write you a referral to an endocrinologist, a specialist in hormone disorders. It’s always best to have a specialist involved in these cases. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… quite thorough, Doctor. An endocrinologist… yes, that seems sensible. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I still dislike the thought of needles, but I understand it’s necessary. And if it’s the right path to finding a solution, then I’ll endure it. Please, let the nurse come in whenever she’s ready. I suppose it’s best to get it over with. Thank you, Doctor Galena. I feel… a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Reneisha. I’m glad I could help ease your anxieties. I’ll just step out for a moment to let the nurse come in. She’ll explain the procedure to you. I’ll be back shortly to discuss the next steps once we have the test results. Don't hesitate to call out if you need anything at all.
