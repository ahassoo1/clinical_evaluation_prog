DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Well, it’s this heat, see? I just… can’t take it anymore. Never used to bother me, worked outside all my life. Now? Feels like my skin’s gonna melt off. It's ridiculous. I'm 62 years old, not a baby.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And when did you start noticing this increased sensitivity to the heat?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't know exactly. A few months, maybe? Last winter was mild, didn't really notice then. But this summer… this summer is different. Even getting the mail is a chore. Used to just walk out, do it, come back in. Now I gotta plan it around the sun. It's… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes. Well, we need to figure out why this is happening. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the heat sensitivity?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… not really. I get a bit tired, I suppose. But I always get tired, working the way I do. And I’m… well, a bit thirsty, naturally, when it’s hot. But that's normal, isn’t it? Look, I’m a practical man, Doc. I don’t go running to the doctor for every little thing. This heat thing is just… new. And bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand you're not one for unnecessary trips to the doctor, Mr. Coby. And it's good you're paying attention to what's new. Fatigue and increased thirst can be normal with heat exposure, but it's important to rule out anything else. Do you have any dizziness or lightheadedness, especially when you stand up?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Not really. Maybe a little unsteady sometimes, but that’s just getting old, I reckon. I don’t faint or anything. I've been climbing ladders my whole life. You’d know about it if I was fainting off ladders, wouldn’t you? It’s just… a bit wobbly sometimes, that's all. Nothing to make a fuss about.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urination – frequency, amount, color?
PATIENT: Urination? Now you're asking about… well, personal things. Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to. It’s… normal. Maybe I’m going a bit more often, now that I’m drinking more water. But that makes sense, doesn’t it? More in, more out. I’m not running to the toilet every five minutes, if that’s what you're asking. Honestly, Doc, I just want to know why I can't handle the heat anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Coby. These questions are important to rule out potential causes. A change in urination can be indicative of several things. Now, have you experienced any muscle cramps or weakness?
PATIENT: Muscle cramps? Sometimes, yeah. After a long day, working in the sun. But that’s just… normal aches and pains. Happens to everyone. I don't go to the doctor when my muscles ache. I take a hot bath and get on with it. Weakness… no, not really. I can still swing a hammer, I promise you. I'm a painter, remember? It's physical work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look at your skin. Just to get a baseline. It’s unlikely to tell me everything, but it’s a starting point.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Don't expect miracles, though. I'm a tough old bird. Worked outside my whole life, sun, rain, snow. A little poking and prodding isn't gonna tell you anything you don't already know.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Pulse is 78, regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing. Skin is dry, but no rash or other obvious abnormalities. Good peripheral pulses, but slightly diminished in your feet. Capillary refill is a little slow, about three seconds. Your skin feels noticeably dry, and the slowed capillary refill is a little concerning. It suggests possible dehydration or reduced circulation. I'm also noting your elevated blood pressure.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure? Now that's new. I haven't had my blood pressure checked in years. Maybe I should've mentioned that. But dry skin and slow… what was it, "capillary refill?" What does that even mean? You're making it sound like I'm falling apart, Doc. And frankly, I feel fine, aside from the heat.
DOCTOR: It means we need to investigate further, Mr. Coby. Elevated blood pressure, dryness, and slow capillary refill—along with your heat intolerance—could indicate several things, including dehydration, but it’s important to rule out anything more serious. I'm going to order some blood work: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We'll also check your electrolytes. And I’d like to order an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. I'll send these orders to the lab, and you can get that done today. It's unlikely to be a serious problem, but we need the information to make an informed decision. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any problems with medication. I take a bit of ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains, but that's it. Look, Doc, are you saying I'm… sick? Because I feel perfectly fine. Aside from the heat, like I've been telling you. This is getting ridiculous. All these tests… is this going to cost me a fortune?
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I'm not saying you are sick. I'm saying your body is exhibiting changes that require investigation. The tests will help us determine the cause of these changes. It's a standard procedure when someone presents with new symptoms like yours. And regarding cost, Medicare should cover most of it. We’ll have the lab check your coverage beforehand. In the meantime, I want you to increase your fluid intake significantly – at least eight glasses of water a day. Avoid strenuous activity in the heat, and wear loose, light-colored clothing. If you experience any dizziness, lightheadedness, or severe muscle cramps, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Eight glasses of water? That's a lot of water. I usually have a cup or two with lunch. But alright, fine. I'll try. And no strenuous activity? What am I supposed to do, sit in the dark all summer? Look, Doc, I appreciate you taking the time, but this all seems… excessive. I just wanted to know why I can't handle the heat anymore. I’m starting to think it's just old age.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, dismissing it as simply "old age" is irresponsible. While aging does bring changes, these symptoms warrant proper evaluation. The tests will help us determine if there’s an underlying medical issue that needs addressing. I've scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in one week, once the lab results are available. Please take this to the lab today, and they’ll schedule your EKG. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. I'll go get these tests done. And I hope they don’t find anything. Honestly, Doc, I'm a practical man. I need to get back to work. This whole thing is a waste of time, but alright. I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please call the office if you experience any changes in your condition before your appointment. And try to stay hydrated. Patient is… resistant to medical advice. Will emphasize the importance of following up next week. .
PATIENT: .
