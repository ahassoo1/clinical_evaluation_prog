DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I look into this… PrEP thing. She said it's good to be careful, you know? I’m not sure I understand all of it, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask.
DOCTOR: PrEP, right. Preventative medication. And your friend suggested it… just out of general caution?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. She’s… very proactive about things. I'm single, and, well, you meet people. I haven't been with anyone regularly but… it's always best to be safe, isn’t it? Especially these days. I just want to know what it involves, if it's right for me, and honestly, if it's something I even need to worry about.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Trefren, it’s good you’re thinking about these things, I suppose. But let's be realistic. PrEP isn’t a blanket precaution. It’s for individuals at significant risk of HIV exposure. It's not something one simply takes "just in case." Do you have any… specific concerns that led your friend to suggest this?
PATIENT: Specific concerns? Not really. She just… read an article, I think, and it made her nervous for me. Honestly, I hadn’t even thought about HIV before she brought it up. I’m 55, Doctor. It’s not like I'm out partying every night. I just… want to be informed, you know? I don't want to be caught off guard. Is that so wrong? I work as a parking attendant – it’s not exactly a high-risk profession.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Trefren, with all due respect, it sounds like your friend may be…overly cautious. And frankly, spending medical resources on someone with your lifestyle for PrEP seems… unnecessary. But, alright. To be thorough, let's go through a quick medical history. Have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I haven't. Never have. Like I said, it’s never been on my radar. I have Medicare, so I’ve had my regular check-ups, but they don’t specifically ask about that sort of thing, not that I recall. Blood pressure’s usually a little high, but manageable. Otherwise, pretty healthy, I think. I walk a lot at work, you know? Though my knees aren’t what they used to be. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Your knees are…not relevant at this time, Ms. Trefren. High blood pressure is noted. Alright. Any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No allergies, either. I eat pretty much everything. And… honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel a bit silly being here. If it’s not something I need, I’d rather just go. My time is valuable, and I’m sure there are people who really need this medication. I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Trefren. You're right to be mindful of resources. However, dismissing potential risks entirely isn't prudent. Let’s just run a few standard blood tests, a basic panel. It will give us a baseline and rule out any other underlying issues. Then we can determine if further investigation, or frankly, if this consultation was even necessary. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That… actually sounds reasonable. A basic panel wouldn’t take too long, would it? And if everything’s clear, then I won't bother you anymore. I appreciate you being… direct, Doctor. It’s nice to just get to the point. So, yes. A blood test sounds fine. Just tell me where to go.
DOCTOR: Good. The lab is just down the hall to your left. They'll need this requisition form. It’s pre-populated with the tests I’ve ordered. Standard blood work, plus an HIV antibody test. They’ll call you with the results in a few days. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions, although I doubt there will be any.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. That’s… that’s everything then? I appreciate you squeezing me in. I'll go down to the lab now. Hopefully, everything’s clear. And, if it is, I won't be back.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Trefren. That will be all. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
