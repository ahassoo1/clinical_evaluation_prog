DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I requested a general wellness panel, if that’s what you mean. Just wanted to get a good look at everything, you know? I’m seventy-four years young, and I like to stay on top of things. Preventative care is key, as my wife always says.
DOCTOR: A “general wellness panel,” yes. While I appreciate your… proactive approach, Mr. Mombrun, these things require a proper assessment. Simply requesting tests isn’t sound medical practice. Now, let's begin with a thorough history. Tell me, what specific concerns, if any, prompted this request?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand completely, Doctor. My apologies. It’s just… well, I don’t have any specific concerns, not really. I feel quite well, all things considered. It’s more of a… a check-up, a baseline, to see if everything is still running smoothly. No aches, no pains, sleep is good, appetite is good. I suppose I just wanted peace of mind, if you understand. My brother, he… well, he didn’t take such good care of himself, and it didn’t end well. So, I try to be diligent.
DOCTOR: Very well. "Peace of mind," as you say. Though preventative care is best directed by identified risks, not simply a general anxiety. Let’s proceed systematically, then. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, either loss or gain?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… perhaps a little weight loss, over the last few months. Not significant, mind you. Maybe two, three kilos, at most. I haven’t been weighing myself religiously, but my trousers feel a bit… looser. I attributed it to the warmer weather, honestly. Less appetite when it’s so hot, you know? But now that you ask, it might be worth looking into.
DOCTOR: Two to three kilograms… and associated with a decrease in appetite. Noted. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s a bit… personal, isn’t it? I suppose it’s part of a thorough history, as you say. Let me see… yes, a little irregularity, if I’m honest. Not severe, but… not as regular as it used to be. Sometimes a bit… looser, other times a bit… more difficult. It comes and goes. I hadn't given it much thought, to be perfectly frank. It seemed like a natural part of getting older, you understand.
DOCTOR: “Natural part of getting older.” That is precisely the sort of complacency that leads to problems, Mr. Mombrun. We must investigate these changes. Have you observed any blood in your stool, or any changes in its color?
PATIENT: Blood? No, Doctor, not that I’ve noticed. Definitely no blood. The color… well, it’s been normal, I suppose. Perhaps a bit darker on occasion, but nothing alarming. I haven’t been scrutinizing my… output, if you’ll pardon my language. My wife does most of the noticing, you see. She's very observant. I’ll have to ask her if she's seen anything unusual. But I’m quite certain there’s been no blood.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Do you experience any abdominal pain, bloating, or nausea?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain at all, thankfully. A little… fullness sometimes after a large meal, perhaps, but nothing I’d call bloating. And no nausea, not even a touch. My appetite is quite good, as I said. I enjoy my food very much, and I haven’t lost my enjoyment of it. I’m a bit of a gourmand, you see. I like to cook, and I enjoy trying new recipes. But no pain, no nausea, thankfully. I’m grateful for that, at least.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Let me see… no diabetes, thankfully. My mother had it, so I’m always careful with sugar, but no diagnosis for me. My blood pressure… it’s been a little elevated on occasion, the doctor told me a few years back, but it’s usually well-controlled with diet and exercise. No medication, thankfully. And no heart disease, as far as I know. I had a cardiologist do some tests about ten years ago, just as a precaution, and everything was normal. Nothing chronic, Doctor. I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard, all things considered. I attribute it to good genes and a healthy lifestyle.
DOCTOR: “Healthy lifestyle.” And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes, one. A rather minor procedure, really. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, maybe ten or twelve years old. It was an emergency, apparently. A burst appendix. But it was many years ago, and I’ve had no complications since. It was a simple procedure, and I recovered quickly. Nothing else, Doctor. No other surgeries, thankfully. I've always been careful to avoid them, if possible.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, childhood. Adequate. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My family… well, they weren’t always forthcoming about medical history. A bit of a taboo subject, you see. My mother, as I mentioned, had diabetes. And my father… he passed away relatively young, from a heart attack, I believe. But it was sudden, and there wasn't much information available. My brother, he had some issues… lung problems, I think. But he didn’t take care of himself, so it’s hard to say if it was hereditary. And that’s about all I know, Doctor. It wasn’t a family that spoke openly about such things. It’s a bit frustrating, to be honest. It makes it difficult to assess my own risk.
DOCTOR: A lack of reliable information. Predictable. Very well. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, I assure you, my vices are limited to a good cup of coffee and the occasional slice of Venezuelan cake. I've never been much for smoking, never touched a cigarette in my life. A little wine with dinner, perhaps, on special occasions, but very rarely. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I'm a man of simple pleasures, Doctor. A good book, a walk in the park, a conversation with my wife… those are my indulgences. I assure you, I lead a very… respectable life. And I'm quite proud of that, if I may say so myself.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, minimal alcohol. Adequate. Finally, allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully none that I'm aware of. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. No reactions to any medications, no food allergies, no sensitivities to pollen or dust... I've never had any trouble, really. I can eat anything, take most any medication, and breathe the air without issue. I believe I'm quite resilient, if I may say so myself. Though I do prefer a gentle breeze to a strong wind, if that counts. But no actual allergies, Doctor. None that I know of.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Mombrun, while I commend your… robust health history, your recent weight loss and changes in bowel habits warrant further investigation. I’m going to conduct a brief physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We will start with abdominal palpation.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. I understand, of course. My old bones aren't quite as flexible as they used to be. Lead me on, then. I trust your expert hands. Please, do take your time. And don't hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please relax and breathe normally. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: A little, Doctor. Not severe, mind you, just… a slight tenderness. It’s hard to describe… almost like a dull ache, right there. It’s been coming and going, as I said. I hadn’t paid much attention to it, to be perfectly honest. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Is that… concerning, Doctor? I do hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: And this?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that’s… a bit more noticeable, Doctor. A sharper discomfort this time. It’s not excruciating, but… definitely there. It almost feels like… a pressure, a tightness in that area. I hadn’t realized it was quite so… sensitive. Is something wrong, Doctor? I confess, I’m starting to feel a little anxious.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, based on your history and preliminary examination, I suspect a possible diverticulitis. However, a definitive diagnosis requires further investigation. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. Do not eat or drink anything after this point. The CT scan requires an empty stomach. I will have my assistant schedule these tests for you immediately. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available, and we will discuss the appropriate course of action. And Mr. Mombrun, if you experience fever, severe abdominal pain, or any change in bowel habits, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Diverticulitis? Oh dear. Is that… serious, Doctor? I see. No food or drink… understood. Fever, severe pain… I understand. Yes, I understand everything, Doctor. Thank you for your thoroughness, and for explaining everything so clearly. I will follow your instructions to the letter. And I will certainly go to the emergency room if anything… changes. Thank you again, Doctor. I do hope it’s not too serious.
