DOCTOR: Hi Larin, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. My back... it hurts real bad. It started, I think, maybe two weeks ago, but it's getting worse every day now. It makes it hard to even stand up straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, two weeks ago, and progressively getting worse… I see. And you said it makes it hard to stand up straight?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… if I try to lift something, even just a little bit, boom. Sharp pain. And then it hurts all day, even when I'm just sitting. It feels like… a bad weight on my back, you know? I try to move slow, but it still hurts. It’s getting hard to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, a sharp pain with lifting, and then a constant ache even at rest… that definitely sounds troublesome. Can you tell me where on your back the pain is the worst?
PATIENT: It's… lower back. Right in the middle, mostly. Sometimes it feels like it goes around to the side a little, but the middle is the worst. It's not like my whole back, just… that spot. Right here.
DOCTOR: Okay, localized to the lower back, mostly the middle. And does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… not much, really. Laying down flat sometimes helps a little bit. But only for a little while. And… when I take some of those pills, the white ones… they take the edge off, but it doesn’t fix it. It just… makes it easier to ignore for a few hours. They're from the doctor before, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, laying flat provides some temporary relief, and the white pills help a little. Do you remember what the name of those white pills are?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think… I have the bottle at home. It's… it starts with a "P", I think. It's small, white pills. I don’t remember the rest. Sorry. It’s been a while since I looked. I just ask my husband to get them for me when I run out. He usually knows.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Larin. It's common to forget those things. We can look it up later if needed. So, besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… well, I get tired really easy. Like, really easy. Even walking to the store makes me feel worn out. And sometimes my legs… they feel kinda numb, but it goes away. That hasn’t been happening for long, just the last few days. Oh! And I haven't been able to eat much. Everything just feels… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, some numbness in the legs that’s new, and decreased appetite. Has the numbness been in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Both legs, but it's not all the time. It's like… when I stand for a long time, or when I walk a lot. And it’s not bad numbness, just kinda… tingly, you know? Like when your foot falls asleep. But it doesn’t go away right away when I sit down.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in both legs, especially with prolonged standing or walking. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you ever had back problems before, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes. I… I had cancer. A few years ago. They did… surgery, and… radiation. It was in my stomach. They said it was… gone, after that. But I still go to the doctor for checkups. That's why I was surprised when my back started hurting. I thought… I thought the cancer was all gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me. That’s important information. And you still have regular checkups related to the cancer?
PATIENT: Yes. Every six months. They do blood tests, and… a scan, sometimes. The last scan was… I think it was in February. Everything looked okay then, the doctor said. He didn’t find anything. But like I said, that was before my back started hurting.
DOCTOR: Okay, February scan was clear. That's good. And besides the cancer, any other medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get headaches sometimes, but everyone gets headaches, right? And… my knees hurt a little when it rains, but that’s it. Nothing serious. I’ve always been pretty healthy, until the cancer.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches and some knee pain. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides those white pills you mentioned?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the white pills for the back, and… a little blue pill. The doctor gave it to me for my blood pressure, he said. It's a small dose, just once a day. And sometimes I take something for the headaches, but that’s just when they’re really bad. Over-the-counter stuff, you know? Like… Tylenol.
DOCTOR: Okay, white pills for the back, a blue pill for blood pressure, and Tylenol as needed. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, ever. The doctors always ask, but I always say no. I’ve never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And lastly, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… my mother had… heart trouble. She died when she was pretty young, I think. And my father… he had diabetes. Lots of people in my family get diabetes, I think. And… my sister, she had… cancer, too. Not the same kind as me, but still.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that information. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on with my back. It’s really worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, I’m just going to feel along your back here. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Hmm… there's some muscle spasm here on the right side. And it does seem tender to the touch. Now, can you bend forward for me, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Okay. Ooh… that hurts. Right there. It’s worse when I bend. And when I try to go back up. It feels like something is… stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain with forward bending. And now, can you try to bend backwards, gently?
PATIENT: Ooh, no. That's… much worse. I can’t really do it. It just… locks up. And the pain goes all the way around to my side. No, I can’t bend backwards. It’s too painful.
DOCTOR: Alright, limited range of motion, particularly with extension. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, just to make sure everything sounds okay. And then I’ll check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Your lungs sound clear, and your heart rhythm is regular. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal on both sides. And now, I'm going to ask you to push against my hand with your legs. Just as hard as you comfortably can. Strength is good in both legs as well.
PATIENT: Okay. It doesn't feel like anything is broken, but it hurts really bad. Everything hurts when I move. I'm worried it might be the cancer.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Larin. It's natural to worry, especially with your history. Based on the exam, it doesn’t feel like the cancer is directly involved right now, but we need to rule things out. The muscle spasm is significant, and the limited range of motion is concerning. We’ll need to get some imaging done, an X-ray of your lower back would be a good place to start. We should also run some blood tests to check for inflammation and other potential causes. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's going on, and what we can do about the pain. Blood tests and an X-ray… okay. Let’s do it. I want to feel better. And I really want to know if it’s the cancer again.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology department right away. I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever to help manage the discomfort in the meantime. Let me also give you some instructions on how to care for your back at home. Try to avoid any heavy lifting or twisting motions, and apply ice packs to the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. We'll get the results of the tests back within a few days, and I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Muscle relaxant and pain reliever… and ice packs. No heavy lifting. Okay, I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to me, and for taking care of this. It makes me feel a little better just knowing what we’re going to do. When should I expect the call? A few days… is that two or three days?
DOCTOR: It should be within two to three business days. So, by Thursday or Friday at the latest. I'll have the nurse give you a card with my contact information in case you have any questions before then. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I'm really worried, but I feel a little bit better knowing we're trying to figure it out. I’ll try to take it easy, and avoid lifting anything heavy. And I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. I understand your worry, and we’ll get to the bottom of this together. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the discharge instructions and prescriptions with you. Get some rest, and try not to stress too much. Take care.
