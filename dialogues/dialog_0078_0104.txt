DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a throat. My throat hurts. Is that all you need to know? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A sore throat can be quite bothersome. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More? Honestly. It just… hurts when I swallow. And it feels scratchy. Like sandpaper. I don't know why you need so much information. Is it contagious? I hope not. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about it being contagious, and wanting to know what’s going on quickly. Asking a few questions helps me rule out different possibilities and make sure we get you the best care. When did the sore throat start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… a few days, I think? Maybe three? It’s hard to say. Things just… blend together, you know? I’ve been… busy. It wasn’t terrible at first, just a little tickle. Now it’s… this. Is that good or bad? I really don't keep track of dates.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Ottaviani, we’ll work with what you remember. A few days is helpful. Has anything made it better or worse since it started?
PATIENT: Worse, definitely worse. Drinking anything cold makes it feel like ice. Hot tea… doesn't help much either, actually. Just makes it… wet. I tried those lozenges, the cherry flavored ones, but they didn’t do anything. They were sticky. And sweet. I don't like sweet things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so cold drinks and hot tea don’t seem to provide relief, and the lozenges weren’t helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I’m just… tired, I suppose. And a little… achy. But I’m always tired and achy. That’s just getting older, isn't it? I haven't felt well since my husband… well, never mind. It's probably just a cold. A nasty one. Is that all there is to it?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel tired and achy, and it certainly could be a cold. Just to be thorough, have you had a fever, cough, runny nose, or any difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Fever? I don’t know. I haven’t checked. I don't own a thermometer. Cough? A little, maybe. Very small. Runny nose… sometimes. Mostly just… stuffy. And no, I can breathe fine. Honestly, Doctor, I think I just need something to make my throat stop hurting. I have errands to run, you know. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. Let’s take a quick look at your throat and listen to your lungs, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't take too long. I’m not fond of… poking and prodding. And make sure your hands are clean. I don't want to catch anything else.
DOCTOR: Of course. I always wash my hands between patients. Please open wide and say "Ah." Okay, Ms. Ottaviani, your throat is quite red, and your tonsils are a little swollen. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. No wheezing or crackles. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don't take anything. I prefer to deal with things myself. My mother always said… well, never mind. No allergies. Definitely not. Just hurry up, please. I really must be going. And honestly, it feels like something is stuck in my throat. Is that normal? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Ottaviani. It's good that you don’t have any known allergies. The sensation of something stuck in your throat can happen with a sore throat, especially if it's inflamed. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it appears you likely have a viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat. However, since you mentioned the feeling of something stuck, and to rule out anything more serious like strep throat or another infection, I’d like to do a quick strep test. It’s a simple swab of the back of your throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? I told you, it’s just a sore throat. A nasty sore throat, perhaps, but just a sore throat. I don't like being fussed over. And I haven’t got time for… tests. I suppose… fine. But be quick about it. And don’t poke too hard.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Ottaviani, and I will be as gentle as possible. It really only takes a moment, and it will help us ensure we're treating you correctly. Okay, just open wide and say "Ah" again. I'm just going to gently swab the back of your throat. It might be a little uncomfortable for a moment. Alright, Ms. Ottaviani, the strep test came back negative. That’s good. So it appears you do not have strep throat. This supports the diagnosis of viral pharyngitis.
PATIENT: Negative? So… what does that mean? Can I finally go? I’ve wasted enough time here. Is it contagious? And what am I supposed to do about the pain? I really don't have the energy for a long explanation, Doctor. Just tell me what I need to know. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ottaviani, you can go. Negative means you don’t have strep throat, which is very good. Viral pharyngitis isn’t usually serious and often resolves on its own within a week or so. It is contagious, so try to avoid close contact with others while you're experiencing symptoms. To manage the pain, I recommend plenty of fluids – warm tea with honey can be soothing, if you can tolerate it. You can also take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, following the dosage instructions on the label. Throat lozenges or sprays can also provide temporary relief. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No. Fluids, pain relievers, lozenges. I can manage. Honestly, Doctor, you’ve explained it enough. I really must be going. I have errands to run, you know. And frankly, I’m starting to feel worse just being here. Is there a bill? And can I get a note for work? I don’t want them thinking I'm… weak.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. The cost for today’s visit is $75. We can process that at the front desk. And yes, I’m happy to write you a note for work explaining that you were seen for a sore throat and advised to rest and take over-the-counter medications. Here you are. And please don’t hesitate to come back if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a week. Get well soon, Ms. Ottaviani. .
