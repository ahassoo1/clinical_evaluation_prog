DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? What did you say? Speak up, young lady. This ear ain't what it used to be from all the noise down in the mine. Something about a… seat?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bigger, a seat. Please, sit down so we can discuss what’s troubling you. I asked what brings you in to see me today. What complaint are you having?
PATIENT: Complaint? I don’t have no complaint! They sent me. The company sent me. Said I gotta get checked 'cause of… the dust. Been workin' in that hole my whole life, you know. Never bothered me before.
DOCTOR: Right. The company sent you for a check-up due to dust exposure. Okay. And are you experiencing anything specific now?
PATIENT: Specific? Like what? You want me to list every ache and pain of an old man? I'm 86 years old! Things hurt. But nothing… new. I breathe, I walk, I eat… mostly. They just want to make sure I ain’t gonna… fall apart on the job, I suppose.
DOCTOR: So, no new cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or wheezing?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Is that like… when you whistle? No, I ain’t whistlin’ none. Look, I told you, I feel alright. A little tired, maybe. Gets harder to lift the heavy stuff, but that’s just age, innit? You askin’ silly questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. "Little tired," you said. And are you having any trouble with your memory lately?
PATIENT: Memory? What kinda question is that? Of course I forget things! I forget what I had for breakfast yesterday! What do you think I am, a computer? It's part of gettin' old, young lady! Don’t go makin' me feel worse than I already do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bigger. Let's see... the company records indicate you've been employed at the mine for over sixty years. Sixty years of dust exposure is… considerable. Have you had any routine medical check-ups during that time?
PATIENT: Sixty-two years, actually. Sixty-two years of honest work. And check-ups? Hmph. They gave us a poke and prod once a year, maybe. Said as long as you could still swing a pick, you were good to go. Didn’t bother with fancy tests or nothin'. Just wanted bodies down there.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, we'll do a more thorough assessment today. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and then I'll want to check your oxygen levels. It’s standard procedure, especially given your occupation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oxygen… levels? You mean like… the air? I breathe air. Always have. What’s wrong with the air? Look, I ain't got all day, you know. I got things to do. But… fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please take a deep breath for me... and exhale slowly. Hmm… I am hearing some… diminished breath sounds, particularly in the lower lobes. And a few scattered crackles. Do you notice any whistling or clicking when you breathe?
PATIENT: Diminished? Crackles? You talkin' in code again, young lady! I hear nothin' but the ache in my bones! Whistlin’? No. Clickin'? Like a clock? No! I told you, I’m alright. Maybe a bit winded after climbin' stairs, but… alright! All this listenin' and pokin' ain't makin' me feel any better, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll also check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. Hmm... 92%. That's a little lower than I’d like, given your age and activity level. And it does support the findings from my lung exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Me? Never touched the stuff! Bad for your lungs, they said. Always been a healthy man, for the most part. Ninety-two… what does that even mean? Lower? Lower than what? You and your numbers…
DOCTOR: 92% means that your blood isn't carrying as much oxygen as it should. It can be normal for some people, but in your case, given your history of dust exposure, it's something we need to investigate further. We’ll do a chest x-ray, just to get a better look at your lungs. Do you have any problems with your kidneys?
PATIENT: Kidneys? What are you gettin' at now? I pee fine! Always have! Look, I don’t like this. X-rays and kidneys… You thinkin’ I’m fallin’ apart? I came here for a check-up, not a… a diagnosis! This is a waste of time, honestly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, the x-ray is a standard precaution. It's not because I think you're "falling apart." It helps us to assess any potential damage from the years of dust exposure. It’s just a picture. And we need to make sure your kidneys are functioning properly before we proceed with any imaging that requires contrast dye. It’s a safety precaution. Have you ever had a reaction to any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I remember. A little painkiller here and there for my back, but nothing fancy. And you keep talkin’ about “dust exposure.” I work with dust! It’s part of the job! Are you tryin' to tell me my job is bad for me? That company been good to me for sixty years!
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I am not saying your job is bad, but prolonged dust exposure can lead to lung problems. That is a well-documented fact. And the x-ray will help us determine if any damage has occurred. We'll also do a quick blood test to check your kidney function. It's a simple procedure. Will you allow me to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Do whatever you gotta do. But don’t go makin’ a fuss over nothin’. I feel alright. Mostly. Just get it over with. But I swear, if you tell me I gotta retire after all these years… I'll… well, I'll complain to someone, that’s what I’ll do!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get started. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. And then we'll head over to radiology for the x-ray. It won’t take long. In the meantime, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never been allergic to nothin’ in my life. Dust, maybe. But that ain’t an allergy, that’s just… life. And speakin' of life, I hope this don't take too long. I got things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: Very well. The phlebotomist should be here any moment. Just relax, and we'll get through this as quickly as possible. .
