DOCTOR: Hi Janeth, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's... well, it's not a real problem, you see. I just thought... a little encouragement would be nice. My daughter, she said I should come get a card from you. A “Get Well” card, she called it. Even though I am well. Mostly. It's just... things. You know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're feeling a bit… down, maybe?
PATIENT: Down? No, no, not down. Just... life is difficult sometimes, isn't it? A card from a doctor feels... official. Like someone important acknowledges it. My daughter, bless her heart, she thinks everything needs a doctor's note. She worries too much. It’s just a little something to show her I’m taking care of myself, you understand?
DOCTOR: Right, I see. So, while you're not experiencing any specific illness… there are things going on that are bothering you. Just to be clear, and for my records, are these things new, or have you been feeling this way for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, for ages. Ages, I tell you. Since my son moved to Australia, mostly. He doesn’t call enough. And my neighbor, she keeps having parties… loud music, all the time. It's just… irritating. It’s not like I need treatment or anything. A card would just… validate it, you know? Make my daughter happy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you're dealing with some loneliness since your son moved, and some stress from the neighbor's parties. Those are definitely valid things to be bothered by. It's good you're recognizing that. Just so I have a full picture, have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Sleep? Oh, I sleep alright. Always have. Maybe I wake up a little earlier than I used to, thinking about the parties, but nothing serious. Appetite is fine too. I cook for my husband every night. He eats everything I make, so I have to keep cooking, don't I? It's not like I'm losing weight or anything. It's just… the principle of the thing! The noise! A card wouldn’t fix the noise, but it would show my daughter I’m thinking about things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know your sleep and appetite are stable. And you're still cooking for your husband, that's wonderful. It sounds like you're very dedicated to your family. Just to rule anything out, have you felt more anxious or sad than usual lately?
PATIENT: Anxious? Well, yes, a little. When the music starts, I get a bit... flustered. It’s just inconsiderate, you know? I try to be understanding, but it's hard when you're trying to watch your stories on television. Sad? Not really sad. More... annoyed. Very annoyed. It’s just… a card from you would make my daughter stop worrying, that’s all. It’s a simple request, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Janeth. It sounds like the noise is causing you significant distress, and you're feeling frustrated and a little lonely. While I can certainly write a note for your daughter, I also want to make sure we address what's bothering you. Sometimes, even small things can impact our well-being. Have you ever considered talking to someone about these feelings?
PATIENT: Talking? Oh, no, no. I don't need talking. I have my daughter. She talks enough for both of us. And my husband, he just says to ignore it. Men, you know? They don't understand these things. I just want the card. A nice card, with flowers maybe. It's not like I need therapy or anything. Just a little acknowledgement that my life is... complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're coping with things in your own way, and you're not looking for a lot of intervention at this time. I'm happy to write a note for your daughter, with flowers, as you requested. Before I do that, though, I just want to quickly check your blood pressure and pulse, just as a routine precaution. It only takes a moment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood pressure? Really? For this? It feels a bit silly, doesn’t it? But alright, if you insist. It’s not like it’s going to change anything. Just get it over with so you can write the card. And make sure it’s a pretty one, please. My daughter likes pink.
DOCTOR: It's just a quick check, as part of a general wellness assessment. It's good to have a baseline. Okay, blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Both within normal limits. Everything looks good, Janeth. I'll go ahead and write that note for your daughter now. Give me just a few moments. Would you like to sit here while I do that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Just sit here. And really, make sure it says something encouraging. Like... "Mother is coping with difficult circumstances and appreciates your concern." Something like that. Not too long, though. My husband will wonder where I am.
DOCTOR: Here you go. I’ve written: “Janeth is proactively addressing some challenges and appreciates her daughter’s support and concern. Wishing her continued strength and wellness.” Is that alright?
PATIENT: "Proactively addressing?" That sounds… clinical. And "challenges?" It makes it sound like I’m fighting a disease! It’s just a noisy neighbor and a missing son! But… alright. It’s better than nothing, I suppose. My daughter will be happy. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I should get home before my husband starts to worry.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janeth. I'm glad I could help, even if it was just with a card. If things do get more difficult, or you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Here’s my card with the clinic's number. Have a good day, and give your husband my best. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Though I doubt I’ll need it. It’s just a phase, I’m sure. A noisy, son-less phase.
