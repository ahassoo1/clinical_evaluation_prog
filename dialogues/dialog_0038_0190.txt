DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well, I’ve been… feeling a bit unsteady, I suppose. Like I’m off balance. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it's become… more noticeable recently. I don’t really… recall exactly when it started, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, “feeling unsteady” and “off balance” – that gives us a starting point. And it’s alright that you don’t have a precise date; we can try to narrow it down. When you say “recently,” can you give me a rough idea – a week, a month, longer?
PATIENT: Hmm… a month, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. It's difficult to say, truly. Things… haven't been very clear lately, if you understand. It feels like it’s been gradually worsening over the last few weeks, though. I just thought it would… pass. But it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common to hope things resolve on their own. “Gradually worsening” is helpful to know. Could you describe what the unsteadiness feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I’m falling, exactly. More like… I have to concentrate to walk straight. And sometimes, even then, I feel like I’m swaying. It’s… disconcerting. Especially at work, you know? It feels like the floor isn’t quite… solid. Does that make sense? I do apologize if I’m not being very clear.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Lilyanna. "Concentrating to walk straight" and "floor isn’t quite solid" – those are good descriptions. It sounds quite unsettling. Just to get a better picture, does anything specific seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Specific… that’s a good question. I hadn’t really thought about it. Um… I think… being tired makes it worse. Definitely. And… if I stand for a long time. At work, mostly. I operate a drill, you see, so I’m on my feet quite a bit. I’m not sure if anything else… Honestly, I mostly just try to avoid situations where I might fall.
DOCTOR: Alright, so tiredness and prolonged standing seem to be triggers. Operating a drill… that’s good information – repetitive movements can sometimes play a role. Let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other symptoms along with the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Symptoms… other than feeling a bit… dizzy sometimes? It’s not a constant dizziness, more like a fleeting feeling. And… I’ve been feeling rather fatigued, even before the unsteadiness started. Just generally… worn down. I don’t recall any… headaches or anything like that. Oh, and my vision… it's been a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, so I just assumed it was my prescription.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fleeting dizziness, general fatigue, and occasional blurry vision—even with glasses. That’s helpful. Let's quickly go through some basic questions. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: To my knowledge, no. I haven't had any… adverse reactions to anything. I don't take any regular medication, either. Just… occasional pain relievers for a sore back, from work. But nothing consistent. I apologize if this is… a slow process. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lilyanna. It's important to take our time and get a full picture. "No known allergies, no regular medication" – good to know. Now, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My husband… he handled all of that. I… I’m afraid I don’t recall much. I was generally healthy, I think. No major illnesses or surgeries… I believe. I had the usual childhood vaccinations, but beyond that… I’m terribly sorry. It’s all rather… hazy. I did lose my husband last year, and things have been… unsettled since then. Perhaps that’s affecting my memory?
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s perfectly normal for things to feel unsettled and for memory to be affected by stress and grief. We'll take things slowly. Alright, so we’ll note “generally healthy, no major illnesses or surgeries to her knowledge.” What about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… um… my mother had some… issues with her heart, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. But beyond that… I'm afraid I don't recall much about either of their medical backgrounds. My husband always took care of those sorts of things. I'm truly sorry for not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mother with heart issues, father with diabetes. That's useful information. No need to apologize, Lilyanna, you're doing fine. Now, before we move on, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. And I… rarely drink. Perhaps a glass of wine on a special occasion, but nothing regular. I prefer tea, if I’m honest. It’s rather calming. And I… try to eat a healthy diet, although it’s been difficult lately. I haven’t been very hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, rare alcohol consumption, prefers tea, and has been experiencing a decreased appetite. Thank you. Alright, Lilyanna. I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I just… hope it won't take too long. Work is… demanding, you see. But I understand you need to do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Okay, Lilyanna, could you stand for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly. Is this… alright? It feels a little… precarious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna. Just close your eyes for a moment, if you can. That’s good. I’m going to gently push you slightly off balance to check your reflexes. It’s nothing to worry about, just let me know if you feel uncomfortable. Okay, now, could you walk a few steps forward, and then a few steps backward, please?
PATIENT: This… isn’t easy. I feel rather unsteady, even with my eyes open. It’s like… the floor is moving. I apologize for walking so slowly. I’m trying to… concentrate.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. You're doing fine. It’s good that you're letting me know how you're feeling. Okay, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Alright, everything sounds clear. I’m going to check your reflexes now. Okay, and finally, I'm just going to test your sensation in your hands and feet. Can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Certainly. Yes, I can feel that. And… yes, I can feel that too. Everything seems… normal, I suppose. Although I do feel rather… tired after all of this. Is something wrong, Doctor? I apologize if I’m being… demanding. I just… want to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: You're not being demanding at all, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly natural to want to know what’s happening. Okay, Lilyanna. Based on the examination, you have some mild ataxia – that’s difficulty with coordination – and a slightly unsteady gait. Your reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. You also reported fatigue, dizziness, and blurry vision. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. It could be related to a vitamin deficiency, a problem with your inner ear, or potentially something neurological. Because of the recent loss of your husband, and your report of feeling "hazy," we should also consider the possibility of stress and its effects. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and other underlying conditions. I also think it would be helpful to do a basic neurological assessment, potentially an MRI of the brain, to rule out anything more serious. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds sensible. Blood tests and a scan… whatever you think is necessary. I just want to… understand what’s happening. I'm… relieved you’re taking this seriously. The… haziness has been quite concerning. And the unsteadiness is making it difficult to work. An MRI… is that… painful? I apologize if that's a silly question. I’m not very good with medical procedures.
DOCTOR: You're not silly at all, Lilyanna. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about medical procedures. An MRI isn't painful. You lie inside a large machine, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It’s a little loud, so we’ll give you earplugs. You just need to lie still for about 30-40 minutes. Before we proceed with the tests, I'd also like to ask a few more questions about your current medications, any recent illnesses, and any changes in your diet. And finally, would you be comfortable with me contacting your primary care physician to discuss these findings and coordinate your care?
PATIENT: That… sounds manageable. Not painful, and just lying still… yes, I can do that. And yes, please, contact my primary care physician. I believe her name is Dr. Ramirez. She’s… quite good. I’m afraid I don't remember much beyond that. As for medications… I haven’t taken anything regularly. Just pain relievers for my back, occasionally. And I haven't been ill recently, although I haven’t been feeling… well, for quite some time now. My diet… has been poor. I haven’t had much of an appetite. I apologize for not being more helpful. I truly am trying to recall everything accurately. It's just… difficult.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lilyanna. You're doing wonderfully. It's perfectly alright that you don’t remember everything. We'll get all the information we need. Alright. So, no regular medications, no recent illnesses, and a poor appetite. Okay, Lilyanna. I'm going to order the blood tests and schedule the MRI for you. I'll also contact Dr. Ramirez to discuss your case. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on getting enough rest and trying to eat small, nutritious meals, even if you don't have much of an appetite. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Auelua. You’ve been very… kind, and patient. I feel… slightly more reassured, knowing we’re taking steps to find out what’s happening. I appreciate your time, and your understanding. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
