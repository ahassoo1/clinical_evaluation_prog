DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Sham. It says here you’re 41 years old. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that is correct. I’m here because… well, I’ve gained weight, and I don’t understand why. It’s been… concerning, to be honest. It’s not like I’ve changed anything in my diet or exercise, and it just keeps going up.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weight gain… and it’s been gradual, despite no changes in your routine. Right. Can you tell me how much weight you’ve gained, approximately?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started maybe six months ago, a little at a time. At first, I didn’t pay much attention. But now… I believe it’s around twenty pounds, perhaps a little more. I weigh myself every week, religiously, and it just… continues. It’s quite distressing, truly.
DOCTOR: Twenty pounds in six months... alright. And have you noticed any other changes along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. I feel… more tired than usual, yes. And a little breathless when I’m doing things, like climbing the stairs. Nothing severe, but noticeable. My husband has mentioned I seem a bit more… sluggish, I believe was the word he used. And I do feel colder more easily than I used to.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, breathlessness, feeling cold… okay. Ms. Selbitschka, do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain. Not at all. Just… this tiredness and the weight. It's not a comfortable feeling, but it isn't painful, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right, no pain. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, my appetite hasn’t changed. I eat the same things, the same amounts. I haven’t been indulging in anything extra, I assure you. It’s very perplexing. I really haven’t altered my routine at all, and that's what worries me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And before this started six months ago, would you say your weight was stable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly stable. For years, actually. Perhaps a pound or two here or there, which is normal, I think. But nothing like this. It was consistent, I knew what to expect. Then, suddenly, this. It's unsettling, truly. It's just… not normal for me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Before we go any further, I need to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – thyroid problems, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything. I have regular check-ups with my family doctor, but he’s always said I was in good health. It’s why this is so confusing, really.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I’ve been fortunate to avoid needing any surgeries. Nothing at all. Just the usual childhood vaccinations, of course. And a wisdom tooth removed when I was younger, but that was many years ago, and it was quite straightforward. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Any family history of, say, thyroid problems, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My mother… she had diabetes, later in life. She was diagnosed when she was around seventy, I believe. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had heart problems. He had a heart attack when he was in his sixties. Aside from that… no, not that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medication if I can. Just a multivitamin occasionally, but I haven’t taken one in months, actually. I try to eat a healthy diet and get enough rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Not to food, or medications, or anything like that. I really don't have any medical issues, which is what makes this all so strange. It’s truly worrisome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and take your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, proceed. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary to figure out what’s going on. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal, no swelling. I’m noting some mild peripheral edema in your ankles. Do you experience any swelling in your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, actually. Now that you mention it… I have noticed my ankles feel a little puffy, especially at the end of the day. I hadn't thought much of it, just assumed it was from standing too long. It’s not severe, but it's definitely noticeable. I thought it was just fatigue, honestly. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Okay, the ankle swelling is relevant. Given your weight gain, fatigue, elevated blood pressure, and the ankle edema… I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Also, a urine analysis. That will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. We'll also want to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. I'm going to order an EKG. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed with all of those tests. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your judgment completely. An EKG and the blood tests… whatever is necessary to understand what’s causing this. Is there anything else you need from me right now? I’m just eager to find out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, I've ordered those tests. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw blood and collect a urine sample. The EKG will be done right here in the office. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available – usually within a day or two. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds excellent. A follow-up appointment to discuss the results is perfect. I am very grateful for your thoroughness. Please let me know when you have availability. I’m flexible and can adjust my schedule. And thank you again for taking my concerns so seriously. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that follow-up for you. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath that gets worse, or significant swelling, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand completely. Chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, or significant swelling… go to the emergency room. I will keep that in mind. Thank you for reiterating that. I feel a little better knowing we are taking these precautions. Is there anything else I need to be aware of before I go to the lab for the tests? I don't want to miss anything important.
DOCTOR: No, I think that covers everything for now. Just try to relax, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. The lab technician will give you specific instructions for the urine sample. It's just a standard test. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are back. We’ll figure this out, Ms. Selbitschka. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your reassurance. I’ll head to the lab now. Have a good day.
