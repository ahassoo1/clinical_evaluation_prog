DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Arbin. Well, it's… it's about the sun, really. I've been getting really bothered by it lately. My eyes, mostly, but my skin too. Feels like everything's just too bright, even on cloudy days. It’s been happening for a few months now, and it’s getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin. A few months, getting progressively worse… and it’s affecting both your eyes and your skin?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. My eyes feel like they’re burning, and I get headaches after being outside, even for a short time. And my skin… it feels sensitive, like a sunburn even when I'm wearing sunscreen. It's a bit strange, because I haven't changed anything about my routine. I always wear a hat and good shades when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Headaches with sun exposure, and skin sensitivity despite sun protection… Have you noticed any changes in your vision – blurriness, halos around lights, difficulty adjusting to darkness?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I hadn’t really thought about it specifically. Let me see… I think my vision is a little blurry sometimes, especially after being in the sun. And maybe… yeah, now that you mention it, lights do seem to have a bit of a… glow around them at night. It’s not a huge thing, but it's definitely there. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and halos around lights are important details. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold, the flu, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a little sniffle back in March, but that was it. Nothing serious. Just a regular cold, and it cleared up pretty quickly. Nothing since then, I promise. I try to stay healthy. Being sick isn’t fun, especially not now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just Medicare covers me, if that’s what you mean. I don’t take any regular pills, not unless I’m really sick with a fever. And allergies… hmm. I used to be allergic to pollen as a kid, but I haven't had a problem with that in years. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything currently.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or known allergies. Let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Have any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any eye problems, skin conditions, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: That's a tough one, Doctor. My wife… she passed away a few years back, and I wasn’t really close to her family. And my parents… they both passed when I was young, really young. I didn't get to know them well enough to remember much about their health, I'm sorry to say. I did have an uncle, on my mother's side, who had really bad skin issues, always in the hospital for it, but I don't know exactly what it was. It wasn't contagious, I know that much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. Limited family history, but a note of skin issues with your uncle. Now, how about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean exactly, Doctor? I work as a dental assistant, if that’s what you’re asking. I live alone, quiet life, really. Not much to tell, I’m afraid. Do you need to know if I smoke or something? Because I definitely don't.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Just trying to get a full picture. No smoking, that’s good. Just wanted to know about your general lifestyle. Okay, Arbin, this is starting to paint a picture. Before we do a quick exam, let me ask one more question. Have you noticed any rashes, blisters, or any other changes on your skin besides the sensitivity to the sun?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really rashes, no. But… sometimes my skin feels really dry and flaky, especially on my face and hands. And I’ve noticed a few small, reddish bumps, mostly on my arms. They don't itch or anything, they’re just… there. I thought it was just from the dry weather, honestly. We had a pretty warm summer already.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry, flaky skin and small bumps. Alright, Arbin, let's take a look at your skin and eyes. It will be a quick exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Could you please sit up and face me, and I’ll start with your eyes?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me adjust my glasses again… Go ahead, whenever you’re ready. I'll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking straight ahead… and now follow my finger… Good. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Some mild injection of the conjunctiva, but nothing alarming. Now, let me take a look at your skin. Skin is dry, as you mentioned. The bumps feel slightly raised, but not painful. No obvious blistering or signs of infection. Alright, Arbin. I'm going to take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'm glad it doesn't seem too bad. I was worried it was something serious. My wife… she always worried about my health. I try to stay positive, but it’s hard sometimes. Just let me know if you need anything, Doctor. Blood pressure is fine, right? I always get nervous when doctors take that thing.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130 over 80, perfectly within a normal range. You're right to be aware of it, but no cause for concern. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve seen during the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing photosensitivity, possibly combined with a mild dermatitis. Basically, your skin is becoming overly sensitive to the sun, and that’s causing the discomfort and skin reactions. The blurry vision and halos could be related, or a separate issue we need to investigate further. It's difficult to say for sure at this stage. I want to run a few tests to confirm this, and rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay, photosensitivity… that makes sense. I guess I've been spending a lot more time outside gardening this year. Tests sound good, Doctor. Definitely. I want to know what’s going on, for sure. What kind of tests are we talking about? And… is it something I should be really worried about? I always get anxious with medical things.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. We'll start with a basic blood test to check for any underlying inflammatory conditions and to rule out things like lupus or other autoimmune disorders. We can also do a skin biopsy if the rash doesn't improve to better understand what's causing it. These are just precautionary measures, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, blood test and maybe a skin biopsy… precautionary measures. That sounds… better. Lupus… that sounds scary. But if it’s just to be safe, then alright. So, what do I need to do about the tests? Do I need to make another appointment? And can you give me something for the sensitivity in the meantime? It’s really bothering me when I’m outside, even with a hat and glasses.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m going to order the blood test for you now. You can go to the lab across the street, they're open until 5pm. And yes, while we wait for the results, I can recommend a topical steroid cream to help with the skin sensitivity. It’s a mild strength, and should provide some relief. I'll also recommend a high SPF, broad-spectrum sunscreen, and of course, continue wearing a hat and sunglasses. We’ll review the blood test results in a week, and if the rash isn’t improving, we’ll discuss the skin biopsy. Here’s the lab requisition, and the prescription for the cream. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, lab across the street, cream for the skin… got it. A week for the results. That feels like a long time, but alright. Will the lab call me when the results are ready? Or do I need to call them? And is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Like, foods to avoid, or anything? I just want to make sure I’m doing everything right.
DOCTOR: The lab will call you with the results, usually within three to five business days. No specific dietary restrictions are needed at this point. Just continue to protect your skin from the sun and use the cream as directed. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – significant blistering, fever, or increased pain – please contact the clinic immediately. Also, if the rash spreads to other areas of your body, let me know right away. Otherwise, let’s see how the cream and sun protection work for you, and we'll revisit this in a week. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Lab calls me, protect my skin, watch for worsening symptoms… got it. You've explained everything really clearly, I appreciate it. Thank you for your time. I think that's all my questions. I’ll go get the blood work done now, and pick up the cream on my way home.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, it’s always best to err on the side of caution. Take care, and have a good day. .
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will. Thank you again. You have a good day too. .
