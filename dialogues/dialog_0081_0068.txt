DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… the swelling. After the cancer treatments, you see. It’s in my… legs, mostly. And sometimes my arms. It’s not painful, exactly, just… puffy. It's been getting worse lately, and I thought I should get it checked.
DOCTOR: Right. Swelling after cancer treatments… a common enough issue, unfortunately. Let’s get a bit more detail. You mentioned legs and arms. Is it symmetrical – meaning, is it the same on both sides?
PATIENT: Hmm… symmetrical? Let me think. I think… yes. Pretty much the same. Both legs are puffy, and both arms… though maybe my left arm is a tiny bit more swollen than the right, but not much. It’s hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, generally symmetrical. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It started… right after I finished the treatments, I think. So, maybe six months? Seven? Time… it just goes by so fast these days. It wasn't bad at first, just a little puffiness. But like I said, it’s been getting worse the last few weeks.
DOCTOR: Six to seven months post-treatment, gradually worsening. And could you describe the swelling a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… it's not like a hard swelling, you know? It's soft. If I press on it, there's a little dent. And it feels… warm, sometimes. Not hot, just… warmer than the rest of my skin. And it gets worse when I stand for a long time. That's when I really notice it.
DOCTOR: Okay, soft, pitting edema, warmer to the touch, exacerbated by prolonged standing. Have you noticed any changes in the color or texture of your skin in those areas?
PATIENT: Pitting… is that the dent? Yes, that's what it is! Um… color? Not really. Maybe a little bit red sometimes, but I put lotion on, so I don't know if that's the lotion or… No, I don't think the color has changed much. The skin… feels normal, I guess. Maybe a little tighter, when it’s swollen.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant change in skin color, perhaps some tightness associated with the swelling. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, fatigue, or changes in your urine output?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… no, not really. I get a little winded walking uphill, but I always have. Fatigue, yes. But I'm 59! I’m always tired, to be honest. And… urine? I go to the bathroom like normal, I think. No, I haven't noticed anything different with that.
DOCTOR: Okay. No new shortness of breath or changes in urine output. Fatigue, attributed to age. Now, let's go over your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides cancer, and what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just the cancer, really. I had… breast cancer. They did the surgery and the… the radiation. And I take… a little pill for my blood pressure. Losartan, I think it’s called. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take something for that, but not very often. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Breast cancer treated with surgery and radiation, Losartan for hypertension, and occasional sleep aid. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve taken lots of pills in my life, and never had a reaction. I think I would remember if I was allergic to something!
DOCTOR: Alright. No known drug allergies. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Just let me… get comfortable here. It’s a little hard, this table.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Let's start with your legs. I'm going to palpate them to assess the swelling and check for any tenderness. Then I will listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax as much as you can. Hmm… yes, there is significant pitting edema bilaterally, up to the mid-calf. And no significant tenderness. Heart sounds are regular, slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally, but no wheezes or crackles. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally, though slightly diminished. Skin is warm and dry. Capillary refill is within normal limits.
PATIENT: Okay… It doesn’t hurt, Doctor, just… feels funny. You’re poking around a lot. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard exam, Ms. Queener. I'm simply gathering information. The diminished breath sounds are likely related to your age and build, and the edema… well, it's consistent with lymphedema secondary to your cancer treatment. However, to rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order some blood work. A complete metabolic panel, a CBC, and a BNP to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out heart failure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… lymp-eh-what? Secondary to… the cancer? So it is the cancer? I thought so. But… heart failure? I don’t have heart problems! Blood work… yes, okay. If you think it’s necessary. But… will it take long? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Lymphedema is swelling caused by a buildup of fluid due to damage to your lymphatic system, often a side effect of cancer treatment. It’s likely related to your history, Ms. Queener, but we must rule out other possibilities. The BNP test is a simple blood test to assess your heart function. It will take approximately fifteen minutes to draw the blood, and the results usually come back within a day or two. I'll have the lab draw it before you leave. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible and wearing compression stockings. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Compression stockings? Like… the tight ones? I don’t like those. They always feel so… constricting. Will the blood work tell me for sure if it's just the cancer, or if something else is wrong? And… is there anything else I can do besides the stockings? I just want to get this fixed, you know? This puffiness is… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Yes, compression stockings. They are uncomfortable, I understand, but they are crucial for managing lymphedema. They help improve fluid drainage. As for the blood work, it will help us determine the cause. It won't give us a definitive answer, but it will rule out other possibilities, such as kidney problems or heart failure. There’s also physical therapy, which can be quite helpful in reducing swelling. I can write a referral for that if you’re interested. And, frankly, Ms. Queener, managing chronic conditions requires patience and adherence to treatment. There isn’t a quick fix.
PATIENT: Physical therapy… okay. Alright, write me a referral. And… the blood work. Just… let’s get it over with. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is the referral for physical therapy and the lab order. The lab is just down the hall. They will take care of you there. Please schedule an appointment with the physical therapist as soon as possible. And I will review the blood work results when they come back. Do you have any other concerns at this time, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I’ll go get the blood work done now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Queener. And remember to follow the instructions regarding the compression stockings.
PATIENT: .
