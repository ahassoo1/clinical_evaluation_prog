DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello. The… the paper said I need this check-up before the insurance starts. Is that correct? I do not understand all the forms, honestly. It is for Medicare, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… a common reason for a visit with new Medicare patients. It’s just a standard overview to make sure we have everything documented correctly before coverage begins. It’s mostly just going through your medical history, some basic questions, and a quick physical exam. Don't worry, we'll take it slow. So, to start, can you just confirm your date of birth for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… August 12, 1997. Is that how you write it? I always get confused with the month and day. My mother always did it differently. It is… a long story.
DOCTOR: Right. August 12, 1997. Okay. And you’re Kiwane Barban, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is my name. Barban. With two ‘b’s. People always forget one. It is… a family name. From Yemen, originally. A good name, I think. Very strong.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We'll make sure it's correct here. Now, Mr. Barban, I'm going to ask you some questions about your overall health. Have you been seeing a primary care doctor regularly?
PATIENT: No. Not… regularly. I work at the… the food place. Long hours. Not much time for doctors. When something is very wrong, I go. Otherwise… no. Is that bad? It has not been a problem, usually. Just… tiredness, sometimes. But that is the job.
DOCTOR: “Well, preventative care is important, even when you feel okay. It's good to get a baseline established. Okay. So, aside from the tiredness from work, are you experiencing any other symptoms currently?
PATIENT: No. Nothing… important. My back aches a little, sometimes. Lifting the boxes, you know? And… my stomach feels strange after I eat. Not painful, just… unsettled. But I eat quickly. Always. It is a bad habit. My grandmother… she always told me to eat slower. But I do not have time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Back pain and occasional stomach upset. How long have you been experiencing these issues?
PATIENT: The back… maybe six months. It comes and goes. The stomach, not so long. A few weeks, perhaps? Since the weather got warmer, maybe? I do not know. It is hard to say. It is not… a serious problem. Just… things. Everyone has things.
DOCTOR: “Right. Well, to get a better picture, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I have never been sick, really. Maybe a cold, sometimes. Nothing serious. My mother, she had… problems with her heart, later in life. But I do not have that. I am strong. I work very hard. Does that count for something?
DOCTOR: “Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I broke my arm when I was a small boy, climbing a tree. But it healed quickly. My cousin fixed it, he knew… bones. Not a proper doctor, but he was very good with hands. It is a family thing. No hospital. No surgeries. I avoid those places, if possible. They are… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I drink… tea, sometimes. For the tiredness. But that is not a medicine. My mother always said tea is good for everything. Not a proper treatment, of course. Just… comforting. No pills. No potions. I prefer to… endure. Is that foolish?
DOCTOR: “Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing that I know of. I eat… everything. My mother made me try all sorts of things when I was young. Spices, fruits… very strange things, sometimes. I have a strong stomach. Not sensitive. No reactions. Never. Unless… the dust at the factory. Makes me cough. But that is not an allergy, is it? Just… dust.
DOCTOR: “Okay. And finally, before we move to a quick physical exam, I'm going to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes. My mother… her heart, like I said. She had… trouble breathing, later in life. And my grandfather, on my father’s side… he had problems with his sugar. Always drinking sweet tea, he was. But that is just… a family habit. Not very healthy. And… my aunt, she had… something with her stomach. But I do not remember what. It was a long time ago. Does that help? It is hard to keep track of all of these things.
DOCTOR: “Alright. Well, that gives me a general idea. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Fine. Whatever you need. Quickly, if possible. I have work later. But yes. Go ahead. I trust you. Just… be gentle with my back, please. It aches sometimes, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please sit up on the examination table and lean forward slightly, I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Blood pressure next. 130 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Let me check your throat now. Say 'ah'. Throat looks clear. Now, ears… Ears are also clear. Now, let me just palpate your abdomen. This will help me check for any tenderness. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No. Not particularly. Just… normal stomach feelings. Like after I eat quickly. A little… unsettled. But not painful. Is that what you mean by tenderness? It is just… the food. Always. Yes, right here… feels a little… bubbly. Like the tea. Not serious, I assure you. I am a strong man. I endure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about on this side?
PATIENT: No. Still… normal. Like after a large meal. A little uncomfortable, perhaps. But not pain. It is… a sensation. A feeling. My mother always said you need to listen to your stomach. It tells you things. This is what it is telling me. It wants slower eating. It is… a message. Perhaps I should try it. But there is no time. It is… complicated. Are you finding something wrong? It is just my stomach, I promise. It has always been like this.
DOCTOR: "Alright. Well, based on this brief exam, there's no immediate cause for alarm, but your blood pressure is slightly elevated and you are describing some chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. It is important to investigate these further. I recommend we do some blood work to get a baseline and rule out any underlying issues. We should also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and potentially consider a referral to a gastroenterologist." "Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Blood work? A gastroenterologist? That sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. Is it really necessary? I feel fine. Mostly. Just… tired, sometimes. And my stomach… it is always like this. Maybe I should just eat slower, like my mother said. Would that solve it? I do not want to spend money on things I do not need. And I do not have time for… specialists. Is there anything else I should be worried about? Perhaps just the blood work, then? The minimum?
DOCTOR: “Well, I understand your concerns, but preventative care is important. The blood work will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help rule out any serious underlying issues. We can start with a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. As for the gastroenterologist, that's just a precaution. If the blood work is normal, we can reassess the need for a referral. Eating slower is a good first step, but it doesn’t always address the underlying cause of chronic symptoms.” “We can order the blood work today. It shouldn’t take long, and the results will be available in a few days. Then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. The blood work… that is acceptable. The minimum, please. No specialists, unless absolutely necessary. And quickly, if possible. I have work, you see. It is… demanding. And… is it expensive? My insurance… Medicare, it covers things, yes? I do not want any surprises. Just the blood work, then. And a quick follow-up. When can I schedule that?
DOCTOR: “Okay. I’ll order the basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. Medicare should cover the majority of the cost, but there may be a small co-pay. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood before you leave. As for the follow-up, the earliest available appointment is August 19th at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: August 19th… Yes, that should be fine. As long as it does not take too long. I have commitments, you see. Work… things. And… is there anything else I need to do? Any preparation for the blood work? I do not want to make mistakes. Just… tell me what to do. And then I can go. I appreciate your help. Just… quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: “No preparation is needed for the blood work. Just don't eat anything for eight hours beforehand, and drink plenty of water. The lab is just down the hall on your left. They'll take care of everything. I'll see you on August 19th at 2:00 PM to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I think that is all. Eight hours… no food. Water. Yes. I can remember that. Thank you… for your time. And… the blood work. Just… quickly, if possible. .
DOCTOR: “Alright. Have a good day.” .
