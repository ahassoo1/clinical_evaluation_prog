DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think? Someone said I needed to come in for a… a check, a substance check. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Medicare sent something, and then someone at the place I work mentioned it, so… here I am. Do you know what I'm talking about?
DOCTOR: A substance check… right. Medicare often sends out notices for preventative screenings. And your workplace… was that related to a specific job requirement, perhaps?
PATIENT: A job requirement… maybe? I operate the paving equipment, you know, the big rollers and stuff. It’s… a lot of responsibility, making sure the roads are smooth. I think they said something about safety, making sure everyone is… alert. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I don't really remember signing anything specific, though. Does that make sense? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Okay, paving equipment operator, safety checks… that does give me a little more context. It sounds like this could be a drug screening, potentially mandated by your employer and facilitated through Medicare. Do you use any substances – prescription or otherwise – regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I take something for my arthritis, a little pill. Yellow, I think? And sometimes, when it really flares up, the doctor gives me something stronger. But that’s not… regular, you know? Just when I need it. Other than that… no, not really. I don’t smoke, and I haven’t had a drink in… well, a very long time. My husband… he liked a little wine with dinner, but that was years ago. Does that help? I’m just trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis medication… yellow pill, stronger medication as needed. That’s good to know. And no smoking or recent alcohol use. Do you recall the name of the arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's the tricky part. It’s… starts with an ‘M’, I think. Maybe ‘Meloxicam’? Or something close to that. I get them filled at the pharmacy down the street, and they just hand me the bag. I don’t always pay attention to the labels, I just take them with my breakfast. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Meloxicam… okay, that’s a common one for arthritis. We’ll confirm that in your record. And yes, memory can be… unreliable sometimes. Just trying to get a full picture here. Now, aside from the arthritis, are you experiencing any other symptoms or health concerns?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t these days? And my knees, of course, they ache. But that's just the arthritis, I suppose. Oh! And sometimes I get a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. But that doesn’t happen often. Is that something I should be worried about? I don’t want to bother you with things that aren’t important.
DOCTOR: No, it's not bothering me at all, Ms. Hughston. That's what I'm here for. Dizziness upon standing – that's called orthostatic hypotension, and it can be related to medications, dehydration, or other underlying issues. Fatigue as well… let’s check your blood pressure and heart rate, and then maybe a quick check of your ears and balance. Just routine, to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible. Yes, please. I trust your judgement, Doctor. My ears are usually fine, but my balance… well, sometimes I feel a little wobbly. I don't want to fall, especially not at work. It's a long way down from that equipment! So, if you think it’s a good idea, I'm happy to let you check.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you could just have a seat here on the table, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Then we'll take a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and a brief look in your ears. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood pressure, you said? That’s good. I try to watch my salt, but sometimes I sneak a little potato chip. Don't tell anyone!
DOCTOR: My lips are sealed, Ms. Hughston. A little potato chip now and then won't hurt. Now, just relax your arm for me… good. 142 over 88… a bit elevated. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Ears… mild cerumen buildup, but nothing significant. Now, could you stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: There we go… a little dizzy, but okay. Oh dear, I do feel a bit lightheaded. It’s probably just getting old. Is my blood pressure always this high? I don't usually go to the doctor, so I don’t really know.
DOCTOR: Whoa there, easy does it. Yes, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and that dizziness when standing confirms some orthostatic hypotension. We'll want to monitor that. Now, concerning this substance check… do you recall if your workplace mentioned a specific type of screening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I really wish I could remember. They just said it was a safety thing. Something about making sure everyone is… clear-headed, I think? It’s all very vague. I operate the paving equipment, you know, and it’s… important to be focused. Maybe it’s a urine test? I don't know. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, safety check, focus… That sounds like a standard drug screening, likely urine-based. We can certainly get that done here today. It's a routine procedure, and we'll send the results to your employer. Now, before we proceed, are you currently taking any over-the-counter medications or supplements – even vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh! Vitamins, yes! I take a multivitamin, and sometimes, when my knees are really bad, I take glucosamine and chondroitin. I think that’s what it’s called. The little orange bottle. I got it at the drugstore. Does that matter? I’m trying so hard to remember everything. I don't want to miss anything.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't matter at all, Ms. Hughston. It’s good you’re telling me. Some supplements can interfere with certain tests, so it’s important to know. Okay, so we have your arthritis medication, multivitamins, glucosamine and chondroitin… and the potential drug screening. We'll get the urine sample now, and then we can discuss managing your blood pressure and the dizziness. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. A little overwhelming, but good. The urine sample first, then talk about the dizzy spells… yes. Where do I go for the urine sample? Is it a complicated process? I hope I don't mess it up.
DOCTOR: The restroom is just down the hall to your right. There’s a collection cup and instructions inside. It's not complicated at all – just a standard sample. We’ll provide you with a private room and everything you need. I'll have the nurse come in and help you with that once you’re ready. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. A private room… good. Thank you, Doctor. I think I can manage. Just down the hall, you said? I hope I don’t get lost.
DOCTOR: Yes, just down the hall to your right. I’ll have the nurse meet you there. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Alright. 51-year-old female, paving equipment operator… elevated blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension, potential drug screening… and a little forgetful, it seems. Let’s see what the records say… .
