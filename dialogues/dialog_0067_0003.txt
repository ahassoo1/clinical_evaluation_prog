DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, to start us off, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, doc, I haven't got all day. It's this…shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happenin’ for a bit now, and it’s gettin’ worse. Honestly, it’s embarrassing. Makes it hard to eat, you know? Not a good look.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It’s definitely frustrating when something interferes with daily activities like eating, and it's completely reasonable to want to get it checked out. It's good you came in. So, this shaking… when did you first notice it starting?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t rightly remember. A while back. Months, probably. Everything’s a blur these days, you know how it is. Old age, I suppose. It wasn't bad at first, just a little tremor. Now… well, now it's noticeable. Don’t ask me when exactly it started, I haven’t the foggiest. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Baide. It’s common for things to be a little hazy when remembering things from a while back. Months, gradually worsening – that’s helpful. Does it happen all the time, or are there certain things that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Certain things? Hmm… I suppose when I’m… tryin’ to do somethin’ precise. Like… cuttin’ my meat. Or buttonin’ my shirt. Anything that requires a steady hand, really. It’s not constant, thank goodness. When I'm just sittin' here, relaxin', it's usually alright. But try and hold a glass… forget about it. A real mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more pronounced with activities that require fine motor skills and is less noticeable at rest. Have you noticed if anything improves it?
PATIENT: Improves it? Now there's a question. Let me think... Honestly, nothin' really. Maybe... if I really concentrate. But that's not exactly a solution, is it? It's exhausting just tryin' to keep it steady. It’s more somethin' that gets worse as the day goes on, if I push myself too much. A little nap sometimes helps, but… well, I’m an old man. Naps are usually on the agenda anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it does worsen with use and concentration, and rest offers some temporary relief. Now, I’m going to ask some broader questions, just to get a good overall picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? Like… besides this blasted hand? No, not really. I get tired, obviously. I’m eighty years old, doc. I get tired existing. But beyond that… no. No aches, no pains, no dizziness… Nothing that sticks out, anyway. Honestly, it’s just this tremblin’ that bothers me. Makes me look like a fool.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other accompanying symptoms that you’ve noticed. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant medical problems… Oh, boy. Where do I begin? I had my appendix out when I was a kid. Broken a bone or two in my day, mostly when I was younger, bein’ a… a bit of a rascal. And… my wife, bless her soul, she was sick for a long time. But me? Not much. High blood pressure, the doctor told me once. But I don’t remember takin’ any pills for it. It didn't seem that serious. I’m sure I've forgotten half of it, though. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Appendix removal, some broken bones, and a history of high blood pressure. We can look into the high blood pressure records if you’d like. Did you have any surgeries besides your appendix out?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. No, not that I recall. Maybe somethin’ on my knee, a long time ago, but honestly it was so long ago, and it was such a simple thing… I really don't remember. Honestly, doc, I barely remember what I had for breakfast. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Baide. It's perfectly fine if you don't remember specifics. I’m just trying to build a complete picture. We can skip that for now if it's causing too much strain on your memory. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. No, doc. Nothin'. I told you, I don't remember takin’ anything for my blood pressure. I occasionally take a little somethin' for… indigestion, when I eat somethin' heavy. But that’s it. No fancy pills, no vitamins… I tried one of those multivitamins once, made me feel awful. Never again. A little glass of wine with dinner is about as medicinal as I get.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just an occasional antacid and a glass of wine with dinner. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, travelled all over… I think I would’ve known if I had an allergy by now. Honestly, I’m more allergic to foolish questions than anything else. Are we almost done here?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. Just a few more questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam, if you’re agreeable. Now, briefly, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, lord. Where do I start? My mother lived to be ninety, a tough old bird she was. My father… died when I was young, heart problems. I had a brother, but he… he wasn't a healthy man. Always sickly. Lots of relatives, aunts, uncles… They all just… lived their lives. Nobody famous, nobody with any special ailments that I remember. Honestly, doc, it’s all a bit of a blur. Is this going to help me with my hand, or are we just reminiscing here?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Baide. I appreciate you sharing what you remember. Knowing about a family history of heart problems is helpful. One final question, if you don't mind. Could you briefly tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What in the world is that supposed to mean? Look, I worked hard my whole life. Was a producer, director… made some pictures people enjoyed. Married for… well, a long time, until my wife passed. Lived in the city most of my life, now I’m retired. Enjoy a good meal, a little wine, and try to keep out of trouble. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, doc, I'm gettin' tired. Can we just look at my hand now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Baide, that’s exactly what I wanted to know. You've lived a full life, it sounds like. Alright, let's take a look at your hand. Would you mind extending your arms in front of you, with your palms open?
PATIENT: Finally! Yes, yes, go ahead. Just hurry up, will ya? It’s not exactly comfortable holdin' my arms out like this. It’s gettin' heavier by the second. See? It's shakin' already. Are you writin' all this down? Don’t need a novel written about my tremblin' hand. Let’s just fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide. I see a tremor present in both hands, a bit more noticeable on the right. I also checked your balance and how easily you move, and everything seems… reasonably normal for someone your age. But the tremor is definitely there, and it is more pronounced when you try to do something specific, as you mentioned. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your reflexes, just to get a more complete picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine, do what you have to do. Just… don’t poke around too much. I'm not as young as I used to be. And please, be quick about it. Is this going to lead to a diagnosis or not? I haven’t got all day, you know. All this prodding and poking is just… unnecessary, frankly. Just tell me what’s wrong with my hand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Everything sounds normal with your heart and lungs, and your reflexes are as expected. Based on your history and the physical exam, the most likely explanation for your hand tremor is what we call essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that causes rhythmic shaking, often of the hands, and it can worsen with age and activity. It’s not usually associated with any other serious underlying medical problems. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes, such as medication side effects, hyperthyroidism, or Parkinson’s disease.
PATIENT: Essential tremor? What in the world is that? Sounds fancy. And you're telling me this is just… something old people get? So you’re not gonna give me a pill to fix it? Just tell me I’m gettin' old and deal with a shaky hand? Honestly, doc, is that the best you’ve got? I’ve heard better from my barber. And Parkinson’s? Now that sounds serious. You're not tellin' me I'm gettin' that, are ya?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Baide. Essential tremor is very common, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious is wrong. It's a condition that causes tremor, but it usually doesn't significantly affect your quality of life. As for Parkinson's disease, I'm not telling you that you have Parkinson's. It's just that sometimes tremor can be an early sign of Parkinson’s, so it’s important to rule it out. To do that, I’d like to order a few simple tests. Specifically, a thyroid function test to check your thyroid levels, and I think it would be wise to get a referral to a neurologist. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the nervous system, and they can perform a more detailed examination and confirm the diagnosis. We'll also review all your medications, even the occasional antacid, to make sure nothing is contributing to the tremor. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist? More doctors? More tests? This is ridiculous. I just wanted someone to fix my hand, not send me on a wild goose chase through a bunch of specialists. Look, doc, I’m eighty years old. I don't need fancy tests and specialist opinions. I just want to be able to eat my dinner without spillin’ everything all over myself. But… alright, fine. Do your tests. But if they come back normal, I'm not goin' to any neurologist. And don't expect me to jump through hoops. Just get it over with. But I swear, if this is somethin' serious… I'm holdin’ you responsible. Now, what kind of tests are we talkin' about? And how long is this gonna take? I haven't got forever, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I apologize for the inconvenience. You’re right, you deserve to get this sorted out efficiently. We'll keep everything as straightforward as possible. The tests will be a simple blood draw to check your thyroid function. That can be done right here at the clinic, and the results should be back in a few days. If the results are normal, and you’re still concerned about the tremor, then a referral to a neurologist would be the next step. They’ll do a more detailed neurological exam, and they can discuss potential treatment options with you, if needed. In the meantime, I can offer you a few strategies to help manage the tremor, such as using heavier silverware, avoiding caffeine, and practicing relaxation techniques. Would you like me to write those down for you?
PATIENT: Heavier silverware? Caffeine? Relaxation techniques? You’re tellin’ me I gotta change my life to cope with a shaky hand? This is preposterous. Look, just get the tests done, and let’s see what they say. Don't bother with the lifestyle changes. I’ve lived a long life without needing any fancy tricks to eat my dinner. And yes, write down where you’re sendin’ me for the blood draw. I don’t trust my memory these days. Just get it over with, doc. I’m ready to go home and take a nap. This whole visit has been exhausting. And one more thing. Don’t expect me to be happy if it turns out to be somethin' serious. You’ve been warned. Now, let’s go. I’m ready for my nap.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Here’s the requisition for your blood draw. The lab is located at… . They’re open Monday through Friday from 8 am to 5 pm, and you don’t need an appointment. The results will be sent directly to me, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them. And here’s a copy of my contact information, in case you have any questions. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that I’ll do everything I can to help you figure this out. Let’s just take it one step at a time. Now, if you’re feeling tired, then please go home and rest. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. Have a good rest of your day, Mr. Baide.
PATIENT: .
