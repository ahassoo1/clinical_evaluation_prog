DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Finco, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit…strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really weak and tired lately, and I’ve also been very yellow – my skin and eyes, you know? And it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. I don’t know if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Ms. Haggar, thank you. Yellowing of the skin and eyes, and a connection to fava beans… We’ll definitely explore that. Could you tell me a little more about this weakness and tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it started maybe a month ago, just feeling a bit more tired than usual. I thought it was just…life, you know? But it’s gotten worse. Now, even simple things like walking up the stairs leave me breathless. And I’ve been getting headaches, too. It’s not a constant headache, more like… waves of feeling really unwell. I also feel a bit dizzy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this has been building over about a month, with increasing fatigue, shortness of breath, headaches, and some dizziness. Are these headaches located in a specific area, or are they all over?
PATIENT: They're… mostly around my temples, I think. And sometimes it feels like pressure behind my eyes. It's not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, and it comes and goes. It's hard to describe, really. And the dizziness isn't spinning dizziness, just… lightheaded. Like I might faint, but I haven’t yet, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s a helpful distinction, Ms. Haggar – temples and pressure behind the eyes, dull ache, and lightheadedness rather than spinning. I appreciate you clarifying. Now, let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. I think my appetite has been a little lower lately, to be honest. I just haven't been feeling very hungry. And… now that you mention it, I think I might have lost a little weight. I haven’t weighed myself recently, but my clothes feel a bit looser. It's not a huge amount, but noticeable. I haven’t been trying to lose weight, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some unintentional weight loss. That’s good to know. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or urine color?
PATIENT: Oh… urine color. That’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but… yes, actually. It’s been much darker than usual. Almost…tea colored, sometimes. As for bowel movements, no, not really. They’ve been pretty normal, I think. Although, I’ve been a bit…constipated lately. But I think that might be from not eating much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Haggar. It’s all very helpful, and nothing is embarrassing when it comes to your health. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication that I know of. No food allergies, either. I can take most things. I haven’t really had to take much medication over the years, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, and that’s it.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t take any regular medication, no vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. I really try to eat a healthy diet, so I haven’t felt the need. I drink a lot of water, though! Does that count?
DOCTOR: That absolutely counts, Ms. Haggar! Staying hydrated is excellent. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that’s about it, I think. And I've had the usual things – colds, flu, things like that. But nothing serious. No major illnesses, no surgeries besides the appendix. My family… my mother had high blood pressure, but that was years ago. I don't have high blood pressure, as far as I know. I usually go to the dentist regularly, but I haven’t needed to see any other specialists in a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a teenager, no other surgeries, and a family history of hypertension. And what about your social history, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: Oh... social history? What do you mean?
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Haggar. It's just a routine part of the exam. By social history, I mean things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or have any significant stressors in your life. It helps me understand your overall health picture.
PATIENT: Oh, I see! Well, I definitely don’t smoke. Never have. And I very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a year. As for stressors… well, life has its ups and downs, doesn’t it? I live alone, and sometimes it gets a bit lonely, but I have a few friends I see occasionally. Nothing terribly stressful, I don’t think. Just… normal life stuff.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Haggar. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, is there anything else you think might be relevant?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Oh! Actually, yes. I went on a trip to Greece last year, and I ate a lot of fava beans there. They were so good! And that's when I started noticing the tiredness, although I didn't connect it to the beans at first. It was just after that trip that I started feeling unwell. I don’t remember eating many fava beans before that. I wonder if it’s possible something was different about them there? Or maybe I just hadn't eaten enough of them before to notice a reaction?
DOCTOR: That's very interesting, Ms. Haggar, thank you for mentioning that. It definitely adds another piece to the puzzle. Alright, I think we have a good starting point. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to conduct a physical examination. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look at your skin. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better, so I'm happy to do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat on the examination table, we’ll get started. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, normal rate. No murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Slight discomfort in the right upper quadrant with deep palpation, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Liver edge is palpable, slightly enlarged. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Bowel sounds are normal. Now, let's take a look at your skin. I notice some mild jaundice, as you mentioned. Skin is warm and dry. Moderate jaundice noted in the sclera and skin. No rashes or lesions. Alright, Ms. Haggar, that completes the physical examination. Based on your symptoms and the exam findings – the fatigue, weakness, dark urine, jaundice, and slight liver enlargement – I’m concerned about possible hemolytic anemia, possibly triggered by something you ingested, like the fava beans. We need to run some blood tests to confirm this. I'm ordering a complete blood count, liver function tests, bilirubin levels, and a Coombs test to look for antibodies.
PATIENT: Hemolytic anemia? That sounds… serious. And the fava beans are really the cause? I thought it was just a weird coincidence. Is it something I need to avoid completely? And what does all this mean? Will I be okay?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Haggar. Hemolytic anemia means your red blood cells are being destroyed faster than they can be made. It can be serious, but it’s also often manageable. And it's possible, given your history, that the fava beans are indeed the trigger. There's a condition called G6PD deficiency – a genetic enzyme deficiency – where people can't properly process certain substances, and fava beans are a common culprit. When they eat fava beans, it causes their red blood cells to break down. The blood tests will help us determine if you have this deficiency, or if something else is going on. For now, I strongly advise avoiding fava beans completely until we have the results. Also, we'll need to review any medications you've taken, as some drugs can also trigger hemolytic anemia in susceptible individuals. Will you be okay?
PATIENT: That… makes a lot of sense, actually. My grandfather was from the Mediterranean, and I remember him eating a lot of fava beans when I was a child. Maybe it’s genetic, like you said. So, no more fava beans. Absolutely. And I haven’t been taking any medication, as we discussed. That’s good, right? When do you think I’ll get the results? And what happens if I do have this deficiency? Do I need to worry about anything else besides fava beans? Is it something I need to tell my family?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know about your grandfather. It certainly adds to the possibility of a genetic predisposition. And yes, that you haven’t been taking any medications is good. It simplifies things. The blood tests should be back within 24 to 48 hours. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re available. If you do have G6PD deficiency, the main thing is avoiding triggers. Besides fava beans, certain medications, and even some foods and chemicals can cause a reaction. We’ll go over a comprehensive list if that’s the case. And yes, it’s a good idea to let your family know. They may also want to get tested, as it’s a genetic condition. There’s no cure, but awareness is key. For now, let's focus on getting those test results. I'm also going to order a reticulocyte count, which measures how quickly your bone marrow is making new red blood cells. This will give us a better understanding of the severity of the anemia. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: A reticulocyte count… okay. That sounds… complicated. But I’ll trust you, Doctor. No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel a little bit better knowing what might be going on. Just… please call me as soon as you have the results, okay? I’m anxious to know what the next steps are. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for being so thorough.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. I understand your anxiety, and I promise my nurse will call you as soon as the results are available. We’ll discuss them together and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – like severe fatigue, shortness of breath, or dark urine – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here's the lab order for the tests, and my nurse will provide you with instructions on where to go for the blood draw. Again, thank you for coming in today. I’m glad we were able to get to the bottom of this, and I’m confident we’ll be able to manage it effectively. .
