DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Krahn. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Kamahele, is it? Yes, yes... well, something about a check-up? For… work, I think. It’s all a bit foggy, honestly. They sent me over. Just trying to get it done, you know? Lots of things happening these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be hard to keep track of everything. A work check-up... alright. So, it sounds like this is a routine physical required by your employer?
PATIENT: Routine… yes, that sounds right. Something to do with… performances, maybe? Or a show? I work at the theatre, you see. Ushering, mostly. And tickets. Though, honestly, the details… they slip away. It’s been a long time doing it. I just want to make sure I’m… allowed to keep doing it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. We'll get everything sorted out. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly… hmm. Not… consistently, no. Things always felt alright, so I didn’t bother, really. A bit of a bad back now and then, but nothing serious. Just… old age creeping in, I suppose. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, it’s been years. Decades, maybe? I really couldn’t say for sure. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not a problem at all. We can certainly start from here. It’s good you’re getting it checked out now. Alright, let's try to fill in some gaps. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me think. Not that I’m aware of, no. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. Though, I don’t eat much anymore. Appetite isn’t what it used to be. I used to love spicy food, but even that doesn’t appeal as much these days. No, I don't think I have any allergies. Definitely not that I remember. It’s hard to recall things from that long ago, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Alright, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not currently. Nothing at all. I used to take something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. But that was… a long time ago. The doctor took me off of it, said I didn’t need it anymore. I haven't taken anything regularly in… oh, goodness, I really can’t say how long. Just a little pain reliever for my back sometimes, but that’s it. Over-the-counter stuff. Not a habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… Oh dear. That’s… a tough one. I had chickenpox as a boy, of course. And… I broke my arm once, when I was climbing a tree. Silly thing to do. Nothing major, though. I’ve always been fairly healthy, you see. Just the usual aches and pains that come with age. I don’t think I’ve ever been seriously ill. No surgeries, no big diseases… I mean, nothing that I remember. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. Is there something specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. Just trying to get a general picture. Let’s move on to family history, if that’s okay. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That’s… tricky. My parents… my father had a weak heart, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young. And my mother… she lived a long life, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses. She was always very… resilient. My siblings… well, there were several of us. I haven’t seen most of them in years. I wouldn’t know their medical histories, even if I wanted to. I’m afraid I’m not much help on that front. It’s been a long time, you see. Things get forgotten.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s not essential. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she used to smoke, but I always discouraged it. Said it was bad for her health. She quit eventually, thank goodness. No, never smoked. Always preferred fresh air. Though, the air in the city isn’t always that fresh these days, is it? But no, never a smoker. And I rarely drink, either. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, about your diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: A typical day… Hmm. Well, I don't have much of an appetite these days, so I don’t eat a lot. Usually just a small breakfast… toast and tea, perhaps. And a light lunch… a sandwich, maybe. I don’t bother with much dinner. Sometimes soup, if I’m feeling up to it. I try to eat healthy, but I don’t have much motivation, you see. It’s just… easier to not eat, if that makes sense. My wife used to do all the cooking. I’m not much of a cook myself. Mostly just… simple things. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to maintain a good appetite, especially when you’re on your own. Alright, let's move on to your current symptoms. Are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or other health problems at the moment?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… a bit. My back, mostly. It aches a lot these days. Especially after standing for a long time. It’s just… old age, I suppose. And sometimes… I get a little dizzy. Not often, but enough to be annoying. And… I forget things. A lot of things. More than usual, I mean. I’m not sure if that counts as a symptom, but… it’s frustrating. It’s hard to keep track of things. That’s why I’m here, I suppose. To make sure I’m still… capable. Capable of doing my job, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. So, back pain, occasional dizziness, and some forgetfulness. Let’s try to get a bit more detail about the back pain. Where exactly does it hurt?
PATIENT: Right here, mostly. Lower back. Sometimes it radiates down my leg, a little. Not always, though. It's a dull ache, more than a sharp pain. It gets worse when I stand for too long, like at work. And when I bend over. It eases up a bit when I sit down and rest. It’s just… a constant discomfort. Nothing debilitating, but annoying nonetheless. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, years now. I just assumed it was part of getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about the dizziness?
PATIENT: The dizziness… it's not frequent, thankfully. It comes and goes. It’s not like a spinning sensation, more like… lightheadedness. Like I might faint, but I never actually do. It usually happens when I stand up quickly. Or if I haven’t eaten for a while. It lasts just a few seconds, then goes away. It doesn't happen every day, but it’s enough to make me a little anxious. I'm always afraid I’ll fall or something. It's probably nothing, though. Just my age. Everything's a little off these days, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, let’s move onto a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll take a look at your back. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, go ahead. Get it over with. I don't like doctors, never have. But I understand it's necessary. Just… be quick, if you could? I have things to do, you know. And my memory isn't what it used to be, so the sooner we finish, the better. Go ahead, Doctor. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won't take long. Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. And your pulse is normal. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, although I do detect a very faint murmur. It’s likely nothing to worry about, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at your back. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: There we go… easy now. Old bones, you know? Everything creaks a little. Go ahead, Doctor. Be gentle, if you would. Don't want to pull anything. It's already sore enough as it is. Do what you need to do, and let's get this over with. The sooner I’m done, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm just going to feel along your back here… Yes, there's some tenderness here on your lower back, as you mentioned. And some muscle spasm. It doesn’t seem to be anything acute, but it’s likely contributing to your pain. Now, I’m going to have you bend forward and touch your toes, if you can. Just go as far as you comfortably can. Okay, stop there. That’s good. It looks like your range of motion is a little limited, and bending forward causes you some discomfort. Alright, you can sit back down now. That was helpful. Overall, it seems like you have some muscle strain in your lower back, and your range of motion is a bit limited. The dizziness and forgetfulness are a little more concerning, though, and warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh dear… everything aches. Investigation, you say? What sort of investigation? I don't like tests, never have. Do I have to give blood? Or… worse? I just wanted a simple check-up, not a whole ordeal. This is all a bit much, honestly. I just want to make sure I can still do my job. That's all. Is that too much to ask? What do you recommend, Doctor? And how long is all this going to take?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. It doesn’t have to be a whole ordeal. The dizziness and forgetfulness are things we should rule out some possible causes for, just to be safe. I would like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying issues. We can also do a simple cognitive assessment – just a few questions to check your memory and thinking skills. It won’t be painful or anything like that. As for blood work, yes, it will require a small sample. It's standard procedure. It shouldn’t take too long. The blood work will take a few days to come back, and the cognitive assessment will only take about 15-20 minutes. We can schedule that for another day if you prefer. In the meantime, I can recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers for your back pain, and suggest some gentle exercises to help improve your range of motion. And, we can discuss strategies to help improve your memory. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear… More tests, more appointments… It's all so overwhelming. Gentle exercises… I don’t know, I’m not very good with exercises. I’m afraid I’ll just make things worse. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Blood work and… what did you call it? Cognitive assessment? Fine. Just… try to make it as quick and painless as possible, if you could? I really don't want to spend the rest of my life in a doctor's office. And yes, the pain relievers would be helpful. Anything to ease the aching. So… what do I need to do first? And how long will all of this take? I need to know so I can… well, so I can prepare myself. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’ll write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever – naproxen. It’s an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory that can help with your back pain. Take it as directed on the label. Then, I'll have the nurse draw a requisition for the blood work. You can go to the lab across the street whenever it's convenient for you. They don’t require an appointment. Just bring your insurance card and photo ID. Finally, I’ll schedule you for a cognitive assessment with our neuropsychologist, Dr. Lee, next week. It’ll take about 30 minutes. Let me see… how about Tuesday afternoon at 2 pm?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… hmm. That works, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. And as long as it doesn't involve any complicated tests. Naproxen, you say? I'll ask the nurse about that. I hope it works. This aching is really getting to me. So… that's it? Blood work, and the assessment on Tuesday? And then we wait for the results? Oh dear. This is going to be a long week. I really hope nothing is seriously wrong. I just want to be able to continue doing my job. That's all. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I think that's all for now. I’ll see you on Tuesday, then. If you’ll excuse me, I need to… try to remember where I parked the car. It’s getting harder every day, you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. We’ll take good care of you. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the requisition for the blood work and go over some instructions with you. And don't worry about forgetting where you parked. It happens to everyone. If you need any assistance finding your car, just ask the front desk staff. We'll see you on Tuesday. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, Mr. Krahn.
