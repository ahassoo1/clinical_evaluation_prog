DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Queener, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… the swelling. After the cancer, you see? It’s mostly in my legs and… sometimes my tummy feels puffy. It’s been a few weeks now. It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Cancer, right. And swelling… a few weeks. Okay. So, this swelling… is it worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it’s… worse in the evening? Yes, definitely. After I’ve been on my feet all day. I like to walk, you see. But then, later… poof. Big legs! It goes down a little when I sleep, I think. It's hard to tell sometimes.
DOCTOR: Walking is good, generally. But… swelling that's worse at the end of the day… Alright. And has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Oh! Not really. I eat… normal food. You know? Not much salt, I try not to. I like bread, maybe too much bread, but… no, nothing different. I haven't been eating anything new or… fancy. Just… bread. Is bread bad?
DOCTOR: Bread… Look, let’s not dwell on the bread. It’s probably nothing. Have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? You mean… when I go to the bathroom? No, not really. It’s… normal. Same as always, I think. I don’t get up at night or anything. It's… everything feels normal there. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right, "normal." Okay. And are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just… the stuff the hospital gave me after the cancer. A little white pill… and sometimes a bigger blue one. I don’t know what they are, exactly. They send them to me every month. I just take them. Is that… a problem? Should I know what they are?
DOCTOR: Look, it's always best to know what you’re taking. We'll get to that. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of! Never had a problem with anything. I can eat anything, take anything… well, except for those cancer pills, of course. They made me feel sick for a while. But allergies… no. I’m very… tolerant, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's have a quick look at your legs. Just need to examine the swelling. If you could just sit on the edge of the table, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Be careful, I'm not very steady on my feet today. Just tell me what you want me to do. And… is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't hurt. Just feeling the swelling… Right leg feels slightly more… substantial than the left. Pitting edema present, about +2 bilaterally. Seems… typical. Anything else you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. It feels… heavy, sometimes. Like my legs are filled with water. And… a little bit itchy, maybe? Not all the time. But sometimes, especially around my ankles. It's not bad itchy, just… annoying. Like I want to scratch it, but I don’t. Is that… normal for swelling?
DOCTOR: Itchy legs… could be a lot of things. Look, you’ve had cancer, so your body’s probably just… readjusting. We'll run some basic blood work. That'll tell us something. It's likely just fluid retention, but we need to rule out other things. .
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Blood work. Will it hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a little cat, you see, and I don't want to leave him alone for too long. I don’t want anything serious happening. .
