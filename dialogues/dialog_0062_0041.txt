DOCTOR: Hi Dorman, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this… weakness. It keeps getting worse, you see. It's in my legs mostly, but sometimes my arms feel it too. It’s been… a slow thing, happening for a while now. The wife, she says I need to get it checked proper.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual weakness in your legs and sometimes your arms. That's good of your wife to encourage you to come in. Can you tell me a little more about how it's been getting worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, at first, it was just a little harder to get up from the chair. You know, like an old man thing. But now… now I stumble more. And walking… walking feels like I’m dragging my feet sometimes. It’s not always there, but it’s happening more often. I used to be very strong, very good at helping with things. I used to work with the athletes, keeping them fit. It's… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating to have something limiting you when you were so active before. So, it started with difficulty getting up from a chair and has progressed to stumbling and a feeling of dragging your feet. Is it worse with certain activities, like walking uphill, or after standing for a long time?
PATIENT: Yes, yes that’s right. Standing for a long time… that makes it worse, for sure. And… uphill is very hard. It feels like my legs just won't listen. Like they are made of… I don’t know… lead. And sometimes, when I try to walk fast, I feel… wobbly. It's hard to explain. It’s not pain, not usually. Just… tired. Very, very tired in my legs.
DOCTOR: Okay, tired and heavy legs, especially with standing and going uphill, and that wobbly feeling when you try to walk faster. And no pain, mostly just fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your balance, like feeling unsteady even when you aren't walking?
PATIENT: Hmm... balance... that's a good question. I have bumped into things a little more lately. Not often, but enough that the wife pointed it out. She says I'm more clumsy now. And… sometimes, when I turn my head quickly, I get a little dizzy. Not a bad dizzy, just… whooshing. Like the room spins for a moment. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But maybe that’s something too?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Dorman. The clumsiness and that whooshing dizziness when you turn your head are definitely things we should look into. Now, let’s talk a little more broadly. Have you had any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Other symptoms... let me see. Well, my vision… sometimes it gets blurry. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. And… I get tired easily, even when I’m resting. More tired than usual, even for an old man. Oh! And my hands… they sometimes tremble a little. It’s not bad, just… a little shaking. Does that make sense? It's all just… little things, you know? But they add up.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Dorman, and it's good you're telling me all of this – even the "little things." Blurry vision, increased fatigue, and trembling hands… Okay. Let’s go through some of your medical history. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Dr. Nakamura. He’s a good man. I see him for my check-ups, but… he mostly checks my blood pressure and makes sure I’m not getting too heavy. He hasn't been much help with this weakness, to be honest. He just said it was probably old age. I’ve had… a bit of trouble with my heart, a long time ago. Nothing serious, they fixed it with a… a little wire, I think. And I have Medicare, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. Nakamura, and you had a procedure for your heart with a wire – likely a stent or pacemaker, we can confirm that in your records. And you're covered by Medicare. Now, have you ever had any major surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. No, I don’t think so. Not any major surgeries. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But that was a long time ago. And… I was in the hospital for a few days when my wife was born, but that doesn’t count, does it? Nothing serious, never really been a sick man, until this… weakness. I’ve had the usual colds and flus, but nothing that kept me down for long. I think that’s it. I'm trying to remember… it's been a long life.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Dorman. It sounds like you've lived a very healthy life overall. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had some trouble with her balance when she got older, very similar to what I’m feeling now, maybe. She fell a few times. And my older brother, he had… something with his nerves, I think. He couldn't move his hands very well towards the end. It was a long time ago, so I don’t remember much. My wife says her mother had trouble with her eyesight, got very blurry. But besides that… not much, as far as I know. It’s a big family, spread all over, so it’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, balance issues in your mother, nerve problems in your brother, and eyesight issues in your wife’s mother. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she doesn’t like it. And I’ve always been active, always looking after my health. Used to tell the athletes to stay away from it too. Bad for your lungs, bad for everything. No, never smoked. I do enjoy a little bit of… well, a little bit of beer sometimes with the wife, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. So, a little bit of beer socially with your wife. And do you drink alcohol frequently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not frequently. Maybe a couple of beers on the weekend, with dinner. Sometimes. We don’t drink every night. Mostly just… a treat. And it’s always with food, never on an empty stomach. My wife keeps me in line, you see. She’s very sensible. I wouldn't say I depend on it, not at all. Just a little enjoyment now and then.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, one last question about your lifestyle – are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Just the usual for my blood pressure, a little white pill. Dr. Nakamura gave it to me. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis in my hands, when it flares up. It's an over-the-counter thing, I think. Ibuprofen, maybe? I can't remember the exact name. And… sometimes I take a little Vitamin D, my wife gives it to me. She says I need it for my bones. But that's about it. Nothing else, really. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for your blood pressure, ibuprofen for arthritis when needed, and Vitamin D. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always asks me before I try anything new, just to be safe. But no, no allergies that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, take any medicine, without any trouble. I’m a pretty simple man, I don’t have many sensitivities, thankfully. It’s a blessing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, Dorman, I’m going to do a brief physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and assess your strength and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm happy to cooperate, whatever will help me figure out what’s going on. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur, which we’ll note. Your lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands. Your grip strength is slightly weaker on both sides, but more noticeable on your left hand. And finally, let’s check your balance. You have some difficulty maintaining your balance with your eyes closed, and you sway slightly. Okay, Dorman. Based on the exam, your blood pressure is a little elevated, there’s a slight murmur, your reflexes are diminished, your grip strength is weaker, and you have some difficulty with your balance. These findings, combined with your reported symptoms, suggest a possible neurological issue, or potentially something related to your circulation. I would like to order some blood work and an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Neurological issue? MRI? That sounds… serious, Doctor. What sort of neurological issue are we talking about? Is it… something bad? I understand you need to do tests, of course. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best, but it's a bit worrying to hear. Blood work I understand, but an MRI… is it painful? And will it show anything definite? I’m a bit scared now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Dorman, and it's perfectly natural to be worried. When I say “neurological issue,” I don’t necessarily mean anything severe. It simply means there could be something affecting your nerves or brain. The MRI is a painless imaging test that will allow us to see a detailed picture of your brain and identify any potential problems. It won't show us everything definitively, but it's the best way to start investigating the cause of your symptoms. The blood work will help us rule out other possibilities, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. It's important to remember we haven't made a diagnosis yet. We're simply gathering information to figure out what's causing your weakness, balance issues, and other symptoms. I want to be upfront with you: potential causes could include stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or other neurological conditions. But again, we need to do the tests to rule things in or out. I’ll refer you to a neurologist, Dr. Chen, who specializes in these types of conditions. He will be the one to interpret the MRI results and discuss the best course of treatment with you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Multiple sclerosis… I've heard of that. It sounds… bad. But you said we need to rule things out. And you're going to refer me to a specialist, Dr. Chen? Is he a good doctor? I trust your judgement, Doctor, but it's a lot to take in. An MRI… how long does that take? And will I need someone to drive me? My wife… she’s a bit worried too. And what about the blood work? Will that be at this clinic? I suppose… if you think it’s necessary, I’ll do whatever you recommend. Just… please, keep me informed. I don’t like being in the dark.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Dorman, and you're right to ask questions and want to be kept informed. Dr. Chen is an excellent neurologist – very experienced and compassionate. He's well-respected in the community. The MRI typically takes about 30-60 minutes. Yes, you will absolutely need someone to drive you, as you'll likely be given a mild sedative to help you stay still during the scan. I’ll write you a prescription for that. The blood work will be done right here at the clinic. We'll draw a few vials of blood, and it usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. I’ll also give you a referral form for Dr. Chen and a list of instructions for the MRI. I’ll have my nurse schedule you for both the blood work and the MRI appointment. She’ll also be happy to answer any questions you or your wife may have. I want to reassure you that we're taking this seriously, and we'll do everything we can to figure out what's going on and get you the best possible care. I will also call you personally once I have the results of your blood work to discuss the next steps. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Having a plan makes me feel better. So, the nurse will schedule everything? And you'll call me with the blood work results? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And you'll call me when you get the bloodwork results? I will make sure my wife comes with me for the MRI. That will make me feel better too. I’m still worried, but… I feel a little more hopeful now. I trust you, Doctor. And I’m grateful for your help. Let me know if there’s anything I need to do before my appointments.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dorman. And you're right to be proactive and bring your wife with you. It's always helpful to have support. The nurse will give you instructions for fasting before the blood work – you'll need to avoid eating or drinking anything for a few hours beforehand. And she'll provide a list of things to avoid bringing to the MRI, like metal objects. There's nothing else you need to do at this point except to schedule the appointments and try to relax as much as possible. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the blood work results. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We're here to support you. Here's that referral form for Dr. Chen, and I’ll have the nurse bring you the instructions for the blood work. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind and patient. I appreciate your help and understanding. I’ll let my wife know and we’ll schedule the appointments as soon as possible. I… I’ll try to stay positive. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dorman. Remember, we're a team, and we'll get through this together. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. And please, take care of yourself and your wife. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon.
