DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have much time. My throat… it hurts. Been hurting for a few days now, I think. It's just… a pain. Is that enough for you to figure out? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore throat for a few days. I understand you're short on time, and we'll do our best to be efficient. “Just a pain” can mean a lot of things, though. Can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? Well… it hurts. Like something is… rough. And when I swallow, it's worse. I don't know how to describe it better than that. I’m a machine setter, not a… a pain describer! Is it important what kind of hurt it is? Because frankly, I don’t recall.
DOCTOR: No, it’s alright, don’t worry about being precise. “Rough” is helpful. And the fact that it’s worse when you swallow is good information. Does it hurt to talk as well?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. A little. Not terribly, but… yes. I find myself speaking softer than usual, I suppose. It's annoying. This is taking too long, honestly. Is it just a cold? Can you just give me something for it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. It could be a simple cold, but we need to rule out other possibilities to be sure. Just to get a clearer picture, have you had any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? I… I don’t check my temperature. Never have. Chills… perhaps? It's been warm lately, so I wouldn’t know the difference. And I always have a little sniffle, dust from the machines, you see. It’s a dirty job. So, no. Nothing else. Just the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's just take a quick look at your throat and listen to your lungs, just to be thorough. It won't take long. Can you open wide and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Aah… Honestly, this feels like a waste of time. My grandmother always said warm saltwater gargles were best.
DOCTOR: Your throat is a little red, but it doesn’t look severely inflamed. Your lungs sound good and clear. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it’s likely a viral sore throat, possibly from a common cold. However, given you've not been feeling well for a few days, and without a confirmed temperature, I'd like to briefly check your ears as well, just to rule out anything else. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ears? What do my ears have to do with my throat? Fine. But be quick about it. I have machines waiting, Doctor. And I'm not insured, so don't try to sell me anything expensive.
DOCTOR: Your ears look fine. No sign of infection there. So, everything points to a viral sore throat. It sounds like it's probably just a common cold, as you suspected. Unfortunately, antibiotics won’t help a virus. We treat the symptoms to make you more comfortable. I’m noting you are uninsured. We can discuss some over-the-counter options, like lozenges, pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and plenty of fluids. Warm saltwater gargles, like your grandmother suggested, are a good idea too. Would you like me to write down some recommendations for you?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter… so, things I can buy at the store? Yes, write it down. Just the basics. No fancy stuff. And tell me how long I should expect this to last. I need to know if I should call in sick for a whole week. Machines don't run themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This lists some options for pain relief and soothing your throat. Most viral sore throats resolve within 7-10 days. If your symptoms worsen after a week, or if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain when swallowing, it’s important to see a doctor again. As for calling in sick, that's a decision you'll have to make based on how you’re feeling. If you can work comfortably, you can try to go in, but don't push yourself. It's better to rest and recover. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Seven to ten days… that's a long time. Fine. I understand. No, I don’t have any questions. I've heard it all before. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose that will be all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tammie. Get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. If anything changes, or if you're concerned, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: Right. Goodbye. Machines won’t run themselves… .
