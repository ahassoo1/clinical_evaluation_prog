DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Good afternoon. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good afternoon to you too. Look here, I don't have all day. I want somethin' done about... well, lookin' at me. I ain't happy with how things are hangin', you understand? It's droopin'. Just...droopin'. And it ain't right.
DOCTOR: Drooping, you say. Alright. And…where exactly are we talking about that’s drooping, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Look, are we playin' riddles here? It's this! The skin...under my chin. It's gone soft, and it hangs. Like an old washcloth. I used to be…sharper. More defined. Now? It's just...sad. And I don't like sad. Can you fix it, or what?
DOCTOR: So, you’re concerned about laxity of the skin in your neck and upper chest region. You'd like to discuss options for improvement. Right. And how long has this been bothering you, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Botherin' me? A long time. Years, I suppose. Maybe five, six years now? It started slow, and now…well, now it's nothin' to look at. Used to be able to shave proper, you know? Now it's just... awkward. Don't ask me specifics, I ain't keepin' track of days and dates. Just...long enough to be fed up with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that's made it more noticeable?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm. Well, I lost some weight last year. Doc told me to, said it was for my blood pressure. Didn't realize losin' weight would make this worse. Everything just…sagged more after that. It was already goin', but the weight loss... sped it up, I reckon. Now it’s really noticeable. Lookin’ in the mirror is a proper disappointment, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: So weight loss exacerbating the laxity…okay. And do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Well, I had that bad knee for a while. Still hurts sometimes, especially when the weather changes. And my blood pressure, like I said. Doc keeps me on pills for that. Other than that…nothin’ major. I’m an old man, things are bound to be breakin' down, you know? Just want to fix this, not get a whole list of what's wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I see here you’re on medication for hypertension. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had no allergies. I can take most anything. I've had enough pills in my life, believe me. Don't need to add a rash to the list. Just... tell me what you can do about the droopin'. Is there a cream? A somethin'? I ain't lookin' for a whole operation if I can avoid it. Old man, remember? Don't bounce back like I used to.
DOCTOR: There are some non-surgical options we could consider, but realistically, Mr. Trendler, for significant laxity, the results are often…modest. We're talking about things like radiofrequency treatments, or possibly some injectables. But given your age and… the degree of laxity you're describing, surgery is likely the most effective path to achieving the results you want. Now, I'm not saying we have to do surgery, but we need to be realistic about expectations. Would you like me to explain a bit about the surgical options?
PATIENT: Surgery? Hmph. I figured as much. Always is, isn't it? Look, I don't want no fancy explanations about every little thing. Just tell me what it involves. How long am I lookin' at being out of commission? And what's the risk? I ain't tryin' to end up lookin' worse than I do now. Keep it simple, Doc. I ain't got all day for medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. A neck lift, which is what we'd be discussing, involves an incision along the hairline and behind the ears. We tighten the underlying muscle, remove excess skin, and redrape the remaining skin. Recovery typically involves about two weeks of limited activity, bruising and swelling for several weeks, and some numbness or tingling that can last for months. Risks include infection, bleeding, nerve damage – leading to weakness or asymmetry – and scarring. It's not a small procedure. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Infection? Nerve damage? Asymmetry? Look, Doc, you're scaring me now. That sounds awful. I just wanted somethin' tightened up, not a whole new face. Is there anythin' else? Some kinda... smaller thing? Maybe one of those creams? I don’t like the sound of that at all. I’ve seen fellas come out of surgery lookin’ like somethin’ the cat dragged in. Ain’t interested in that. So, what about the creams? Are they worth a try, even if they don't do much? Just to avoid a knife?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Trendler. The creams, the lotions…they’re not going to give you a significant result. They might improve the skin texture slightly, but they won’t address the laxity, the underlying muscle… It’s like trying to fix a sagging roof with paint. It’s not going to happen. We could explore some non-invasive energy-based treatments, like radiofrequency, but as I said, the results are modest. You'd likely need multiple sessions, and it’s not guaranteed. Honestly, if you’re trying to avoid all risk, perhaps it’s best to accept things as they are. It's an option.
PATIENT: Accept things as they are? You're tellin' me to just...let it hang? After comin' all the way here? That's a proper waste of my time. Look, Doc, I ain't lookin' for a miracle. Just somethin' to make me feel less like a melted ice cream cone. If the creams ain't gonna do nothin', and the surgery is too risky... well, then I guess I'm outta here. I ain't payin' for bad news. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, hold on a moment. We can discuss the radiofrequency treatments in more detail. It’s a less invasive option, and while the results aren’t dramatic, it might provide a subtle improvement. We'd need to do a series of sessions… but there is a cost involved, and it's not a guaranteed fix. We can schedule a consultation with the aesthetician to assess your skin and give you a more informed opinion. Would you be interested in that?
