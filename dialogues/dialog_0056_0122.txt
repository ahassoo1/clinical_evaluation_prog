DOCTOR: Hi Venus, nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Amussen. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, things have been… not quite right with my memory lately. It is concerning, you understand. Especially with my… condition. High blood pressure, the doctors say. It makes one worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Memory concerns are definitely something to take seriously, especially with a history of high blood pressure. So, just to clarify, you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. For… oh, nearly fifteen years now, I believe. It is managed with medication, usually. Though, lately, I have been feeling… a little more scattered, if you will. It is difficult to explain. Not forgetting everything, but… details. Important details. It is… unsettling. I try to write things down, but even that feels… less reliable these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. So it sounds like you’re noticing a change in your memory – not a complete loss, but difficulty recalling details, and even remembering to use the notes you’re making. And you said this has been happening recently?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Recently… perhaps three months, maybe four? It is hard to pinpoint. Time… it feels like it is slipping away more quickly. And it’s not just forgetting where I put my keys, Doctor. It is… appointments, names of people I’ve met, things I need to do for my properties. Things a professional should remember. It is… distressing. I do not wish to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Okay. Three to four months of noticing this change, specifically with details related to daily life and your work. And you’re understandably distressed about it. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I… I have been more tired, perhaps. Not just the usual tiredness, but a… heavy fatigue. And… a little more difficulty concentrating. Focusing on tasks. I used to be able to manage several properties simultaneously with no problem. Now… it feels like a great effort. Small things, perhaps. But they are… accumulating. And I worry. It is my blood pressure, yes? It must be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and difficulty concentrating in addition to the memory issues. And you’re concerned it’s related to your blood pressure. That’s a reasonable concern. Just to get a clearer picture, have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, weakness or numbness on one side of your body, or difficulty speaking?
PATIENT: No, no headaches. My vision is… well, it is not perfect, I require glasses, but no changes. And no weakness, no numbness. I can speak perfectly well, as you can see. No, those things have not happened. It is… mostly the forgetting, the tiredness, the difficulty thinking clearly. It is frustrating. I pride myself on my competence.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No headaches, vision changes, weakness or numbness. You mentioned you take medication for your high blood pressure. Could you tell me what medications you're currently taking, and the dosages, if you know them?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… I always keep a list. Lisinopril, twenty milligrams, once daily. And Amlodipine, five milligrams, also once daily. I have been on these for… oh, nearly ten years now, I believe. The dosages have been adjusted a few times over the years, but this is the current regimen. I take them every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg and Amlodipine 5mg daily. Have you noticed any side effects from these medications?
PATIENT: No, not really. Occasionally, a little dizziness when I stand up too quickly. But nothing major. I have learned to be careful. And… sometimes my ankles swell a bit, but I elevate my legs and it usually helps. Nothing that would cause me to stop taking the medication. I need these for my blood pressure, you understand. It is… a necessary inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Okay, some occasional dizziness and ankle swelling, manageable with precautions. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly acceptable, Doctor. I understand that is part of the process. Please, proceed. I want to find out what is happening, and I trust your expertise. I wish to be… thorough.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150/90. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you cross your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, I can cross my legs. My reflexes… I haven’t paid much attention to them, to be honest. I hope they are… adequate. It has been a long time since I had a physical exam, you understand. Things… slipped my mind, with everything. I apologize if I am not a very cooperative patient.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Good reflexes there. Now I’m going to check your balance. Could you please stand up and try to balance on one leg for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Oh… that is… not as easy as it used to be. I appear to be a little unsteady. I apologize. Perhaps I should have warned you. I have not been doing much walking lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little unsteady balance, but you were able to maintain it for a few seconds. That's helpful to know. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your memory and thinking. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today… It is… August… the second? Yes, August 2nd, 2025. Is that correct? I hope I have not misremembered. It feels… distant.
DOCTOR: Okay, August 2nd, 2025 is correct. And can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: That… Suburban, is it not? Yes, we are in Suburban. I… I recognize the clinic now. It just… took a moment to recall. It is the stress, I believe. It clouds my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay. You were able to recall that we are in Suburban. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it’s difficult to pinpoint a specific cause for your memory issues. The dizziness, ankle swelling and slightly elevated blood pressure could be related to your medication, but the memory issues are concerning enough to investigate further. I'd like to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. We should also consider a cognitive screening test to get a more objective assessment of your memory and thinking skills. What do you think?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Blood work and a screening test… yes, let us proceed with that. I would like to know what is happening, and if there is something that can be done. If it is my medication causing this, then perhaps an adjustment is needed. If it is something else… well, then we will address that as well. I am prepared to cooperate fully. Just… please let me know the results as soon as they are available. This uncertainty is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. The lab work should be ready within a few days, and we can schedule the cognitive screening for next week. My nurse will call you to arrange an appointment. In the meantime, continue taking your medication as prescribed. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – severe headaches, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… very thorough. I appreciate your attention to this matter. No, I do not believe I have any further questions at this time. I will await the results of the tests and the call from your nurse. Thank you for your time, and for listening to my concerns. I hope to have some answers soon.
