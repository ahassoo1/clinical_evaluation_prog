DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Yes, well, I just moved here, you see. Social thing, I suppose. Medicare requires it. Honestly, I don’t recall exactly why they sent me to you. A check-up, I presume? I haven’t a moment to waste, really.
DOCTOR: Right. A “check-up.” While Medicare does have certain preventative care requirements, it's generally helpful for me to understand your specific concerns. Let's start with this: are you currently experiencing any health problems?
PATIENT: Problems? Oh, goodness, at my age? Which one isn’t a problem? I suppose… my knees ache a bit. They always have. And I get tired easily, though everyone does, don’t they? Really, I don’t think it’s anything to trouble you with. Just… old age, dear. It’s a perfectly natural phenomenon.
DOCTOR: “Aches and fatigue.” Right. Let's try to be a little more specific. When did you first notice the knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specifics… That’s a difficult question. Years, I should think. Decades, perhaps. It comes and goes, you see. Not a constant affliction. I truly couldn’t pinpoint a start date. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Engelhaupt, to establish a baseline and determine if there’s a treatable component to your discomfort. Even if it’s been years, we need to assess the severity and potential causes. Is the pain in both knees, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I suppose. Though one is generally worse than the other. Honestly, I don’t make a habit of cataloging my aches and pains, dear. It’s rather… undignified. Is there something you can prescribe to make it better? I haven’t the energy for a lengthy investigation.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt. However, prescribing medication without a proper evaluation isn’t responsible care. To help me understand what’s going on, let's move through a brief review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis? Goodness, no. My family has never had arthritis. We're a sturdy people, you see. Maya, strong lineage. Though… my mother did complain of stiff joints towards the end. But that was just old age, I'm certain. Doctors these days are so quick to label everything. Is this going to take much longer? I have an appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more questions, then. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh, yes. Appendicitis, many years ago. And… a hysterectomy, of course. That was… quite some time ago now. Aside from those, I can’t recall anything of note. Though my husband may remember. He has a rather remarkable memory for such things. Is he required to be here? Because frankly, bringing him would be a… logistical nightmare.
DOCTOR: No, your husband isn’t required to be here. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… Well, I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take a… a something. A little yellow one. My husband handles all that, you see. He's very organized. I wouldn't know the names if you paid me. I really don’t concern myself with such trivial details. It’s all rather… beneath me. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite faint. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: Ms. Engelhaupt, it’s essential for me to have an accurate medication list to ensure your safety. "A small white pill" and "a little yellow one" aren't sufficient information. Could you perhaps bring a list with you next time, or have your husband accompany you?
PATIENT: Honestly! This is preposterous! I came here for a simple check-up, and now I'm being interrogated like a common criminal! I'm perfectly capable of managing my own affairs, thank you very much. I simply don't have the patience for this endless questioning. I believe I've had enough. I think I’ll just go. Good day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Engelhaupt, I understand your frustration. However, I am obligated to gather sufficient information to provide appropriate medical care. I strongly advise you to schedule a follow-up appointment with a more detailed medication list. Without it, I cannot safely assess your condition. Here is some information that may be helpful. Please contact my office to reschedule once you have that information. .
