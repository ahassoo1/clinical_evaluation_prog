DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. I’m Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ve been experiencing some… well, numbness in my leg, primarily. It’s been happening on and off for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out rather than let it continue.
DOCTOR: Numbness, alright. And how long exactly is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I believe, around the middle of June. So, about six weeks now, give or take a few days. It isn't constant, it comes and goes, which is what makes it a little difficult to pinpoint exactly when it began. Mostly in my left leg, from the thigh down to my foot.
DOCTOR: Six weeks. And is this numbness associated with any pain, weakness, or changes in your ability to walk?
PATIENT: That's a good question. There isn't any sharp pain, no. It’s more… a tingling sensation when it happens, and sometimes a sort of heavy feeling. As for walking, not really. I haven’t noticed any significant difficulty with that, thankfully. Though, if I’ve been on my feet for a very long stretch, like a full day of work, I might feel a bit more tired than usual in that leg, but I attributed that to just being on my feet so much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things somewhat. And you said it’s primarily in the left leg. Does it ever radiate anywhere else?
PATIENT: Occasionally. It's not a frequent occurrence, but sometimes I'll feel a similar sensation – not as strong, mind you – in my left foot, specifically around my toes. And, very rarely, a bit of the tingling will creep up into my hip, but it's fleeting. It’s hard to describe – it’s not a consistent pattern, really. Does that help? I'm happy to provide more detail if needed. I have a good memory for these sorts of things, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what sort of work do you do, Mr. Kinjerski?
PATIENT: I’m a special effects artist and animator, Doctor. It's a bit of a varied profession. I spend a lot of time at a computer, designing and creating effects for film and games. But I also do some practical effects work – building props, setting up sets, that sort of thing. It can involve long hours standing, moving equipment, and, as I mentioned before, quite a bit of time seated. A lot of it is very physical, actually, despite what people might think.
DOCTOR: I see. A physically demanding profession, despite the creative aspect. Now, have you experienced any recent injuries, even minor ones, to your leg, hip, or back?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. I haven’t had any falls or significant bumps or anything of that nature. I'm usually quite careful, and I don’t engage in any particularly risky activities that might lead to injury. I did help a friend move some furniture about a month ago, and it was a bit strenuous, lifting heavier boxes, but nothing that felt particularly taxing at the time. No immediate pain or anything like that. I pride myself on being quite strong, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I eat a reasonably balanced diet, I exercise regularly when I have the time—though my work can make that challenging at times—and I don’t smoke or drink excessively. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything significant, and I don’t take any regular medications. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything I’ve ingested or come into contact with. I’ve tried various foods over the years, and my skin hasn’t reacted to any particular plants or insects, as far as I can remember. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I can go into detail about things I've specifically been exposed to if that would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, grandparents—who have experienced nerve problems, diabetes, or back issues?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother, on her side, her father – my grandfather – did experience some back problems later in life, arthritis mostly, I believe, and it caused him some discomfort, especially with walking. He didn’t have diabetes, as far as I know. My father’s side of the family… they were mostly healthy, as far as I can recall. No known cases of diabetes or significant nerve problems that I’m aware of. My parents are both still living, and I’m fairly close to them, so I would likely know if they had experienced anything of that nature. I have one younger sister, and she’s also healthy, as far as I’m aware. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know. Now, I'm going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll start by checking your reflexes and sensation in your legs. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. If you could please lie down on your back, that would be great.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, feel free to let me know if there is anything specific I can do to make the examination more comfortable. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Now, I’m going to test sensation in your legs. Please tell me when you feel the light touch. Can you feel this on your left thigh?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that, Doctor. It’s a light touch, but definitely perceptible. No issues there. Is there a particular pattern you’re looking for? Should I describe the sensation in more detail?
DOCTOR: No, just confirm you feel it. Alright, and here, on your left shin?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that as well, Doctor. Again, a light touch, but clear. No trouble detecting it. Is it alright if I ask what you’re looking for, generally? I understand you need to conduct the examination, but knowing the purpose might help me be more specific with my responses.
DOCTOR: I’m assessing for any areas of diminished sensation, Mr. Kinjerski, which can indicate nerve involvement. And here, on the top of your foot?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that, Doctor. It's a bit fainter there, perhaps, compared to my thigh and shin, but definitely present. It's like… a gentle brushing sensation. Is that normal? It might just be the difference in nerve density, if that’s a factor. Would it be helpful if I compared it to the sensation on my right foot to highlight any discrepancies?
DOCTOR: Alright, and here on your right thigh… Yes, you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I feel that. It's comparable to the sensation on my left thigh, perhaps slightly stronger. No issues there. Is something concerning you? I understand if the examination is taking longer than expected, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. I simply want to ensure I provide you with the most accurate information possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. That will be sufficient for now. Based on my brief examination, and your history, it could be a mild case of peripheral neuropathy. However, given your age and overall health, it's less likely. We need to rule out other causes. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a vitamin B12 level. We will also need to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to check for any structural abnormalities. I'll have the lab requisitions and MRI order sent to your insurance.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate the comprehensive approach. Peripheral neuropathy, you say? Is that something serious? And an MRI of my lumbar spine… is that necessary? I understand you’re trying to rule out other causes, but is there anything else we could explore first? Perhaps a nerve conduction study? I’m not trying to question your judgment, of course, just seeking to understand the reasoning behind the chosen course of action. I'd like to be fully informed, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kinjerski, a nerve conduction study might be considered eventually, but it wouldn’t be my first step. An MRI is necessary to rule out spinal stenosis or a herniated disc, which can compress the nerves. Peripheral neuropathy, while not always serious, can be caused by various factors – vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, even autoimmune diseases. We need to determine the underlying cause. The blood work will give us a baseline, and the MRI will provide a visual assessment of your spine. It’s standard procedure, frankly. I don’t appreciate being questioned about my medical judgment. Here are the lab requisitions and the MRI order. The lab is located at… and the MRI facility is at… Schedule the MRI as soon as possible. We’ll review the results when they’re available. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. I apologize if my questions came across as questioning your judgment. It wasn’t my intention to be disrespectful. I simply… prefer to be well-informed about my health, and I tend to ask a lot of questions. I’ll schedule the MRI and blood work as soon as possible. Thank you for your time and attention. If I have any questions regarding the scheduling process, or the results, who should I contact? And roughly how long should I expect to wait for the results? I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, even if I ask a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You can contact the clinic’s scheduling department for the MRI appointment. The lab results should be available within 3-5 business days, and the MRI results typically take a week. I’ll review them when they come in, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Otherwise, I’ll see you when the results are available. Next patient.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. Thank you again for your time. I'll contact the clinic if I have any questions, or if my symptoms worsen. Have a good day, Doctor.
