DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarrotta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Just need to get this card so I can drive people around. Ride-share, you know? I’m San, by the way. I think it’s a commercial driver thing? I don't really understand all the paperwork, to be honest. I just want to make sure I’m allowed to do it legally.
DOCTOR: Alright, San. A commercial driver's license medical card, yes. That makes sense. So, to be clear, you’re looking for a DOT physical to allow you to drive for a ride-sharing service. Just want to confirm that's correct. And it's just the physical exam you need, not a full driver’s license application, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right! Just the physical. I don’t need a new license, just the card to show I’m healthy enough. I hope it's not too much trouble. I'd like to get it done quickly if possible. I have a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: No trouble at all, San. It's a fairly standard exam. It will involve checking your vision, hearing, blood pressure, and a brief physical assessment. We'll also go over your medical history to make sure you meet the DOT requirements. Before we start, could you tell me a little bit about any health conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... Well, I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. And I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, mostly just stiffness. Nothing too bad, I can still get around. I also take a medication for high blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Is that enough? Should I tell you everything? It feels like a long list sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information to start with, San. Gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, arthritis in the knees, and Lisinopril for high blood pressure. No problem at all taking your time – it’s important to be thorough. Do you know what your typical blood pressure reading is at home, if you monitor it?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. My daughter bought me one of those automatic ones. It's usually around 130 over 80, sometimes a little higher if I’m stressed. I try to take it a couple times a week. I don't always remember, though, to be honest. I'm getting older, you know. Things slip my mind. But when I do take it, that's generally what it is.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, San. It’s very common. 130 over 80 is a good starting point. And it’s helpful that you check it when you can. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. I eat pretty much everything. I’ve never had any trouble with penicillin or anything like that, either. Honestly, I can’t even remember ever being allergic to anything. Unless... bees, maybe? I got stung once as a child and it was a bit painful, but I didn’t swell up or anything. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: A mild reaction to a bee sting doesn’t necessarily mean you have a full allergy, San. We’ll just note that you’ve been stung before. Alright, and just to finish up the medical history, have you ever had any serious illnesses like heart problems, diabetes, or lung issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My heart is strong, I've always been active. My father lived to be 95 and he walked every day. I haven’t been diagnosed with diabetes, and my lungs are good as far as I know. I used to smoke, a long time ago, maybe a pack a day, but I quit about thirty years ago when my daughter was born. I haven’t had any trouble breathing or anything like that since. Oh! I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, but I recovered fully. Is that something I need to mention?
DOCTOR: Yes, pneumonia is good to know, San. Thank you for mentioning that. It’s good you recovered fully. Okay, so no heart problems, diabetes, or lung issues currently, and you quit smoking thirty years ago after having pneumonia. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, do you have any family history of serious illnesses like heart disease, stroke, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me think... My mother had high blood pressure, like me. She lived to be 88, though. My father, he was healthy as a horse, didn’t really have any problems. My brother… he has type 2 diabetes, he wasn’t very careful about his diet. And my daughter, thankfully, she’s very healthy. That's all I can really think of right now. It's been a long time since we talked about family history. I hope that's enough information?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, San. High blood pressure in your mother, type 2 diabetes in your brother, and you and your daughter are healthy. Okay, great. Now, let's move on to the physical exam. I’m going to check your vision, hearing, blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. We’ll also do a quick neurological check and check your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Let’s get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the better. I have an appointment later this afternoon. I hope it doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: I understand, San. We'll be as quick as possible. First, let’s check your vision. Could you please read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Okay... um... that's an... F... then a... P... then... B... then... L... and finally... D. Is that right? It's a little blurry without my glasses, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. You can read the top line with some difficulty. Now, let's try the next line down. Please read these letters for me.
PATIENT: Oh dear… it's getting harder. Um… I think that’s a… V… then… Z… and… uh… is that a… K? Oh, I’m sorry, it’s really blurry now. I should have brought my glasses. This is embarrassing.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, San. It's perfectly alright. We can adjust for not having your glasses. Let’s move on to your hearing. I’m going to put these headphones on and play some tones in each ear. Please let me know when you hear the tone, even if it’s faint.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Go ahead. I hope my ears are still working properly. I used to go to a lot of concerts when I was younger. Hopefully I didn't damage them too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m starting with the left ear. Please raise your hand when you hear a tone. … Okay, now the right ear. … Alright, San, your hearing appears to be slightly diminished in both ears, particularly at higher frequencies, which is common with age and noise exposure. We’ll make a note of that. Now let's check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Loud music will do that to you, I guess. Go ahead with the blood pressure. I hope it’s not too high. I had a cup of coffee this morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so, considering you had a cup of coffee this morning. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Your heart and lungs sound clear, with no unusual noises. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological check.
PATIENT: Okay, good to hear. I'm always a little nervous about blood pressure. Go ahead with the check. I hope I can follow your instructions properly. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, San, could you please hold this pen and touch your nose with it?
PATIENT: Okay… like this? Oh dear, I’m sorry. It’s a little shaky. I haven’t done this in years. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, San. A little shakiness is common, especially when you haven’t done this in a while. Now let's try the other hand. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes with this small hammer. This might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Alright. Now let's check your feet for sensation. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Go ahead. I hope I don't flinch. Oh! That was… surprising. Yes, I can feel that… and that… yes, both feet are fine. Can we be done soon? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright, San. That completes the physical exam. Everything appears within normal limits, with the exception of slightly diminished hearing and a mildly elevated blood pressure reading. Your reflexes are normal and you have full sensation in both feet. Based on this exam and your medical history, you are medically cleared to drive commercially, with the recommendation to monitor your blood pressure regularly. I will fill out the DOT medical form for you now. It will take a few minutes. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful! That's such a relief. No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. Just... so I can drive people around without any trouble? That's all I needed to know. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. How long will it take to fill out the form? I really do have that appointment later.
DOCTOR: It will just be a few more minutes, San. I'm finishing it up now. Yes, this form clears you to drive commercially, assuming your blood pressure remains well-managed. Here you go. Please keep this form with you when you drive. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
