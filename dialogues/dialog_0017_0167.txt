DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… my foot. It hurts. A lot. It’s got a… a sore, you see. Been there a while now. It’s not getting better.
DOCTOR: A sore, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a sore. Like… an open wound. On the bottom of my foot. It’s red and… sometimes it weeps a little. It’s very painful when I walk. I try not to walk much. But it’s hard, you know? I like to be outside.
DOCTOR: We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, how long precisely has this “sore” been present?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Let me think… maybe two, three months now? It started small, I thought it was just a… a blister maybe? From my slippers. Then it didn’t go away. And got bigger. It’s hard to say exactly, Doctor. Time goes by…
DOCTOR: Very well. And has anything – any treatment, any change in activity – made it better, or worse, over these two or three months?
PATIENT: I put some bandages on it. And I tried to keep it clean. Wash it with soap and water. That didn’t seem to help much. Maybe a little. But it didn't really help. I stopped walking so much, like I said. I thought that would help, but… it still hurts. It seems to bother me more when I stand for a long time.
DOCTOR: And do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The nurse, she told me… I have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, that's what she called it. I take some pills for that. Every day. And I used to see a doctor for my heart, but… it's been a while. I think it's okay now.
DOCTOR: Diabetes. Of course. And what medications are you taking for your diabetes, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have a little bag at home with all my pills. Um… there's a white one, and a yellow one, and a small blue one. I take… two of the white ones in the morning, and one of the yellow ones at night. And sometimes the blue one, if I feel… not so good. I’m not very good with remembering names, Doctor. My wife used to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Names are important, Mr. Stoegbauer. Very well. Let's move on. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway. I take a lot of things over the years… My wife always checked, but… she's gone now. So I just take what the doctors give me. I’ve never had a rash or… anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at this foot. Please, sit here and remove your sock and shoe on that side. We need to assess the situation directly. Don't waste my time.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Yes, right away. It’s a little stiff, my foot. Getting older, you know. Here we go… Careful now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, quite the ulceration. Approximately 2 centimeters in diameter, located on the plantar aspect of the first metatarsal head. Significant erythema and some purulent drainage. Capillary refill is… sluggish. This is concerning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Very concerning.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, Doctor. Sluggish? What does that mean, exactly? Is it… serious? It hurts terribly, you see. I just want it to feel better. I don’t like going to the hospital…
DOCTOR: Sluggish capillary refill indicates compromised circulation, Mr. Stoegbauer. Which, given your history of diabetes, is precisely what I expected. You likely have a diabetic foot ulcer, and it requires prompt attention. While I can provide some local wound care here in the office, the severity suggests you'll need to see a podiatrist. And possibly a vascular surgeon, depending on further evaluation. I will write you a referral. Do not delay. This can lead to serious complications, including infection and, potentially, amputation.
PATIENT: Amputation? Oh, no… No, Doctor, that can’t be. My wife… she always took care of my feet. I don’t understand. Is there nothing else? Can't you do something now? I just want it to heal, not… not lose my foot.
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, I am not performing a miracle. I can debride the wound and apply a topical antibiotic, but without addressing the underlying vascular insufficiency and controlling your blood sugar, this will merely be a temporary measure. The referral to the podiatrist and vascular surgeon is crucial. Here. Schedule appointments immediately. And I strongly advise you to follow up with your primary care physician to ensure your diabetes is well-managed. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I… I understand. Podiatrist… vascular… it sounds very serious. Is there… is there anything I can do? Besides the appointments? To… to help it heal? Just something… small? I don't want to lose my foot.
DOCTOR: Strict blood sugar control is paramount, Mr. Stoegbauer. Diet and medication adherence, as prescribed by your physician. Keep the wound clean and dry. Absolutely no pressure on that foot. Elevate it whenever possible. And for goodness sake, wear properly fitting shoes. That is all you can do. Now, do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you… I will make the appointments. Thank you for seeing me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Stoegbauer. And do not neglect the referrals. .
