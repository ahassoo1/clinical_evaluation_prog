DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… painful. That is why I am here. I would like to finish this quickly, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I'll do my best to be efficient. “Painful” is a little broad though – could you tell me more specifically where you’re experiencing pain, and what that pain feels like?
PATIENT: It is in my back. Lower back, mostly. It feels… like a heavy weight is always on it. And it burns, sometimes. Especially when I bend over. I do a lot of work with fences, you see. Heavy lifting. It’s been this way for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, feeling like a heavy weight, and burning when you bend over. And this is related to your work with fences, heavy lifting. How long has this been going on for, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: About… six months, I think. Maybe a little longer. It started slow, just a little ache after work. But it got worse and worse. Now it’s… constant. Even when I am resting.
DOCTOR: Six months, starting with a mild ache and progressing to constant pain even at rest. Has anything specific made it better at all?
PATIENT: Nothing, really. I’ve tried… sitting differently. Lying down. Warm baths help a little, for a short time. But it always comes back. I took some pills my friend gave me, once. But they didn't do much. I don't remember what they were.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant relief with positioning, warm baths provide temporary improvement, and you tried some medication from a friend – which is good to know, but we’ll want to stick to things prescribed specifically for you. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now?… Maybe a six. It’s not the worst it’s been. But it’s always there, nagging. It makes it hard to sleep, sometimes. And… hard to do my work, obviously. Six feels right. Maybe seven on a bad day.
DOCTOR: Alright, a six to seven, with difficulty sleeping and affecting your work. Let's talk a bit more broadly. Aside from your back, have you noticed any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: No. Just my back. My knees ache a little sometimes, when it’s cold, but that’s just… old age, I suppose. Nothing like this back pain. It's mostly in my lower back, and… sometimes it shoots down my leg, a little. Not always. But when it does, it feels… like pins and needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, the pain radiates down your leg, with a pins-and-needles sensation at times. That's important information. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about other things, just to get a complete picture. Have you had any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little… clumsy sometimes. But I always figured that was from being tired. It’s hard work, you know? I haven’t noticed any real… weakness. I can still walk and everything. But… I drop things more than I used to. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That does count, Ms. Reihner. Thank you for telling me. Have you had any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: No. Everything is… normal, there. I’m sorry. I don’t understand why you are asking about… that. Is this important? I would like to get this over with, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Reihner. I apologize if these questions seem personal, but they help me rule out other possibilities and ensure I provide the best care. It’s important to be thorough. Changes in bowel or bladder function can sometimes be related to back pain, so I need to ask. Since you haven't experienced any changes, that's good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions, such as diabetes, arthritis, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor sometimes, but they don't usually find anything wrong. I had a… problem with my heart, years ago, but that was fixed. My husband… he passed away, a few years back. That’s about it. I don’t take any regular medicine, besides what I bought at the store for a cold, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Reihner. My condolences for your loss. It's helpful to know about the previous heart problem. And that you don't currently take any regular medications. Before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I'm Lakota. We didn’t use much medicine when I was growing up. Just… herbs and things. Now, can we please get this over with? My back is really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. We will. I just want to finish gathering some information, and then we'll move on to the physical exam. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as back problems, arthritis, or heart disease?
PATIENT: My mother had… arthritis, I think. In her hands. It made it hard for her to cook. My father… he died young. From a fever, I think. We didn't have good doctors back then. No one really talked about things like family history. It wasn’t important. Can we just look at my back now? I'm getting tired of talking.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Reihner. We can do that now. I understand your frustration. Let’s move on to the physical exam. I’m going to need you to lie down on the examination table. I'll start by feeling your back to check for tenderness and muscle spasms. Then I'll ask you to move in a few different directions to assess your range of motion. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… alright. Just be gentle, please. And hurry. I have fences to fix.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. I will be as gentle as possible. I'm going to start by feeling along your spine and the muscles on either side. Please let me know immediately if anything is particularly painful. Okay, tell me if this is tender… right here?
PATIENT: Ow. Yes. Right there. That’s… very tender. And… it feels tight. Like a knot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here, on the left side?
PATIENT: Not as bad. A little sore. But mostly… it's right there, where you were just pressing. It feels… like it's going down my leg now, a little. The pins and needles. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask you to gently bend forward, as far as you comfortably can. Please stop if you feel any sharp pain. Alright, go ahead…
PATIENT: Ow. I can’t go much further. It… really hurts. And now my leg feels… numb. Just a little. It’s hard to bend over. I haven’t been able to do that properly for months. Stop, please. It's making it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner, stop right there. No need to push yourself. I'm noting all of this. Your range of motion is limited, and bending forward causes significant pain and exacerbates the numbness in your leg. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes in your legs. Please relax your legs, and I'll tap on your knees with this little hammer.
PATIENT: That tickles. And… it doesn't feel right. It feels… weak. Like it’s harder to move them. My husband used to say I had strong legs. From all the work I do. But… now they don’t feel so strong. Are you sure this isn’t something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. I understand your concern, and we will get to the bottom of this. Now, I'm going to check the sensation in your legs. Please tell me if you can feel me touching your legs when I touch them with this. Can you feel this on the top of your foot?
PATIENT: Yes… but it's not as strong as it should be. It feels… muffled. Like someone turned the volume down. Can I sit up now? This is… very uncomfortable. I need to go fix those fences. They won’t fix themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner, you can sit up. And I understand you have fences to fix. Based on the physical exam, you have tenderness in your lower back, limited range of motion, diminished reflexes, and reduced sensation in your legs, along with radiating pain and numbness. This pattern of symptoms is concerning for possible nerve compression, potentially caused by a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. It’s important to rule out other causes as well. To get a clearer picture, I recommend an MRI of your lower back. This will allow us to visualize the spinal cord and nerves and identify any abnormalities. I am also going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. In the meantime, I will prescribe a short course of muscle relaxants and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to help manage your pain and inflammation. I also recommend gentle stretching and avoiding any heavy lifting or activities that exacerbate your symptoms. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: MRI? Blood work? That sounds… expensive. And I can't just avoid heavy lifting. That’s my job. What if it’s something really bad? I don't have time for… all of this. I just need something to fix my back so I can get back to work. Can’t you just give me a shot or something? My friend said a shot worked wonders for her. I don't want to spend a lot of money on tests. What does the shot cost? And… will I be able to work after the shot?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Reihner. I know the thought of tests and the potential cost can be worrying, and I want to assure you I'll do everything I can to help. While a shot might provide temporary relief, it won’t address the underlying cause of your symptoms, and the effects are often short-lived. It also carries risks, and without knowing the exact cause, it could potentially mask a more serious problem. The MRI is the best way to get a definitive diagnosis, so we know exactly what we are dealing with. I will have my staff check with your Medicare plan to see what portion of the cost is covered. We can also discuss financial assistance options if needed. Regarding the shot, it would cost approximately $150, but again, it's a temporary fix. The MRI will cost more initially, but it's an investment in getting the right treatment and preventing long-term complications. I am concerned about the nerve compression and the potential for weakness in your legs. We need to rule out anything serious before proceeding with any treatment. In the meantime, I will prescribe the muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory medication. I will also give you a handout with gentle stretching exercises. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the MRI and blood work?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Order the tests. But make sure they cover as much as possible with Medicare. And… hurry. I have fences to fix. Can I get the prescriptions now? I need to go. And please… don’t make me come back for more tests unless it’s absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I will make sure my staff prioritizes these orders and assists you with scheduling the MRI appointment. I will also send the prescriptions electronically to your pharmacy of choice. They should be ready shortly. Here is a handout with gentle stretching exercises for your back and legs. Please follow these instructions carefully, and avoid any activities that exacerbate your symptoms. I understand you're eager to get back to work, and I want to help you do that safely. I will review the results of the tests as soon as they are available and contact you with a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as increased weakness, numbness, or bowel/bladder dysfunction, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… hurry. And thank you.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Reihner. I'll have my staff assist you with scheduling the tests and getting your prescriptions. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. .
