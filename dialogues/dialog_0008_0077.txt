DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I'm Dr. Cumper. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Bigger is the name. They told me to come... something about the mine? Been working there a long time, you know. They want me checked, even though I feel alright. Just routine, I suppose. Don't understand why they bother with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. It is a routine check-up, as you said, part of the clinic’s program with the mine. It’s good they’re being proactive. Even if you’re feeling alright, it's important to get a baseline assessment, especially with long-term exposure like that. To start, can you tell me a bit more about what kind of work you do at the mine?
PATIENT: Work? I operate the machines. Big ones. Move the rocks and dirt. Been doing it… goodness, almost fifty years now. Underground mostly. Dark, dusty place. Always is. They give us masks, of course. But you can still feel it in your lungs, you know? Not that I'm complaining. It's a job. A good job. Always been a good job. Though, younger folks don't want it these days. Too hard.
DOCTOR: Fifty years… that’s a long time. And underground work with dust exposure… okay. Do you find yourself coughing much?
PATIENT: Coughing? Sometimes. Everyone coughs, Doctor. Especially in the winter. Old age, you know? Not a special cough. Just… a cough. Nothing to write home about. I don't wheeze or anything. And I ain't spit up no blood, if that's what you're thinking. I'm a strong man, still. Stronger than most these youngsters. Don't need fancy medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no blood, no wheezing. Just a general cough, mostly in the winter. Good to know. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, even with light activity?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Hmm… not really. Maybe when I’m climbing the stairs at home? But who doesn't get winded going up stairs these days? It's a lot of stairs, you know. Old house. They don't build 'em like they used to. And I ain't exactly a spring chicken anymore. It's just… normal, I think. You get old, things slow down. Ain't got the same puff as when I was a boy.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, mainly a cough, and a bit of shortness of breath with stairs. Have you ever smoked, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Smoked? Me? No, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for you, you know. Always thought it was foolish. My wife… she didn’t like it either. Good woman, my wife. Passed away five years ago. Smart woman. Wouldn't let me near the things. And I listened to her. Always did.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Bigger. That must be difficult. Alright, no smoking history, which is excellent. Now, let's talk about any other medical conditions you might have. Have you been diagnosed with anything else, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think the doctor mentioned something once, years ago. Said I needed to watch the salt. But I feel fine, you know? I take a little pill sometimes, when I remember. Don't bother me much. Nothing serious. And no diabetes. I like my sweets, but I ain't got the sickness. Heart… never had any trouble with my heart. Still ticking strong, as far as I know. Always been a strong man, I told you. A very strong man.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, sometimes. That's good. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Medication… hmm… let me think. It’s a small white pill. That’s about all I know, Doctor. The wife used to handle all that. Filled the little boxes, made sure I took it. Now… I just see the white pill and I take it. Can’t recall the name, sorry. Too many things to remember when you get old. Just a white pill. That's what I know. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Bigger, don't worry about it. It's just helpful to know. We can look it up later. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had bad knees. Arthritis, I think they called it. Couldn’t walk much when she got old. My father… he died young. Heart trouble, they said. Sudden like. But that was a long time ago. And my sister… she's still alive, thank goodness. Healthy as a horse, that one. Always been lucky, that sister. Not much else to tell you, Doctor. Nothing fancy. We ain’t a family with special sicknesses. Just… regular people.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with arthritis, father with early heart trouble, sister healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That’s about it. Long time ago. They didn’t have fancy things like they do now. Just… cut it out. And I had a small thing on my eye, years ago. A doctor removed it. Nothing major. Small thing. A little cut, a little bandage. Not like some of these youngsters, always getting things fixed. I’m a tough man. Don't need much fixing.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal as a boy, and a small procedure on your eye. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the white pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the white pill, Doctor. Sometimes I take something for my knees, when they bother me. But not all the time. Just when they ache. Something over the counter. You know, the kind you buy at the shop. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. Helps a little. But I try not to take too much. Don't want to ruin my stomach. Old man's stomach, you know. Delicate. Just the white pill, and sometimes the ibuprofen. That’s all. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, white pill for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. And one last thing before we do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. Never been allergic to anything. Maybe a little dust sometimes… but who isn’t in my line of work? But not a real allergy. Just makes me cough a little. My wife… she was allergic to cats. Couldn’t be around them. But me? I can eat anything. Strong man’s stomach, remember? Never had a problem. Never. Don't need to worry about allergies with me, Doctor. Never have.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Go ahead, Doctor. Do what you need to do. I haven't got anything to hide. Strong man, remember? Just don't poke too much. Old bones, you know. And don't be surprised if you hear a little rumble in my chest. That's just the mine. Been down there a long time. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. I’ll start with your heart. Take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, slightly diminished. No murmurs detected. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, with some mild end-expiratory wheezing noted. Now, I'm going to listen to each of your lobes. Please take a deep breath in when I tell you to.
PATIENT: Wheezing, you say? Hmm. Told you, Doctor. That's just the mine. Dark, dusty place. Been breathing that air for fifty years. Always been a little rumble in my chest. Nothing to worry about. Don't fuss too much over it. I feel alright, you know. Strong man. Just do what you need to do. Don't take too long now, alright? Got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Lung sounds remain clear with mild, end-expiratory wheezing bilaterally. I’m going to check your throat and ears now. Throat is clear, no significant inflammation. Ear canals clear, tympanic membranes intact. Pulses are present and regular, slightly diminished in the extremities. Everything seems generally okay, Mr. Bigger, but the mild wheezing and diminished lung sounds do warrant further investigation given your long-term exposure at the mine.
PATIENT: Further investigation? What’s that mean, Doctor? You gonna cut me open? I told you, I’m a strong man. Don’t need no cutting. This wheezing… it’s just the mine. Always been there. You’re makin’ me nervous now. Just tell me if I’m alright or not. I ain’t got time for fancy tests. Fifty years down there, you know. I’m used to a little rumble in the chest. It ain’t botherin’ me none.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your concerns. No, I’m not suggesting surgery. What I mean by further investigation is a simple chest X-ray and possibly a breathing test—a spirometry—to assess your lung function. It's a standard procedure, and it will help us understand what might be causing the wheezing and ensure there isn’t any underlying damage from the dust exposure. It’s not about thinking you’re unwell right now, but about establishing a baseline and monitoring your lung health over time, especially given your long career in the mine. It's a preventative measure. It will take only a few minutes and could provide us with valuable information. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Breathing test? Sounds… complicated. And expensive. I got bills to pay, Doctor. Is it really necessary? I feel alright. Strong man, remember? Always been alright. I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. Maybe… maybe just leave it alone? I'll just keep takin' my white pill and avoid the dust when I can. It’s been fifty years, you know. If somethin' was gonna happen, it would've happened by now. Don’t want to waste my time on fancy tests. I got things to do. Is there somethin' else we can do? Just tell me I'm alright and I'll go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your reluctance. However, given your long-term exposure to dust at the mine, it’s important to rule out any potential lung conditions, even if you’re currently feeling well. It's possible to have changes in your lungs without experiencing noticeable symptoms. We can discuss the cost with the billing department and see if insurance covers the tests. As for your time, the X-ray and breathing test can both be done quickly, often within the same visit. If you're truly hesitant about the tests right now, we can proceed without them. However, I strongly recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment in six months for a repeat physical exam and assessment of your lung function. We can then compare the results and determine if any further investigation is needed. Would you be comfortable with scheduling a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Six months… hmm. That’s a long time. But… alright. A follow-up appointment. I suppose I can do that. But no fancy tests right now, alright? Just a check-up. And make it quick. I don’t like spendin’ all day at the doctor's office. And… and don't tell me nothin' is wrong if I start coughin’ more. I want to know if somethin' is actually happenin’. I'm a strong man, but even strong men get old, you know. Alright. Schedule the appointment. Six months. That’s it. And make sure it’s with you, Doctor. I don't want to see anyone else.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. I’ve scheduled a follow-up appointment for you with me in six months. We’ll repeat the physical exam and assess your lung function then. And I absolutely promise to be upfront and honest with you if anything changes. I've also made a note in your chart to discuss the potential benefits of pulmonary function testing at that time. Here's a card with the appointment details. Please call if you need to reschedule. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
