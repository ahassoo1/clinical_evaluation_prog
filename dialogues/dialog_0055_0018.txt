DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… rather difficult to put into words precisely. I seem to be going to the bathroom… a lot. More than usual, certainly. It's been going on for a little while now, though I can’t say exactly how long. My memory isn’t what it once was, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when things aren’t as clear as one would like. Frequent urination… alright. And would you describe it as painful, or just… frequent?
PATIENT: No, not painful, Doctor. Just… a lot. It doesn’t hurt, thankfully. It’s more… inconvenient, really. And a bit disruptive to my sleep, if I'm being honest. I find myself getting up quite a bit during the night. I suppose I should also mention… I seem to be drinking a good deal more water than usual as well. Though, again, I can’t pinpoint when that started. It just feels… natural now, to reach for a glass.
DOCTOR: Alright. Frequent urination, no pain, disruptive sleep, and increased fluid intake. I see. And is this increased urination constant throughout the day, or is it worse at certain times?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question, Doctor. I believe… it’s rather consistent, actually. Not particularly worse at any specific time, as far as I can recall. It’s… just always there, if you understand. Perhaps a little more noticeable in the evenings, simply because I’m not distracted by other things then. But truly, it doesn’t seem to follow a pattern. I apologize for being so vague. It's just... difficult to remember specifics.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Verbos. We’ll work through it. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Past medical history… let me see. That’s… a bit of a challenge, Doctor. I’ve seen a few doctors over the years, of course. Standard things, I suppose. A cold here, a bit of the flu there. Nothing… serious, as I recall. I think I had my appendix removed many years ago, but I could be mistaken. And… I believe I was told I had slightly elevated blood pressure at one point, but that was a long time ago, and I’m not certain if I ever required any treatment for it. Honestly, my records are… scattered, to say the least. Would it be alright if we perhaps… skipped that, and focused on your questions? I fear I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: We can certainly attempt to proceed, but it’s important to have a complete picture, if possible. Do you recall approximately when you might have had your appendix removed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… quite a long time ago, Doctor. I would estimate… perhaps in my early thirties? Though, truthfully, that’s just a guess. It was before I moved here, certainly. I lived in Prague at the time. It was a small hospital, nothing fancy. The doctor was… very kind, I recall. But the details… they’re rather hazy. I apologize again for my poor memory. It’s most frustrating for both of us, I’m sure. Was there a specific reason you ask about the appendix? Perhaps knowing that will help me recall more.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Verbos. Knowing approximately when it occurred is helpful. We simply need to rule out any potential complications, although it's unlikely after such a long period. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s another difficult one, Doctor. My parents… they’ve both passed away now, many years ago. My mother… she lived a long life, but I don’t recall her having any significant illnesses. My father… he had some heart trouble towards the end, I believe. Nothing too serious, as I recall. And I had a sister, but we weren’t particularly close, and I didn’t keep track of her medical affairs, if she had any. I am afraid I can't offer much in the way of specifics. I was never one for keeping track of such things, you see. I always focused on my work. Environmental engineering tends to absorb all one’s attention, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright. Now, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… well, I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s the extent of it. Very rarely, mind you. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no. I am a scientist, you see. A bit of a bookworm, if I’m being honest. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book to… those sorts of things. I find them rather… unpleasant, to be frank. I've always been quite health-conscious, in my own way.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, mind you. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I don’t feel the need for much in the way of supplements. And over-the-counter drugs… perhaps an aspirin now and then, for a headache, but that’s about it. I really try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. Oh, wait! There is one thing… my neighbor, Mrs. Novak, gave me some herbal tea a few weeks ago. She said it was good for… something. Digestion, perhaps? I’ve only had a cup or two, though. I don't recall the name of it, unfortunately. It tasted rather… floral.
DOCTOR: Floral, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Quite floral. And a bit… earthy, I suppose. It didn't taste unpleasant, mind you, but I wouldn't say it was particularly memorable. I only accepted it out of politeness, really. Mrs. Novak is a very kind woman, and she’s always trying to help. But I am not one for herbal remedies, generally speaking. I prefer to rely on… established medical practices. I haven't noticed any particular effects from it, if that's what you’re asking. Just thought I should mention it, in case it was relevant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Verbos, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, certainly. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, of course. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Please, proceed as you see fit. I will do my best to cooperate. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I hope I’m not too much trouble. My… condition, you understand. It’s difficult to lie still for extended periods sometimes. But I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Verbos. We’ll take it at your pace. First, I’d like to check your vital signs. Relax your arm for me, please. 148 over 88. A bit elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72 and regular. Respiration is 16 and unlabored. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, but I detect a slight murmur. Not particularly concerning, but worth noting. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. No tenderness or masses noted. Bladder feels slightly full, which could explain some of your frequent urination. Everything seems relatively normal, although your elevated blood pressure and slightly full bladder are areas we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Hmm… a slightly full bladder, you say? That doesn’t surprise me in the least, Doctor. As I mentioned, I am going to the bathroom quite frequently. And the murmur… well, I haven’t been feeling particularly unwell, so I suppose it’s nothing to worry about unduly. You mentioned investigating further, though? What did you have in mind? I confess, I am not particularly fond of… invasive procedures, if you understand. Perhaps some blood tests would be sufficient?
DOCTOR: Blood tests are a good starting point, Mr. Verbos. We’ll start with a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to assess kidney function and electrolytes, and a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, to rule out any prostate issues, given your age and symptoms. As for invasive procedures, we will certainly not proceed with anything without a thorough discussion and your full consent. A urinalysis is also standard practice. It’s a simple test to check for infection or other abnormalities. As for the murmur, we may consider an echocardiogram, a non-invasive ultrasound of the heart, if it persists or worsens. Would you be amenable to those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… reasonable. Blood tests, a urinalysis… I suppose those are perfectly acceptable. I am not particularly keen on the ultrasound, if it can be avoided, but I trust your judgment. If you deem it necessary, then I will, of course, cooperate. As long as it’s non-invasive, that is. And you promise to discuss everything with me beforehand? I simply dislike surprises, you see. When can I expect to have these tests done? And will they require any special preparation on my part? I wouldn’t want to… inconvenience anyone.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verbos. I promise a full discussion before any procedure, and we’ll proceed at your pace. The blood tests and urinalysis can be done right here in the clinic today. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare—just avoid eating a large meal beforehand, and drink plenty of water. The results should be available within a few days. Once we have those, we’ll discuss them and decide if further testing is necessary. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a fluid diary to track your intake and output. It may help us identify any patterns or triggers for your frequent urination. I’m sending the orders to the lab now. A nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… quite satisfactory. A fluid diary, you say? Very well, I shall do my best to keep track of my intake. It’s a bit tedious, to be honest, but I understand the importance of thoroughness. And a nurse will be with me shortly? Excellent. I appreciate your… patience and understanding, Doctor. It’s most reassuring to know that you’re taking my concerns seriously. I confess, I've sometimes felt dismissed by other doctors in the past. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbos. It's my job to listen and provide the best possible care. Please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or concerns at any time. We will work through this together. A nurse, Emily, will be in shortly to assist you with the blood work and urine sample. In the meantime, feel free to relax. We'll review the results as soon as they're available, and develop a plan from there. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this moment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s all for now. I appreciate your thoroughness and your… kindness. I feel much more at ease knowing that we have a plan in place. I shall do my best to keep track of my fluids, and I will await the results with… cautious optimism. Thank you again for your time and attention. I suppose I will just… sit here quietly and try not to worry.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Verbos. Just relax, and Emily will be with you shortly. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
