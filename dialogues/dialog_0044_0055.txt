DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. Why don’t you have a seat and tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, frankly, I’ve been hearing a great deal about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, keeps going on about it for… well, for everything. And honestly, it sounds rather… undignified. But she insists it might help with my… discomfort. So, I thought I'd simply inquire about getting a… certification, if that’s the correct term.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ellan. It's good you're being proactive and exploring options. “Certification” is a common term, yes, though we typically call it a medical cannabis recommendation here. It sounds like your daughter has sparked your interest, and you’re understandably curious. Before we discuss that further, and to ensure it’s a suitable path for you, could you tell me a little more about this “discomfort” you mentioned?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor. Must we be so… blunt? It's simply… the aches and pains that come with getting older. A bit in the joints, mostly. It’s not as though I’m suffering from some dreadful illness. It’s just… inconvenient. And makes gardening rather more difficult, which is a great shame. I do enjoy my roses, you see. But, to be perfectly clear, it’s not debilitating.
DOCTOR: Of course, I apologize. You are absolutely right; we should proceed at your pace. And gardening is important – a wonderful hobby. It’s good to maintain activity. “Aches and pains” can mean a lot of different things, though. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… a dull ache, mostly. In my knees, predominantly. And sometimes in my lower back. It’s worse in the mornings, naturally. And after I’ve been… exerting myself. Which, as I said, includes gardening. It’s not a sharp pain, Doctor. It’s just… there. A constant reminder of the indignities of aging. Honestly, I used to be so active. I danced, you know. Ballroom dancing. But these days… it’s rather difficult.
DOCTOR: I see. A dull ache, worse in the mornings and after activity. Ballroom dancing sounds lovely – that's a good level of activity. And it's understandable that it’s more difficult now. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say this pain is on a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Really, Doctor? A scale? Well, I suppose… on a good day, perhaps a three. A four, if I’ve been particularly ambitious in the garden. But rarely more than that. It’s not as though I’m incapacitated, you understand. I simply… feel it. And it’s… bothersome. I haven’t taken anything for it, mind you. I prefer to simply… endure.
DOCTOR: Okay, a three or four on a typical day. And you prefer to endure rather than take medication. That's perfectly valid. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your knees or back?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… Nothing significant, no. I was quite a sporty child, you know. A bit of netball, some tennis. A few scrapes and bruises, naturally. But no broken bones, no serious injuries. I did twist my ankle once, decades ago, but it healed quite well. And I had a rather nasty fall in the garden last year – tripped over a rose bush, if you can believe it! – but thankfully, only a few bruises and a bruised ego. Nothing that required a visit to the doctor, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant injuries. A bit of sports in your youth, a twisted ankle, and a fall last year – thankfully nothing serious. That's good to know. Now, to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Must we go through all of this? I assure you, I am in perfectly good health for a woman of my age. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat and how much I exercise. But if you insist… I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course. Measles, mumps, that sort of thing. And I had a rather unpleasant bout of the flu a few years ago, but I recovered quickly. I've never been a smoker, and I only drink a small glass of wine with dinner. I don’t have any allergies, and I’m not currently taking any medications. Is that sufficient, Doctor? Or are you planning to interrogate me further?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly sufficient for now, Ellan. Thank you for that thorough overview. It sounds like you’ve led a very healthy life, which is wonderful. And I assure you, I’m not interrogating you! I simply want to ensure I have a complete picture before discussing any potential options. Now, just to be complete, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… well, my mother lived to be 85, she had some… arthritis, naturally, in her hands and knees. My father had high blood pressure, but that was due to his… temperament, I suspect. My sister is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. And my brother… well, he had some problems with his… digestion, but I don’t believe it’s relevant. Honestly, Doctor, are you looking for some sort of genetic predisposition to… aches and pains? It runs in every family, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: You’re right, Ellan. Aches and pains do seem to run in many families. And it’s helpful to know. Now, before we discuss medical cannabis, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your knees and back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor? Is that truly necessary? I assure you, my knees and back are perfectly… adequate. I don't see the point of subjecting myself to… poking and prodding. I came here for information about medical cannabis, not a… diagnosis. However… if you insist… I suppose I can allow a very brief examination. But please be gentle. And I would prefer not to undress. Is that acceptable?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. Absolutely. We can certainly keep your clothing on, and I'll be as gentle as possible. A quick exam will simply help me understand the range of motion in your knees and back, and identify any potential sources of discomfort. It will also help me determine if medical cannabis is a suitable option for you, and if so, which type might be most effective. If you're comfortable, let's start with your knees. Could you please sit on the examination table, and I'll ask you to bend and straighten them a few times?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But do be quick about it. I have a garden to tend, you know. And I do not enjoy being… manipulated. Although… my roses are rather demanding, so perhaps a little manipulation is to be expected. Very well, proceed. But gently, please. And do let me know when it’s over.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. We will take it slowly and gently. Okay, I’m just feeling around your knees now. Do you feel any pain or tenderness in a specific spot?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, there! Just there, on the inside. Not excruciating, but… unpleasant. It's always been a bit sensitive, that knee. I twisted it years ago, as I mentioned. It seems to bother me more when it's cold. And after I've been… kneeling in the garden. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure you need to… press so hard? It’s hardly a scientific examination, is it?
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ellan. I didn’t mean to cause any discomfort. You’re right, it doesn’t need to be painful. Just feeling for tenderness. Okay, can you gently bend your knee for me, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: There! That’s as far as I can go without… significant discomfort. It feels rather… stiff. And creaky. Honestly, Doctor, it sounds like an old door hinge. It's hardly surprising, considering my age. And all the gardening I do. But please, don't push it. I don't want to end up with a… seized-up knee. That would be most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We won’t push it. Your range of motion is slightly limited, and there's some discomfort with bending. Now, let's check your right knee. Any pain or tenderness on this side?
PATIENT: No, not on this side. Just a bit of… general stiffness, perhaps. Nothing significant. It’s not nearly as troublesome as the left one. Honestly, Doctor, you're making me feel rather… old. I used to be so agile. Ballroom dancing, you know. But I suppose time takes its toll on all of us. And gardening is rather hard on the joints.
DOCTOR: Okay, and can you gently bend this knee for me?
PATIENT: There. That’s quite comfortable, actually. Not nearly as limited as the other one. It feels… adequate. Though I suspect it’s only a matter of time before it starts to… complain. Honestly, Doctor, you're making me dwell on my age. It's most unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your right knee has a better range of motion. Now, let's check your lower back. Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, right there! Just below the belt, on the left side. It's a dull ache, really. Not sharp, but… persistent. It flares up after I've been… bending over the rose bushes, of course. It's hardly surprising. Honestly, Doctor, you're reminding me of all the things I can't do anymore. It's most demoralizing. But proceed, if you must. Gently, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. Can you gently bend forward for me, as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: There! That’s as far as I can go without… significant discomfort. It feels rather… stiff. And creaky. Honestly, Doctor, I sound like an old rocking chair. It's hardly surprising, considering my age. And all the gardening I do. But please, don't push it. I don't want to end up with a… pulled muscle. That would be most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We won’t push it. That’s sufficient. Alright, Ellan, thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some typical age-related joint pain and stiffness, likely exacerbated by your gardening. It doesn't seem to be anything serious, but it’s understandably causing you some discomfort. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: “Typical age-related joint pain”? Honestly, Doctor, you’re hardly offering a groundbreaking diagnosis. I know I have aches and pains. I simply wanted to know if medical cannabis might offer some… relief. And frankly, I'm not convinced. It sounds rather… undignified. But proceed, if you must. Tell me, what precisely does one do with this… medical cannabis? And what are the… side effects? I do not want to end up… incapacitated.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Ellan. And it's good you’re thinking critically about it. You’re right, it's not a groundbreaking diagnosis, but it helps us determine the best course of action. Medical cannabis comes in many forms – oils, tinctures, capsules, and even topical creams. For your situation, an oil or tincture taken under the tongue might be a good starting point. It allows for precise dosing and relatively quick absorption. The goal isn't to become “incapacitated,” but rather to manage your pain and stiffness so you can continue to enjoy your gardening and other activities. As for side effects, they are generally mild. Some people experience dry mouth, dizziness, or drowsiness. Rarely, it can cause anxiety or changes in appetite. We start with a very low dose and gradually increase it until you find the optimal level, carefully monitoring for any side effects. We would also need to consider potential interactions with any medications you might be taking, although you've indicated you aren't currently taking any. Do you have any concerns about trying it?
PATIENT: “Dry mouth”? Honestly, Doctor, I barely drink a glass of wine with dinner. The thought of deliberately inducing dry mouth is… unappealing. And “dizziness”? I have roses to tend, you know. I cannot afford to be… unsteady on my feet. And “changes in appetite”? I maintain a very strict diet. The idea of deliberately altering my system… it’s rather unsettling. And frankly, I’m not convinced it’s worth the risk. Although… if it truly could alleviate my… discomfort… perhaps a very small dose might be worth considering. But I insist on absolute control over the quantity. And I would need a detailed explanation of the… procedure. And I would require a guarantee that it will not interfere with my gardening. Do you understand? This is not a decision to be taken lightly.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Ellan. This is a very sensible approach, and you’re right to be cautious and prioritize control. We will proceed at your pace, with complete transparency and a focus on minimizing any potential risks. Here’s how it would work: If you decide to try it, we start with a very low dose of a full-spectrum CBD oil with a small amount of THC – less than 0.3%, which is the legal limit and unlikely to cause any noticeable psychoactive effects. We would start with just a few drops under your tongue, and you’d track your symptoms and any side effects. We’d gradually increase the dose over several days or weeks, as needed, until you find the optimal level for managing your pain and stiffness. I would provide you with detailed instructions on how to administer the oil, as well as a symptom tracker. We’d schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor your progress and address any concerns. And I can absolutely assure you that our goal is to help you manage your pain without interfering with your gardening. Before we proceed, I want to ensure you understand the potential benefits and risks, and that you are comfortable with the process. Do you have any specific questions about any of these steps?
PATIENT: Very well. A “very low dose” is… acceptable. And I appreciate your assurance that it will not interfere with my gardening. Although, I must confess, the idea of deliberately altering my system still… unsettles me. What precisely is this… “full-spectrum CBD oil”? Is it… natural? I do not want to be ingesting any artificial chemicals. And what are the… potential interactions with my… rose fertilizer? I use a rather potent formula, you see. And finally… will it show up on any… medical tests? I have a check-up scheduled next month, and I would prefer not to explain… this.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ellan, and it's good you're thinking ahead. "Full-spectrum CBD oil" is derived from the hemp plant, a cousin of marijuana, but contains less than 0.3% THC, the psychoactive compound. It's considered a natural product, and the quality can vary depending on the source. We use a reputable brand that is third-party tested for purity and potency, ensuring it contains no artificial chemicals or contaminants. I can provide you with the lab reports if you’d like. As for interactions with your rose fertilizer, that’s unlikely. The oil is ingested and processed by your body, while the fertilizer is applied topically to the plants. There’s no known interaction between the two. Regarding medical tests, CBD is not typically detected on standard drug tests, which primarily screen for THC. However, it can sometimes cause a slight elevation in certain liver enzymes. I will inform the lab that you are using CBD prior to your check-up, so they can interpret the results accordingly. To summarize, the risk of interference with your gardening or medical tests is very low, and we will take every precaution to minimize any potential side effects. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: Very well. If you assure me it will not interfere with my roses… and if you provide me with the lab reports… and if you promise to inform the lab about this… “CBD”… I suppose I might be willing to… try a very small dose. But I insist on starting with the absolute minimum. And I expect regular monitoring. And if I experience any… unpleasant side effects… I expect immediate attention. Do you understand? This is not a decision to be taken lightly. My roses are counting on me.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Ellan. And I assure you, your roses are in safe hands – and so are you. We will proceed with the absolute minimum dose, and I will provide you with detailed instructions, lab reports, and my contact information for immediate attention if you experience any side effects. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to assess your progress. Before we proceed, I need you to sign a consent form acknowledging the potential risks and benefits of medical cannabis. It’s a standard procedure. Here you are. Take your time to read it carefully, and please don’t hesitate to ask any questions.
PATIENT: Very well. But do be warned, Doctor, I have a lawyer who is most… thorough. And I expect absolute clarity. No hidden clauses. No ambiguous language. And no attempts to… deceive me. My roses are counting on me, you know.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ellan. I want you to feel completely comfortable and informed before signing anything. I’m here to answer any questions you have, no matter how small. I assure you, the document is straightforward and transparent, outlining only the necessary information and your rights as a patient. Please, don’t hesitate to point out anything that’s unclear or concerning. Your well-being – and the well-being of your roses – are my top priority.
PATIENT: Very well. The language is… acceptable. Though I do find the section on “potential side effects” rather… alarmist. But I suppose it’s prudent to be aware of all possibilities. I have one question. It states here that I must disclose this… “medical cannabis” to any healthcare providers I consult. What precisely does that entail? Do I need to inform my… gardener? He’s quite knowledgeable about plant life, you see. And will this affect my… rose show entries? They’re quite competitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ellan. I’m glad you’re thinking ahead. When it comes to disclosure, it primarily refers to medical professionals – doctors, pharmacists, specialists. You don’t need to inform your gardener, despite his knowledge of plant life. That’s not necessary. As for your rose show entries, it’s unlikely that using medical cannabis will affect your eligibility. The rules typically focus on the cultivation and preparation of the roses themselves, not on the personal health of the exhibitor. However, it's always best to check the specific regulations of the show to be certain. I can help you find that information if you’d like. Ultimately, disclosure to medical professionals is about ensuring your overall safety and avoiding any potential interactions with other medications or treatments. It’s a standard precaution. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Very well. If you assure me that my roses will not be affected… and if you can provide me with the contact information for the rose show regulations… I suppose I am willing to proceed. But do not expect me to be… effusive in my gratitude. I am simply seeking relief from my… discomfort. And my roses are counting on me, you know. There. Now, let us proceed with this… experiment. But do be warned, Doctor, if it interferes with my roses… you will hear from my lawyer.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ellan. I appreciate your careful consideration and your frankness. I assure you, we will proceed cautiously and with your best interests – and the well-being of your roses – at heart. Now, let's discuss the specific product we’ll be using and how to administer it. We’ll start with a very low dose – just a few drops under your tongue, as I mentioned. I’ll provide you with detailed instructions, as well as a symptom tracker to monitor your progress. I also have contact information for the rose show regulations here, and I’m happy to help you navigate their website if you’d like. Are you ready to begin?
PATIENT: Very well. If you insist. But do not expect me to be… overly enthusiastic. I am simply seeking relief from my… discomfort. And my roses are counting on me, you know. Proceed. But do be warned, Doctor, if this interferes with my roses… you will hear from my lawyer. And do not expect me to be overly communicative. I have roses to tend, you know.
DOCTOR: Understood, Ellan. I respect your time and your priorities. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best – and your roses – in the days to come. .
