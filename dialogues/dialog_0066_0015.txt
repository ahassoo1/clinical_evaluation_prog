DOCTOR: Hi Mikeisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. It is… nice to meet you too. Um, my… sinuses. They are bothering me. A lot of pressure, you know? It’s been… a while now, I think. I don’t remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus pressure. I understand. And you said it's been going on for a while – can you try to remember roughly how long?
PATIENT: Oh… that is hard. Maybe… a few months? Or… longer? It feels like a long time, but… everything feels a little blurry, you know? I work… a lot. With the drill. Oil… places. It’s noisy. Maybe that makes it hard to remember.
DOCTOR: I see. Working with machinery can definitely make it tough to keep track of things. A few months, okay. And is it constant pressure, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Sometimes it is… really bad. Like a heavy weight. Other times… it’s just… there. A dull ache. Not so bad I can't work, but… uncomfortable. I take… pills. For the pain. The red ones. I don’t know the name. My husband gets them for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it fluctuates, and you’re taking some pain pills that your husband provides. We’ll definitely need to figure out what those pills are, for safety reasons. Do you know anything about the dosage or how often you take them?
PATIENT: Oh… no. I just… take them when it hurts. He tells me how many. Usually… one or two. Sometimes three if it is really bad. I don’t… keep track. He knows what to do. He always has. I trust him. It’s just… the pain is bad.
DOCTOR: I understand you trust your husband, and that’s good. It's just important for me to know exactly what you’re taking to make sure it’s safe and isn’t interacting with anything else. We'll get that sorted out. Besides the pain, are you experiencing any other symptoms with your sinuses?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes my nose feels… stuffy. Like it’s blocked. And… I think I cough a little. Not a lot. Just… sometimes. And… I feel tired. Very tired. But I work long hours, so… maybe that is just from work. It’s hard to tell. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mikeisha. Stuffy nose, cough, and fatigue – those can all be related. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches along with the fatigue?
PATIENT: No. No fever. No chills. Just… tired. Like I have no energy. And… sometimes my head hurts. Not just in my sinuses, but… all over. Like a… pressure. But maybe that's from the sinuses too. It’s all… mixed up, you know? It's hard to tell what is what.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be hard to pinpoint everything when you're feeling unwell. Okay, so no fever, chills, or body aches. We've talked about the sinus pressure, stuffy nose, cough, fatigue, and headaches. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, allergies, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I don’t think so. I’ve never… been to the doctor much. Except for… when I was pregnant. But everything was fine then. I don’t have… allergies that I know of. And… no, I don’t think I have high blood pressure. I feel… okay. I work hard, but… strong. My husband says I'm healthy. He checks my… pulse sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So no known medical conditions, everything was fine during pregnancy, and you haven't been diagnosed with any allergies. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. No surgeries. No hospital. I… I try to stay healthy. I don’t like doctors. Or hospitals. I just… deal with things. My husband helps me. He knows what to do if something is really bad. But… this sinus thing… it’s not going away. That’s why I came. It’s been too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions, like asthma, allergies, sinus problems, or anything else that runs in the family?
PATIENT: Um… my mother… she had… trouble breathing sometimes. When she was old. But I don’t know what it was. Just… old age, I think. And… my brother, he has… diabetes. But that’s… him. Nobody else… I don't think so. We don't talk about… health much. It’s not something we… share. It's a little… private.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some breathing problems when she was older and your brother has diabetes. That's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Oh, no. Never. I do not smoke. I do not drink. And… definitely not… those things. I work very hard. I need to be strong. Those things… they would make me weak. My husband… he doesn’t like those things either. We have a good life. A simple life. But this… this sinus problem… it is making me tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, just one more question about your background. Are you allergic to any medications or have you had any bad reactions to any in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I don’t think so. I don’t take many medications. Just the red pills for the pain. And… sometimes, when I have a cold, I take something for the… stuffy nose. But nothing… bad has ever happened. I just… take them. My husband always checks… to make sure I don’t take too many. He’s very careful. I trust him. I really do. But… I don’t remember the names of the pills. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mikeisha. It's okay that you don't remember the names. We'll figure it out. Alright, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your sinuses for tenderness, and take a look in your nose and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. That’s… alright. But please… be gentle. And… not too long. I need to get back to work soon. My husband… he’s counting on me. And… I don’t like being touched too much. But… if you need to, that’s okay. Just… please be quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can hear right now. Now, I’m going to gently feel around your sinuses to check for tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Okay, there’s a little tenderness over your maxillary sinuses, which is consistent with sinus inflammation. Finally, I'm going to take a quick look in your nose and throat. Your nasal passages are a little congested and red. Your throat looks normal. Overall, the exam findings suggest some degree of sinus inflammation, likely sinusitis. Now, to help determine the best course of action, I'd like to ask if you have insurance, and if so, what type?
PATIENT: No. No insurance. We… we don’t have money for that. It’s… expensive. My husband works very hard. But… it’s not enough for insurance. We just… pay for things as we need them. I’m sorry. I wish we did. But… we don’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That's alright. We can definitely work with that. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis, an inflammation of your sinuses. While it's likely not a serious condition, it can be quite uncomfortable. Without insurance, we need to be mindful of costs. I recommend trying some over-the-counter treatments first. A saline nasal rinse can help clear congestion, and a decongestant like pseudoephedrine can help reduce swelling. You can also take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain. However, given that you've been experiencing symptoms for several months, and you're taking pain pills regularly, I'm concerned that this might be a chronic issue or a more complicated case. We should be sure of what you are taking as well. Before we proceed, could you please bring me the container of the "red pills" you mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: Here. These are them. My husband gets them for me. He buys them at… the store. I don’t know which store. He just… brings them home. He says they help with the pain. I trust him. But… I wish I knew what they were. I’m scared they might be… bad for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, these are… naproxen 500mg. It's a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, often used for pain relief. It can be effective, but long-term use can have side effects, like stomach problems. It’s good you brought these in. Since you've been taking these regularly for some time, and your symptoms haven't fully resolved, I recommend we try a few other things. I’d like to refer you to a local clinic that offers affordable healthcare services. They can perform some basic tests to rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms, like an allergy or infection, and potentially prescribe a stronger medication if needed. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A clinic? That… sounds good. If it’s… affordable. I don’t want to cost my husband too much money. He works so hard. But… if it can help me get better… yes. Please. I just want to feel better. And… I want to know what is wrong with me. So I can… stop worrying. Is it far?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. There is a clinic about 20 minutes from here, and they offer a sliding scale fee based on income, so the cost should be manageable. I can give you their contact information and a referral letter outlining your symptoms and my findings. In the meantime, continue the saline nasal rinse and consider reducing your naproxen use if possible, or taking it only when the pain is severe. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Here's the clinic's address and phone number. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. You… you listened to me. And you didn’t… judge me. That means a lot. I appreciate your help. And… I hope this clinic can help me too. I just want to feel normal again. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. I hope you feel better soon. Take care, and have a good day.
