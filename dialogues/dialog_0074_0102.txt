DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Reisig, you say? A nice name. Hmm… what brings me in… well, it’s just… I’ve been doing a lot of sighing lately. Deep breaths, you know? Not painful, just… a lot of them. It feels like… I don’t know… like I’m carrying something heavy, even when I’m not. My daughter, she told me I should come see someone. She worries, you know? A good girl, that one.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of your daughter, Mr. Vantine. It’s always good to have someone looking out for us. So, you’ve been experiencing frequent sighing, and you describe it as feeling like you’re carrying a weight, even when you aren’t physically exerting yourself. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… a while now. Weeks, I think? Maybe months? Time… it slips away, you know? It’s hard to keep track. It didn’t start suddenly, it was more… gradual. I just noticed I was doing it more and more. Not every minute, but… often enough that my daughter pointed it out. She said it sounded… sad.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Vantine. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when things started. Several weeks to months is helpful to know. And it’s good you mentioned it was gradual. Besides the sighing and the feeling of carrying a weight, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other changes… well, I’ve been… a little more tired, maybe? Not like I can’t get up and do things, but… things feel harder, you know? And… I don’t sleep as well as I used to. I wake up a lot during the night. Just… thoughts running through my head. Old memories, mostly. Not bad memories, just… there. My wife… I miss her, terribly.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Vantine. It’s completely understandable that you’re experiencing these feelings, and that it impacts your sleep. The fatigue and difficulty sleeping certainly could be related. Are these thoughts keeping you up most nights, or is it more intermittent?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not every night, Doctor. Some nights I sleep alright. But… most nights, I wake up at least once or twice. Sometimes I can get back to sleep, sometimes I just… lie there. Thinking. About… everything. About the old days. About her. It’s not a bad feeling, exactly. Just… a quiet sadness. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining it perfectly well, Mr. Vantine. It sounds like a very natural response to loss, and it’s good you can identify that it’s tied to your memories of your wife. Besides the sighing, fatigue, and sleep disturbance, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you experienced any unintentional weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Appetite… that’s a good question. I think… I don’t eat as much as I used to. Not because I don’t want to, but… it just doesn’t feel as appealing. My daughter brings me food, bless her heart, and I eat enough to keep going, but… I haven’t been really hungry, you know? And… I think I might have lost a little weight. My clothes feel a little looser. I haven’t weighed myself, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Vantine. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing a number of changes, and it’s good you’re noticing these things. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to ask a few more general health questions, and then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Ask away. A physical exam… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. High blood pressure… I think the doctor mentioned something about that, years ago. But I don’t remember taking any pills for it. And diabetes… no, I don’t think so. My wife, she had a little trouble with her sugar, but not me. Heart problems… no, never. I used to be very active, you know? Worked hard all my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possible history of high blood pressure, but not currently on medication, and no known history of diabetes or heart problems. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long time ago. And… oh, I had a little operation on my knee, years later. Just a small one, to fix a torn cartilage, I think. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and a knee surgery. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she lived a long life, but she had trouble with her joints, arthritis, I think. And my father… he had a weak heart, I remember that. He didn’t take care of himself, you know? Worked too hard. And my sister… she had some trouble with her nerves, always worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis, heart disease, and anxiety. Now, I’m going to ask about your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills. Never have. I just… try to get by. My daughter sometimes gives me vitamins, but I don't really remember taking them consistently. As for allergies… not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… hmm. Well, I’m a widower, as I mentioned. My wife passed away five years ago. It feels like yesterday, sometimes. I live alone, in the same house we always lived in. My daughter visits often, bless her heart. I don't really go anywhere anymore. Used to be very active in the community, but… things change, you know? I don't drink, and I don't smoke. Never have. I used to enjoy gardening, but… my knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Vantine. It sounds like you've experienced a lot of changes, and it’s admirable how you’ve adapted. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Go ahead. I trust you. It’s been a long time since anyone… looked at me, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Just breathe normally. Deep breaths in and out… Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. No murmurs auscultated. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but slightly diminished at the bases. Blood pressure is 148/85. Ears are clear, tympanic membranes intact. Throat is clear, no signs of inflammation. Everything appears normal so far, Mr. Vantine. Your heart and lungs sound reasonably good, your ears are clear, and your throat looks fine. I’d like to check your reflexes and a quick neurological exam, if you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… good to hear, Doctor. Sounds alright, you say? That’s a relief. Reflexes… yes, go ahead. Do whatever you need to do. I’m not afraid. I just… want to feel better. It’s hard to explain. I just feel… tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Just relax your arm… and relax your leg… Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Muscle strength is 5/5 in all extremities, meaning good strength. Coordination is intact. Everything appears normal so far, Mr. Vantine. Your reflexes are good, your muscle strength is good, and your coordination is good. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing fatigue, sleep disturbance, and a feeling of carrying a weight, possibly related to grief and adjustment to life after your wife’s passing. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which we should monitor. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes for your fatigue, like anemia or thyroid issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work… yes, alright. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgment. Grief… yes, maybe that’s it. It’s just… hard. Everything feels so empty without her. But… I don’t want to be a bother. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Mr. Vantine. It’s my job to listen and help you feel better. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things, and I commend you for doing so. The blood work will help us rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms, and from there, we can discuss some strategies for managing your fatigue and grief. We can also discuss monitoring your blood pressure at home. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. I’ll also give you a requisition for a lipid panel. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you right away. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. That sounds… good. A lot of tests… but if that’s what you think is best. Lipid panel… I don’t even know what that is. No… I don’t think so. Not right now. Just… tell me… will it take long to get the results? And… will it cost a lot of money? My daughter… she worries about money.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Vantine. The results should be back within a few days, usually 3-5 business days. As for the cost, I understand your daughter’s concern. I’ll have the billing department give you a breakdown of the costs before you leave, and we can discuss potential options if it’s a financial hardship. The lab does offer a self-pay discount, and we can explore if you qualify. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a handout with some information on grief support resources in the community. It can be helpful to talk to others who are going through similar experiences. We can also discuss some strategies for improving your sleep hygiene, like establishing a regular bedtime routine and avoiding caffeine before bed. Would you like me to go over some of those strategies with you now, or would you prefer to have some time to process everything first?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s kind of you, Doctor. The handouts… yes, that would be good. And… maybe just a little bit about the sleep. I do toss and turn a lot. But… don’t overwhelm me, alright? My head gets foggy sometimes. Thank you. You’ve been very patient with an old man.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. It’s my pleasure. Let’s start with the basics of sleep hygiene. One of the most important things is to establish a regular bedtime routine. Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on weekends. Also, create a relaxing bedtime environment. Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool. Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed, and try to avoid screen time for at least an hour before you go to sleep. It can also be helpful to get regular exercise, but avoid exercising close to bedtime. And if you can’t fall asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed and do something relaxing, like reading or listening to calming music, until you feel sleepy. We can also discuss some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, if you’re interested. But for now, let’s focus on establishing a regular bedtime routine and creating a relaxing bedtime environment. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds sensible, Doctor. Regular routine… yes, I used to have that. When my wife was still here. But… it’s hard to remember things sometimes. And… I don’t like being alone in the dark. But… I’ll try. I promise. For my daughter. And… for her.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Vantine. Taking small steps is all that matters. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious or uncomfortable being alone in the dark, especially after a loss. Perhaps a small nightlight could help?
PATIENT: Oh… a nightlight. Yes… that’s a good idea. My granddaughter… she used to have one. A little bunny. Yes… a nightlight. I’ll have to ask my daughter. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve given me a lot to think about. And… I think that’s enough for today. My head is starting to feel foggy.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. It’s perfectly understandable. We’ve covered a lot today. Remember, I’m here to support you. I’ll have the lab requisition and the grief support handouts ready for you. The billing department will provide you with a cost breakdown before you leave. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, taking things one day at a time is perfectly fine. I’ll see you back here in a few days to discuss the lab results. And please, try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’re a very kind woman.
