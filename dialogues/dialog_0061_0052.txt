DOCTOR: Bula, Mr. Benic! It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, it’s grand to meet ye too, Doctor. Well, I’ve been havin’ a bit o’ trouble o’ a mornin’s. Nausea, ye ken? It’s been comin’ on for a few weeks now, and the nurse thought I should pop in. She said somethin' about my heart… I’ve got a bit o’ heart trouble, they told me. Not sure what exactly, just… weak, I suppose. It’s the sick feeling I’m worryin’ about, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Nausea for a few weeks now, and you mentioned some heart trouble. That’s good you’re getting it checked out. Let's talk about this nausea a little more. Could you describe what it feels like?
PATIENT: Aye, well, it's not a violent sort o’ thing, ye ken? Not like food poisoning or anythin’. More… a queasiness, right in my stomach. It usually hits as soon as I sit up in the bed, and it lasts for a good hour or so. Doesn’t always go away completely, just… fades a bit. I haven't actually been sick, if that makes sense. Just feel like I might be. And it’s worse if I try to eat somethin' first thing. Toast usually just sits like a lump o' stone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a queasiness that happens when you sit up in the morning, lasting about an hour, and it’s worse with eating, especially toast. You haven’t vomited, but feel like you might. That’s helpful. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I’ve noticed. Just… time, I suppose. Lyin’ back down sometimes helps a wee bit, but I cannae spend all day in bed, ye ken? A bit o’ fresh air doesn’t do much either. I’ve tried sippin’ water, and that doesn't bother it, but it doesn't help it, if that makes sense. It’s just… there. A right nuisance, it is. I’ve also noticed it seems… worse on days when I’ve been sleepin’ a bit flat. Does that mean anythin'?
DOCTOR: Okay, so time and lying back down offer minimal relief, and fresh air doesn't seem to impact it. It's not improved by water, and it seems worse after sleeping flat. That is good information. You mentioned you were told you have some heart trouble. Do you know what was diagnosed, or what tests you’ve had done for it?
PATIENT: Aye, well, the doctor back in Inverness… a right good man, Doctor MacLeod… he said somethin’ about my heart not pumpin’ as strong as it should. Heart failure, he called it. I had an echocardiogram, I think that’s what it was, where they put the gel on your chest and do the scan. And a chest X-ray, of course. He put me on some tablets, water tablets, I believe, to get rid o’ some fluid. I’ve been takin' them regular as clockwork, but… I suppose this sickness could be somethin’ different. I haven’t been back to see Doctor MacLeod since… it was a good while ago now. He retired, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were diagnosed with heart failure and were prescribed water tablets for fluid retention. You haven’t seen a doctor since Doctor MacLeod retired. It’s good you remember the water tablets – that’s important. And you're right to wonder if this nausea could be something different. Let me just take a look at your records here… Ah, yes. It confirms the diagnosis of heart failure, and you’re on furosemide, a diuretic, 40mg daily. Besides the nausea, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Aye, furosemide, that’s the name o’ it. My memory’s still good, thankfully. As for other symptoms… well, I get a bit breathless sometimes, especially if I’m walkin’ uphill. And my ankles do swell up a bit at the end o’ the day, even with the tablets. I put it down to the heart, ye ken? I also feel a bit… tired, all the time. Not like a proper illness, just… drained. And I’ve been sleepin’ on an extra pillow or two lately, just to make breathin’ a wee bit easier at night. Does that sound like it’s all connected?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve been experiencing breathlessness with exertion, ankle swelling despite the furosemide, fatigue, and needing extra pillows to sleep comfortably. Those symptoms do sound consistent with heart failure. Now, sometimes nausea can be a side effect of certain medications, including furosemide, though it’s not super common. But given your other symptoms, and the fact it's been going on for a few weeks, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to check your abdomen as well. Then I’ll check your ankles for swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I trust yer judgement. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors listenin’ to my chest, thankfully. It's all part o’ the course, I suppose. And checkin’ my ankles is no bother at all. I’ve a feelin’ they'll be a bit puffy, to be honest. It's just one o’ those things, I reckon. Just let me know if ye need me to do anythin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Alright, a bit tender here on the right side, but nothing too concerning. And yes, as you suspected, there’s some moderate swelling in both ankles. Okay, Mr. Benic. Your heart sounds a bit… muffled, and there are some crackles in your lungs, which can be a sign of fluid buildup. The ankle swelling is consistent with that. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, it sounds like your heart failure might be worsening, and that could be contributing to the nausea. However, nausea can also have many other causes, so we need to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a few other things. I'd also like to get an ECG, just to see how your heart is doing electrically. And, given how long it's been since you saw Doctor MacLeod, I think it would be helpful to repeat the echocardiogram to see how your heart’s pumping function has changed. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds very thorough, Doctor. And sensible, as ye said. I’m happy to have all those tests done. My kidneys haven’t been the best lately, I’ve noticed I’m needin’ to go to the bathroom a bit more often, so checkin’ them sounds a good idea. An ECG and another echocardiogram too… fine with me. The more information, the better, I reckon. Just let me know when and where I need to go for them. I’m a patient man, I don’t mind waitin’ a wee bit. I just want to feel a bit better, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Benic. I’m glad you’re agreeable to the tests. I’ve put in the orders for the blood tests, ECG, and echocardiogram. The blood tests can be done here in the clinic lab today. I'll have the nurse draw them after we finish talking. The ECG can also be done here today. For the echocardiogram, we’ll need to schedule an appointment with the cardiology department at the hospital. I’ll have the receptionist call you to set that up, and she’ll give you the information you need about preparation for the test. In the meantime, let's talk about managing your symptoms. Are you following a low-sodium diet?
PATIENT: Aye, I try to, Doctor. I've always been a bit careful with salt, ever since Doctor MacLeod told me to watch it. I don't add much to my food, and I try to avoid processed things like bacon and sausages. I read the labels on everything, too, lookin' for hidden sodium. I've got a wee garden, ye ken, so I grow a lot o' my own vegetables, which helps. It's not perfect, mind ye, I do enjoy a bit o' cheddar cheese now and then, but I try to keep it under control. Is that enough, d'ye think? Should I be doin' more?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Benic! Growing your own vegetables and reading labels is a fantastic start. It sounds like you’re very conscientious about your diet, and a little bit of cheddar now and then won't hurt. It’s good you’re already being so careful. Are you weighing yourself regularly?
PATIENT: Aye, I do, Doctor. I’ve got a wee set o' scales in the bathroom. I try to weigh myself every mornin', after I’ve been to the bathroom, of course. I’ve noticed I’ve been puttin' on a bit o' weight lately, even with the water tablets. It worries me a wee bit, 'cause I know that can make the heart failure worse. I wrote it down in my wee notebook, too, just to keep track. It's only a pound or two, but it's enough to make me concerned. It's just… frustratin', ye ken? I'm tryin' my best, but the weight keeps creepin' up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good you’re tracking your weight. Weight gain can be a sign that fluid is building up, even with the furosemide. That’s definitely something we need to pay attention to. Given the weight gain and nausea, I'm going to slightly increase your furosemide dosage, from 40mg to 60mg daily, and see if that helps to reduce the fluid buildup and alleviate the nausea. I want to be cautious, so we will check your electrolytes after the blood tests. I'll also give you a prescription for an anti-nausea medication to help you feel more comfortable in the meantime. It's not a long-term solution, but it should help with the symptoms while we figure out what's going on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Increasin’ the water tablets and tryin’ somethin’ for the sickness… grand. I haven’t got any allergies, not that I know o'. I’ve taken all sorts o’ things over the years, and never had a reaction. My mother always said I had a strong stomach, which is probably why I’m so worried about this sickness now! It’s a bit o’ an irony, ye ken? But no, no allergies. Just the usual… gettin' a bit tired after a long walk, but that’s just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the allergies. And your mother sounds like a wise woman! Alright, I’ve written you a prescription for metoclopramide, 10mg three times a day as needed for the nausea. Please take it with food. It can cause drowsiness, so be careful driving or operating machinery. So, to recap: we’ve increased your furosemide dosage, I’ve given you a prescription for metoclopramide, and we’ve ordered some blood tests, an ECG, and a repeat echocardiogram. The nurse will draw your blood now, and the receptionist will schedule your echocardiogram. I want to see you back in one week to review the results of the tests and see how you’re doing. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, especially if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your legs or abdomen, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I understand perfectly, Doctor. Increased water tablets, metoclopramide for the sickness, blood tests, ECG, echocardiogram… and see ye in a week. And watch out for worsenin’ symptoms, go to the emergency room if needed. I’ve got it all written down in my wee notebook here, just to be sure. Thank ye kindly for yer time and patience, Doctor. Ye’ve put my mind at ease a wee bit, knowin’ we’re gettin’ to the bottom o’ this. I appreciate it a great deal. Now, where’s the nurse, so I can get these blood tests done?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Benic! I'm glad I could help. The nurse, Sarah, is just outside the door. I’ll let her know you’re ready. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Sarah! Mr. Benic is ready for his blood tests. Take care, Mr. Benic, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
PATIENT: .
