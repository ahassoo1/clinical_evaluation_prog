DOCTOR: Good morning. Marija, is it?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor… Pitmon, yes? It is Marija. And it’s pronounced “Chee-lah”, if you please. I scheduled an appointment regarding… end-of-life planning documents. My husband suggested I look into it, though frankly, at my age, it seems a bit premature.
DOCTOR: Chee-lah. Right. Well, while I appreciate your… proactive approach, this isn't quite the usual sort of thing handled in my Internal Medicine practice. I deal with current health concerns, not hypothetical future ones. Perhaps you were looking for an estate planning attorney?
PATIENT: An attorney? Really. My husband specifically said a medical professional. He thought I needed to discuss a POLST form, or perhaps an Advance Directive… something that outlines my wishes should something… unexpected occur. I assumed a doctor would be the appropriate person to explain the options and ensure it’s properly completed. I find it rather odd that you haven’t heard of these things.
DOCTOR: Look, I’ve been practicing for twenty-four years. I know of those forms. They’re… paperwork. Mostly for people who are actively ill, facing a terminal diagnosis. You seem perfectly healthy to me. I see your height and weight here – 199 centimeters, 137 kilograms… You appear quite robust. Frankly, spending my time on this when I have patients with real medical needs seems… inefficient. We can briefly discuss it, but I'm not going to spend the whole appointment on legal documents. Tell me, are you experiencing any symptoms at all?
PATIENT: “Robust”? Is that what you call it? I am a tall woman, yes, and I maintain a healthy appetite. It doesn’t mean I don’t wish to be prepared. And frankly, Doctor, it’s rather presumptuous to assume my health is so excellent as to preclude me from considering these matters. My husband and I simply want to have everything in order. I’m perfectly capable of understanding my own mortality, thank you very much. But if you refuse to explain these “paperwork” forms, I suppose I’ll have to find a doctor who isn’t so dismissive. Now, are you able to tell me, in simple terms, what a POLST form is, or shall I leave?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Don't get your… knickers in a twist. A POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – it’s a medical order. Basically, it tells emergency personnel what you want done if you can’t speak for yourself. Do you want CPR?
PATIENT: “Knickers in a twist”? Is that really how a medical professional speaks to a patient? And yes, I understand it’s a medical order. My husband explained that much. But what about an Advance Directive? Is that simply a written document outlining my wishes, or is it something more formal? And what is the process for completing these forms? Do I require witnesses? A notary? I assure you, Doctor, I don’t intend to simply scribble something on a piece of paper and expect it to be legally binding.
DOCTOR: Look, this is getting ridiculous. An Advance Directive is… a more general statement of your wishes. It’s not as legally binding as a POLST, which is a direct order. As for witnesses and notaries… honestly, I don’t specialize in estate planning law. It varies by state. You’d really be better off talking to an attorney. But fine. If you insist. It typically needs to be witnessed, sometimes notarized. But I can give you a very basic form, a template, that you can take and… sort out with someone qualified. Is there anything medical I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: A “template”? You’re going to give me a blank form and expect me to… “sort it out”? This is utterly preposterous. I came here seeking professional guidance, not a bureaucratic runaround. Honestly, I’ve had more helpful conversations with receptionists. Thank you for your time, Doctor. It seems I’ve wasted mine. I shall find a doctor who understands the importance of preventative care, even when it comes to end-of-life planning.
