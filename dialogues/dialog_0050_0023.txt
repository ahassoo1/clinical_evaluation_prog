DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you are 38 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 38 is right. Um... my chest hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. It's... like a pain. In my breast.
DOCTOR: "Pain," you say. Could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: It's hard to explain. Not like... a bad pain, you know? More like... sore. Like when you use muscles too much. It's on... this side. <points to left chest> Not always there, though. Sometimes it's gone for days. Then it comes back.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this been occurring, Mr. Bulaong?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe... two months? I don't remember exactly. It started slow. Just a little bit. I didn't think much of it at first. It's just... been happening more now. My wife told me to come see someone.
DOCTOR: Wise of your wife. And is there anything that seems to trigger this soreness?
PATIENT: Trigger? You mean... what makes it worse? Um... I work on roofs, you know? Maybe when I'm lifting things? Or... when I'm really reaching? It's hard to say for sure. Sometimes it just happens. It doesn't feel like anything did it.
DOCTOR: Roofing, you say. A physically demanding profession. And you’ve noticed it correlates with lifting or reaching, but also occurs at times without a clear precipitating event. Is the pain radiating anywhere – down your arm, to your back, perhaps?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. It stays... right here. <points to left chest again, more specifically> Just in my chest. Doesn't go down my arm or to my back. It's just... uncomfortable. Like a bruise, almost, but no bruise. And it's only on this side. Not both. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Bulaong. However, chest pain, even if described as “uncomfortable” or “sore,” warrants careful evaluation. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your chest wall. Please remove your shirt, and I'll provide you with a gown. We need to rule out any musculoskeletal issues, and, more importantly, any cardiac concerns. Do you have any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No heart problems. My blood pressure… I don’t know. I don’t go to the doctor much. And no, no cholesterol problems. I don't even know what that means. I work hard, eat okay… I guess. <looks down and starts to untuck his shirt> Is it... bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, it is always prudent to investigate chest pain. I am not suggesting there is cause for undue alarm, however, it is my responsibility to conduct a thorough assessment. Please simply loosen your shirt enough for me to auscultate your heart and lungs, and palpate the area of discomfort. Now, have you experienced any shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, or dizziness accompanying this chest soreness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No shortness of breath. Not sick to my stomach. No sweating... not more than usual from work, anyway. And no dizziness. Just the pain. Sometimes it's worse when I lie down, I think. But not always. It's confusing. I'm not good with remembering things like this. <loosens shirt slightly, revealing his chest> Is this okay?
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is within normal limits, and I do not detect any murmurs or irregularities. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Palpation reveals some tenderness to the left parasternal region. No palpable masses or deformities. It feels musculoskeletal in nature, likely strain or inflammation of the intercostal muscles. However, given your description and the fact that you are a manual laborer, we should still conduct a basic blood workup to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions, and to establish a baseline. I also want to order a chest X-ray. It is a simple precaution. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any problems with medicine before. Blood work and... X-ray? Okay. Whatever you think is best. Is it expensive? I don't have insurance. My wife... she worries about money. <looks down, fiddling with the hem of his shirt>
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, I understand your financial concerns. Unfortunately, diagnostic testing does incur costs. I will attempt to order the most cost-effective options available. We can also discuss options for payment plans with the clinic. As for the blood work, we'll check a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and inflammatory markers like ESR and CRP. The chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and rule out any pneumonias or other significant pathology. While the musculoskeletal examination is reassuring, it’s better to be thorough. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pain relievers or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't take any pills. Just... work hard and try to rest when I can. My wife gives me some cream sometimes for my back... but that's it. It smells nice. <shrugs> I just want it to stop hurting. Can you... give me something for the pain?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, while I understand your desire for immediate relief, I must emphasize that prescribing medication without a definitive diagnosis would be imprudent. We need the results of the blood work and the X-ray before proceeding. However, for symptomatic relief, I can recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen, following the dosage instructions on the label. Rest, ice, and gentle stretching may also provide some benefit. I will write you a brief note outlining these recommendations. <Begins to write on a prescription pad> Now, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or engage in any recreational drug use?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoking. Never liked it. Sometimes a beer with my wife on the weekend... but not much. And no, no drugs. I just work. <leans forward slightly> I worry about my job, you know? If I can't work... we don't have much money. Is this going to stop me from working?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, your concerns are noted. I understand the importance of your livelihood. It is unlikely that this discomfort will prevent you from working, however, it is premature to make any definitive statements until we have the results of the diagnostic testing. I will arrange for the blood work and X-ray to be performed today. A technician will draw your blood, and then you will proceed to radiology for the imaging study. I will review the results as soon as they become available, and we will discuss a comprehensive treatment plan. I will also provide you with a short note for your employer, outlining your visit and recommending a brief period of modified activity. Is there anything else I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's everything. Thank you. I hope it's nothing bad. <looks relieved, but still worried> Where do I go for the blood work and... the X-ray?
DOCTOR: The laboratory is just down the hall to your left, room 104. The radiology department is on the second floor, room 210. The receptionist will provide you with the necessary paperwork. Once the studies are completed, you can return here, and I will be available to discuss the results. A member of my staff will contact you if there are any significant delays. Please inform them if you experience any worsening chest pain or shortness of breath before your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions regarding the directions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I can find it. Thank you for your help. <starts to get up, looking a little less anxious> I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Get well soon, Mr. Bulaong.
