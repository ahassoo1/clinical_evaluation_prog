DOCTOR: Hi Laury, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. I want to… um… find out more about where my family come from. I hear you can do a test with spit… to see where people, long time ago, they live?
DOCTOR: That’s right! We can do genetic ancestry testing – it uses a saliva sample to look at your DNA and give you an idea of your ethnic origins. It's become quite popular. It won’t tell you exactly where your family lived, more like regions and populations your ancestors likely came from. Is that what you were hoping for?
PATIENT: Regions… okay. I understand. My mama, she from Marshall Islands. But… before that? My grandpa, he tell stories, but old man stories, you know? Hard to remember everything. I just… want to know more. Is okay if it not perfect?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that’s perfectly fine. It won’t be a perfect, definitive answer, and it’s wonderful you're interested in your family history. It sounds like you’d like to explore the ancestry beyond your maternal side. To help me understand if this test is right for you, and to get the most out of it, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Health? Um… I’m old, you know? Eighty-five. Little bit of trouble with my knees, but I walk okay. Doctor give me medicine for my water… my pressure, I think? But mostly okay. I eat fish, lots of fish. And rice. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Knowing about your general health and any medications you're taking is important before we proceed with the genetic testing. So, you're taking something for your blood pressure – do you happen to know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Um… Little white pill? I think… Doctor Sato give it to me. He retired now. I get it from the pharmacy. Every month. I not so good with remembering names. Is okay if I just tell you I take white pill for water?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can look it up in your records if you’re comfortable with that. It's just good to know exactly what you're taking. Since you mention taking something for your blood pressure, do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, no diabetes. And my heart… Doctor check it every year. He say okay. Little fast sometimes, but okay. I think just old age. Not much else. I been pretty lucky, I think. Fish is good for you, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you’ve been pretty lucky! And you’re right, fish is very good for you. Okay, before we talk more about the ancestry test, I just want to quickly ask about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don’t think so. Never had trouble with anything. I eat everything my mama make. Sometimes a little itchy from mosquito bites, but not allergy. Nothing serious. I pretty tough old man.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And just one last quick question before we discuss the testing further: have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Um… When I was young, maybe… appendix? I think so. Long time ago. And I break my arm when I fall from coconut tree, but that not surgery, just… fix with bone setter. Nothing else. I think. Old man forget things, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, appendix removal a long time ago and a broken arm that was treated with a bone setter. Now, let’s talk about the ancestry test. The test itself is pretty straightforward – you spit into a tube, and we send it off to the lab. It usually takes about 6-8 weeks to get the results. The results will give you a breakdown of your ethnic origins, and it might also give you information about potential relatives. Would you like me to explain a little bit about how the test works, or would you like me to go ahead and order it for you?
PATIENT: Explain a little bit. I not so good with… science things. Just tell me what they do with my spit. And is it… painful? Is it safe? I worry about these new things.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s smart to be cautious about new things! It’s not painful at all – it just involves spitting into a tube. The lab then analyzes your DNA – which is in your spit – to look at tiny differences that are common in people from different parts of the world. It’s like a puzzle – they look at the pieces of your DNA and see where they fit best. It's very safe! The lab uses a small amount of your spit, and they don't store any personal information about you. They only look at your DNA for ancestry purposes. We'll go over the results together when they come back, and I can help you understand what they mean. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that make sense. Like puzzle. Okay. And they not keep my spit forever? Just look at it and… that’s it? I worry about people using things… for wrong reasons. Old man gets worried. But puzzle sound good. Maybe I learn something about my grandpa’s stories. So… we do the spit test?
DOCTOR: That’s right, they don’t keep your spit forever – they analyze the DNA and then destroy the sample. It's understandable to be worried about privacy, and I want to assure you that we take it very seriously. Yes, let's do the spit test! I think it could be really interesting for you to learn more about your family history. I have the kit right here. It comes with instructions, and it’s very easy to use. We'll just need you to sign a consent form first, explaining that you understand the test and its limitations. Would you like me to get that for you?
PATIENT: Yes, consent form okay. I want to know about my grandpa. And puzzle sound fun. Maybe I tell you stories after I get results. So, I spit in tube, and you help me with puzzle?
DOCTOR: Wonderful! That’s exactly right. You spit in the tube, and I'll help you with the puzzle. And I would love to hear your stories after you get the results – family history is really important. Here’s the consent form. Just read it over, and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. It just explains what the test involves and what your rights are. Take your time. And then we can get started.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I read it now. Hmm… okay. This all sound good. I sign here, yes? Is okay now? I ready for puzzle.
DOCTOR: Perfect! Yes, everything looks good. You've signed the consent form, so we can proceed. Here is the collection kit. It's pretty simple. You just follow the instructions on the box. You'll need to avoid eating or drinking anything for about 30 minutes before you collect the sample. Once you’ve collected the sample, you’ll seal the tube and I’ll give you a prepaid envelope to mail it to the lab. It usually takes about 6-8 weeks to get the results. Do you have any questions about how to collect the sample?
PATIENT: No, I think okay. No eat, no drink. Spit in tube. Mail it. Easy. Six to eight weeks… long time. But okay. Maybe I tell my friend about puzzle. He like stories too. Thank you, Doctor Ranjan. You very kind. Is that all for today?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Laury! I'm glad I could help. And yes, that's all for today. Just remember to follow the instructions on the kit, and please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. We'll be in touch when the results come back. I look forward to hearing your stories! Have a wonderful day, Laury!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I go home now and think about grandpa. Maybe puzzle tell me his name.
