DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor…Bakan, was it? Yes, yes, a pleasure. Hmm… what brings me in… Let me see. It’s about my blood, I think. My daughter… she said I should find out my blood type. Something about… in case of emergencies, she said. It’s all a bit… fuzzy, you know? I don’t quite remember why exactly, but it seemed important to her. So, here I am.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Nini. It’s quite sensible of your daughter to encourage you to determine your blood type – it can indeed be very important information to have, particularly in emergency situations. It’s good you’re being proactive. So, to clarify, you don’t currently have any specific symptoms or concerns besides wanting to know your blood type?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms. Nothing at all, really. Just… old age, I suppose! Everything aches a little, but that’s just… being my age, isn’t it? No, no specific reason, just… wanting to have it on file, like my daughter said. Is that enough? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mrs. Nini, you're not rambling. It's perfectly reasonable to want to have this information available, and I'm happy to help. To get a clear picture, and just as a matter of routine, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a tricky one. My past medical history… Hmm. Let me see. I’ve lived a long life, you know? Lots of little bumps and bruises. I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder – rigging, it was. Years ago. And I had… something with my gallbladder, I think? They took it out. But beyond that… honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I went to a doctor regularly for years, but I don’t remember what he did for me, if anything. My daughter handles most of that now, bless her heart. She's very organized.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Nini. It's common for details to become less clear over time, especially with a long and full life. And it’s wonderful that you have such a supportive daughter assisting with your healthcare. You mentioned having your gallbladder removed. Do you recall approximately when that surgery took place?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The gallbladder… That was… oh, let me think. It must have been… sometime in the eighties, I think? Maybe the early nineties? It was definitely before my husband passed. He was still… well, he was very much with it then. So, yes, before 1998, definitely. That helps, doesn’t it? It was at the hospital in… oh, what was the name of that town? It's on the coast. Ugh, this memory…
DOCTOR: It does help, Mrs. Nini, thank you. Don't worry about the exact details; we'll get what we need. Knowing it was before 1998 is a good starting point. Now, regarding your family history—are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother, she lived to a good age, but she had… something with her heart, I think? Not a strong heart, she always said. And my father… he worked very hard, outdoors, and he had bad arthritis in his hands when he got older. Lots of aches and pains. Beyond that… I don’t really remember. We weren’t a family that talked much about illnesses, you know? It was just… life.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Nini. It's common for families to not discuss medical history openly. Knowing about your mother's heart condition and your father's arthritis is helpful, though. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, such as food or insects?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Medications. Just a small pill for my blood pressure, I think. A little white one. My daughter orders it for me, so I don’t really pay attention. And… no allergies, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my whole life! And I’ve been stung by plenty of bees while working, but never had a bad reaction.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mrs. Nini. A small white pill for blood pressure. We'll confirm that with your pharmacy records, just to be certain. Now, before we proceed with determining your blood type, I'd like to quickly perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, of course. A quick examination. That sounds perfectly fine. I’ve had plenty of those over the years. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… try not to poke too much, if you wouldn't mind. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Nini. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, a slight murmur, which is common at your age, but nothing concerning at this moment. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but within an acceptable range given your age and activity level. Now, I will quickly examine your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected.
PATIENT: Everything feels alright, Doctor. A little pressure, naturally, but nothing painful. You're very gentle, I must say. My old bones appreciate it. Is that all? Are we getting closer to finding out this blood type, then? I'm terribly curious, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Nini, that was very helpful. We are getting closer. Now, to determine your blood type, I’ll need to draw a small sample of blood. It will only take a few minutes. Do you have a preference for which arm?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A needle? Well, I suppose it has to be done. I’ve had blood taken before, haven’t I? Hmm… I think my left arm is better. Yes, the left arm. It doesn't get as much… rigging work.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Nini. The left arm it is. I will clean the area first, and you may feel a brief pinch. Just try to relax. Alright, almost done… just a little more… There we go. All finished. Please keep gentle pressure on this gauze pad for a few minutes to prevent any bruising. Now, we’ll send this sample to the lab for analysis. It should take approximately 20-30 minutes to receive the results. Would you like to wait here, or would you prefer to step outside for a bit?
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn’t so bad, was it? Thank you, Doctor. I think I’ll wait here, if you don’t mind. I don’t really want to wander off. It's nice and cool in here. And… I’m terribly curious to know my blood type now! Twenty to thirty minutes, you say? That shouldn’t be too long. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mrs. Nini. It’s my pleasure. I’ll check on you periodically. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to let me know if you feel any discomfort. I’ll also take a moment to review your current medication list, just to ensure everything is up-to-date. We’ll discuss the results and any necessary precautions as soon as they come in.
PATIENT: That sounds lovely, Doctor. Thank you for being so thorough. I do appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Nini, the results are back. It appears your blood type is A positive. Do you have any questions about what that means?
PATIENT: A positive… A positive… What does that mean, exactly? I’ve never really understood all this blood type business. Does it mean I can’t give blood to just anyone? Is that it? My daughter mentioned something about compatibility… Oh dear, this is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question, Mrs. Nini. It can be a little confusing. Essentially, your blood type determines what kind of blood you can receive, and what kind of blood you can donate. Being A positive means you can receive blood from people who are A positive or O positive. You can donate blood to people who are A positive or AB positive. Your daughter is correct about compatibility. It's important to ensure blood types are matched correctly during transfusions to avoid any complications. Do you have any other questions about this?
PATIENT: Oh, so I can't just give blood to anyone who needs it… That makes sense, I suppose. A positive… and O positive… And… is it common? Is A positive a common blood type? Or is it rare? I always wondered about these things, you know. And… does it mean anything about my health? Does it make me more susceptible to anything? Oh dear, I’m probably asking too much.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too much at all, Mrs. Nini. It's good to be informed. A positive is actually one of the most common blood types – around 34% of the population has it. So, you're in good company. And no, your blood type doesn't necessarily mean anything about your overall health or susceptibility to illnesses. It's primarily important for transfusions and compatibility purposes. It is good to know your blood type in case of emergencies, though. It allows medical professionals to provide you with the appropriate care quickly and efficiently. Do you have any specific concerns about emergencies that prompted your daughter to suggest this?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear. Not rare, that’s a relief! As for emergencies… hmm. My daughter… she’s a bit of a worrier, you know? She said something about… I think it was about a surgery I might need someday? She said knowing my blood type would speed things up if anything happened. Or maybe it was about a fall? I do tend to stumble now and then. Honestly, I can’t quite recall. She just said it was important to have on file. A very practical girl, my daughter.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of her, Mrs. Nini. Knowing your blood type in advance can certainly streamline the process in emergency situations, even for planned surgeries. It eliminates the need for time-consuming blood typing tests when every minute counts. We’ve documented your blood type in your medical record, and I'll provide you with a copy of this printout to keep for your records. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. And very patient with my rambling. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for not making me feel silly for not knowing all this medical jargon. I’ll be sure to give this printout to my daughter. She’ll be very pleased. And I feel much better knowing my blood type now.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mrs. Nini. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns in the future. Now, if you’re feeling up to it, we can discuss some general health maintenance recommendations, or you can head home and relax. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you, Doctor. I think I’ll head home and relax, if you don’t mind. It’s been a long morning, and all this talk of blood types has quite worn me out! Thank you again for everything. You have a lovely day now.
DOCTOR: You as well, Mrs. Nini. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a wonderful day, and be sure to rest. We’ll see you at your next appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
