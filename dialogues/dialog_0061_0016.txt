DOCTOR: Bula and welcome, Mr. Farson. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you, Doctor. It’s…Farson, yes. Nicky Farson. I’m here about my bruising. It’s gotten…rather noticeable, lately. I’m on a blood thinner, you see, and I understand that’s usually the cause, but it seems…more than usual. It's a bit concerning, frankly. I don't usually bother with small things, but this is getting difficult to ignore.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Farson. Bruising that's more noticeable than usual, especially while on a blood thinner, is definitely worth checking out. It’s good you came in. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the bruising becoming more frequent or severe?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s been creeping up on me for…oh, I’d say the last month or so. At first it was just a little extra color after a bump – nothing I hadn’t seen before. But then it started appearing with…well, almost nothing at all. Just everyday things. Reaching for something on a shelf, that sort of thing. It’s not like I’m walking into walls, Doctor. I assure you. And it's not just little spots now, it's…larger patches. It's rather bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a gradual increase over the last month, starting with normal bruising after minor bumps and now happening with very minimal trauma, and the size of the bruises is increasing. That’s helpful to know. And where are you noticing the bruising, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Mostly on my arms, I suppose. And my legs. Not…not all over, thankfully. But definitely the limbs. A bit on my torso, too, now that I think about it. Just…randomly. It’s not like I'm deliberately looking for it, but it’s hard not to notice, you understand. It's… unsightly. I used to be quite active, and I don't want to curtail that just because I look like I’ve been in a boxing match.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Farson. It's good you're staying active, and we want to figure out what’s going on so you can continue to do so. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides what might be causing the bruising?
PATIENT: Well, my wife…she passed away a few years back, and that was…difficult. Aside from that, I was generally healthy. A bit of high blood pressure, perhaps, but nothing that required constant medication. The blood thinner was prescribed after a…a minor cardiac event, a couple of years ago. Nothing serious, mind you. A flutter, the doctor called it. They wanted to be cautious. Aside from that…no, I can't think of anything major. I'm not a complicated case, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of a cardiac flutter that led to being prescribed a blood thinner, and a history of high blood pressure. That's good to know. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Farson. Can you tell me what blood thinner you are currently taking, and what dosage?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… It’s…Warfarin, I believe. Yes, Warfarin. And the dosage… that changes, doesn’t it? They adjust it based on…tests. I think it’s currently…5 milligrams, maybe? No, wait. It’s… I really should write these things down. I see Dr. Ramirez for that, and she handles the adjustments. Honestly, Doctor, I leave that to her. I just take the pills.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Farson. It's good you have Dr. Ramirez managing your Warfarin. We can certainly look up your recent INR results in the system here. Okay, I see your most recent INR was 2.8 from last week. Besides the Warfarin, are you taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Good heavens, no. I don't hold with all that new-age nonsense. Just…a bit of ibuprofen now and then, for aches and pains. Nothing regular. And perhaps a cold remedy when I’ve got a sniffle. I don’t take anything consistently, Doctor. I assure you, I’m not one of those people who’s always popping pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just occasional ibuprofen for aches and pains and cold remedies as needed. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. I'm not a fussy eater, Doctor. And no reactions to any medications in the past, as far as I recall. My wife used to worry about that sort of thing, but I always told her I was as sturdy as an oak tree.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. And finally, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I was never one for any of that. A glass of sherry with dinner, perhaps, on occasion. But certainly no hard liquor, no smoking, and definitely no…those things. I lead a perfectly respectable life, Doctor. Always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, so very occasional sherry with dinner, but no smoking or recreational drug use. That’s good to know. Now, Mr. Farson, I’m going to do a quick physical exam to get a better look at the bruising and check for any other signs that might be contributing to this. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, certainly. Please do. I suppose it's best to be thorough. Though I can assure you, I haven't been getting into any fights. And I haven't fallen and bumped myself recently. I'm quite careful, you see. But go ahead, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'm just going to gently feel your arms and legs, and take a look at the areas of bruising. Alright, I see some ecchymosis – that’s just the medical term for bruising – on your forearms and shins. The bruises vary in size, as you mentioned. They’re mostly flat, and don't feel particularly raised or warm to the touch. No signs of swelling. Your pulses are good in all extremities, and your skin feels normal otherwise. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Everything sounds normal so far, Mr. Farson. However, with the increased bruising while on Warfarin, we need to rule out other potential causes. I'm going to order some blood work to check your platelet count, complete blood count, and coagulation studies. This will help us determine if there's a problem with your blood clotting ability. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work is always a good idea, I suppose. Though, honestly, I feel perfectly fine otherwise. A bit of a worry about the bruising, of course, but no pain, no fatigue, nothing like that. Still, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then please do. I trust your professional opinion. Just… try not to poke too many holes in me. I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible, Mr. Farson, I promise. It’s just a standard blood draw – a few vials, and we’ll have a lot more information to work with. I’m also going to order a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, as these organs play a role in blood clotting. Okay, I’ve placed the orders. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we’ll review them and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you notice any unusual bleeding – nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your urine or stool – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: No, I don't suppose so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Just… when do you think you’ll have the results? It’s just… I’m going on a short cruise next month, and I'd rather not be worrying about this while I’m trying to relax.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question, Mr. Farson. Typically, lab results come back within 2-3 business days, but it can sometimes take a little longer. I’ll make a note to expedite the process as much as possible, especially with your cruise coming up. I’ll also have the nurse give you a call as soon as they're available. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re being proactive to rule out any serious issues, and often, these things have a simple explanation. I'll also recommend you avoid any activities that might lead to bruising while we await the results. And continue taking your Warfarin as prescribed by Dr. Ramirez. Do you have any further questions or concerns before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least a little. I appreciate your thoroughness and your… calmness. It’s reassuring to have a doctor who doesn’t rush things. Just… remind me again about the nurse calling?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. I’m glad I could reassure you. The nurse will call you within 2-3 business days to discuss the lab results. She’ll have your results ready and can answer any questions you have. If you haven't heard anything after 3 business days, please don’t hesitate to call the office and we’ll look into it for you. Here’s a copy of the lab orders for your records. And please, if anything changes or you experience any unusual bleeding, don’t hesitate to contact us. Have a good day, Mr. Farson, and enjoy your cruise! I hope you have a relaxing time.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. And I shall try to enjoy it, despite this…bruising business. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. Take care, and we’ll be in touch soon. Goodbye.
