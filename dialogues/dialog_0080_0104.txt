DOCTOR: Hi Tammie, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Throat. It hurts. Been hurting. I… don’t really have time for this, if we’re being honest. Just… tell me what I need to do to make it stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time, and we’ll try to be as efficient as possible. A sore throat can be caused by a lot of things. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More… how? It hurts when I swallow. And… it feels rough. Like sandpaper, maybe? Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to feelings. I just need it gone. I have things to do. It’s probably nothing, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, sandpaper is a good way to describe it. And the pain when you swallow – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly when I… eat. Or drink. Or talk. So, pretty much all the time, if I'm being truthful. Look, is this going to take long? I don’t understand why you need to know so many details. It’s my throat. It hurts.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I seem to be asking a lot of questions. It really does help me narrow down what might be going on, and make sure I don’t miss anything important. Have you had a fever, cough, or any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? I haven’t checked. And cough… sometimes. A little one. Not important. I work with… machines. Dust happens. It's not a sickness cough, if that makes sense. More of a… work cough. And no, nothing else. I told you, it's just my throat. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, a work cough is good to know. And no other symptoms… any recent body aches or headache?
PATIENT: My back aches. Always. From… the machines. It’s heavy work. And… sometimes my head hurts, but that’s just… life, you know? Everyone gets headaches. It's probably from the noise at work. All the clanging. I don’t see how that’s related to my throat. Honestly, this is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, Tammie. It's good to know about the headaches and back pain – sometimes things are connected in ways we don't expect. Now, let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I… I don’t have a doctor. Never really needed one. My husband… he handled all that. And now… well. I just… work. I eat. I sleep. No fancy conditions. Really. Don't waste your time asking. It’s all very simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. Why are you asking me all these things? It’s a sore throat, not… I don't know… a heart transplant! This is ridiculous. I’m a perfectly healthy woman, despite what you might think. I just want something for my throat. Now.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. I'm asking these questions to make sure I'm providing you with the best and safest care. It helps me rule out anything serious. One quick question, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Never been allergic to anything. I take… sometimes I take something for my back, but I don't remember the name. My neighbor gave it to me. It was… a little blue pill, I think. Look, I really need to get back to work. This is taking too long. Are you going to give me something or not?
DOCTOR: Okay, a little blue pill… that's good to know, though it does make it hard to know what you took. Let’s do a quick exam of your throat, just to take a look. It will only take a minute. Can I take a look?
PATIENT: Look in my throat? No. Absolutely not. I don’t like people sticking things near my throat. It’s… invasive. I told you what’s wrong. It hurts. Give me something for the pain and I’ll be on my way. I don’t need you poking around. Really. It’s unnecessary. .
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Tammie. I wouldn't want to do anything that makes you feel unsafe. However, without a quick look, it's difficult to determine the cause of your sore throat, and I want to be sure I'm recommending the right treatment. Since you're not comfortable with a full exam, I'm hesitant to prescribe anything without knowing more. Given your history and symptoms, and the fact you haven't had a fever, it could be a simple viral sore throat. However, it’s also possible it could be something else. Since you are uninsured and I can't fully assess the situation, I'd strongly recommend visiting a free clinic or urgent care if it doesn't improve within a few days, or if you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or trouble swallowing. I can provide you with some information on local resources. In the meantime, I suggest over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and lots of fluids. Does that sound okay?
