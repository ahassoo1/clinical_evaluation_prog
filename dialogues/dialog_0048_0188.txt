DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Secondi, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. Criston Secondi.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s… my pee. It’s orange. For, like, two days now. It’s kinda weird.
DOCTOR: Orange urine. Right. And you're concerned about… the color?
PATIENT: Yes! It’s not… normal, is it? I drink water. I always drink water. Not a lot maybe, but enough. My wife, she said I should come see someone. She worries.
DOCTOR: Wife worries. Yes. Well, many things can cause a change in urine color. Dehydration, certainly. Certain foods. Are you taking any vitamins?
PATIENT: Vitamins? Um… sometimes. A multivitamin. The cheap ones, from the supermarket. Not every day, though. When I remember. Why? Is that it? The vitamins?
DOCTOR: It could be the vitamins. They contain riboflavin, which can cause a bright yellow, even orange, discoloration. But we can't rule other things out without… a little more information. Have you noticed any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Nothing like that. Just… orange. And my wife getting on at me. She says I should be more careful. She’s right, probably. I forget things sometimes. It just… looks wrong.
DOCTOR: Right. And no fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no. Nothing like that. Just the pee. I feel… normal. A little tired, maybe. But I always feel a little tired. Work is hard. Is it bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Secondi, I have other patients waiting. “Worried” is not a medical diagnosis. Let's get a quick urine sample. We’ll check for infection, and other… things. It's a standard procedure. The restroom is down the hall on the left. I’ll need you to collect a mid-stream sample, please. There are instructions posted.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. A sample. Yes. I can do that. Mid-stream… right. I will try to remember. Where exactly is this restroom? And what does “mid-stream” mean? Just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, first door on the left. And “mid-stream” means… …start urinating, and then collect the sample. Don't catch the first bit, and the last bit. The middle part. It's really not complicated. I have a nurse who can assist you if you are having difficulty. Please hurry.
PATIENT: Okay. Start, then middle, then… not the first or last. I understand. Thank you. I will try my best.
DOCTOR: Some people… Honestly.
