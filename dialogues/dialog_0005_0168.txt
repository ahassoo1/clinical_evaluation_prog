DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a delicate situation, really. I’m starting to date again, and I thought it prudent to have a check-up. One simply doesn’t want to… introduce complications, if you understand my meaning. It’s not just about me, you see. There are considerations.
DOCTOR: Right. “Complications.” I understand. A sensible approach, certainly. Let’s get a good picture of your overall health then. So, to start, have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well? Yes, I suppose. Though “well” is a rather… subjective term, isn’t it? I maintain a very active social calendar, and that can be draining. But no actual illnesses, if that’s what you mean. I take my vitamins, of course. And I'm quite particular about my diet. No fast food, ever. It’s simply… uncouth.
DOCTOR: Vitamins are good. Active is good. "Uncouth" dietary choices… less so. Alright. When you say “feeling generally well,” are you experiencing any specific symptoms – anything new or unusual, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, my knees do creak a bit when I rise from a chair, but that’s to be expected. I’m not a young woman anymore. And sometimes, if I'm particularly engrossed in conversation, I forget where I put my spectacles. But that’s hardly a symptom, is it? Just… absentmindedness. A common affliction, I assure you. I do believe my husband has the same problem, bless his heart.
DOCTOR: Creaky knees and misplaced spectacles... noted. Those aren't necessarily cause for alarm, but good you mentioned them. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in weight? Heavens, no. I maintain a very strict regimen, as I mentioned. I weigh myself every morning, first thing, before breakfast. I haven’t fluctuated more than a pound in… well, I couldn't say exactly, but it’s certainly been a long time. A lady must be disciplined, you understand. It’s simply… important. Are you suggesting I have gained weight, Doctor? Because I assure you…
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all, Ms. Pandolfi. I'm simply gathering information. Just routine. The chart does indicate a weight of 93 kilograms… is that accurate?
PATIENT: Ninety-three kilograms? Well, that is… a rather blunt way of putting it. It is accurate, I suppose. But kilograms are so… imprecise. I prefer pounds, naturally. And while I may not be a size two, I am certainly… comfortably proportioned. It’s a matter of build, you understand. A substantial woman requires a substantial frame. Are we focusing on my weight, Doctor? Because I’m not entirely sure why it’s relevant to my… dating prospects.
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Ms. Pandolfi, because weight can contribute to overall health risks. It’s not a judgment, simply a factor. Now, let’s not get sidetracked. Have you had any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite? Absolutely not. My appetite is as discerning as ever. I simply cannot abide poorly prepared food. And I take great pleasure in a refined dining experience. Although, I must confess, the portion sizes these days are appalling. Everything is so… excessive. I prefer smaller, more elegant courses. It’s about quality, not quantity, you see. Are you suggesting I overeat, Doctor? Because I find that rather… presumptuous.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Pandolfi, I am not suggesting that. I am trying to get a complete medical history. Let's try something different. Any problems with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Oh, no, I sleep quite soundly, thank you. Although, my husband does snore. Rather loudly, I might add. It’s… disruptive, on occasion. But I manage. I simply… reposition myself. Or, if it’s particularly bad, I gently nudge him. But my sleep is undisturbed. I require a full eight hours, you know. A lady must maintain her composure, and that requires adequate rest. Do you specialize in marital disturbances, Doctor? Perhaps you could recommend a… solution?
DOCTOR: I focus on your health, Ms. Pandolfi. Let’s return to that. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! Are you serious? I hardly think that is appropriate conversation for a medical examination. I mean, really! My… my bowel habits? That is… that is quite personal. I assure you, I maintain a perfectly regular schedule, thank you very much. And I fail to see how that is relevant to my… my social life. This is quite beyond the pale, Doctor. Quite beyond the pale.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, with all due respect, a complete medical history includes questions about bowel habits. It’s essential for identifying potential health concerns. It is not a matter of propriety, but of responsible care. However… let’s move on. Any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, now that you mention it, my bunions have been particularly troublesome lately. And my lower back aches if I stand for too long. But one simply must endure, don’t you think? A lady has obligations, social engagements… one cannot simply sit about and complain about aches and pains. It wouldn’t be dignified. Is this… is this related to the “complications” you inquired about earlier? Are you suggesting my social calendar is… detrimental to my health? Because I assure you, it is quite vibrant, and I have no intention of slowing down.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Pandolfi, I am not suggesting that your social calendar is detrimental to your health. But dismissing pain is not advisable. It can be a sign of something serious. Now, let's discuss your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis… anything at all?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Heavens, no. I’ve always been remarkably healthy, thank you. My mother always said I had a constitution of steel. Though, I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu in 1998, but that hardly counts as a chronic condition, does it? And my husband’s aunt had something… some sort of ailment with her joints, but that’s hardly relevant. Really, Doctor, I'm a very healthy woman. I simply wanted a quick check-up before… before potentially entering a new phase of my life. Are you certain this line of questioning is necessary? It’s all rather… intrusive, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I understand your discomfort, but a thorough assessment is crucial, especially given your stated concerns. Let’s try this: have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh, yes! I had my tonsils removed when I was a child. A very common procedure, I believe. And I had a small cyst removed from my back in… oh, goodness, I couldn’t possibly say when. It was quite minor, really. A simple outpatient procedure. But other than that… no. Nothing of significance. Are you attempting to build a case against me, Doctor? Because I assure you, I have no hidden maladies. This is all rather… unsettling, to be perfectly honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Well, my mother lived to be 87, a very active woman right up until the end. She did have a touch of arthritis in her hands, as I mentioned, but that was hardly debilitating. My father… he passed away rather suddenly from a heart condition, I believe. It was quite a shock, of course. And my brother… well, he’s always been a bit… delicate. Suffers from allergies, I think. But nothing serious. Are you looking for something specific, Doctor? Because I’m beginning to feel as though I’m being interrogated, rather than examined.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Heavens, no. I pride myself on maintaining my health without resorting to artificial substances. I take my vitamins, as I’ve already mentioned, a daily multivitamin and a calcium supplement for bone health, naturally. But that’s it. Nothing more. I believe in a natural approach to wellness. Are you suggesting I should be taking medication, Doctor? Because I assure you, I am perfectly capable of managing my own health. This is all rather… condescending, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Well, I’m slightly sensitive to shellfish, but it’s hardly a debilitating allergy. Just a mild rash, really. And I find that certain perfumes give me a headache, but that’s hardly a medical condition, is it? Other than that… no. I’m remarkably resilient, actually. Do you have any other… probing questions, Doctor? Because I must say, this examination is becoming quite tiresome. I had hoped for a more… streamlined experience, to be perfectly honest. Is there a reason you are focusing on potential ailments, rather than simply assuring me I am fit and healthy?
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I understand your frustration. However, a "streamlined experience" is not always possible or responsible medical care. Given your history of not providing specific information and your stated concerns about entering a new relationship, I believe a physical exam is warranted. Would you be willing to allow me to conduct one?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Good heavens, Doctor! I came for a simple check-up, not a… an invasive examination. I hardly think it’s necessary. I’ve told you repeatedly I am in excellent health. Are you suggesting I am somehow… untrustworthy? This is quite outrageous. I believe I’ve wasted enough of my time here. I think I’ll take my leave now. Thank you for your… attention.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I understand your discomfort, but refusing a basic physical examination while expressing concerns about your health is not advisable. I am concerned about providing adequate care. I strongly recommend we reschedule when you are willing to allow me to perform a proper assessment. If you are experiencing any acute symptoms, I urge you to seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day. .
