DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… my nose. It feels… not good. Like, stuffy. I have had it for… a little while now, I think. It is hard to remember exactly when it started, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint the exact start date of an illness. “A little while now” is perfectly alright for now. So, you’re experiencing nasal congestion – a stuffy nose. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, stuffy. That is it. Um… it is worse when I lay down, I think. And sometimes my head hurts, on my face, around my nose and eyes. Not a bad hurt, but… annoying. Like pressure. I take some… pills. But they do not really help much. I buy them at the store.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the congestion is worse when you lie down, and you're experiencing some facial pressure around your nose and eyes. You’ve also been taking over-the-counter medication for it, but it hasn’t provided much relief. Could you please clarify what medication you've been taking?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It is… a red box? With white letters. I do not know the name… I just ask for “something for my sinus” at the store. The lady always gives me this one. It has little, little pills inside. I do not remember if it is one pill or two… I just take it when it hurts. Is that okay? I am sorry I cannot remember the name.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Boham. Many people find it difficult to recall medication names, especially when purchased over-the-counter. Describing the packaging is helpful. To better understand what’s going on, let's move through a few more questions. Do you have any other symptoms along with the congestion and facial pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Sometimes… I feel tired. Just very tired. And maybe a little bit of a… cough? Not a big cough, just a small one sometimes. And my throat… it feels a little scratchy. But that could be from work, you know? Lots of dust. Do you… understand? I work with the… the drills. Oil work.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. You’re experiencing fatigue, a mild cough, and a scratchy throat, which you suspect might be related to your work environment. The oil work with the drills could certainly contribute to that. Now, have you noticed any fever or chills associated with these symptoms?
PATIENT: Fever…? I do not think so. I did not feel hot, if that is what you mean. And no chills… I feel warm sometimes, but that is just the weather, I think. It gets very hot during the day. No shaking or anything. Is… is that bad if I do not have a fever? I worry sometimes. I am not a doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to worry when you're not feeling well, Ms. Boham, and it’s good that you're asking questions. The absence of fever doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. Many illnesses present without fever. To help me get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as asthma, allergies, or chronic sinus infections?
PATIENT: Um… that is a hard question. I don't… I don't think so. The doctors in… El Salvador… they did not find anything. I have been healthy, mostly. Maybe a cold sometimes, like everyone. I get… a little cough every year when the weather changes. But I don’t have… asthma? Or… allergies? No, I don’t think so. I eat everything. I have never had to worry about that. Is that… helpful? I am sorry if I am not explaining it good. It is hard to remember.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Boham, and don’t apologize at all. It's perfectly fine if you don’t recall specific diagnoses. So, no known chronic medical conditions, asthma, or allergies. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No… no surgeries. And I have never been to the… the hospital. Not here, not in El Salvador. I have been very lucky, I think. Just… normal sicknesses, like when you get a cold. Nothing bad. Just… tired sometimes. This nose thing is the longest I have felt sick. It is… worrying me a little. I need to work, you know? My husband… he works too, but… we need the money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Boham. It’s good to be proactive about your health, especially when it’s impacting your ability to work. Let's talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as asthma, allergies, sinus problems, or any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Um… that is hard to know. My mama… she always had a little cough, like me. And my papa… he had high blood pressure, I think. The doctor told him to watch the salt, I remember that. And my sister… she has a little asthma, maybe? When she was small. But… we do not talk much, my sister and me. So I do not know many details. It is… complicated. Is that… okay? I am sorry I cannot give you more information. It is hard to remember all of those things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Boham. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. You’ve provided valuable information, and I appreciate you sharing what you remember. So, a history of cough in your mother, high blood pressure in your father, and asthma in your sister. Now, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? What does that mean, doctor? I am not very good with… words. I work. My husband works. We have a small house. We go to church on Sundays. What kind of information do you need? I do not… smoke, if that is what you are asking. I drink… sometimes, a little wine with dinner. Is that what you mean by social?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Boham. “Social history” simply refers to lifestyle factors. You’ve already provided helpful information. You work, you attend church, and you occasionally drink a little wine. Do you have any pets?
PATIENT: No pets, Doctor. My husband, he is allergic to cats. He gets very… sneezy and itchy. And I do not like the… the smell. So no cats, no dogs, no birds. Just us. And our neighbors’ chickens sometimes wander into the yard. They make a lot of noise! Is that… important? I am just trying to answer your questions good.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Boham. No pets, and you're aware of potential allergens from neighboring chickens. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, like I said. And the pills I take for my nose… they do not make me sick. Maybe a little sleepy sometimes, but… that is okay. I like to rest. I don’t think I am allergic to anything. I don’t feel allergic to anything. Is… is that all of the questions, Doctor? My head is starting to hurt a little. Not bad, but… a little.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Boham. That is very helpful, and you’ve answered all of my questions thoroughly. I understand your head is starting to hurt a little, and I apologize for the lengthy questioning. Now, I would like to perform a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. This will involve listening to your lungs, checking your sinuses, and looking in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay, Doctor. If it helps. Please be gentle, though? My head does hurt a little now. And I get… nervous when people touch my face. But… I trust you. Please be quick, if you can. I need to go back to work later today.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Boham. I will be as gentle and quick as possible. I understand your nervousness, and I will explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Please take some deep breaths in and out through your mouth. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your sinuses to check for tenderness. There's some tenderness over your frontal sinuses. Now, let's take a look at your throat. Please say "ah." Your throat is slightly red, but no significant swelling or exudate. Finally, I'll just quickly check your ears. Your ears appear normal. Based on my examination, you have some tenderness in your frontal sinuses, a slightly red throat, and congestion, as you described. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, it appears you may be experiencing sinusitis, likely a viral upper respiratory infection that has settled in your sinuses. However, given the duration of your symptoms, we should consider the possibility of a bacterial component.
PATIENT: Sinusitis? Is that… bad, Doctor? A bacterial… what? I do not understand all of those words. I just want my nose to stop hurting. And to be able to breathe. Will… will I need pills? Strong pills? I need to go to work, you know. I do not want to be too sick to work. My husband, he would be very worried.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed, Ms. Boham. I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. Sinusitis simply means inflammation of your sinuses – the air-filled cavities in your face. It’s quite common, especially after a cold. A bacterial component means there’s a possibility a bacterial infection is contributing to your symptoms. We don't know for sure yet. For now, I recommend a trial of supportive care and observation. This includes: Over-the-counter decongestant: Continue taking the medication you’ve been using, but be mindful of the recommended dosage and duration. Saline nasal spray: Use this several times a day to help clear congestion. Warm compresses: Apply a warm compress to your face to relieve pain and pressure. Hydration: Drink plenty of fluids. We will also order a chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia. I do not believe strong pills are necessary at this time. We will start with this approach and see if your symptoms improve over the next 72 hours. If they worsen or do not improve, we may need to consider antibiotics. Does that make sense, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: Saline… nasal spray? What is that? Is that… like water? And a… chest x-ray? That sounds… scary. Will it hurt? I do not want to get… poked. I just want some pills that will make my nose better. 72… how many days is that? I am not good with numbers. And what if… what if it gets worse? Will I have to go to the hospital? I am very worried now, Doctor. My head is hurting even more.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel worried, Ms. Boham, and I apologize for causing you anxiety. Let me clarify everything, and please don't hesitate to interrupt me if anything is unclear. A saline nasal spray is simply a saltwater solution that helps to moisten your nasal passages and clear congestion. It’s very gentle and doesn’t hurt at all. You can purchase it over the counter at any pharmacy. It comes in a spray bottle, and you simply spray it into each nostril. A chest x-ray is a quick and painless imaging test that helps us to check your lungs. You will simply stand or sit in front of a machine, and a small amount of radiation is used to create an image of your lungs. It doesn’t involve any needles or poking. 72 hours is equivalent to three days. If your symptoms worsen – such as a high fever, severe headache, or difficulty breathing – or if they do not improve after three days, we will consider further evaluation, which may include antibiotics or, in rare cases, a referral to a specialist. I do not anticipate that you will need to go to the hospital. I would like to set you up with a follow-up appointment in three days to reassess your condition. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Three days… okay. Saline… water spray. No… poking. That sounds… better. And no hospital, you think? Good. My husband, he would worry very much if I went to the hospital. He is very old. A follow-up… appointment? Does that mean I have to come back here? I need to work, Doctor. I do not know if I can take time off. But… if you think it is important, I will try. And what about the chest… x-ray? Where do I go for that? Will it cost a lot of money? I do not have much money.
DOCTOR: Yes, a follow-up appointment means you’ll come back to see me in three days. We can schedule it for a time that minimizes disruption to your work schedule. Regarding the chest x-ray, you can go to the radiology department located at [Name of local radiology clinic/hospital – provide a specific location]. I will send an order electronically to them, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. I understand your financial concerns. Let me check the cost with our billing department and see if there are any assistance programs available. We can discuss options to help make it more affordable. I will also provide you with a written referral to minimize any out-of-pocket expenses. Here is a written summary of the plan, including instructions on using the saline nasal spray, and information about the chest x-ray. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: Radiology… department. I will try to find that. And you will help with the… money? That would be very kind. My husband, he would be very grateful. It is… hard to read all of this, Doctor. The letters are very small. I think… I think that is all. I am very tired now. And my head is still hurting. Thank you for helping me, Doctor. You are very patient with me. I hope the… water spray will help. And I hope I do not need the… x-ray. But I will go if you think it is important. I should go now, I think. My husband is probably worried. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Boham. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We are here to help. Rest now, and focus on getting better. We'll see how the saline spray works, and if the x-ray is needed, we’ll discuss it further. Take care, and give my best to your husband. Goodbye, Ms. Boham.
