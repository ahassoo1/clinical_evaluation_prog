DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Chest… feels funny. And heart… goes bump-bump-bump too fast sometimes. Blood pressure, they said… high. Just want to fix it, quick. I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, “chest feels funny” and a fast heartbeat… and high blood pressure, you said. Yes, I see a little about that in your chart. “Quick” is good, we’ll try to be efficient. Can you tell me a little more about this “funny” feeling in your chest?
PATIENT: Funny… like… squeezing. Not always squeezing, you understand. Sometimes just… tight. Like someone is sitting on my chest. It happens when… when I walk fast. Or… when I angry. Yes, when I get upset. It doesn’t last long. But it’s annoying. Very annoying. And I don’t like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, squeezing or tightness in the chest, especially with walking or when you’re upset… That’s helpful. And it doesn’t last long. Does it radiate anywhere – does the feeling spread to your arm, jaw, or back at all?
PATIENT: Radiate? What’s that mean? Like… sunshine? No sunshine. It stays… here. Maybe… little bit in my left arm. Not bad. Just… feels tired. Like I carried too many groceries. But mostly… here. I’m a busy man. Don't have time for things to spread.
DOCTOR: “Radiate” just means if the feeling travels anywhere else. Okay, so mostly in the chest, sometimes a little tiredness in the left arm. And it happens when you're active or upset. Now, have you ever experienced this feeling at rest – when you're just sitting or lying down?
PATIENT: At… rest? No. When I sit… I sit. When I lie… I lie. Not much happening then. I’m not running around. It's when I do things! I have a garden, you know. Lots of work. This is important. Not sitting around feeling things.
DOCTOR: Right, it seems to be linked to activity. Okay. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you know if you’ve ever been diagnosed with any other conditions, like diabetes or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Cholesterol? Diabetes? I eat good food. Mostly. My wife cooks. She makes kimchi. Very healthy. I don’t know about… diagnoses. Doctors… always want to give you names for everything. I just want it fixed. I don't need a name.
DOCTOR: I understand. You want it fixed, and that’s what we’ll focus on. Sometimes knowing a name helps us understand how to fix it best. But we can certainly proceed without dwelling on that. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Hmph. Once. Long time ago. When I was young man. Appendicitis. They cut it out. That’s it. No other… cutting. I don’t like hospitals. Smells bad. And too many young people running around. Now, is this going to be a long process? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy many years ago. Good to know. And I understand your concern about time. Let's try to be quick. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Just… little pill for my water. My wife says I drink too much water with dinner. Something for the… swelling. Small, white pill. That’s it. I don't like taking pills. Makes me feel… slow. Is this what this appointment is about? Pills? I came here for my chest!
DOCTOR: You’re right to remind me. We are here for your chest. I just want to be thorough. The pill is just to make sure we have a complete picture. Okay, one last quick question about your family. Does anyone in your family – your parents, siblings – have heart problems or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family? My father… he was strong man. Farmer. Worked hard. My mother… she cooked. Very good cook. No… no heart problems. Not that I know of. They… they didn't go to doctors much. Too busy. Can we be done now? I really need to get going. My garden… the weeds… they are multiplying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I think I have enough information for now. Based on what you’ve told me – the chest tightness with activity and upset, the tiredness in your arm, and your blood pressure reading – it sounds like we need to investigate the possibility of angina. Angina is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It’s common, and often manageable. But it’s important to rule out anything more serious. I’d like to order an EKG – that’s a quick, painless test that measures your heart’s electrical activity – and a blood test to check your cholesterol and other levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: EKG? Blood test? More tests? Fine. Whatever. Just… make it quick. I don’t have time for long waiting rooms. And don't tell me about names for everything. Just fix it. My garden is waiting. Where do I go? And how long will this take?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The nurse will be in shortly to take you to the EKG room, and then draw some blood. The EKG itself will only take a few minutes, and the blood draw shouldn’t take long either. We should have the results back within a couple of days. I’ll review them and call you with a plan. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity, and if you experience any chest pain that doesn’t go away with rest, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room? No! No emergency room. I just want to fix my chest, not… end up in hospital. Fine. No strenuous activity. I will sit in my garden. And you call me. Quick. Weeds… the weeds are multiplying… .
