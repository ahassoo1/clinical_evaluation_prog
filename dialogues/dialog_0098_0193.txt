DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bombara. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, it is… a bit embarrassing, actually. I have been… passing a lot of gas. Much more than usual, you see. It is causing me some… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Goodstein. It's alright, there's no need to be embarrassed. These things happen. Increased gas can be quite bothersome. When did you first notice this becoming more frequent, and can you describe the discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I believe, about… oh, perhaps three weeks ago? Maybe a little longer. And the discomfort… it is not pain, exactly. More… a fullness. A bloating feeling, mostly in my stomach. And sometimes… a little cramping, but not often. It happens after I eat, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks or so, fullness and bloating, primarily after eating… and occasional cramping. Is it associated with any particular foods, as far as you can tell?
PATIENT: That is a good question. I do enjoy a good sausage, you see, from the little shop near my apartment. And cabbage. My mother makes a very good cabbage soup. Perhaps those are the cause? I also drink a lot of… fizzy drinks. The orange kind. Perhaps that is it? I am not certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, sausage, cabbage, and fizzy orange drinks… those are helpful things to know. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the gas and bloating?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, not really. I have been… a little tired lately, perhaps? But I do not sleep very well. The city is quite noisy, you see. And sometimes, my stomach makes… rumbling noises. But I think that is just from the gas. I haven't noticed anything else unusual, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tiredness and some stomach rumbling. And you mentioned the noise in the city affecting your sleep. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… movements? Oh. Well… they are… regular. I go… every day, usually. But sometimes… a little looser than usual, perhaps? Not diarrhea, no. Just… softer. And sometimes I have to go more often. But it is not a constant thing, you see. It is hard to explain. I apologize. I am not very good with these… details.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Goodstein, you’re doing just fine. Softer stools and increased frequency occasionally. Now, just to get a more complete picture, do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. I do not take any medications regularly. Just… sometimes, for a headache, I take a little pill. Aspirin, I believe it is called. But that is all, you see. I do not have any food allergies that I am aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or regular medications, just aspirin occasionally for headaches. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother… she had some trouble with her stomach when she was young. Something about… indigestion, I believe. And my father… he had a weak heart. But he lived to be eighty-five, you see. So it wasn’t too bad. And my sister… she is very healthy. No problems at all. I am not certain if that helps, Doctor. I do not know much about… medical things.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Goodstein. Any history of stomach issues is good to know. Alright, if you don't mind, I'd like to listen to your stomach and do a quick palpation – just feel your abdomen. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Here I am, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I feel a little silly, but I want to help however I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just feeling for any tenderness or masses… and listening for any unusual sounds. I do hear some increased bowel sounds, which isn't surprising given what you've told me. There's a little bit of tenderness in the lower abdomen, but nothing too significant. No masses that I can feel. Everything else seems… normal, for now.
PATIENT: Very well. That does not sound too bad, does it? Is it something serious, Doctor? I hope it is not something serious. I do enjoy my cabbage soup, you see. And my sausage. Perhaps I should stop eating those things?
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound like anything immediately serious, Mr. Goodstein. It’s likely a combination of things – the foods you mentioned, possibly some increased air swallowing, and maybe a little bit of sensitivity in your gut. The tenderness is mild, so it’s not causing me a lot of concern right now. I think, as a first step, we can try an elimination diet – reducing or eliminating the cabbage, sausage, and fizzy drinks for a week or two and see if your symptoms improve. We could also consider a medication to help with gas relief, if you're experiencing a lot of discomfort. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: An elimination diet… yes, that sounds reasonable. I can certainly try that. It will be difficult to resist the sausage, but for my health, I suppose I can manage. And a medication for the gas… yes, if it will help, that would be good. I do not want to spend all day… passing gas, you see. It is quite embarrassing. Do you have a recommendation for the medication, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, there are a few options. Simethicone is over-the-counter and can help break up gas bubbles. Another option is Beano, which you take before eating foods that cause gas – it contains an enzyme that helps digest the complex sugars. Either one could be helpful. We can also consider a probiotic supplement, which helps restore a healthy balance of gut bacteria. Let's start with Simethicone as needed, and see how that works for you. If that doesn’t provide enough relief, we can discuss the other options. I will also provide a handout with information on the elimination diet and foods to avoid. Does that sound good to you, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Simethicone… I will look for that. And the handout… yes, that will be very helpful. I appreciate your help very much. I feel much better knowing what to do. Perhaps I can finally enjoy my cabbage soup again, without… consequences.
DOCTOR: That's my hope as well, Mr. Goodstein. We'll monitor your symptoms, and if they don't improve or worsen, we can consider further testing, like a stool sample to rule out any underlying infections. But let's start with these conservative measures and see how you respond. I’ll write up a prescription for the Simethicone and print out the handout for you now. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have answered all my questions. And you have made me feel much better. Thank you again for your kindness and your help. Perhaps you should try my mother’s cabbage soup sometime. It is very good, even if it does cause… trouble.
DOCTOR: I appreciate the offer, Mr. Goodstein! Perhaps one day. Now, let’s get you those instructions and the prescription, and hopefully, you’ll be enjoying your cabbage soup – comfortably – in no time. Here you go. This handout details the elimination diet. And this is the prescription for the Simethicone. Take it as directed on the label. If you don’t see any improvement after a week or two, or if your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to call the office and schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is everything. Thank you once again for your time and your help. I truly appreciate it. Have a good day, Doctor Bombara. And thank you, again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day as well, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care now.
PATIENT: I will, Doctor. Thank you. Goodbye, Doctor Bombara.
