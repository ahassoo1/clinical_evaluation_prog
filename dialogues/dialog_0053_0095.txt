DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Nissenbaum. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about my ear. And my face, a bit. It all just…happened. Woke up yesterday and I could barely hear anything on one side, and half my face feels like it’s drooping. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. "Happened." Well, things don't just happen, Mrs. Nissenbaum. There's always a reason. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? What more specific do you want? I told you – I woke up and couldn't hear well, and my face feels…weak. Is that not specific enough? I don’t have time for a twenty-question game. I’m a radiologist, you know. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: A radiologist, are you?
PATIENT: Yes, a radiologist. And a rather good one, if I may say so myself. Though being a radiologist doesn’t make me immune to…whatever this is. Honestly, I’d expect a bit more understanding from someone in the medical field. Do you need me to draw a diagram? It’s on this side.
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. Left side. And when you say "weak," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It droops. It just…doesn’t move properly when I try to smile, or close my eye all the way. It feels…odd. Like something is pulling on it. It’s very noticeable, I assure you. I had to practically re-do my entire makeup this morning. Do you see it? It's quite alarming.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see some weakness on the left side. Can you tell me if you’ve had any pain, any changes in your taste, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little discomfort, perhaps, but nothing significant. Taste…no, I don’t think so. And swallowing is fine. Honestly, this whole situation is just… irritating. I had a very important conference call scheduled for this afternoon, and now I sound like I'm speaking through a tin can. Is there anything you can do about this quickly?
DOCTOR: Alright. And before yesterday, were there any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I was perfectly fine. I went to bed, I woke up, and then… this. I haven’t been sick, I haven’t hit my head, I haven't been exposed to anything unusual. It just…appeared. It’s all very strange and frankly, quite concerning. Are you going to run some tests, or just continue questioning me?
DOCTOR: Tests are always an option, Mrs. Nissenbaum, but a proper history is crucial first. Now, have you experienced any dizziness, ringing in your ears, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Ringing… a little, perhaps, but I often hear a faint ringing, it's just age, I suppose. Vision is perfectly fine. Honestly, Doctor, are you listening to me? I’m telling you, it all happened suddenly. Yesterday morning I was fine. Now I look like I’ve had a stroke! Is this contagious? I have a luncheon next week…
DOCTOR: A stroke is unlikely given your description, but it’s important to rule out anything serious. Now, regarding your medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Goodness, no. I’m a radiologist! We’re usually the healthy ones. I watch my diet, I exercise…well, I used to exercise regularly before all of this. I’ve never had any problems with blood pressure or sugar. Look, I just want to know what’s causing this and how quickly you can fix it. My schedule is quite demanding. Is it a virus? Perhaps a simple antibiotic will suffice?
DOCTOR: Hmm. No significant past medical history listed. No record of diabetes or hypertension. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I prefer to keep my body natural. Vitamins, yes, a daily multivitamin. And sometimes fish oil. That’s it. Really, that’s all. It’s quite simple. Are you going to examine my ear now, or should I just lie down and wait for a miracle? I have a very important appointment at three. This is all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s take a look at this ear. Please open your mouth and say "Ah." Hmm. The ear canal appears clear, but there's some slight redness behind the eardrum. Nothing immediately alarming, but it could indicate an infection.
PATIENT: An infection? Really? I haven’t been sick! I haven't even had a cold. Is that all it is? A simple ear infection? I thought it was something serious. Will an ear drop fix it? I have a luncheon next week, and I absolutely must look presentable. Tell me it’s something easily treatable. And quickly.
DOCTOR: It’s possible it’s a viral infection affecting the facial nerve, causing the weakness. The ear redness is likely a secondary issue. However, with the sudden onset and facial weakness, we need to rule out other, more serious causes. I'm going to order a CT scan to rule out any structural problems. It's the safest course of action.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Really, Doctor? All this for an earache? I’m a radiologist, you know! I understand the risks associated with radiation exposure. Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn’t we just try some antibiotics and see if it improves? Honestly, this is all becoming quite… distressing. And expensive, I presume? My insurance situation is…complicated. .
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nissenbaum, while I understand your concerns about radiation exposure, given your symptoms, and the possibility of a more serious underlying cause, a CT scan is the most responsible course of action. A proper diagnosis is crucial. Regarding your insurance, we have a financial counselor who can assist you with payment options. .
