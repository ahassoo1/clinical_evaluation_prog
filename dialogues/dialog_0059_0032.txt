DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Chagaris, you say? A…foreign name. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, of course. I’m here because…well, it’s a rather delicate matter, wouldn’t you agree? Something of an…unpleasantness. I’ve noticed a…discharge. Yes, a discharge. Rather bothersome, really. Not something a man of my age expects, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It can be quite concerning to experience something like that, and you're right to seek it checked out. It's good you came in. “Delicate matter” is a perfectly reasonable way to describe it. Could you tell me a bit more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…difficult to say precisely. It’s not…gushing, thankfully. More of a…seepage. A rather…unwelcome dampness, if you will. And it has a…peculiar odor. Not foul, mind you, but…not entirely pleasant. It’s been going on for…oh, goodness, I can't rightly say. A week? Perhaps a fortnight? My memory isn’t what it once was, you know. These things happen when one reaches a certain age.
DOCTOR: I understand. A week or a fortnight is helpful, thank you. And you mentioned a peculiar odor… can you describe it at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It's not like…rotten eggs, certainly. More…metallic, perhaps? A faint tang, like…old pennies. Or maybe…rust? It's hard to articulate, Doctor. It’s an odor one doesn't encounter frequently, thankfully. And it's not constant, you understand. Comes and goes. Mostly…after I’ve…well, after I’ve relieved myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, metallic, like old pennies or rust, and mostly after urination. That's helpful information, Mr. Krok. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain, you say? Not exactly pain, Doctor. More of a…discomfort. A slight stinging, perhaps. And a…hesitation. It takes a moment to…begin, you understand? And the stream…isn't as robust as it once was. Not that I’m complaining, mind you. A man expects a certain decline with age. But it’s…noticeable. It’s not a pleasurable experience, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort and stinging with urination, and a hesitancy to start, with a weaker stream. Thank you for describing that so clearly, Mr. Krok. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? Good heavens, no. I’m not ill, Doctor. Just…a bit of a bother. Chills, either. And abdominal pain…well, my stomach grumbles occasionally, but that's the fault of Mrs. Krok’s cooking, I assure you. No, no fever, no chills, no abdominal pain. Just this…unwelcome discharge and the slight…difficulties with urination. Honestly, Doctor, at my age, one expects a few…quirks.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of this with me, Mr. Krok. While it’s true that some changes are common with age, it’s important to investigate these symptoms just to be sure. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm…that’s a good question. Mrs. Krok handles most of the medications, you see. I recall a slight rash once, many years ago, after taking something for…indigestion, perhaps? But it was a mild irritation, easily dismissed. Nothing serious. I wouldn’t say I have any significant allergies, Doctor. Mostly, I just prefer to avoid taking pills whenever possible. They rarely agree with me.
DOCTOR: Understood. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, like vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see…Mrs. Krok insists I take a multivitamin, something with all sorts of…letters and numbers on the bottle. And occasionally, she gives me a fish oil capsule for my…joints. They ache a bit in the cold weather, you see. Other than that…no, not really. I prefer a good cup of tea for what ails me. And a brisk walk in the garden. Nature is the best medicine, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, have you had any previous medical problems or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was a long time ago. When I was a young man, I broke my arm falling from a tree. A rather foolish endeavor, now that I think about it. And…Mrs. Krok reminds me I had my appendix removed sometime in the 1970s. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. Other than that…no, not much. I've always been a relatively healthy man, you see. I attribute it to good genes and hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm in youth, appendix removed in the 1970s. Do you have any family history of medical problems, like diabetes, heart disease, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Family history…that’s a difficult question, Doctor. My father…he was a strong man, a farmer. Lived a long life, as I recall. But he wasn’t one for doctors. Mrs. Krok’s side of the family…her uncle had something with his…heart, I believe. And her brother had trouble with his…well, with a similar issue to what I’m experiencing now, if I recall correctly. A rather delicate matter, you understand. But details are hazy, I’m afraid. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krok. Any information is helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that’s acceptable. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and I’d also like to check your abdomen and perform a digital rectal exam. This is to help assess the prostate and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. I understand this can be…uncomfortable, but it’s an important part of the evaluation. Do you have any questions about the exam?
PATIENT: A…digital rectal exam? Good heavens. Is that absolutely necessary, Doctor? It sounds…rather intrusive. And frankly, a bit undignified for a man of my age. I’ve lived a long life without such examinations, you see. Couldn't we perhaps…try something else? I assure you, I’m not feeling terribly ill. Perhaps a blood test? Or some sort of…scan? I’m not certain I’m comfortable with such a…personal examination.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Krok, and I apologize if it sounds unpleasant. It is a standard part of evaluating prostate health, especially with the symptoms you’ve described – the hesitancy, weaker stream, and discharge. The prostate is located near the rectum, and a digital exam allows me to feel for any abnormalities, like enlargement or tenderness, which could indicate a problem. While blood tests and scans can be helpful, they don't always provide a complete picture. A physical exam is crucial for initial assessment. I assure you I will be as gentle and discreet as possible. However, we can certainly discuss alternative options or delay the exam if you’d prefer, but I want to be upfront that it may limit our ability to accurately diagnose the cause of your symptoms. Would you like me to explain the potential benefits and risks of proceeding with the exam in more detail?
PATIENT: Goodness gracious. It seems I have little choice, do I? A man of my age…subject to such indignities. Very well, Doctor. If it’s absolutely necessary, I suppose I can endure it. But I implore you…be gentle. And discreet, as you said. I’ve always prided myself on my dignity. And…please, no unnecessary conversation during the…examination. I find that rather…distracting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I completely understand and will ensure your comfort and dignity throughout the exam. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I will refrain from unnecessary conversation. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know, and we can stop immediately. I'm going to have you lie on your left side with your knees drawn up. Please let me know when you’re ready. I'll wash my hands and return shortly.
PATIENT: Goodness gracious. What has my life become?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Come in, Doctor. Let’s get this over with. The sooner it’s finished, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I'm just going to apply a little lubricant and then insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It may feel a bit of pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please try to relax as much as possible. Okay, that’s all for now. I did feel some enlargement of the prostate gland, and it felt slightly firm. It’s not dramatically enlarged, but it’s certainly not normal. I also noted some tenderness. This suggests the possibility of prostatitis – inflammation of the prostate – or benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate. In some cases, it could also be a sign of prostate cancer, although that's less likely at this stage. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some additional tests, including a urine analysis, a PSA blood test, and potentially a transrectal ultrasound. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Prostatitis? Enlargement? Cancer?! Good heavens, Doctor, this is hardly the news I wanted to hear. I simply came in with a bit of…discharge. Now you’re talking about inflammation and…cancer! Very well, Doctor. If you insist, order your tests. Urine analysis, blood tests, ultrasound…whatever it takes to determine what’s going on. But please, try to be as optimistic as possible. I’m not a young man, but I’m not ready to…depart just yet. And please, explain these tests to me in plain English. No medical jargon. I want to understand what you’re doing and why.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Krok, and I apologize for delivering unsettling news. I assure you, we are not jumping to any conclusions. Many men experience prostate issues as they age, and it doesn’t automatically mean cancer. We are simply gathering information to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. The urine analysis will help us check for any infection in your urinary tract. The PSA blood test measures a protein produced by the prostate gland. Elevated levels can sometimes indicate an enlarged prostate, inflammation, or, less commonly, cancer. The transrectal ultrasound involves inserting a small probe into your rectum to create an image of your prostate gland, which will help us assess its size and shape and identify any abnormalities. We'll schedule these tests as soon as possible. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and develop a plan of action. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you an antibiotic to treat any potential infection. If the antibiotic helps alleviate your symptoms, that will be a good sign. I will also recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen, to manage any discomfort. Do you have any questions about the tests, the medication, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Antibiotics…pain relievers…it all sounds rather…grim. But I suppose it’s better to be proactive, as they say. I suppose my only question is…how long will it take to get these test results? And will they be…painful? This whole experience has been rather…uncomfortable, to say the least. I’m simply hoping to get back to my garden as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to get back to your garden, Mr. Krok. Let’s focus on getting you there as quickly as possible. The lab results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. As for the transrectal ultrasound, we can schedule that for next week, and it’s generally not painful, although you may feel some mild discomfort or pressure, similar to the digital exam. We’ll use lubricant to minimize any sensation. The procedure itself only takes about 10-15 minutes. Here are the contact details for the lab and radiology department. Please call them to schedule your appointments. Once you've scheduled them, let my office know so we can track the results. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience a fever, chills, severe pain, or difficulty urinating – please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything for now, Doctor. 3-5 business days…I’ll contact the lab and radiology department as soon as possible. I appreciate your…thoroughness, Doctor, despite the…unpleasant nature of it all. And thank you for explaining everything in such…plain English. I feel somewhat reassured, although still rather…apprehensive. Well, I suppose I should be on my way. I have a garden to tend to, and a wife who is undoubtedly wondering where I am. Good day, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Get back to your garden, and please take care of yourself. .
