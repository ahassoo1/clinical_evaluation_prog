DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my leg. It’s been… puffy. After the treatments, you know? For the… the sickness. It’s just, it won't go down, and it’s a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy after treatments. Could you tell me a bit more about these treatments?
PATIENT: Oh, um… they gave me… medicine. Through the veins. And then… some rays. Like a big machine. It was a while ago now. Maybe… six months? I don’t really keep track of dates very well. It was at the hospital in town. They said it was to… fight the bad cells. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Okay, so treatments at the hospital about six months ago for… cancer, it sounds like?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Cancer. They said it was… in my breast. And now this leg. It’s mostly my calf, you know? It feels… tight. And sometimes a little sore when I walk. I just want it to be normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the puffiness is in your calf, mostly, and has been present since the end of your cancer treatments six months ago. You mentioned it's tight and sometimes sore when you walk. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg, or any pain specifically when you flex your foot, like pointing it up and down?
PATIENT: No, no redness. It doesn’t feel warm, just… big. And no, it doesn’t hurt to… move it around. Not really. It’s more of a… dull ache, if I walk too much. It’s hard to explain. It just feels wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with walking, and mostly just a feeling of it being wrong. Have you had any history of blood clots or deep vein thrombosis before?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Oh dear… I don’t think so. The doctors never said anything about that. I had a… a bad fall when I was younger, broke my arm, but that was a long time ago. No clots, as far as I know. Honestly, Doctor, I forget half the things they tell me! It’s awful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Queener, it's common to forget details, especially with everything you've been through. Okay, so no known history of blood clots. Let's do a quick examination of your leg, if that's okay with you. I'll just need to feel and measure your calf circumference, and listen to your pulses. It will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please? It’s a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Queener. Okay, so the circumference of your left calf is 38 centimeters, and your right calf is 36 centimeters. So there's a 2 centimeter difference. Your pulses are present, but a bit diminished on your left side compared to your right. And when I gently press on your calf, there’s a little bit of tenderness. No noticeable warmth or redness. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it sounds like you may have some post-thrombotic syndrome, or post-thrombotic edema. This can happen after cancer treatment, even if you didn't have a diagnosed blood clot, due to inflammation and changes in the veins. It’s essentially some swelling and discomfort in the leg because the veins aren’t draining as efficiently. However, to be certain, we should rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Post… what now? That sounds… complicated. So, it’s not a new clot? Is that what you're saying? Because I really don't want another problem. I just want this swelling to go away. Is there… medicine for it? Something to make it better?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have a new clot, though we need to confirm that first. Post-thrombotic syndrome happens after a clot has resolved, or sometimes even without a clearly identified clot, as a result of the treatment itself. It's essentially the leg not draining fluid as well as it should. To rule out a current clot, I’d like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. That will give us a clear picture of the veins and blood flow. If that comes back negative for a clot, then we can focus on managing the post-thrombotic edema. For that, we can try compression stockings, which help improve blood flow. Elevating your leg when you rest can also help reduce swelling. In some cases, diuretics, which are water pills, can be helpful, but we’ll need to discuss that if the other measures aren’t enough. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An ultrasound… alright. And stockings? Like… the tight ones? I remember my mother wearing those. Will they help? I really don't like feeling… restricted. But if it makes the swelling go down… yes. Do what you think is best, Doctor. Just… not too tight, please. And how long will the ultrasound take? I have a… a bridge game on Thursday.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll make sure they aren’t too tight. They come in different compression levels, and we’ll find a comfortable one for you. The ultrasound usually takes about 30-45 minutes. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning, which should give us results by Thursday. And it shouldn't interfere with your bridge game. I'll write you a prescription for the stockings and a referral for the ultrasound. In the meantime, try to elevate your leg whenever possible and avoid prolonged standing or sitting. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Nothing I know of, anyway. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting old! Thank you, Doctor. You've been very… patient with me. I do forget things so easily. A referral for the ultrasound… good. That sounds… reassuring.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. It’s my job, and I'm happy to help. Forgetfulness is common, especially with everything you've been through. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the ultrasound for you before you leave. Here’s the prescription for the stockings and the referral for the ultrasound. The receptionist will give you the details for scheduling. If you experience any new or worsening pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, please don't hesitate to call the clinic or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I'll call about the ultrasound right away. And I'll try to remember to… elevate my leg. It was nice meeting you. .
DOCTOR: It was nice meeting you too, Ms. Queener. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and enjoy your bridge game! .
