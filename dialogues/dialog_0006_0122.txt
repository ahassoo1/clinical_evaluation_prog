DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… difficult to explain, but I have been noticing some things with my memory. It is new. Just recently. I am… concerned.
DOCTOR: Memory issues, okay. “Recently” – can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Perhaps… three months? No more than four. It is not a complete forgetting, you understand. More like… words escaping me. Or… forgetting why I walked into a room. Small things, but they happen more often now. It is worrying because my blood pressure has been… not good.
DOCTOR: Three to four months. And you’ve noticed it’s coinciding with some blood pressure concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. The doctor before… he was very good, but he… passed away. And now my new doctor, he says my blood pressure is too high. He gave me… pills. But these memory things started around the same time. It could be nothing, I suppose. But I thought I should mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good you’re bringing it up. New medication can sometimes have side effects, so that’s definitely something to consider. What’s the name of the medication, if you recall?
PATIENT: I… believe it was… Lisinopril? Yes. Lisinopril. A small, white pill. I take it every morning. I… do not always remember if I took it, which is… ironic, considering. And… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, alright. We’ll look into that. And these memory lapses… can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Yes. Just yesterday, I was preparing for a meeting with the community association. Very important meeting. I had all the papers, everything organized. I walked into the kitchen to get a glass of water… and I completely forgot what I was going to do. I stood there for a full minute, trying to remember. Finally, I just… went back to the papers. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Kitchen, meeting papers… okay. And is this happening with other things, or mostly related to tasks and appointments?
PATIENT: Mostly tasks, I think. Remembering names… no. Faces… sometimes, but I always apologize. It is the doing things that is difficult. Like, I will start to cook… and forget what I was making halfway through. Or… put the keys in the refrigerator. Small things. But increasingly frequent. I am a very organized person, Doctor. It is… not like me.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… No, not really. I… sleep well enough. I eat… normally. I feel… tired, perhaps. But that is just from the stress of everything, I think. The community association is very demanding. And being… alone now… it is difficult. My husband passed three years ago. But no, no other… significant changes. Just the memory.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a broader picture, can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I had pneumonia when I was younger, but that was many years ago. And… my cholesterol is a little high, but nothing serious. Otherwise, I have been… quite healthy. Until recently, of course. My blood pressure was always fine until… perhaps the last year. The doctor said it was likely stress. But now… it is much higher, even with the pills. And this memory… it worries me greatly.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia, high cholesterol, blood pressure increasing in the last year… okay. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. No hospitalizations. I… broke my arm as a child, but that was a very long time ago. Nothing serious in my adult life. I always tried to stay active. Walked every day. But with everything happening… it is difficult to maintain my routine now. I feel… overwhelmed. Perhaps that is contributing to it?
DOCTOR: It very well could be. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I… used to have seasonal allergies, but they have improved with age. Nothing that requires medication. I can eat anything, take any medication… usually. It is just… this memory thing. It is very disturbing, Doctor. It is not like me at all. It makes me… anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a multivitamin. A small one. Every morning with my Lisinopril. And… sometimes, I take ibuprofen for a headache, but not often. Perhaps once a month. That is all, Doctor. I promise. Just the Lisinopril and the multivitamin, and occasionally, ibuprofen. I am a simple woman, Doctor. I do not take many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara. Let’s check your blood pressure again, and I’d like to do a quick neurological exam, just to get a baseline. Nothing to worry about, just routine. It'll help us rule things out. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Please, do what you need to do. I just want to understand what is happening. I am… eager to find a solution. I hope it is nothing serious. I apologize for being so… anxious. I am usually a very calm person. But this… this is worrying.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. It’s perfectly understandable. I’m going to inflate the cuff now. Just relax your arm. Okay. Blood pressure is elevated, 160 over 95. We’ll need to discuss that. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes, balance, and a few simple cognitive functions. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. Is this… alright? I am trying to be very still. It is… difficult. I always have trouble with coordination. But I am trying my best. I apologize if I am slow.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. You’re doing fine. Now, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? Let me think… It is… August. Yes, August. The second, I believe. August 2nd, 2025. Yes, that is correct. Is something wrong, Doctor? I… usually remember dates easily. But I was preoccupied earlier. The community association… it is very demanding.
DOCTOR: Okay. August 2nd, 2025. Good. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I'll say them, and you try to remember them. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am ready. Please, say the words. I will try my very best. I… hope I can remember them. I am already anxious about forgetting. But I will try. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… yes. Table… I… Penny… yes. Apple, Penny… and… I… I can't remember the third word. I know there was a third word, but it is… escaping me. It was something simple, I am sure. Apple, Penny… I apologize, Doctor. This is… unnerving.
DOCTOR: Alright. Apple, Penny… okay. Now, I’m going to ask you a simple math question. What is 10 minus 7?
PATIENT: Ten minus seven? That is… easy. It is three. Three, Doctor. A very simple calculation. I apologize for my trouble with the words, but math… math I understand. Always have.
DOCTOR: Three. Good. Alright, Ms. Alvara. That’s enough for now. Based on what you’ve told me and this quick exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The memory issues, combined with the high blood pressure, could be related to medication side effects, stress, or something else. It's too early to say definitively. I want to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel and a thyroid panel. And I’d like you to schedule an MRI of your brain, just to rule out any structural issues. Now, I also want to discuss your blood pressure. It's consistently elevated despite the Lisinopril. We may need to adjust your dosage or add another medication. I also recommend a follow-up appointment with a neurologist to further assess your memory. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds sensible. Blood work, an MRI… and a neurologist. I… understand. I want to find out what is happening, and I will do whatever you recommend. I apologize for being… difficult. I just… feel anxious. It is… unsettling to feel my memory failing. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, schedule the tests. And… tell me what I need to do. I will do whatever is necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. I’ve ordered the blood work. You can schedule that at the front desk. I’m also sending a referral to Dr. Levin, a neurologist in the area. His office will contact you to schedule the MRI. In the meantime, continue taking the Lisinopril as prescribed, but keep a log of any side effects you experience. And… try to manage your stress as much as possible. Easier said than done, I know. I'm going to increase your Lisinopril dosage slightly. We'll monitor your blood pressure closely. And... I'll give you a list of resources for managing stress and memory. Here’s that list, and the lab requisition. I want to see you back in two weeks to review the results. If you experience any sudden changes or worsening symptoms, don't hesitate to contact the office. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds like a good plan. More Lisinopril, blood work, a neurologist… and a follow-up appointment. I… appreciate your thoroughness. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I… feel a little better knowing we are taking steps to find out what is happening. I will contact Dr. Levin and schedule the MRI. And I will keep a log of any side effects. Thank you again, Doctor. I… will see you in two weeks. I hope it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. We'll do everything we can to figure this out. And try not to worry too much until we have more information. If anything comes up before your appointment, please don't hesitate to call. Take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I… will see you soon.
