DOCTOR: Hi Ellan, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it for my arthritis. Says it'll do wonders. Frankly, I thought it was for… other people. But she insists, and I’m a reasonable woman. So, here I am. I understand you can… certify one for it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. We do have patients who find medical marijuana helpful for managing arthritis pain, among other conditions. It's good you're exploring all your options. And it’s definitely not just for “other people” anymore, as you said! To see if it might be a good fit for you, though, I need to get a better understanding of your arthritis and your overall health. Let's start with your arthritis. Where exactly are you experiencing pain, and how long have you been dealing with it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, really. Mostly my knees, and my hands. Makes it awfully difficult to do my needlepoint, you know. And my back… don’t even get me started. I’ve had it for… well, a long time. Decades, I suppose. Since before I retired. I was a bailiff, you see. Lots of standing, lots of… unpleasantness. Not a sedentary job, let me assure you. It’s just gotten worse with age, naturally.
DOCTOR: Decades… that's quite a while. And a bailiff – that definitely sounds physically demanding. So, the pain is primarily in your knees, hands, and back. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it varies, Doctor. It’s not like it’s a simple thing. Some days I wake up and it’s manageable. Other days… well, getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain. My husband, Harold, he has to help me sometimes. It’s worse in the cold weather, definitely. Dampness too. It’s just… old age, really. Although my daughter insists it’s not “just” old age. She reads all sorts of things on the internet, you know.
DOCTOR: It is good that your daughter is involved and looking out for you. And you're right, pain rarely is "simple." It sounds like it significantly impacts your daily life, especially on colder, damp days. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about the type of pain?
PATIENT: The type? What do you mean, “type”? It hurts, Doctor. What more type is there? Is it a sharp pain? A dull ache? It changes! Some days it’s throbbing, other days it’s… like needles. Honestly, it’s just… unpleasant. I’m not a doctor, you know. I don’t have a vocabulary for all of these… specifics. I just know it makes it difficult to enjoy my life. Is that specific enough?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, you shouldn’t need a medical vocabulary to describe pain! And "unpleasant" is a perfectly valid description. It sounds like you experience a variety of sensations – sharp, dull, throbbing, and even needle-like pain. That variability is helpful to know. Let's try this a different way. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you can imagine, what would you say your pain is typically like?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… Honestly? It fluctuates so much. On a good day, maybe a three or four. But on a bad day… Oh, goodness, sometimes it gets to an eight, maybe even a nine. Especially when the weather is bad. It’s… debilitating, really. I have to lie down, take pills… Harold has to bring me everything. It’s just… awful. I don’t like being dependent.
DOCTOR: That's a significant range, and an eight or nine is certainly debilitating. It sounds like the pain really impacts your quality of life and independence, especially on those bad days. Now, besides the pain itself, are there any other symptoms you experience with your arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my joints do get… stiff. Especially in the mornings. It takes me a good hour just to get moving. And sometimes they swell up, particularly my knuckles. They look… rather unsightly, to be frank. And… I suppose I get tired more easily than I used to. But that could just be my age, of course. I don’t know. It’s hard to say what’s the arthritis and what’s just… getting old.
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the mornings and swelling in your knuckles, that's very common with arthritis. And you're right, fatigue can be difficult to attribute solely to arthritis, but it's good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. And I have… high blood pressure, the doctor tells me. I take pills for it, of course. Harold reminds me. And… I suppose I've had the usual things. A touch of the flu here and there. Nothing serious. I’ve never been a sickly person, you understand. I’m a strong woman. But that’s about it. Nothing else that I can think of, really. I've never been one for complaining to doctors. I only go when absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and high blood pressure – that's helpful to know. And you take medication for the blood pressure, which is good. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, sometimes I take ibuprofen for the arthritis pain, when it’s really bad. But only as needed. I try not to take too many pills, you know. I don't want to become dependent on them. And… oh! I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I was a little low. Other than that… no, I don't think so. Just the vitamin D, the ibuprofen when necessary, and the blood pressure pills. Harold keeps track of it all, really. I just take what he gives me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen as needed for arthritis pain, vitamin D supplement, and medication for high blood pressure. And Harold helps you manage your medications. That’s very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I've never had a serious allergic reaction. I mean, I might get a little sniffle when the pollen is bad, but that's just… seasonal. Nothing to write home about. I’m not allergic to any medications that I know of. I’ve taken so many pills over the years, I’d certainly know if I was. No, I don't have any allergies. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let's quickly touch on your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my mother had… arthritis, of course. But who doesn't have arthritis? And my father… he had heart trouble. That’s why he… well, that's another story. And my sister… she had diabetes. But other than that… not really. Nothing major. We weren’t a very… medical family. We just… dealt with things. Didn’t spend a lot of time talking about illnesses. It was considered rather… impolite, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so arthritis, heart trouble, and diabetes in the family. That's helpful information. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Are you suggesting…? I am a respectable woman, Doctor. I have never touched a cigarette in my life. And I might have a small glass of sherry with dinner occasionally, but that's just for medicinal purposes, you understand. It helps me relax. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not! I wouldn't dream of it. I believe in a healthy lifestyle. Moderation in all things, that's my motto.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. I apologize if my question was presumptuous. A small glass of sherry occasionally is perfectly reasonable. Now, one last thing before we do a quick physical exam. What are your goals for coming here today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, frankly I’m tired of being in pain. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about how this… medical marijuana will help me sleep, ease the stiffness, allow me to enjoy my needlepoint again. I want to be able to live my life, you understand? I don’t want to be dependent on pills, I don’t want to lie in bed all day, and I certainly don’t want to be a burden to my husband. If this… marijuana can help me with that, then I’m willing to try it. That's why I came here, to see if I'm a candidate. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: That is very clear. You want to reduce your pain, improve your quality of life, and maintain your independence – and you’re hoping medical marijuana might be a way to do that. I completely understand. Alright. To help determine if you might be a good candidate, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. We’ll just check your joints for swelling and range of motion, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please be gentle. My joints are rather sensitive, you know. And don't take too long. I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I'll be quick. Let's start by having you sit on the examination table. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Could you bend them for me, as much as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is… awkward. There. That's about as far as I can go. They creak something awful, you know. It feels like gravel grinding together. And it’s… rather painful, to be honest. It's gotten worse over the years. Harold says I walk like an old woman. He’s probably right.
DOCTOR: I see a slight swelling on both knees, and there is some tenderness when I press here. And I can definitely feel the creaking you mentioned. Your range of motion is a bit limited, as you said. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Do you experience pain in your knuckles?
PATIENT: Yes, particularly in these knuckles. It’s worse in the morning, you know. They’re stiff and swollen, and it’s difficult to make a fist. Sometimes they ache all day. And as you can see… They’re rather unsightly, aren’t they? My daughter says it’s just “part of aging,” but I think it’s more than that. It’s… debilitating. I can’t do my needlepoint like I used to. And that's one of my favorite things! It's terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see some definite swelling and redness in the knuckles of both hands. There's some tenderness when I press on them, and your range of motion is somewhat limited. I can see how that would make it difficult to do your needlepoint. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart and lungs sound clear. No concerning sounds there. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me, and what I've observed during the exam, it sounds like you likely have osteoarthritis in your knees and hands. The pain, swelling, stiffness, and limited range of motion are all consistent with that diagnosis.
PATIENT: Osteoarthritis, you say? Well, I suppose that figures. My mother had something similar. It's just… terribly inconvenient. So, does that mean I'm a candidate for this… marijuana? My daughter keeps saying it will change my life. I just want to be able to enjoy my hobbies again, you know? And not be dependent on pills. Is it safe? I've heard all sorts of things…
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking those questions. Yes, given your symptoms and medical history, you are a candidate for medical marijuana. It could potentially help with your pain, stiffness, and sleep, and could allow you to reduce your reliance on other medications. Now, regarding safety. Like any medication, medical marijuana does have potential side effects. Common ones include dizziness, drowsiness, and dry mouth. It can also interact with other medications, which is why it’s important to disclose everything you’re taking. And it’s important to start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed. It's also important to note that marijuana can affect people differently. Some people experience significant relief, while others may not. It’s not a cure-all, but for many people with osteoarthritis, it can be a helpful addition to their treatment plan. Do you have any specific concerns about potential side effects or interactions?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t like the idea of feeling dizzy or drowsy. I still drive, you know. And I certainly don't want to feel "out of it." And I take a small blood pressure pill every day. Will that interact with it? Harold is terribly worried about my blood pressure. He checks it constantly. And… I suppose I’m a little worried about the legality of it all. I’m a law-abiding citizen, you understand. I don’t want to get into any trouble. My daughter assures me it’s perfectly legal now, but… well, you never know.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns. You're right to be cautious. Let's address them one by one. First, dizziness and drowsiness. We would start you on a very low dose, and closely monitor your response. If you experience any significant side effects, we can adjust the dose or discontinue the medication. It’s also important not to drive or operate heavy machinery if you’re feeling drowsy. Regarding your blood pressure medication, there is a potential for interaction, although it’s usually mild. We’ll need to monitor your blood pressure closely, especially when you first start taking the marijuana. Your husband’s diligence in checking your blood pressure is excellent. And you're right, the legality of medical marijuana varies by state and locality. Here, it is legal with a physician’s certification. I will provide you with all the necessary documentation. Now, if we decide to proceed, the next step would be to complete the necessary paperwork and obtain a medical marijuana card. We can discuss different forms of marijuana – oils, edibles, etc. – and find one that’s right for you. Does that sound like something you’d be interested in?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. I am tired of being in pain, and my daughter insists it will help. And I trust her judgment, mostly. But I still have reservations. I don't like the idea of feeling "out of it," and I certainly don't want to get into any trouble with the law. If you promise to monitor my blood pressure closely, and assure me it won't interfere with my medication, and if you can guarantee I won't feel dizzy or drowsy… then I suppose I'm willing to try it. But please, be careful. And don't hesitate to tell me if you think it's not a good idea. I don’t want to make things worse. Let’s start with… whatever is the least likely to cause side effects. Oils, you said?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you I will proceed with caution. We will monitor your blood pressure closely, and we can always adjust the dosage or discontinue the medication if needed. I also want to emphasize that I will be here to support you every step of the way. You are right to start with the least likely to cause side effects. Marijuana oils, specifically those with a higher CBD content and lower THC content, are a good starting point. CBD is non-psychoactive, meaning it won’t make you feel “high” or dizzy. THC is the component that can cause psychoactive effects, and we’ll keep the dosage very low. I will complete the necessary paperwork to get you a medical marijuana card. It takes a few days to process. Once you receive it, you can visit a licensed dispensary to purchase the oil. I will also provide you with a detailed information sheet on safe usage, potential side effects, and how to monitor your response. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… acceptable. Please, just be careful. And keep a close eye on my blood pressure. Harold will be relieved to hear that you’re monitoring it closely. He worries terribly, you know. And please, give me your direct number. Just in case. I don’t want to have to go through a lot of red tape if I experience any side effects. I’m a bit old-fashioned, you see. I prefer to speak to a real person. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. And I hope this works. I really do. I just want to be able to enjoy my life again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here is my direct number. Please don’t hesitate to call, even if it’s just to ask a question. I understand your concerns, and I am here to support you. I’ll also make a note to check in with you in a week to see how you’re doing. I’m optimistic that this will help you manage your pain and improve your quality of life. And I’m glad to hear you’re willing to try it. I will have my nurse give you the paperwork and the information sheet on the way out. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all for now. Thank you again for your patience and understanding. And please, be careful. I suppose I should be going. Harold is probably wondering where I am. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ellan. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope you have a wonderful day. Take care.
