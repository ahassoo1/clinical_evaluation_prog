DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Memmolo. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Tremor, you said? Yes. It's… well, it’s my hands. They shake. Been happening for a while now, I guess. Not sure how long exactly. Everything’s a bit blurry these days, you know?
DOCTOR: A tremor…right. And you said “a while now”?
PATIENT: Yeah, a while. Months, maybe? Longer? It comes and goes. Worse when I’m trying to… do things. Like, holding a cup. Or… well, anything that needs a steady hand. Used to be good with my hands, you know. Worked at the plant for… a long time. Water and wastewater. Don’t remember the exact number of years anymore.
DOCTOR: Right. And is it just your hands, or do you notice it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. Just the hands, I think. Maybe a little bit… unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I figured that’s just getting old. I fall now and then, but that’s… well, you know. Old age. It’s a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed anything else accompanying the tremor?
PATIENT: Accompanying it? Like… what do you mean? It just shakes. Sometimes it's worse when I'm stressed, I suppose. And… well, I get tired easier these days, but that could be the age too, right? I don't know. Everything feels… off. Honestly, I can't put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. Just… a little something for my blood pressure, I think. Small white pill. Doctor gave it to me a while back. Can’t remember the name of it, though. Never been one for taking a lot of pills. Don’t like how they make you feel.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. I eat… well, I eat whatever my daughter brings over. She's a good girl, always looking after me. Don’t think I'm allergic to anything. Nope. Never been. Are we almost done? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just have a quick look at your hands and do a brief neurological exam. Just to get a better picture of things. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Neurological… exam? Is it going to be uncomfortable? I don't like being poked and prodded. Look, I just want to know if this shaking is something serious, you know? Is it Parkinson's? My neighbor had Parkinson’s, and… well, it wasn’t pretty. I just want a quick answer, if you can. Can we just… skip the exam?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your concerns, but a proper examination is necessary. I can’t give you an accurate assessment—or even a guess—without one. It’s standard procedure. It’s not about poking and prodding; it’s about gathering information. It won’t be extensive, I assure you. Please, have a seat. We’ll start with your hands.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But make it quick. I haven't got all day. I just hope this isn’t going to take too long. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. I'm going to check your reflexes and observe the tremor. Now, extend your arms…like this. Don’t tense up. Just let them rest. Hmm. The tremor is most prominent at rest. And it seems to be…slightly asymmetrical. Reflexes are… diminished, but not absent. Now, can you tap your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: This is awkward. I feel like an old fool. See? Useless. I told you. Everything's going. I used to be so steady. It's all…going. My daughter says I'm just getting old, but… this feels different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the limited examination and your history…it could be essential tremor, or… early signs of Parkinson’s disease. It's too early to say definitively without further investigation. I’m going to order a brain scan—an MRI—and refer you to a neurologist for a full evaluation. They’ll be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and discuss treatment options. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A brain scan? A… neurologist? Sounds…serious. More tests? More doctors? I just wanted to know if it was something I should worry about. Is it bad? Will I… will I end up like my neighbor? Honestly, I’m not sure I can handle much more of this. It’s all… a bit much. Can't we just… try a pill? Something to make it stop shaking? My daughter will be furious if I have to go through all these tests…
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your anxiety, but a diagnosis requires proper investigation. I cannot simply prescribe a "pill" without knowing the cause of the tremor. The MRI will help rule out other possible causes, and the neurologist is the specialist best equipped to assess your condition. I am referring you, not abandoning you. Here is the referral to Dr. Novak. Their office will contact you to schedule an appointment. It is important that you follow up with them as soon as possible. Do you have any questions about the referral process?
PATIENT: Questions? I… I don't even know what to ask anymore. Dr. Novak… is that far? Will I have to wait a long time? I just want this to be over with. My daughter handles all this paperwork anyway. I’ll just give this to her. Honestly, Doctor, I just feel… lost. I’m an old man. I just want to be able to hold a cup of coffee without shaking. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I understand your frustration. But I've provided the referral, and that's all I can do at this time. I have other patients waiting. I wish you all the best with your follow-up appointment. .
