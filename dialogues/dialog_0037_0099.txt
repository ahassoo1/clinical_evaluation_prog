DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Minatra. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I received the results from my gastrointestinal endoscopy test, and the doctor who performed it said there were some…abnormalities. He suggested I come see someone to discuss them further, and my primary care physician recommended you. I must admit, I'm a little anxious about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Minatra. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way when you're waiting to understand test results. We’ll definitely go through everything together, step by step. First, do you happen to have a copy of the endoscopy report with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here it is. I made sure to bring all the paperwork they gave me. It's a bit of a mess, I apologize. My hands were shaking a little when I gathered it.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Minatra. It's completely understandable. Okay, I see here that the endoscopy was performed on July 26th at City General. The report indicates some polyps were found in the colon. It also mentions…biopsies were taken, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. They did take several biopsies. The doctor explained something about needing to look at them under a microscope, but honestly, I was so flustered I didn't absorb much of what he said after he mentioned "polyps." It sounded…serious. Is it? I suppose that’s what I’m really asking.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re asking. Polyps are fairly common, Ms. Minatra, and often aren’t cancerous. However, they can sometimes develop into cancer over time, which is why they remove them and send them to pathology for examination. That’s why the biopsies were taken – to determine what kind of polyps they are and if any further treatment is needed. Do you know where these polyps were located in your colon?
PATIENT: I…I don't recall the specifics, Doctor. He used a lot of medical terms, and frankly, my memory isn't what it used to be. I believe he said something about the…ascending colon? And maybe the sigmoid colon? But I wouldn't swear to it. He had a diagram, but I was so focused on not…fainting, I didn’t pay close attention to where exactly he was pointing. Is that information important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know the location, but don't worry about not remembering. We can look at the report again, and it should specify the polyp locations. Okay, here we are. It does indicate polyps were found in the ascending colon, the transverse colon, and the sigmoid colon. There were three polyps removed in total. The pathology report describes them as…adenomatous polyps. Now, adenomatous polyps are the type that can become cancerous, but thankfully, the report also states that they were all… tubular adenomas, and they were…small. The report indicates no evidence of invasive carcinoma. Before we proceed, do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. No allergies that I am aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication, thankfully. Though, I try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. My late husband, bless his soul, was allergic to penicillin, but that was him, not me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Minatra. And I’m sorry to hear about your husband. So, regarding your medical history, have you had any other significant health issues in the past?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was some years ago now. Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed in 1987. And I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about fifteen years ago, but it’s been well-managed with medication ever since. Other than that…just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I’ve never been a smoker, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. My grandmother always said a good diet is the key to a long life.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Ms. Minatra. So, gallbladder removal in 1987, and well-controlled hypertension. And no smoking or excessive alcohol. That’s excellent. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day, in the morning. And I occasionally take Ibuprofen for arthritis pain in my knees, but only when it’s really bothering me. Perhaps two or three times a month, and then just the over-the-counter dose. Nothing else, I assure you. Here’s what I take regularly. You can see, it’s not much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Minatra. That’s very helpful. Lisinopril 20mg daily, and Ibuprofen as needed. Now, have you had any family history of colon cancer, or any other gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My family…we weren’t very good at keeping medical records. We come from a long line of…sturdy people who didn’t bother doctors much. My mother’s side, they were all farmers, very robust. I believe my grandfather had some sort of stomach trouble, but I don’t know the specifics. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about these things. No one I know of ever had cancer, but that doesn't mean much, does it?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean much, Ms. Minatra. Family history can be difficult to ascertain, and sometimes it’s just not available. It’s good you’ve thought about it, though. Alright. So, based on the endoscopy report, your history, and everything we’ve discussed, the polyps removed were tubular adenomas, and the pathology report showed no evidence of invasive carcinoma. The recommendation typically with tubular adenomas is surveillance colonoscopies to monitor for any recurrence. Do you have any questions for me before we discuss the specifics of that surveillance schedule?
PATIENT: No evidence of…cancer? That’s…very good news, isn't it? Surveillance colonoscopies…that means I have to go through that procedure again? How often? And will they have to remove more polyps? I…I didn't enjoy the preparation for the first one, to be honest. It wasn't a pleasant experience. I suppose if it’s necessary, it's necessary, but…it's a little daunting.
DOCTOR: Yes, no evidence of invasive carcinoma is very good news, Ms. Minatra. That’s the most important thing. And you’re right to ask about the surveillance colonoscopies. It’s important to understand what that entails. The frequency of surveillance depends on several factors, including the size and number of polyps removed, and if there were any high-risk features on the pathology report. In your case, since you had three tubular adenomas, the recommendation would be a follow-up colonoscopy in five years. As for the preparation, I understand it's not pleasant. There are different preparation options available now, some of which are more tolerable than others. We can discuss those options and find one that's best suited for you. We can also discuss ways to make the process more comfortable. Do you have any concerns about undergoing another colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Five years…that feels manageable. And different preparation options…that’s good to know. The one I had last time was…thorough, shall we say. I suppose my biggest concern is…what if they find more? What if these new ones are cancerous? I know you said the pathology report was clear, but…I can’t help but worry. And what if the procedure itself causes complications? I read some things online… I realize I shouldn’t look things up on the internet, but…it’s hard not to.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Minatra. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about the possibility of recurrence, or potential complications. The risk of finding more polyps is always there, but remember that colonoscopies are excellent at detecting and removing them before they have a chance to develop into cancer. We’ll be monitoring you closely. As for complications, they are rare. The most common complications are minor, such as bloating or abdominal discomfort. Serious complications, such as bleeding or perforation, are very uncommon, occurring in less than 1% of cases. We take every precaution to minimize those risks, and we have protocols in place to manage them if they do occur. To help ease your mind, we can discuss the procedure in detail, and I can answer any questions you have. We can also talk about lifestyle modifications that can help reduce your risk of recurrence, such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking. Would you like to discuss those options now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be very helpful. I think…understanding the procedure itself would make me feel much better. What exactly happens during a colonoscopy? And what kind of preparation should I expect this time? Is it the same as last time? And…what about the lifestyle modifications? What exactly should I be doing differently? I try to eat well, but I suppose I could always improve.
DOCTOR: Certainly. So, during a colonoscopy, you’ll be lying on your side, and we’ll gently insert a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum. This allows us to visualize the entire length of your colon. We’ll be looking for any polyps or other abnormalities. If we find any polyps, we’ll remove them using specialized instruments. The procedure is typically painless, as you’ll be given sedation to help you relax and minimize any discomfort. As for the preparation, there are several options available now. The traditional prep involves drinking a large volume of a liquid solution to cleanse the colon. However, there are newer, lower-volume preps that are often more tolerable. We can discuss which option is best suited for you, based on your preferences and medical history. Some preps involve taking pills, while others involve drinking a smaller volume of liquid. We’ll provide detailed instructions on how to prepare for the procedure, and we’ll answer any questions you have. Regarding lifestyle modifications, maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and fiber can help reduce your risk of recurrence. Regular exercise is also important, as it can help improve your overall health. Avoiding smoking is crucial, as smoking is linked to an increased risk of colon cancer. We can also discuss the importance of regular screenings, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your condition. Do you have any questions about any of these aspects?
PATIENT: That…sounds manageable, Doctor. The newer preps sound much more appealing, to be honest. And I already try to eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly, so I’m on the right track there. I suppose my biggest concern is…the sedation. I don’t like feeling…out of control. Will I be completely unconscious? And will I need someone to drive me home? I live alone, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Minatra. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about the sedation. You won’t be completely unconscious, but you will be very relaxed and likely won't remember much of the procedure. It’s what we call “twilight sedation.” You’ll be able to respond to questions and commands, but you’ll be very drowsy and comfortable. And yes, you absolutely will need someone to drive you home, and to stay with you for a few hours afterward. Because of the sedation, you won’t be able to drive yourself, and we recommend having someone stay with you for the rest of the day to monitor your condition. Since you live alone, we’ll need to make arrangements to ensure you have a ride home and someone to stay with you afterward. Do you have any family or friends who can help?
PATIENT: That’s…difficult, Doctor. My only family is a niece, and she lives several states away. She’s very busy with her own family and…I wouldn't want to impose. I have a few acquaintances from my gardening club, but…they’re not particularly close friends. I suppose I could ask…but I feel uncomfortable burdening them. I didn't realize this would be so complicated.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Minatra. It’s understandable to feel uncomfortable asking for help, and it’s good you’re thinking ahead. We do have resources available to help patients who don’t have someone to accompany them. We can arrange for a medical escort to drive you home and stay with you for a few hours afterward. There may be a small fee associated with this service, but it’s often covered by insurance. We can also discuss the possibility of scheduling the procedure at a different time, when you might be able to arrange for a ride and someone to stay with you. The most important thing is to ensure you have a safe and comfortable experience. Let’s explore those options, and see what works best for you. We can contact the medical escort service and get a quote, and we can also look at different dates and times for the procedure. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: That…sounds much better, Doctor. A medical escort would be a great relief. I wouldn't want to put anyone out. Yes, please, let's explore those options. I'm willing to be flexible with the date and time. As long as I know I'll be safe and well-cared for, I’m happy to proceed. You’ve been very helpful and reassuring, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I’m glad I could help. It’s my job to ensure you feel comfortable and informed, and we’ll take all the necessary steps to make this a safe and positive experience. Okay, let me see…here’s a reputable service called “Safe Ride Home.” They provide reliable transportation and post-procedure monitoring. Let me check their availability for the next few weeks and get a quote for their services. While I’m doing that, are there any other questions or concerns you have?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything for now. I’m trusting you to take care of the arrangements. I'm sure you'll find a suitable date and time, and I'm relieved to know there’s a medical escort service available. Honestly, I was quite frightened when I first came in, but you’ve put my mind at ease. Thank you again for your kindness and patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Minatra. That's what I'm here for. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. We’ll get everything scheduled for you, and we’ll make sure you have all the information you need. I’ll contact Safe Ride Home and get their availability, and then I’ll give you a call back to discuss the best date and time for the procedure. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s my direct line, feel free to reach out anytime. Now, let's get this scheduled.
