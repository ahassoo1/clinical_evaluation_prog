DOCTOR: Hi Andrew, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Dry eyes. That's why I'm here. Feels like sand, sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to bother a fella. I just want to get it fixed, if that's possible. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand – that "sandpaper" feeling is really unpleasant. And I appreciate you wanting to get this sorted quickly. First, let’s try to get a little more detail. When did this start, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm. Rough estimate… maybe a few months? Hard to say exactly. Things kinda blur together when you get to be my age, you know? It wasn’t sudden, just… slowly got worse. I didn't think much of it at first. Figured it was just the wind, mostly. We get a lot of wind where I live.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Things do blur together. A few months, gradually worsening… that’s helpful. And the wind makes sense – that can definitely contribute. Is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Maybe one’s a little worse than the other, but they both feel it. It’s not bad all day, just… when I'm working, mostly. Or when it’s windy, like I said. Not too bad inside, with the heat on.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyes, worse with activity and wind, better inside with heat. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the dryness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes blurry vision, I guess. Not all the time, just when it’s really bad. And… maybe a little burning sometimes? It’s hard to say. Old eyes do a lot of things. I just want it to stop feeling like something’s in ‘em. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. Blurry vision and burning, along with the dryness – okay. Have you tried anything already to help it, like eye drops?
PATIENT: Eye drops? No. Never used 'em. Didn’t seem worth botherin’ with. Figured it would just go away. I'm not one for fancy things. I just get on with it, usually. But this… it's stickin’ around.
DOCTOR: Alright, no eye drops yet. Okay. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never been one for sniffles or sneezes. Dust bothers me a little, when I’m workin’ with cement, but everyone gets a little dusty, right? I wouldn't say it’s an allergy, just… dust. It's part of the job.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And dust bothers you with work, but not a formal allergy. Now, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… not much to tell. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin’ outta a tree. And had my appendix out when I was young. Other than that… pretty healthy, for an old guy. No regular doctor visits. Just go to the hardware store when somethin' breaks. I haven’t seen a doctor in… well, a long time. I don't have insurance either.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, appendix removed, otherwise generally healthy. No regular doctor visits, no insurance. I appreciate you sharing that. And do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No medications. Never been one for pills. Don't like 'em. I eat alright, sleep alright, and just keep movin'. That's my medicine, I guess. I'm a cement mason, I need my hands, need to be clear-headed. Pills mess with that, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Okay. And do you have any family history of eye problems, like glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she wore glasses when she got older. That’s about all I remember. My father didn’t. And I don't really know much about the rest of the family, to be honest. Not close, you see. We were always… busy. Didn’t have much time for family things. Just work.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother wore glasses, otherwise no known family history of eye problems. Alright, Andrew. Let's take a quick look at your eyes, if you don’t mind. I'll just check a few things and see what’s going on. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I got things to do. Just be quick about it. I don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Andrew. Your vision is slightly reduced in both eyes, but not dramatically so. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light, and your extraocular movements seem normal. There is some mild dryness and slight redness, especially on the lower eyelids. No significant discharge. It seems like you have dry eye disease, likely exacerbated by the wind and dust from your work. It's common, especially as we get older. It's not an emergency, but it can be quite uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Dry eye disease? Sounds fancy. Can you fix it? I just want it to stop feelin’ like grit. No big speeches, just tell me what I gotta do. I got a job to finish, and sand in my eyes isn't helpin'.
DOCTOR: No big speeches, I promise. It's treatable, Andrew. Often, simple measures can make a big difference. I recommend starting with artificial tears – over-the-counter lubricating eye drops – several times a day, even when your eyes don't feel dry. Think of them like oil for a machine. Also, consider wearing wraparound sunglasses outdoors to protect your eyes from the wind and dust. And avoid rubbing your eyes, as that can make the irritation worse. We can also try a slightly thicker gel or ointment at night to help lubricate your eyes while you sleep. I’ll write you a prescription for one. If these measures aren't enough, we can explore other options, but let's start simple. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Eye drops and glasses… alright. That’s not too bad. A prescription… I don’t know about that. How much is that gonna cost? I told ya, no insurance. Just tell me the cheapest way to get it fixed, if you can. And can I get the drops at any drugstore? I gotta get back to work. This is takin’ too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost, Andrew. The ointment I’m prescribing is relatively inexpensive, usually under $20 with a discount card, which most pharmacies offer. We can see if a coupon code helps at the pharmacy too. The eye drops are available over-the-counter at any drugstore, and there are many affordable options. I recommend starting with a preservative-free brand to minimize irritation, but those are available in different price ranges. I’ll write the prescription and a note recommending preservative-free drops. Do you have a preferred drugstore?
PATIENT: Walgreens. There's one close to my place. And look, I appreciate you tryin' to keep it cheap. I ain't lookin’ for fancy, just need to see. If this don't work… I don’t know what I’ll do. Maybe just wear goggles all the time. But let's try the drops first. Write it down, and I'll get outta here. Got cement to pour.
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. Prescription and the note. Hopefully, these drops and ointment will make a significant difference. And if not, we can always explore other options. We can discuss goggles if it comes to that. Just follow the instructions on the bottle and the prescription, and if your symptoms don’t improve within a week or two, please call the office to schedule a follow-up. Do you have any questions before you go?
