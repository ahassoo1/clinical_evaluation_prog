DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello, Doctor. It's... something down there. A little... leakin', you know? Not good. Been happenin' a little while now. I don't rightly know why it's happenin'. It's embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be quite distressing, Ms. Genard. When you say “down there,” are you referring to vaginal leaking?
PATIENT: Vaginal? Oh, no, no, Doctor. Not that part. Down there. You know... the other part. For a man. My... friend. It's comin' from him. Honestly, I don't know why a woman needs to worry about that.
DOCTOR: I see. You’re experiencing leakage from your husband’s…genitalia?
PATIENT: Husband? I don't have a husband. I'm tellin' you about my friend. He… well, he lets me use his studio space, see? And somethin's drippin'. It's not polite, I tell ya. And I don’t like it when things are drippin' in my paintin' area.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, allow me to clarify. You are consulting me – a physician specializing in internal medicine – regarding a leakage issue… not with a person, but with an inanimate object – specifically, your friend’s studio space?
PATIENT: Well, what else would I be talkin' about? It's his studio! He's a… a creative type, ya know? Always makin' a mess. And now this. Drippin' and stinkin'. I thought you doctors were supposed to fix things! Honestly, the youth these days… no common sense.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, with all due respect, internal medicine pertains to the diagnosis and treatment of human medical conditions. A leaking studio space is… outside of my area of expertise. Perhaps a plumber, or a general maintenance professional would be more suited to assist you. I am afraid I cannot provide any medical advice regarding this matter. Are you experiencing any personal medical concerns today that I can address?
PATIENT: A plumber? You think a plumber can fix a… a delicate situation? You don't understand art, Doctor! It's… complex! But... Alright, alright. Maybe I am a little confused. I've been feelin' kinda… off lately. A little tired, you know? And somethin's just... achin'. Down there. My down there. But it’s probably nothin'. Old age, ya know? .
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you are experiencing fatigue and some aching… in your pelvic region?
