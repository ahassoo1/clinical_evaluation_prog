DOCTOR: Hi Airam, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. My husband… he said I should come. Something about… learning things? I don't really remember. It's just a check-up, right? Not… sick stuff?
DOCTOR: Okay, a general check-up is perfectly fine. Your husband sounds like he's looking out for you, which is good. Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint why we're here, and that's alright. We'll just go through a few things, and see what's going on. Before we get started, just to confirm, you're Airam Fontanazza, 33 years old?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Thirty-three… I think. Time… it goes fast. Is this going to take long? I have things to do, you know. Work and… stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. It shouldn’t take too long, but a thorough check-up does require some questions and maybe a quick physical exam. To start, can you tell me anything specific that’s been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Not really. I get… tired. But everyone gets tired, right? Work is hard. Lifting metal all day… it’s not easy. My back sometimes hurts, but I just… ignore it. It’s always a little sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and some back soreness. That’s good to know. You said lifting metal at work – what kind of work do you do exactly?
PATIENT: I… work with the metal sheets. You know, for buildings? Houses? We cut them, bend them, put them together. It’s… physical. My husband does the fancy stuff, the designs. I just… make the pieces. It's not like I'm telling you anything important.
DOCTOR: No, it is important. Knowing what your work involves helps me understand what might be going on. So, cutting and bending metal sheets, physically demanding work. Do you have any trouble with your hands or wrists?
PATIENT: Trouble? Sometimes they ache. Especially at the end of the day. I just rub them. My mother always said rubbing helps. It's probably just old age. Do I look old?
DOCTOR: You definitely don't look old, Airam. And rubbing can be helpful for temporary relief. It's good you're listening to your body. Okay, let's see... besides the tiredness, back pain, and hand aches, are there any other symptoms you've noticed?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not… really. I eat. I sleep. Sometimes I get a headache, but everyone gets headaches. I don’t… I don’t know what you want me to say. Is there a list? Maybe if you just tell me what I should be feeling?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Airam. I'm not trying to make you list things you don't have. I just want to get a full picture. Let me ask a little more systematically. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills… maybe when it’s cold outside? I don’t… I don’t know what night sweats are. Do I need to… take off my shirt? This is silly.
DOCTOR: No, no, you absolutely don't need to take off your shirt! Night sweats are just when you wake up drenched in sweat for no apparent reason. Okay, good. Let’s move on. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… I eat when I’m hungry. Weight… probably. I don’t really pay attention. My husband says I should eat more vegetables. He worries too much. I haven't weighed myself in… a long time. Is this going to be over soon?
DOCTOR: Okay, no major changes in appetite or weight. We're almost through the questions, Airam. Just a few more. Have you been experiencing any problems with your bowel movements or bladder control?
PATIENT: What? Now you're asking about… that? That's… personal! I don't talk about that with strangers. This is ridiculous. My husband said I needed a check-up, not… an interrogation! I think I'm done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam, I understand your discomfort. I apologize if I’ve made you feel uneasy. I assure you, I’m just trying to gather all the necessary information to help you. We can absolutely stop the questioning if you prefer. However, to properly assess your health, it's important to be open about all aspects of your well-being. It sounds like you're experiencing some fatigue and discomfort, and it's possible there's a medical reason for it. Before we finish, would you mind if I just quickly check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: No. Just… no. I don't want you touching me. My husband can tell me what's wrong. He knows everything. This was a waste of time. I’m leaving.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. I understand. I respect your wishes. Before you go, I want to strongly advise you to consider discussing your fatigue and back discomfort with your husband, as you mentioned. If you experience any sudden or worsening symptoms—like chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe headache—please seek immediate medical attention. I’ve documented our conversation today. If you change your mind about a physical exam or further evaluation, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. Here's my card. Have a good day, Airam.
