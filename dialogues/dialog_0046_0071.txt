DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, my niece… she’s trying to get settled here, you see. Coming from overseas. And I believe she needs certain… shots? To be able to stay legally. I'm hoping you can tell me what's required for her visa, or immigration, whatever it’s called. I'm a bit confused about it all, honestly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Skarbek. It sounds like you’re asking about the vaccination requirements for your niece’s immigration status. That can be quite complex, and you’re right to want to ensure everything is correct. To clarify, do you know when she arrived, or when she plans to arrive?
PATIENT: That’s exactly it, Doctor, thank you for putting it that way. She plans to arrive. She hasn’t come yet. She’s still in… well, I don’t want to bother you with the details of where, but she’s hoping to be here by… let me see… October, maybe November. Is that soon enough to get everything sorted? I worry about causing delays for her.
DOCTOR: October or November gives us a reasonable timeframe, yes. The requirements depend on her age, of course, and where she’s coming from, but generally, we’re looking at verification of certain vaccinations. To be as precise as possible, do you have her date of birth?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me think… she was born… April 12th, 1998. That makes her… twenty-seven years old now, I believe. Does that help? I'm sorry, I'm not very good with dates, sometimes. It’s been a long time since I needed to remember such things.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. April 12th, 1998. So, she’s 27 years old. Okay, based on her age and current immigration guidelines – and I’m referencing the CDC and USCIS recommendations – she’ll require verification of certain vaccinations. These generally include: measles-mumps-rubella , diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis , varicella , polio, influenza, and hepatitis B. Depending on her country of origin, there may be additional requirements or recommendations for things like tuberculosis screening. Do you have her vaccination records with you, or do you know if she has had these vaccinations previously?
PATIENT: Well, that's a lot of names! I'll try to remember them. She thinks she had most of them as a child, growing up. But things were… different where she was. Records weren't kept as carefully, you understand. I don't believe she has any official records with her, no. We would have to… start over, wouldn't we? Is that likely? I suppose it's better to be safe.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that records might be incomplete. Starting over is quite common in these situations, Mr. Skarbek. We can certainly do that. We’ll need to determine what vaccinations she’s already had and which ones she still needs. To do that most accurately, we'll perform a blood test to check for immunity to some of these diseases. We can also administer the vaccines she needs, and I'll provide documentation suitable for her immigration application. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Yes, a blood test makes sense. And documentation is exactly what I need. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. Allergies… hmm. Let me see. She doesn’t have any known allergies, no. Not to food, or medicine, or anything like that. Though, she gets a bit itchy sometimes, after being bitten by mosquitoes. Is that the sort of thing you need to know? I’m probably being silly.
DOCTOR: No, that's good to know, but mosquito bites aren't typically a medical allergy we need to document for vaccinations. We’re more concerned about reactions to vaccines themselves or known sensitivities to ingredients within them. Okay, let's start with a quick physical exam. I'll check her vital signs and listen to her heart and lungs just to establish a baseline. Then we'll draw some blood for the immunity tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. A physical exam is good, I suppose. Better to be thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to do everything properly. She’s a good girl, my niece. Just wants to start a new life here. I'll try not to get in the way.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Skarbek. You're being a very supportive uncle, and that’s wonderful. Please, have her sit here on the exam table, and we’ll get started. First, I’m going to check her weight and height. Then I'll take her blood pressure and pulse. Okay, her weight is 102 pounds, and her height is 5’2”. Her blood pressure is 120/80, and her pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular. That’s all within normal limits. Now, I'll listen to her heart and lungs. Her heart sounds are normal, regular rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. Everything sounds… positive, doesn’t it? She's always been a healthy girl. Though, she does worry a lot. Moving to a new country… it’s a big step for her. So, the blood test… what exactly does that involve? Will it be painful? I don’t want to frighten her.
DOCTOR: It's wonderful that she’s generally healthy. And yes, moving to a new country is a big step! The blood test is fairly straightforward, Mr. Skarbek. A phlebotomist—a trained professional—will use a small needle to draw a few vials of blood from a vein in her arm. There will be a brief pinch, similar to what you feel when getting a flu shot, but it’s usually very quick. We'll apply a bandage afterward, and it shouldn't be painful for long. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and it typically takes about 5-7 business days to get the results back. Once we have those, we can determine which vaccinations she needs and create a plan. Do you have any questions about that process, or anything else we've discussed so far?
PATIENT: Five to seven days… that’s not too bad. And a quick pinch… she can handle that, I’m sure. She’s tougher than she looks. No, I think I understand everything so far, Doctor. You’ve explained it all very clearly. Though… what if she doesn’t need all of those shots? What if the blood test shows she’s already immune to most of them? Will we still have to give her some? I just want to avoid anything unnecessary, if possible. She’s a bit… sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Skarbek. And it’s perfectly reasonable to want to avoid unnecessary vaccinations. If the blood test shows she is already immune to certain diseases, then we will not administer those vaccines. We only want to give the vaccinations she absolutely needs to meet the immigration requirements and protect her health. The results will be very specific, telling us exactly which antibodies are present in her blood. We'll review them together, and I’ll explain everything in detail before proceeding with any vaccinations. So, the goal is to only administer the vaccines that are truly necessary. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that is very clear, Doctor. Thank you. That relieves my mind a great deal. Just knowing we won’t give her anything she doesn’t need… that makes a big difference. So, should we… get the blood test done now? She’s waiting in the lobby, a bit anxious, but she’s trying to be brave. I told her you were very kind.
DOCTOR: Yes, let's go ahead and get the blood test done. And please tell her I'm happy to meet her. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in this situation, and we’ll do everything we can to make it as comfortable as possible. If you could escort her back, and I'll have the phlebotomist ready to go. We’ll take excellent care of her.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you again for your patience and kindness. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll go get her now. She’s just over there, near the magazines. I’ll tell her you're ready for her.
DOCTOR: Please let me know when you return with your niece. We’ll get started as soon as she’s ready.
PATIENT: .
