DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning. I think… my husband made me come. He said I need to… learn things? About… being healthy. I don't really remember why. It's just... a check-up, right? Not because I feel sick.
DOCTOR: A check-up is a good place to start. Although, usually patients come in because they are experiencing something. It’s helpful for me to understand why your husband suggested this visit, even if it’s just for preventative measures. Do you have any idea what concerns he might have?
PATIENT: Concerns? He just… says I work too hard. And don’t take care of myself. He worries… a lot. I work with metal, you know? It’s heavy work. I’m strong! I don’t need… fussing. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Heavy work. It is important to assess how that impacts your overall health. A complete check-up involves a bit of information gathering, a physical exam, and potentially some basic lab work. It typically takes about an hour, perhaps a little longer depending on what we find. Before we get started with the exam, let’s go through some questions. It will help me get a better understanding of your health history. Now, have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Um… not really. Maybe when I was a little girl? I don’t remember. A long time ago. I get… colds sometimes. And… aches. From the work, mostly. I don't go to the doctor unless I have to. It's a waste of time, usually. They tell you to rest. I need to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major illnesses or hospitalizations as an adult. Colds and aches from work…understood. And you generally avoid the doctor unless absolutely necessary. Fair enough. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. No. I don’t think so. Maybe… when I was little? For my tonsils? I really don't remember. My mother took me. It was a long time ago. I don't recall it being a big deal. Why do you need to know all this?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Fontanazza. Knowing your surgical history helps us understand your body's response to anesthesia and potential complications. It's important to have a complete picture. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… my mother… she had… problems with her stomach. Always complaining. And my father… he worked very hard, like me. He just… got old. He wasn't sick, not really. Just… tired. I don't think anyone else… had anything. We don't really talk about it. It's not… polite. Is this all you're going to ask? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re eager to return to work. However, gathering this information is essential. Now, have you ever been told you have any allergies—to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I have to, to keep my strength up. No time for fussy eating. I don't take pills if I can help it. Make me sick. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. But… sometimes my skin gets itchy. From the metal dust, maybe? Or the soap. It doesn't last long. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: Itchy skin could be a reaction to something. We'll need to determine the cause. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription or over-the-counter—or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I told you, pills make me sick. And… herbs? What for? I work hard, I eat, I sleep. That’s enough. My husband sometimes tries to give me… something for my aches. But I always throw it away. It smells funny. I don’t need that stuff. I’m fine. Really. Can we just… be done now?
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I appreciate you telling me all of this. However, it's important to be thorough. We haven’t even done a physical exam yet. Before we proceed, I need a clear understanding of your current health status. Let’s start with your weight. I see on the form it’s listed as 136 pounds, and your height is 151 centimeters. That gives you a BMI of… well, it's higher than the recommended range. This can contribute to various health problems. Do you have any concerns about your weight?
PATIENT: My weight? What’s that got to do with anything? I’m strong! I lift heavy metal all day. I need to be… solid. Solid is good. The number… doesn’t matter. My husband worries about numbers. I don't. It's just… me. Can we skip this part? I don't like talking about… this stuff. It's personal. And I have work.
DOCTOR: While I respect your privacy, a complete assessment is necessary to ensure your well-being. We will need to proceed with a physical exam, and I would also like to order some basic blood work. This will give us a more accurate picture of your health status. Before we do that, can you tell me anything about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Diet? I eat. Whatever I can get. Rice, mostly. And… meat. Sometimes vegetables. I don’t have time to… fuss with fancy food. My husband tries to make me eat… greens. I don’t like them. They taste… funny. I need energy, not… rabbit food. It’s enough. I work hard, remember? I burn it off. Can we just get this over with? I have a lot to do. I’m losing money just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with the physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We will start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Please remove your shoes and any unnecessary clothing. I’ll be right back with my instruments.
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry. I don't like being… exposed. And I'm cold. This is a waste of my time, you know. A complete waste.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just roll onto your back, please. We'll start with your blood pressure. This will only take a moment. 148 over 92. Elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Respiration is 16, normal. Heart sounds are normal, but slightly distant. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but there is some mild wheezing on auscultation. Do you experience any shortness of breath, or have you noticed any coughing or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. I work hard. I always breathe hard. That's normal. Coughing… sometimes. From the dust. But it’s nothing. Just… irritation. Chest pain? No. I’m strong. I don't get… weak feelings. What are you writing? Are you saying something bad? I told you I'm fine! This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you experience any pain or discomfort. Abdomen is firm, with some tenderness in the upper right quadrant. No masses palpated. Liver edge is palpable, slightly enlarged. Do you drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Alcohol? No! Absolutely not. My husband doesn’t allow it. He says it’s bad for my health. And I need to be strong. Strong people don’t drink… that stuff. It makes you weak. What are you looking for? Is something wrong? I knew I shouldn't have come. This is a waste of time. A complete waste. And it’s cold in here!
DOCTOR: Extremities are warm and dry, with normal reflexes. No edema noted. Based on my examination, and the information you’ve provided, I have some concerns. Your blood pressure is elevated, your liver is slightly enlarged, and you report some tenderness in your abdomen. I recommend we order some blood work to assess your liver function, cholesterol levels, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a lipid panel and a complete metabolic panel. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking and prodding? More waiting? I don't like it. What will it prove? I told you I'm fine. Maybe I just need a vacation. A long vacation. This is all stress, you know? Worrying about work, about money… it’s enough to make anyone sick. Is it expensive? I don’t have a lot of money to waste. My husband… he manages the finances. I don’t ask. Can’t we just… forget about it? I’ll just rest. And try to… relax.
DOCTOR: The blood work is important to get a clear picture of your health status. I understand your concerns about cost. The lab work will cost approximately $250. I can provide you with a request form, and you can discuss payment options with the lab directly. While I respect your decision, I strongly advise you to consider getting the blood work done. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions and ensure your long-term health. I will also give you a referral for a nutritionist, who can help you with improving your diet and managing your weight. Here is the contact information for the lab and the nutritionist. Please schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. Do you have any questions before you leave?
