DOCTOR: Hi Lilyanna, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Yoshino. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… unsteadiness. It’s difficult to explain, precisely. I feel… off balance, frequently.
DOCTOR: Okay, “off balance” is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not constant. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just a feeling, like the room is swaying a bit. Other times… I actually stumble. It's been… worrying me, naturally. I work… well, I did work with heavy machinery, and that requires a certain… steadiness. I’m afraid it’s been affecting my ability to… function, shall we say. Though truthfully, I’m struggling to remember when it began, exactly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're getting it checked out, especially with your previous work. Not remembering when it started is okay – it happens. Let’s try to narrow it down. Roughly, would you say this started more than a month ago, less than a month ago, or somewhere in between?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's a difficult question. More than a month, I believe. Perhaps… two or three months, at least? It’s… frustrating, I apologize. My memory isn’t what it once was. It feels… hazy. It wasn’t immediate, you see. It wasn’t like I woke up one morning suddenly unsteady. It was… gradual.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lilyanna. It’s completely fine. Gradual onset is helpful to know. And hazy memories are common. Okay, so two to three months, gradual onset. Can you describe what the unsteadiness feels like when it happens?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to describe. Sometimes it's like being on a boat, a gentle rocking. Other times, it’s more… internal. Like the ground isn’t quite solid beneath my feet. And occasionally, it’s accompanied by a… lightness in my head. Not dizziness, precisely, but a… floaty feeling. It doesn’t last long, usually. Just a few moments. But it's… unsettling. It's a very strange sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, "rocking," "internal instability," and a "floaty feeling" – that gives me a better picture. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: That’s… another challenging question. I haven’t noticed any clear trigger, no. It doesn’t seem to be related to specific activities or… locations. I’ve experienced it both at home and… elsewhere. Though… I suppose it's more frequent when I’m tired. That’s just a vague observation, though. I used to work long hours, and… fatigue was rather commonplace. I’m not certain if that’s related, or merely coincidental.
DOCTOR: Okay, more frequent with fatigue. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. No… not that I’m aware of. No headaches, no blurred vision, no… ringing in my ears. No nausea or vomiting. My appetite has been… normal, I suppose. I haven’t experienced any… weakness in my limbs, or any difficulty with… speech. I believe my hearing is as it always was. Honestly, it’s mostly just this… unsteadiness. It’s… isolating, if that makes any sense. It’s difficult to explain to others.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Lilyanna. It's frustrating when symptoms are hard to pinpoint. Okay, no headaches, vision changes, ringing in the ears, nausea, vomiting, appetite changes, weakness, or speech difficulties. That’s helpful. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. My husband, bless his soul, handled most of the medical matters. I recall… some minor issues with my blood pressure, years ago. Nothing significant, as far as I am aware. I was treated for it, and… it was under control. Beyond that… I don’t believe so. I’ve generally been… quite healthy. It’s… shameful to admit, but I don’t recall specific diagnoses. My memory… it’s truly unreliable. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. It's perfectly alright. It's common for details to be fuzzy, especially if others handled those things. So, history of some blood pressure issues in the past that were treated and under control. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. No surgeries, to my recollection. I’ve been fortunate, in that regard. I’ve never required… hospitalisation for anything major. Just… routine check-ups, and the treatment for my blood pressure, as I mentioned. It’s… difficult to believe it's been years. Time… it slips away so quickly. And my memory… it fails me. I’m terribly sorry for the lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: You're not lacking clarity at all, Lilyanna. We’re getting a good picture. No surgeries, no major hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… challenging. My mother… she suffered from arthritis, I believe. In her later years. And my father… he had some heart trouble, as I recall. But beyond that… I’m afraid I don’t know. My family… we weren’t particularly close. We didn’t… discuss medical matters openly. It’s shameful, I know. But it’s the truth. My memory… it fails me when it comes to personal details. I apologize for the vagueness. I wish I could provide more information.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilyanna. You’ve told me what you remember, and that’s what’s important. History of arthritis in your mother and heart trouble in your father. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine on special occasions. And… recreational drugs? Certainly not. I’ve always led a… temperate lifestyle. My husband… he disapproved, naturally. And I… I share his views. It’s… important to maintain a clear mind, especially in my line of work. Or, did in my line of work. I apologize, I often… drift.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. That’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never experienced an allergic reaction to anything. I’ve always been… quite fortunate, in that regard. No food allergies, no medication sensitivities, no… environmental allergies. I’ve always been… remarkably healthy, despite my current… predicament. I apologize for the vagueness. My memory… it truly fails me. I wish I could provide more information, but… I’m afraid this is all I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement entirely. I… I’m prepared for whatever you deem necessary. I simply wish to… understand the cause of this unsettling imbalance. I appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to have you walk a few steps for me, and then I'll check your balance standing with your feet together. Okay, your gait appears steady, though slightly wide-based. Balance is a little unsteady, particularly when you close your eyes. There’s a mild amount of swaying. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Overall, the neurological exam shows some mild imbalance but no other significant deficits. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems relatively normal, although the mild imbalance is consistent with your report.
PATIENT: I see… Mild imbalance, you say? Is that… concerning? What could be causing it, Dr. Yoshino? I must admit, I’m rather… anxious about this. I’ve never experienced anything like it before. Is it something serious? My work… I worry about returning to it, if this persists. I apologize for my… nervousness. It’s just… unsettling, to feel so… unsteady.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Lilyanna. It is unsettling. The good news is, the exam didn't reveal anything alarming. Mild imbalance can have a lot of causes, though. It could be something as simple as a slight inner ear issue, a vitamin deficiency, or even a side effect of medication – although you haven’t mentioned taking any, which is helpful. It could also be related to your blood pressure, even though it's currently normal. Because it's been going on for a couple of months, and you're experiencing some uncertainty with it, I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. I want to rule out anything serious and identify the underlying cause. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for any deficiencies, a vitamin D level, and a basic metabolic panel. I also think it would be helpful to get an MRI of your brain to rule out any neurological issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds reasonable. If it will help to determine the cause, then please, proceed. I trust your judgement entirely, Dr. Yoshino. An MRI… that sounds rather… involved. But if it’s necessary, then I suppose it must be done. What will be involved, precisely? And… how long will it take to receive the results? I’m eager to… understand this, and to regain my steadiness. I apologize for my… persistent questioning. It’s just… unsettling, to feel so… vulnerable.
DOCTOR: You're not being persistent at all, Lilyanna. It’s good to ask questions. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the inside of your brain. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large machine. It's important to remove any metal objects – jewelry, hairpins, and so on. It’s a bit noisy, but you can wear headphones. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes. As for the results, it depends on the lab and the radiologist, but usually, we’ll have them back within a few days to a week. Once we have those results, we can discuss them in detail and come up with a treatment plan. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend that you avoid any activities that could increase your risk of falling. And if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – severe dizziness, headache, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No… I believe I understand. Avoid activities that could increase my risk of falling. And seek immediate medical attention if my symptoms worsen. And await the results of the MRI and blood tests. One question, if you don’t mind. Is it possible… is it possible this is related to… my husband’s passing? It’s been a year, but… I sometimes feel… disconnected. Could stress or grief be contributing to this unsteadiness? It seems… a rather distant possibility, but… I confess, I’ve been wondering. I apologize for raising such a… personal matter. It’s just… I’m grasping for explanations.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Lilyanna, and not a personal matter at all. Grief and stress absolutely can manifest physically, and it's common for people to experience a variety of symptoms after a loss, including dizziness, imbalance, and fatigue. It's certainly a possibility that your stress and grief are contributing to your symptoms. However, it's important to rule out any underlying medical causes first, which is why I'm ordering the tests. Even if your grief is a significant factor, addressing any potential physical issues is important. We can also discuss coping mechanisms and resources for dealing with grief if you'd like. In the meantime, please be kind to yourself. Allow yourself time to grieve and heal. And if you’re struggling, don’t hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or a therapist. Would you like me to provide you with some information about grief support groups in the area?
PATIENT: That… is very kind of you, Dr. Yoshino. Yes, please. Information about grief support groups would be… most welcome. I… I confess, I’ve been rather isolated since my husband’s passing. Perhaps… connecting with others who understand would be… beneficial. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your… compassion. It’s… reassuring to feel… heard. I shall await your instructions regarding the tests, and the information about the support groups. And… thank you, again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I'm glad I could help. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, print out some information about local grief support groups for you before you leave. She’ll also give you the paperwork for the lab tests and the MRI scheduling information. Just remember, you're not alone in this. And we'll work together to figure out what's going on and get you back to feeling like yourself. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Yoshino. I believe that is all. You’ve answered all of my questions, and provided me with… much reassurance. I shall await the instructions from your nurse, and proceed with the tests as directed. Thank you, again, for your kindness and… patience. I appreciate your thoroughness. I shall see you again soon, I presume. .
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the test results. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions. It was a pleasure meeting you, Lilyanna. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
