DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Tremor, you said? Yes… a shaking. It’s… well, it’s mostly in my hands, I think. Honestly, it comes and goes, and I forget when it started. A while now, definitely. It’s just… annoying, really. Can we get this over with?
DOCTOR: “Annoying.” Right. Well, Mr. Jezik, “annoying” can be a sign of something quite serious. We need to establish some specifics, regardless of your… assessment. First, when you say “comes and goes,” can you describe when it’s worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Let me think. Not when I’m resting, that’s for sure. When I… use my hands, I guess. Like, when I’m trying to… well, I used to fix things, you know? Plumbing mostly. That’s what I did for work. So when I’m trying to do something precise. Does that make sense? It's hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Plumbing. Alright. So, action-induced. And you say you used to fix things… When did you stop fixing things, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Stop? Oh… goodness. That was… a long time ago. Maybe… five years? Ten? It’s all a blur, honestly. My divorce was around then, too. Everything kinda mashed together. I retired shortly after, I think. Or… was it before? I really can't recall. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Frustrating for you, perhaps. It makes a precise medical history rather difficult, you understand. Ten years ago… alright. And has this tremor been gradually worsening over those ten years, or has it been relatively stable?
PATIENT: Stable… hmm. I suppose… maybe a little worse now than it was, but not dramatically. It comes and goes so much, it's hard to tell. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times it's… well, like this. But it’s never bad bad, you know? Just… inconvenient. Honestly, I mostly try not to think about it. Is there a quick test we can do? I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: A "quick test," you say. Well, Mr. Jezik, medicine is rarely so… expeditious. Very well. Let's perform a brief neurological assessment. Extend your arms in front of you, palms up. Now, hold them like that. Don’t strain. Just… hold.
PATIENT: Like this? It's… a bit awkward, I haven't done much with my arms lately. It’s getting a little shaky already, but that’s just… me, I think. How long do I have to hold them? I’m starting to feel a bit tired.
DOCTOR: Approximately thirty seconds, Mr. Jezik. Unless, of course, you wish to collapse from exhaustion prematurely. Observe. There is a definite tremor present, though mild. Now, please bring your hands to your chin and tap each finger to your nose, alternating, as quickly as you can.
PATIENT: Like this? It's harder than it looks! I used to be quite steady, you know. Plumbing requires a steady hand. This is… humiliating. Can we just skip to the end? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Sufficient. Frankly, Mr. Jezik, your impatience is not conducive to a proper assessment. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any other neurological symptoms?
PATIENT: Neurological… What does that mean, exactly? Do you mean… headaches? No, not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that’s just… old age. And I get a bit… forgetful. Like we’ve already established. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know what you’re asking. Is this tremor going to stop me from… I don’t know… gardening? That’s what I do now. Can you just tell me if I need to worry?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, “worrying” is not a diagnosis. I need information, and you are proving remarkably unhelpful. Do you experience any dizziness, changes in vision, difficulty speaking, or weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Sometimes my hands feel a little… tired, like I said. But not weak. No, I don't think so. Dizziness? No, not really. Maybe a little lightheaded sometimes when I stand up too fast, but that happens to everyone, doesn't it? Vision… well, I need glasses, but that’s just… getting older. And speaking… am I mumbling? My ex-wife always said I talked too much, but that’s probably just her. Honestly, I think I’m fine! This tremor is just annoying.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, with all due respect, your self-diagnosis is… inadequate. We will proceed, though it is proving… challenging. Do you have any past medical conditions?
PATIENT: Past medical… oh, goodness. Let me see. I had the flu a few times, I suppose. And… My prostate was acting up a few years back. Had some treatment for that. Other than that… I’ve always been pretty healthy, actually. A little arthritis in my hands, but nothing serious. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit. About twenty years ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Arthritis and a prior prostate issue. And smoking. Twenty years ago is still relevant. Any medications you are currently taking, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take something for blood pressure, I think. A small white pill, every morning. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you know? Nothing fancy. Honestly, Doctor, I mostly try to avoid taking pills. They never seem to do much good.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us move on. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I sneeze sometimes, like everyone does when the pollen is bad, but… I've never had a serious allergic reaction. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. Just… normal sneezes. Is this really necessary, Doctor? This tremor isn’t getting any worse, and I have an appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, I am attempting to gather a complete medical history to ensure proper care. Now, tell me about your family history. Any neurological disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… goodness. That’s a tough one. My mother died when I was young, breast cancer. My father… he just… got old, I suppose. He was a farmer. My aunt, on my mother’s side, she was a bit… confused, towards the end. Dementia, I think they called it. But that was a long time ago. And my brother… he always was a bit clumsy. Nothing serious, just… not very coordinated. Is that what you’re asking about? This is all very vague, Doctor. I'm not a doctor, I just live my life.
DOCTOR: Dementia in your aunt. Alright. And finally, your social history. Do you drink alcohol, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Drink? Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe a beer if I’m watching a game. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I never was much of a drinker, to be honest. Preferred a good Pilsner, if I did. But not anymore. I mostly just garden now. It’s more relaxing. Can we be done soon? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your history - mild tremor, family history of dementia, and your age – my preliminary assessment suggests a possible essential tremor, though the dementia in your family warrants further investigation. However, ruling out other causes is crucial. I will order a basic metabolic panel and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. I also recommend a neurological consultation with Dr. Vasilescu to evaluate the tremor more thoroughly. It is imperative to schedule this appointment as soon as possible. I will provide you with a lab requisition and the neurologist’s contact information. I will also recommend you monitor your symptoms for any changes. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist… great. More appointments. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your time, but honestly, this all seems like a lot of fuss over a little shake. Will these tests tell me if I need to stop gardening? That’s all I really care about. And… how much will this all cost? I’m not insured, you know.
DOCTOR: The cost is not my concern, Mr. Jezik. Your health is. Regarding gardening… the neurologist will determine if your tremor poses any risk. The lab results will be available in approximately five business days. Please schedule your appointment with Dr. Vasilescu promptly. Is there anything else?
