DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Hembrey, is it? Yes, well… honestly, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. My daughter, Susan, insisted. She said I should get “checked out.” Something about… preventative things. I feel perfectly fine, you know. Just a little curious, I suppose. Though I do wish she wouldn't fuss so much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of Susan to be proactive with your health. While feeling "perfectly fine" is excellent, preventative care is very important, even without specific complaints. It allows us to establish a baseline and catch potential issues early on. Let's start with a brief history. Could you tell me about any significant medical problems you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a long time ago now. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a girl, naturally. And… well, there was that time I broke my wrist, falling off my bicycle. But other than that… honestly, not much. I’ve always been quite healthy, I think. My husband, bless his soul, he was the sickly one. Always something with his heart. I suppose I've been lucky. Though… what does "baseline" even mean? Is that like… a starting point?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Calvery, a baseline is exactly like a starting point. It's what’s normal for you right now. We’ll assess your current health – things like your blood pressure, weight, and do some basic tests. Then, if anything changes in the future, we have something to compare it to. Regarding your past medical history, just to confirm: tonsillectomy and a wrist fracture – is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Tonsils… wrist. Ages ago. Honestly, I barely remember the wrist thing. Susan always had a good memory for these sorts of things. She probably knows more about my medical history than I do. She’s a very organized girl, always was. She’s a lawyer, you know. Very detail-oriented. Did you want me to list all my allergies? I don't think I have any, but Susan always asks if I'm allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It's helpful to have that context. And yes, please, let's address allergies. Even if you believe you don't have any, it's important to formally document that. Do you experience any unusual reactions to medications, foods, insect bites, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, I don’t think so. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, but the doctor just keeps prescribing the same one. Never had any trouble with it. Food… I like most things. Maybe… maybe I get a little heartburn sometimes after spicy food? But that’s just indigestion, I think. Not an allergy. And bugs… I just swat them away. I don't go around hugging mosquitoes! Honestly, I think Susan worries too much. It’s probably just old age making me forgetful. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no known drug allergies, food allergies, or environmental allergies. We’ll note the occasional heartburn, likely related to diet. Now, let's move on to your current medications. You mentioned a pill for your blood pressure. Do you know the name and dosage of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. I just take the little white one. The doctor sends it to the pharmacy every month. I don’t bother with remembering the name. Too many numbers and letters these days! Susan usually checks when I pick it up, and reminds me how many to take. She’s very good with those things. Let me think… I think it starts with an “A”? Or maybe a “B”? Oh, this is hopeless. Really, you should just ask my daughter. She knows everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to keep track of medications. However, it's crucial for me to have accurate information. While I appreciate Susan's assistance, it's important for you to be aware of what you’re taking. Perhaps we can access your medication list electronically through the pharmacy?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good idea. If you can get it from the pharmacy, that would be wonderful. I don't know anything about computers, so I can’t do it myself. Susan could probably do it, but she’s very busy with work. Maybe just… ask the pharmacy? They’re always very helpful. That would be the easiest thing, I think. It’s much easier to let someone else handle it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Calvery, I have your medication list here. It appears you're taking amlodipine 5mg daily for hypertension, as well as a multivitamin. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Amlodi… something? Yes, that sounds right. The little white pill. That’s the one. And the multivitamin, yes. Susan insisted I take one. Says I don’t get enough vitamins from my diet. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine without it. But she worries, you know? Always has. She’s a good girl, Susan. Very responsible. So, you found it on the computer? How does it know? It's a bit frightening, all this technology.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Calvery, the information is stored securely within the healthcare system. It's updated when your prescriptions are filled. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical examination. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your general appearance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a hair appointment later this afternoon. And Susan will be wondering where I am. Honestly, I feel perfectly healthy. But I suppose it can't hurt to be checked. Just don't poke too much. My skin is quite sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning at this time, but we’ll want to monitor it. Your lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let me check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated today. We’ll recheck it after a few minutes. It could be a bit high due to anxiety or recent caffeine intake.
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh dear. Is that bad? I had a cup of tea this morning, but that's all. I don't drink coffee. It gives me the jitters. Anxiety? I’m not anxious. Just… a little impatient. And worried about Susan, always working so hard. Is that what’s causing it? The blood pressure, I mean? It's probably just that.
DOCTOR: The blood pressure is still elevated. While stress can contribute to fluctuations, this is consistently above the optimal range. We should investigate further. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes. Now, could you tell me about your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, my diet? Well, I eat… reasonably. I try to. I don’t eat a lot of red meat. Susan always tells me I should eat more vegetables, but I don't particularly like them. Mostly I have… chicken. And fish, sometimes. And pasta. I like pasta. And bread. I have a slice of bread with my tea. It's a nice, simple diet. Nothing fancy. I suppose I could eat more vegetables, but they just don’t taste very good. I used to enjoy cooking, when my husband was alive. But now… what's the point?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you engage in any regular physical activity?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I used to go for walks, when I was younger. But my knees aren't what they used to be. And frankly, it's just too hot these days to go outside. I mostly just sit. In the house. Reading. Or watching television. Susan tells me I should exercise, but… what's the point? I'm old. It's not like I'm going to run a marathon. Honestly, I think I'm just getting old. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm just going to ask you a few questions about your overall health. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… chest pain? No, not really. Maybe a little discomfort sometimes, after eating a big meal. But that’s probably just indigestion. Shortness of breath… not that I’ve noticed. Although, I do get a little winded going up the stairs. But that’s just because I’m old, isn’t it? Palpitations… no, I don’t think so. My heart feels fine. Swelling in my ankles? Sometimes, yes. But only at the end of the day. It goes away when I put my feet up. Honestly, I think it’s just my circulation. It's nothing serious, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your vision, headaches, dizziness, or numbness or weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. Vision... well, it's not as good as it used to be. I need reading glasses, of course. Everyone does at my age. Headaches… not very often. Maybe a little tension headache sometimes, if I’m worried about Susan. Dizziness? Not really. Though I did feel a little lightheaded once, after standing up too quickly. Probably just low blood sugar. Numbness or weakness? No, not that I’ve noticed. Everything feels… fine. Mostly. Honestly, I think I’m just getting old and everything is starting to… wear out. That's what my husband used to say.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, based on our conversation and examination, your blood pressure is consistently elevated. Additionally, you report some mild shortness of breath and intermittent ankle swelling. While some of these symptoms could be attributed to aging, it’s important to rule out any underlying cardiovascular issues. I recommend we order some blood tests, an electrocardiogram to assess your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. We may also consider a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor to get a more accurate reading of your blood pressure throughout the day. Would you be agreeable to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests? That sounds… complicated. And a bit frightening, honestly. I don't like tests. What if something is wrong? I’m already old, you know. Is it really necessary? I suppose if you think it's absolutely necessary… but I don't want anything invasive. And I don’t want to spend all day in a hospital. Susan always says I should take care of myself, but… I just want to be left alone. Will these tests take very long? And will they hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Calvery. These tests are not invasive and will not take an excessive amount of time. The blood tests will only require a small sample of blood, and the ECG is a simple, painless procedure where we place electrodes on your chest to record your heart rhythm. The chest X-ray is also non-invasive and only takes a few minutes. The purpose of these tests is simply to get a clearer picture of your overall health and rule out any potential issues. If everything is normal, then we can simply continue to monitor your blood pressure and focus on lifestyle modifications. I will be with you every step of the way to explain the results and answer any questions you may have. Would you like me to schedule these tests for you?
PATIENT: Oh… well, if you’re going to be with me… and if it doesn’t take too long… I suppose so. But no poking, dear. And I need to know when my hair appointment is before we schedule anything. It’s very important. Susan would probably want to come with me. She always insists on knowing everything. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. No poking, I assure you. And absolutely, Susan is more than welcome to accompany you. It's always helpful to have a support person with you. Let me check the availability at the lab and radiology department. Do you have a specific day or time that works best for you and Susan?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Susan is very busy with work, you know. She's a lawyer. Always has court dates and meetings. Perhaps… next Tuesday afternoon? After two o'clock? That’s usually when she has some free time. But we’ll have to be quick, because she has a dinner engagement that evening. And please make sure it doesn’t interfere with my hair appointment. It’s on Thursday, at eleven o’clock. Very important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. I've scheduled your blood tests for next Tuesday at 2:30 PM, followed by the chest X-ray at 3:15 PM. I have also scheduled an ECG for Wednesday morning at 9:00 AM. This should accommodate your schedule and Susan’s commitments. I will provide you with the necessary paperwork and instructions before your appointments. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… complicated. Three appointments! Well, I suppose it’s better to get it over with. Will these tests be very expensive? Medicare covers everything, doesn't it? I don't want any surprises. And will I have to fast before the blood tests? I always get so hungry.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Calvery, Medicare will cover the cost of these tests. You may have a co-pay or deductible, but our billing department can provide you with more specific information. And yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. That means no food or drinks, except for water. I understand it can be difficult, but it's important for accurate results. We can reschedule if you are truly unable to fast, but it may delay the process. I will provide you with a detailed instruction sheet outlining all the necessary preparations for each test. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Eight hours! That's a very long time. I usually have a cup of tea with my breakfast. And a little biscuit. Perhaps just a small biscuit? And what if I get dizzy from being hungry? Will they let me sit down? I don’t want to faint in the waiting room. Honestly, all this is very stressful. I wish Susan were here. She always knows what to do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, it's understandable that you’re feeling stressed. It’s not always easy to undergo medical testing. Unfortunately, consuming even a small biscuit before the blood tests can affect the results. It's best to refrain from eating or drinking anything other than water for the full eight hours. However, if you feel lightheaded or dizzy, please inform the phlebotomist immediately. They are trained to recognize these symptoms and can provide you with a comfortable chair and monitor you closely. We can even reschedule the test if you’re feeling unwell. I will write a note on your chart about your concerns, and the lab staff will be informed to provide you with extra support. Would you like me to provide you with a list of comfortable things to do while fasting, such as reading or watching a relaxing movie?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, dear. A list of things to do… that might be helpful. I do enjoy reading. And watching those gardening shows. Though, honestly, I think I’ll just worry about it. Susan always says I worry too much. But I can't help it. It's just my nature. Well, I suppose there's nothing else I can do. I’ll try to fast, and I’ll try not to worry. But I’m warning you, if I faint, it’s on your head! Do you think it's possible to bring Susan with me to the lab, just in case? She always makes me feel better. And she can keep track of all the paperwork. I always get so confused.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. You are more than welcome to bring Susan with you to the lab. Having a support person there can definitely ease your anxiety. I will write a note on your chart that Susan will be accompanying you. And don't worry, we'll do everything we can to make this as comfortable as possible. I have a list of resources and helpful tips for fasting that I'll provide to you before your appointment. It includes suggestions for relaxing activities, staying hydrated, and managing any potential discomfort. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very patient with me, dear. I do apologize for all the fuss. I just don’t like doctors. And I don’t like tests. But I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Well, thank you again. I’ll try to remember all the instructions. And I’ll bring Susan with me. That should help. I suppose I’ll see you next Tuesday then. Unless something unexpected happens. Good day to you. .
