DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It just… stays there, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're having difficulty completely emptying your bladder when you urinate, and this has been happening for a bit. Can you tell me a little more about “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… maybe… three, four months now? It started slow, just a little bit left behind. But now… now it's more often. Sometimes it feels like I just can't push it all out, no matter how hard I try. It’s not painful, just… frustrating. And I worry, you know? It doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and concern, Mr. Hilber. It’s good you’re paying attention to this. Not being able to empty your bladder completely can sometimes lead to other issues, so it's important we figure out what’s going on. First, let's talk about your overall health. Have you noticed any other changes along with this trouble urinating?
PATIENT: Other changes… well, now that you mention it… I get up a couple more times at night to go. Not every night, but more than I used to. And sometimes… sometimes I feel like I have to go really suddenly. Like, no warning. Just… gotta go now. Does that make sense? I don't know if that’s part of the same thing or not.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense, Mr. Hilber. Increased nighttime urination – what we call nocturia – and the sudden urge to urinate can definitely be related. Let’s go through some other things to get a clearer picture. Do you have any trouble starting your urine stream, or is it a strong, steady flow once you begin?
PATIENT: It starts okay. Not like a weak little trickle, you know? It comes out pretty normal at first. It's more… getting it empty at the end that’s the problem. It feels like there’s always a little bit left behind, no matter how long I sit there. And I do have to strain a little sometimes, but I wouldn’t say it's hard. Just… a little extra push.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: No, not really. It looks pretty much the same as always. Clear, you know? Sometimes a little darker if I haven't had enough water, but that's normal. And the smell... well, it smells like pee. I haven't noticed anything different about it. I try to drink a good amount of water, you know, to keep things moving.
DOCTOR: Good. Staying hydrated is important. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with pills. I don’t take them anymore. Other than that… not really. I haven't had much trouble with sickness, thankfully. I did have a surgery on my knee a long time ago, but that healed up fine. And… my wife, bless her heart, she used to take me to all the doctors. I don’t remember all the details of everything. She passed away a few years back, and I haven't been to the doctor much since then. It’s… hard to keep track of things on your own.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. It's completely understandable that keeping track of medical details can be difficult. We’ll take our time and figure things out. So, you had high blood pressure in the past, which is now controlled without medication, and you had knee surgery a long time ago. No diabetes or other significant medical problems that you recall?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. Nothing like that. Just the blood pressure and the knee. I try to stay active, you know? Walking is good for the knee, and I like to fish when I can. Keeps me busy. But this… this water problem is starting to worry me. It’s not comfortable, and I don’t want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any urinary tract infections – UTIs?
PATIENT: UTIs… hmm. I don’t think so. I don’t remember ever being sick with anything like that. My wife always told me to drink cranberry juice if I thought I was getting a cold, but I don't think she ever said anything about infections. I’ve never been to the hospital for anything with my water, if that makes sense. Just… this feeling now is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. Just a little vitamin D in the winter, because it gets dark so early. And sometimes I take a pain reliever for my knee if it's acting up, but that's it. Nothing regular, nothing for my water or anything like that. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, you know? They never seem to help much anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just vitamin D occasionally and a pain reliever for your knee as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always asked me that question, and I always said no. I don't have allergies to food, or anything like that. I eat pretty much everything. Just... regular food, you know? Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife didn’t like it, and I didn’t want to upset her. I used to work with some fellas who smoked, but I never picked it up myself. It always seemed like a bad habit to me. I prefer fresh air, you know? Especially when I’m fishing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. And how much alcohol do you typically drink in a week?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, on the weekends. Nothing regular, and not a lot. I don't really care for it much, to be honest. My wife used to have a glass of wine now and then, but I never really got into it. I prefer a good cup of tea, you know? Keeps me warm in the winter.
DOCTOR: Okay, very light alcohol consumption. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had problems with their kidneys, bladder, or prostate?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father had some trouble with his kidneys when he got older, I think. He was always tired, and the doctor said something about them not working right. But he didn't talk much about it, you know? He was a private man. And my brother… he had some trouble going to the bathroom when he got older, too. It took him a long time to empty his bladder, I think. But I don’t know all the details. It’s been a while, and I don’t remember everything. We weren’t very close, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had kidney problems, and your brother had difficulty emptying his bladder. That's helpful information. Now, Mr. Hilber, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll need to listen to your abdomen, and I'll also do a digital rectal exam to check your prostate. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh. Well… I haven’t had one of those in a long time. Is it… necessary? I mean, I’m not having any pain down there, you know? Just trouble with my water. But… if you think it’s important, I guess I can do it. I trust your judgment, Doctor. It’s just… it’s not very comfortable, is it?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It’s not the most comfortable exam, you’re right. But it’s a very important part of evaluating the prostate, which can sometimes contribute to urinary problems, especially in men. It helps me assess the size and texture of the prostate, and rule out any abnormalities. It will only take a few moments. I’ll explain everything as I go, and we'll take it slow. I'll make sure you're as comfortable as possible. Do you want a moment to change into a gown?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, if you think it’s necessary. I don’t want to waste your time, Doctor. And I do want to figure out what’s going on with my water. A gown, you say? Yes, alright. Where is it? I haven't had a physical in a long time, you see. I’m not used to all this. Just tell me what to do, and I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The changing room is just over there. There’s a gown hanging on the hook. You can undress from the waist down and put on the gown, open side in the back. I’ll be right outside when you’re ready. Take your time. Alright, Mr. Hilber. If you could lie down on the exam table, please. We'll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Okay. I’m listening to your abdomen now. I don't feel any masses or tenderness. Your bowel sounds are normal. Now, I'm just going to perform a quick digital rectal exam. I’ll let you know before I start. This will help me check the size and texture of your prostate. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should only take a few seconds. Take a deep breath. Okay, all done. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious hard lumps or areas of concern. The enlargement is not significant enough to be immediately alarming, but it could be contributing to your urinary symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That was a little uncomfortable. But I understand you needed to do it. Enlarged, you say? Is that… bad? Will I need surgery? My wife always worried about things like that. She said I should always get a second opinion. What does this mean, Doctor? Is there anything I can do to… shrink it? Or something I can take? I really don’t want to have surgery, if I can avoid it. This is all very worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Hilber. It’s good you’re asking questions. An enlarged prostate is very common as men get older, and it’s often a benign condition – meaning not cancerous. It’s called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need surgery. The enlargement itself can put pressure on your urethra – the tube that carries urine out of your bladder – making it difficult to start or fully empty your bladder. To get a better understanding of what’s going on and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. First, I want to do a urine analysis to check for infection and blood. Then, I’d like to do a Prostate-Specific Antigen, or PSA, blood test. This test measures the level of PSA in your blood, which can be elevated in some cases of prostate enlargement or prostate cancer. Finally, I’d also like to do an ultrasound of your bladder to see how well it’s emptying. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I want to figure out what’s going on. I’d rather know, you see? Even if it’s not good news. My wife always said knowledge is power. Infection and blood… a PSA test… and an ultrasound. Yes. Alright. How long will it take to get the results? And… where will I go to get these tests done? Is it here at the clinic? I don’t drive much anymore, you see. My neighbor usually takes me when I need to go somewhere. I need to make arrangements. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. We can do all of these tests right here at the clinic. The urine analysis and blood test can be done today, and the ultrasound can be scheduled for next week. I’ll give you a lab requisition form for the blood test. You’ll need to fast for eight hours before the blood draw, meaning no food or drinks other than water. The lab technician will take care of the urine sample here at the clinic. The ultrasound will take about 20-30 minutes, and you'll need to have a full bladder for the test, so you'll need to drink plenty of water beforehand. It usually takes about 3-5 business days to get the results back. Once I have them, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… eight hours fasting… drink plenty of water… ultrasound next week… and you’ll call me with the results. 3-5 business days. Yes. That sounds alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. My wife always said it's important to have a good doctor. Someone you can trust. I think I can trust you, Doctor Bacy. Thank you again. Is there anything else I need to do right now? Or… can I go now? I think I need to go home and drink some water. For the ultrasound.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I'm glad I could help. And I appreciate your kind words. No, there’s nothing else you need to do right now. You can go home and start drinking plenty of water for the ultrasound next week. Just let the receptionist know when you’re ready to leave, and they’ll assist you. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, lower back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the clinic immediately. Take care, Mr. Hilber. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
