DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, Doc, right? Yeah. It’s this cough. Been hacking up stuff... some of it’s got, well, red in it. Not a lot, but enough to worry me. I smoke, you see. Always have. Figured it might be that. Just want to get it checked, if that makes sense. Don’t really remember much else about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A cough with some red in the sputum, and you're a smoker. It's good you're getting it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, let’s go over a few things. First, how long have you had this cough?
PATIENT: Long...? Gosh. A while. Maybe… a couple months now? It started kinda slow, just a tickle. Didn't think much of it then. The red stuff… that’s newer. A few weeks, maybe? Hard to say for sure. Time gets away from me. Does it matter exactly when it started?
DOCTOR: It does help to have a timeframe, but we can work with that. A couple of months for the cough overall, and a few weeks with the red sputum. Has the cough been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I guess. Worse when I’m moving around, or when it’s cold. When I’m just sitting, it’s not so bad. Sometimes I wake up with it, too. A hacking cough, you know? Keeps me up sometimes. It ain’t constant, but it’s always there, somewhere in the background.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse with activity and in the cold, and it sometimes wakes you up at night. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think. I get tired easy. Always have, but maybe worse lately. And… sometimes I feel kinda short of breath. Not all the time, just when I really push myself. Does that count? I don’t know. I ain't been feeling great, but I figured that’s just getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and shortness of breath with exertion. That's good information to have. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like heart problems, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never been to a doctor much, to be honest. Doc said my heart was okay, years ago. When I was younger. As for lung problems… well, I smoke. Is that a problem? Besides that, I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with sugar, either. Medicare sends me stuff, but I mostly ignore it. Don't remember any specific… conditions.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known medical conditions that you’re aware of, and a brief history of a normal heart check years ago. And you smoke. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital. Never needed surgery. Broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s it. Just a simple break, Doc fixed it right up. Nothing else. Always been pretty lucky, I guess. Until this cough.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family...? That’s a tough one. Not much family left, to be honest. My mother passed a long time ago. I don't really know much about her health, to be honest. She always seemed pretty strong. Dad… he smoked too. Passed away when I was young. I think he had some trouble breathing near the end. But I don’t really know what happened. Sorry. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember a whole lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's alright if you don't have a lot of information about your family history. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol or use any other tobacco products besides cigarettes?
PATIENT: Sometimes. I have a beer now and then. When I'm with friends. Nothing heavy. Just a couple. And cigarettes... well, yeah. Always have. Been smoking since I was a kid, I guess. Never tried anything else. Just cigarettes. And beer, occasionally. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional beer and a long history of cigarette smoking. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been allergic to anything, as far as I know. Tried a few different medicines over the years for colds and stuff, but never had a reaction. I don't really eat anything strange, either. Just regular food. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nah. Don’t take nothin’. Used to take somethin’ for my blood pressure, a long time ago, but Doc took me off of it. Said I was fine. Haven’t taken anythin’ since. No pills, no herbs, nothin’. I just want to know what's goin’ on with this cough, Doc. It’s worryin’ me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. Thank you for that information. It's good to know you aren't currently taking any medications. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Then, I'd like to take your temperature and pulse. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. Just get it done, Doc. This cough is really gettin’ to me. Hope it ain’t nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath in through your mouth… and out. Good. And again… deeper if you can. Okay. I'm hearing some wheezing in your lungs, and a slight decrease in airflow on the lower left side. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. Your temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your pulse is 88 beats per minute. I want to be thorough, Mr. Reyno, so I'm going to recommend a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. It will help us rule out anything serious. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: X-ray...? Hmm. Sounds… serious. Is it gonna cost a lot? I'm on Medicare, you know. What are you lookin’ for, exactly? Is it somethin’ bad? I don’t want any big surprises, Doc. Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Reyno. An X-ray is a standard test, and with Medicare, your out-of-pocket cost should be relatively low – typically just your copay. We’ll verify the exact cost before proceeding, of course. As for what we're looking for, the X-ray will help us see if there's any inflammation, fluid buildup, or abnormalities in your lungs. Given your history of smoking and the red-tinged sputum, we need to rule out things like pneumonia, bronchitis, or, more seriously, lung cancer. It’s important to be thorough, especially given your cough and the decrease in airflow I detected. I'm not saying it is anything serious, but we need to investigate to be sure. It's better to know, even if it turns out to be something minor. Would you like me to explain the X-ray procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Lung cancer…? Oh, Lord. I… I guess I don't have a choice, do I? If you think it's best, then do it. But please… hurry. I don’t want to be waitin' around wonderin'. And, uh… how long does it take?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. I understand this is concerning, and I appreciate you trusting me to help you figure this out. The X-ray itself is very quick – it only takes a few minutes. The technician will position you between the X-ray machine and a plate, and they'll take a few images. There’s no pain involved. After the images are taken, the radiologist will review them and send me the results, usually within 24 to 48 hours. I will then call you to discuss the findings and create a plan. I'm going to have the nurse schedule the X-ray for you right away. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for an inhaler to help with your wheezing. It won’t solve the problem, but it should give you some relief. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An inhaler... yeah, that sounds good. Anything to make it easier to breathe. Just... please, Doc, call me as soon as you know somethin'. I don't want to just sit here worryin'. Okay. Let’s get it over with. I guess there ain’t nothin' else to do but wait now.
DOCTOR: You are right, Mr. Reyno. Waiting is the hardest part. I promise to call you as soon as I have the results. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your X-ray and explain how to use the inhaler. In the meantime, try to stay as calm as possible. If you experience any significant worsening of your symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, fever, or chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No... I think that's all. Just... thank you, Doc. For not beatin' around the bush. And for listenin'. I guess I’ll just wait for the nurse now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Reyno. I’m here to help you through this. The nurse will be right with you. Take care. .
