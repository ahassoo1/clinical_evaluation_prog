DOCTOR: Hi Lilliana, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, my joints, mostly. They get… stiff in the mornings. Real stiff. It’s just… hard to get going, you know? It's been happening for a while now, I think. Not sure how long, exactly. Time… slips away.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Time slips away,” that’s a good way to put it. It's common for joint stiffness to develop gradually. So, it’s primarily stiffness in the mornings, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, mornings are the worst. And… sometimes during the day too, if I’ve been sitting for a bit. Not always, though. It's not… a sharp pain, exactly. More like… everything just feels… stuck. Like an old door that needs oiling. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lilliana. “Like an old door that needs oiling” – that's a very helpful description! And it’s not a sharp pain, more of a stiffness… okay. Can you tell me where specifically you're feeling this stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My fingers, definitely. Especially when I wake up. And… my knees, I think. They creak a bit when I stand up. And maybe my hips? It’s… hard to pinpoint, honestly. It's not one place. It kind of… moves around. I used to be able to garden all day, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fingers, knees, and possibly your hips. It sounds like it's affecting multiple joints, and that it’s not constant in one particular spot. And gardening is becoming difficult. Has this gotten progressively worse over time, or does it come and go in waves?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s gotten worse, I think. Definitely slower to get going each morning. And I need to… I don't know… wiggle my fingers more to get them to work. Waves… hmm. Not really waves, maybe? More like… a slow, steady… slide downhill? If that makes any sense. I just wish I could get back to my roses.
DOCTOR: "A slow, steady slide downhill," I understand. That’s a good way to describe it. It sounds like it's been a gradual process, and it’s impacting your daily activities. Okay, Lilliana, to get a better understanding, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis or anything similar?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history… That’s… fuzzy. My husband, George, he always took care of all that. I remember… something about my blood pressure being a little high, maybe? Years ago. But arthritis… I don't think so. I just know things ache more now than they used to. He always said I was a strong Greek woman, though! He’s… gone now, you see.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about George. It's completely understandable that things might be a bit fuzzy right now. And being a strong Greek woman is a wonderful thing! So, high blood pressure in the past, but no formal arthritis diagnosis. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… No surgeries, not that I remember. Hospitalized… Oh! When I broke my wrist, years ago. When I was younger. Tripped over the cat, silly thing. They put a cast on it. But other than that… No, I don't think so. It was a long time ago, though. Everything feels… far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken wrist many years ago, and no other surgeries or hospitalizations that you recall. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my blood pressure sometimes. A small white pill. I can’t remember the name of it. George always filled the prescription. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for the aches, but not every day. Only when it's really bad. Do you… need to know exactly what it is? I don't have the bottle here.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Lilliana. We can certainly look that up later. Just knowing you take something for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed is helpful for now. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… I don’t think so. I eat everything! Greek food, of course, mostly. And George always said I had a strong stomach. I haven't had any… reactions, not that I recall. But I'm not very good at remembering those things, you see. I never paid much attention to ingredients and such. George did all the shopping.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, to get a better picture of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… try not to hurt me. My joints are a little… sensitive, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilliana. I’ll be very gentle. I’m just going to take a look at your joints, check your range of motion, and feel for any swelling or tenderness. Please let me know immediately if anything causes you pain. Okay, I’m looking at your fingers now. I notice some slight swelling at the base of your knuckles, and when you make a fist, the motion seems a little restricted. There’s also some tenderness when I gently press here. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. When you bend your knees, it’s a little stiff, and I can hear a slight creaking sound. There's a bit of tenderness along the joint line. And finally, your hips. The range of motion is a bit limited, and there is some discomfort when I move your leg in certain directions. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you may have osteoarthritis, which is a common type of arthritis that causes the cartilage in your joints to break down over time. However, to confirm this, I’d like to order some blood tests and an X-ray of your hands and knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… osteoarthritis… that sounds… serious. I knew something wasn't right. Blood tests and an X-ray… that sounds… a lot. But if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. I trust your judgement. Just… please explain everything clearly, you know? I get confused easily. And… will it hurt? The X-ray, I mean.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel a bit overwhelmed, Lilliana. It is a lot, and it’s good you're asking questions. Osteoarthritis is common, especially as we get older, and it’s very manageable. The blood tests will help rule out other types of arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis, and the X-ray will help us see how much wear and tear there is in your joints. The X-ray itself is completely painless. You’ll simply stand or lie still while the machine takes a picture of your hands and knees. There is a very small amount of radiation involved, but it’s a very low dose and not harmful. I’ll write down the orders for the blood tests and X-ray. The clinic will schedule those for you. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. No pain with the X-ray, that’s good. And you’ll explain the results to me? And then… a treatment plan? What does that mean? Will I have to take lots of pills? I don’t like taking pills. And… will I still be able to garden? That’s very important to me, you see. My roses… they need me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will explain everything clearly, Lilliana. And yes, we will develop a treatment plan together. It doesn't necessarily involve lots of pills, not at all. Often, we start with less invasive options like physical therapy, exercise, weight management if needed, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, which you’re already using. We can also discuss things like joint injections, which can provide temporary relief, and other options if needed. The goal is to manage your pain, improve your function, and keep you doing the things you love. And regarding your roses… that’s very important! We’ll work together to find a plan that allows you to continue gardening as much as possible. There are modifications we can make to your technique, and exercises to strengthen the muscles around your joints, so you can keep enjoying your roses. I'm going to write an order for the blood tests and X-ray now, and the clinic staff will contact you to schedule those. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please continue to use ibuprofen as needed for pain. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… a little better. Modifications to my technique… that might work. I’ve been trying to lift the heavy pots with my back, maybe that’s why it hurts. No… I think that's all for now. Just… please don’t make me take too many pills. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. My George… he always liked doctors who explained things clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. And I promise, we’ll focus on the least invasive options first. Lifting heavy pots with your back is definitely something to avoid - we can discuss proper lifting techniques at your follow-up appointment. It was lovely meeting you today. The clinic staff will be in touch soon to schedule your tests. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. And remember, we’ll work together to find a plan that works for you. Take care, Lilliana. And enjoy your roses!
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. I will. Goodbye.
