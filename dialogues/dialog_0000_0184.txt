DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, good to see you. Though, frankly, at your age, seeing anyone feeling well would be a surprise. Now, tell me – what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about… me lookin’ in the mirror, Doctor. It ain’t a pretty sight, you know? Things… droopin’. Always was a strong man, pile drivin’ and all. But now… well, I just want somethin’ done about it. Don’t have time for this nonsense, really. Just want to be fixed.
DOCTOR: “Droopin’,” you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, droopin’. Everywhere! Neck, face… even the skin on me arms. It weren’t like this before, you know. Used to be tight, solid. Now it just… hangs. Like old curtains. You understand what I’m sayin’, Doctor? I ain't askin’ for a miracle, just… tighter. Is that possible? And don't tell me it's just age. I know what age is!
DOCTOR: Right. “Hangin’,” as you put it. We need to be a little more specific, Mr. Trendler. Are we talking about muscle weakness, or is this primarily a skin concern?
PATIENT: Muscle weakness? What kinda question is that? I was a pile driver operator! Strongest man on the job! But… now when I look at me arms, they don't look strong, they look… empty. Skin too, I suppose. It’s all just… soft. Not like it used to be. Hard, you know? Like leather. Now it just… wobbles. You got somethin’ that can fix wobble, Doctor? And quickly, if you please. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some loss of muscle tone and changes in skin elasticity. Now, have you noticed any pain associated with this “wobbling,” or any difficulty with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Pain? No! What kinda man complains about a little wobble? Used to take hits from steel, I ain't bothered by a bit o' saggin'. Activities? I can still do things, just… don’t want to look like this while doin’ ‘em. Understand? It’s a matter o’ principle. A man should look strong when he’s strong. Not… deflated. Just tell me what you can do, Doctor. And how long it will take. I ain’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. We need to rule out some underlying causes before we discuss…cosmetic interventions, Mr. Trendler. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! I eat plenty. Always have. Good food, good portions. Never been one to skip a meal. Maybe a little less than before, now that the missus… well, never mind. But no weight loss. I’m solid, Doctor. Just… softer around the edges. Like a well-worn rock. Don’t need tests or nothin’, do I? Just fix it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, “just fixing it” requires understanding why it's broken. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowin’? No! What are you tryin’ to imply, Doctor? I eat like a horse! Steak, rice and peas… everything. Maybe a bit slower, now, reachin' for things... but that’s just my age, you know? And I already told you, I ain’t lost no weight! Look, I just want my face… and neck… tightened. Is that too much to ask? And I got a dominoes game at three, so if we could speed things along…
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. I want to check your muscle strength and reflexes. And I will take a look at your neck and face more closely. Please sit up straight and relax your arms. And then we'll check your reflexes. It's just a standard check, Mr. Trendler. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But don’t go pokin’ around too much. And hurry it up, will ya? Dominoes wait for no man. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your reflexes. Just let your arm hang loose… and relax. Good. Now, squeeze my hand… firmly. And again… Hmm. And now, I'm going to check your neck muscles. Please try to turn your head against my resistance. Okay, good. And now, looking at your skin… there's some noticeable loss of elasticity, as you mentioned. And a little bit of thinning. Your muscle tone is… diminished, particularly in your arms and neck. Reflexes are a little sluggish, but within normal limits for your age. Okay, Mr. Trendler. I’m concerned about possible muscle wasting. It could be age-related, but we need to rule out other causes.
PATIENT: Muscle wasting?! What are you talkin’ about?! I told you, I eat good! I pile drove for forty years, built this body with hard work, not nothin’ disappearin’! You think I just… shrunk?! This is ridiculous. Are you tryin’ to tell me I’m… sick? I just want to look less droopy, Doctor! Not… fall apart! I need to see a different doctor. This is nonsense. You’re wastin’ my time.
DOCTOR: Please, Mr. Trendler, calm down. I’m not saying you’re “falling apart.” I'm simply explaining my concerns. Muscle wasting can have many causes, and it’s important to identify the root cause before considering any cosmetic procedures. It could be related to your diet, or underlying medical condition. Let me just quickly review your EHR… Hmm. I see here a history of… mild hypertension, managed with medication. And a recent cholesterol check… elevated. But no recent blood work beyond that. I’m going to order some comprehensive blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a creatine kinase level to assess muscle health. We also need to check your vitamin D levels. And I'm going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more detailed evaluation of your muscle strength and nerve function. It’s just to be thorough, Mr. Trendler. Don’t jump to conclusions. I understand you’re concerned about your appearance, but we need to address any potential underlying medical issues first. That’s my responsibility as your doctor. And frankly, attempting any cosmetic intervention without knowing the root cause could be… counterproductive.
