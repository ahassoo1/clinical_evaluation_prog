DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. I’m Dr. Hembrey. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, like we talked about. I’m pretty busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Of course. Efficiency is appreciated. However, a thorough review is still necessary, even with existing results. To ensure I have a complete understanding, I will need to ask a few clarifying questions. It will be much faster in the long run. Now, regarding those results… what specifically are you most concerned about?
PATIENT: Look, I understand. Just… honestly, anything bad? That’s what I’m worried about. I don’t really follow all the… numbers and stuff. Is it something I need to be seriously concerned about, or is it just… one of those things?
DOCTOR: “One of those things” is rarely sufficient in medicine, Ms. Kovtun. While I appreciate your directness, I need specifics to provide an accurate assessment. Let’s start with the reason for the initial testing. What prompted you to come in and have these tests done in the first place?
PATIENT: Right, okay. It was… fatigue, mostly. Just really tired all the time, even after sleeping. And a bit dizzy sometimes. My friend said it could be… something, so I figured I’d get it checked out. It started maybe… three months ago? I don't really keep track.
DOCTOR: Three months. Alright. And has this fatigue been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, yeah. Some days are worse than others, but it’s always there, you know? Like a weight. And the dizziness is… random. Happens when I stand up fast sometimes, or if I turn my head too quickly. Nothing major, but annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are there any other symptoms accompanying the fatigue and dizziness?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. I’ve been getting headaches, on and off. Not terrible, just… dull aches. And I guess I’ve been a little more irritable than usual. My coworker keeps asking if I’m getting enough sleep, which is… annoying. That’s about it, I think. No fever, no weight loss, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Irritability and headaches… Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything looks… normal. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses anyway, so I just figured it was my prescription needing an update. It's been a while since I've been to the eye doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: It's… okay. I haven't lost my appetite, but I haven’t been hungry either. Just eating when I remember, I guess. It's not like I'm craving anything specific. Everything tastes… normal.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, do you have any family history of anemia, thyroid problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandmother, on my mom’s side, had… something with her thyroid, I think. She was always tired, and gained a lot of weight. But that was a long time ago. As far as I know, nobody else has anything major. Mom’s pretty healthy, and my dad… well, he’s gone. I don’t really know much about his side of the family.
DOCTOR: Thyroid history in the family… important to note. Now, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never smoked, don't drink much – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Definitely no drugs. I'm pretty straight-laced, honestly. Just trying to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Very good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I just… deal with it. Honestly, I don’t like feeling sluggish, and even a little painkiller makes me feel weird.
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty lucky in that regard, I guess. Can we get to the results now? I really do have a lot on my plate today.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed. I’ve reviewed your lab results and, as you requested, I will be direct. Your complete blood count shows a slightly low hemoglobin level, indicating mild anemia. Your thyroid-stimulating hormone is also slightly elevated, suggesting possible hypothyroidism. These results, coupled with your reported symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, and headaches, are concerning. However, it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We need to conduct further testing to determine the cause of these abnormalities.
PATIENT: Okay… That sounds… bad. Anemia and something with my thyroid? What does that mean? Is it serious? And what "further testing" are we talking about? Honestly, I'm not a doctor, so if you could just… simplify it for me, that’d be great. And how long is this going to take? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, while I understand your anxiety and time constraints, it's crucial you grasp the seriousness of these initial findings. Anemia means you have a lower than normal red blood cell count, which can lead to fatigue and weakness. Hypothyroidism means your thyroid gland isn't producing enough thyroid hormone, also leading to fatigue, weight gain, and other symptoms. Now, determining the cause of these abnormalities is vital. For the anemia, we’ll need to run an iron panel, a vitamin B12 level, and a folate level to identify any deficiencies. We will also want to check a reticulocyte count, to assess if your body is producing new red blood cells. For the thyroid, we’ll need to check thyroid antibodies to rule out autoimmune causes such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. These tests will require a blood draw. It should take approximately 15-20 minutes for the draw itself. Results typically take 2-3 business days to come back from the lab. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… Okay, that’s… a lot of information. Blood draw, 2-3 days, no strenuous activity. Fine. Just… Hashimoto’s? Is that… serious? And what if it is serious? Do I need… medication? Because I really don't want to be on medication if I can avoid it. I just want to feel normal again, I don’t need a whole bunch of pills.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition where your immune system attacks your thyroid gland. It is a chronic condition, but manageable with medication in most cases. Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to a variety of complications, including weight gain, heart problems, and even depression. Regarding medication, yes, treatment for hypothyroidism typically involves taking a synthetic thyroid hormone replacement. However, we do not know yet if you have Hashimoto's or even hypothyroidism definitively. The blood tests will provide us with the necessary information to determine the best course of action. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. Do you have any specific questions about the blood draw process itself?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve had blood taken before. Just… can I still go to work? I mean, I can’t just take a week off every time I feel a little tired. I need to know if it's something I can work through, or if I need to… seriously reconsider things. I have a deadline next week, and I really can't afford to fall behind.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, while I understand your concerns about your deadline, prioritizing your health is paramount. I would advise against strenuous activity or prolonged periods of stress until we have a clearer understanding of your condition. Continuing to push yourself could exacerbate your symptoms and potentially delay recovery. However, I can provide you with a note stating that you are undergoing medical evaluation for fatigue and possible thyroid issues. This may allow you to request accommodations from your employer, such as a reduced workload or flexible hours. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, a note. That’s… helpful. Reduced workload, flexible hours… Yeah, I can work with that. I just… I really can’t afford to lose my job over this. So, just the note, and then the blood tests, and we wait? Is that it? And where do I even go for the blood tests?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. I will write a note excusing you from strenuous work activities pending the results of your blood tests. As for the tests, you can go to the lab located at 123 Main Street, directly across from City Hospital. The order will be sent electronically, so simply present your identification and insurance information, although you stated you are uninsured. They will bill you directly. I am also scheduling a follow-up appointment for August 9th, to discuss the results and formulate a comprehensive treatment plan. Does that date work for you?
PATIENT: August 9th… Yeah, that should work. Fine. Okay, so 123 Main Street, no insurance, August 9th… I think that covers everything. Honestly, I’m a little overwhelmed. Can I just… go now? I need to get this done and hopefully get back to normal as quickly as possible. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Kovtun. Here is the note for your employer. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms before our follow-up appointment. And please, try to prioritize rest and avoid unnecessary stress. Your health is of utmost importance. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. .
