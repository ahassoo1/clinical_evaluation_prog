DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it's really getting on my nerves.
DOCTOR: I understand. Hiccups that persist for more than two days can be quite bothersome. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, they're…normal hiccups, I guess? You know, the kind where your stomach muscles clench and you get that little jerk. They come and go, not really a pattern, just…random. It’s not painful, just really annoying. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down, everything my grandmother told me, honestly. Nothing’s worked.
DOCTOR: Okay, "normal" hiccups that haven't responded to common remedies. That’s helpful to know. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No, not really. I mean, I’m a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t? I run a small entertainment business, so things are always busy. I haven't noticed anything else…no heartburn, no trouble swallowing, no dizziness. Just the hiccups. It’s mostly just the constant interruption, if that makes sense. Hard to talk to clients when you’re… hic …doing that.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Constant interruption can be very disruptive. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history to see if anything might be contributing. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and I broke my wrist a few years ago – that’s about it. No major illnesses, no surgeries besides those. I used to get migraines occasionally, but those haven’t bothered me in years. My blood pressure is usually okay when I get it checked at the pharmacy, but I haven’t had a full check-up in a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a wrist fracture, migraines that have resolved. And you mention generally good blood pressure readings at the pharmacy. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything, take any medication when I need it, and haven’t ever had a reaction. I used to work with a lot of perfumes and fragrances for events, and I had no problems there either. Honestly, I’m usually very…robust, if that makes sense. This hiccup thing is just so strange for me. hic See? There it is again.
DOCTOR: Yes, “robust” is a good way to put it. It's unusual for someone with your history to have persistent hiccups. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing regularly. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. And I haven't taken anything in the last few days. I really try to avoid medication if I can. I believe in letting my body heal itself, usually. hic This is just…stubborn. I haven't even been able to enjoy my tea properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father had high blood pressure, like I said, though it was never really serious. My sister is healthy as a horse, though. No heart problems, no cancer, nothing like that that I know of. It's not a family that has a lot of big health issues, really. hic It’s just…odd. My grandmother always said hiccups meant someone was talking about you, but I doubt that's it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No significant family history of conditions that might be contributing. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I own a small event planning business – mostly small parties and corporate functions. So, it's a lot of running around, long hours, and sometimes not enough sleep. I eat…okay, probably not as well as I should. Lots of takeout when I'm busy. I try to walk when I can, but it’s not a regular thing. I don’t smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I am divorced and live alone, so I do most things by myself. hic That’s pretty much it. A busy life, but usually a healthy one.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that gives me a good overview. Given your history and the persistence of the hiccups, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will help me rule out any obvious underlying causes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I trust your judgement. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. hic Just a bit of a nuisance. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ivette. If you could please lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take nice, deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly that I can detect. Your diaphragm feels normal in its range of motion. Blood pressure is 130/80 today. Your weight is 73 kilograms and height is 153 centimeters, giving you a BMI of 31.2 which is in the obese range. Everything seems normal physically. Given the duration of the hiccups and the lack of any concerning findings on the exam, it's likely we're dealing with a benign case. However, persistent hiccups can sometimes be a sign of something more serious, though it's less common. I'd like to order a basic blood work panel to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count just to rule out any imbalances or underlying medical issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. I'd rather be safe than sorry. Blood work sounds good. I’m used to busy schedules, so I can definitely fit that in. hic It's just frustrating, you know? I’ve never had hiccups last this long before. What kind of imbalances are you looking for, specifically? I don't want to worry unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I'll explain it as clearly as possible. We’re primarily looking for imbalances in electrolytes like potassium, sodium, and calcium. These can sometimes disrupt nerve function and cause hiccups. We'll also check your kidney function, as kidney issues can occasionally lead to electrolyte imbalances. A complete blood count will rule out any signs of infection or anemia, which could also contribute. I'm writing the order for the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall. You’ll need to fast for at least 8 hours before the test, so if you haven't eaten anything since last night, you're good to go. I will also order a chest x-ray just to be thorough. It will help rule out any issues in your lungs or diaphragm. Here are the orders for the lab work and the chest x-ray. Once you have the results, the lab will send them directly to me. I’ll review them as soon as I receive them, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, continue trying the home remedies you've already tried – holding your breath, drinking water, etc. If the hiccups become significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or difficulty swallowing, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that all makes perfect sense. Electrolytes, kidney function, and a chest x-ray to be thorough. And come back if anything gets worse. hic I can definitely do that. Thank you, Dr. Glowka. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll get the tests done right away. hic Hopefully, we can figure out what’s causing this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or experience any changes. I'll be looking forward to the results. In the meantime, try to get some rest and take it easy. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and please let me know how it goes.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Dr. Glowka. I will. Have a good day too. hic
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. Take care.
