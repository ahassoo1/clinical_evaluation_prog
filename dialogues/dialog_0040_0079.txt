DOCTOR: Right. Well, Courtnye, let's get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, okay. It’s my bruising. It’s been…worse lately. I’m on, you know, a blood thinner, and I just keep getting these big bruises, even when I don't think I’ve done anything to cause them. It's a bit worrying, honestly.
DOCTOR: A blood thinner, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Warfarin. Dr. Lee started me on it about six months ago for…well, a heart thing. It was atrial fibrillation, I think. Anyway, the bruising just wasn't this bad before. I bumped my arm on the doorframe yesterday, and it already looks like someone punched me. It's just…odd.
DOCTOR: Odd, yes. Well, Warfarin can cause that. Have you had any other issues since starting it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really… well, maybe I've been a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just…life, you know? I haven’t noticed any bleeding gums or anything like that. And no nosebleeds. Just the bruises. They seem to pop up everywhere now. I don't even remember getting some of them.
DOCTOR: "Don't remember getting them?
PATIENT: It sounds silly when I say it out loud, I know. But seriously, I’ll be walking around, and then bam, new bruise. It's like they appear out of nowhere. It's especially bad on my legs, and now my arms. I’m a bit worried something else is going on, to be honest. I mean, is the medicine just…not working right?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take a look. I see here you haven’t had your INR checked in… three months?
PATIENT: Oh. Wow. Is that right? Three months? I… I guess I just kept putting it off. It's a bit of a drive to get to the lab, and I've been busy. I figured if I wasn't feeling any different, it was probably okay. That was a bad idea, wasn't it?
DOCTOR: It was. A very bad idea. We need to get that checked immediately. The whole point of Warfarin is to keep your blood at a certain thickness. Without regular monitoring, it’s like flying blind.
PATIENT: Right. Okay, you're right, I should have. I feel awful now. Is that why I’m bruising so easily? Because the levels are off? And… what happens if they’re really off? Is it dangerous? I’m getting a little anxious now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It could be the levels. Or, frankly, you might just be prone to bruising. Some people are. But we need to know. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then I'll write you a lab order. Don’t get yourself worked up over nothing. It’s probably just a simple adjustment needed. Roll up your sleeves. And your pants legs, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, sure. I guess that makes sense. Bruising just…doesn’t run in my family, so it's a bit weird. I just want to get this sorted out, honestly. This is all a bit stressful.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there’s quite a bit here. Varied stages. And on your legs…yes, similar. Let me palpate a few of these. They don’t appear particularly concerning, but we still need to rule things out. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a PT/INR, and a basic metabolic panel. Get this done within 24 hours.
PATIENT: Okay. Complete blood count… PT/INR… basic metabolic panel. Got it. Twenty-four hours. Is there a lab you recommend? The one near Dr. Lee’s office is always so busy. And… what exactly are we looking for with all these tests? Just so I know what to expect? I’m not very good with medical stuff, if you haven’t noticed.
DOCTOR: The CBC will tell us if you’re anemic or have any other blood cell abnormalities. The PT/INR… that’s the Warfarin level, obviously. And the BMP checks your kidney function and electrolytes. It’s standard stuff. As for the lab, just go to the one on Elm Street. It’s usually quicker. And frankly, if your INR is drastically off, you’ll need to get this addressed immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. CBC… anemia… INR… Warfarin level… BMP… kidneys. Elm Street. Got it. So, if the Warfarin level is wrong, it's serious? Like, hospital serious? I'm getting a bit worried now. Is there anything I should be looking out for before I get the tests? Like, should I avoid bumping into things? Is that even possible?
DOCTOR: Look, you're getting ahead of yourself. It's potentially serious, yes, if it’s severely off. But most likely, it just needs adjusting. As for avoiding bumps… yes, try to be careful. It's common sense. And if you experience any significant bleeding – nosebleeds that won't stop, blood in your urine, excessive bruising, or any other unusual bleeding – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Significant bleeding. Nosebleeds. Urine. Excessive bruising. Emergency room. No, I think that covers it. I just... I really hate feeling like something is wrong. This whole thing is just making me anxious. Can I just… get the lab order, please? I just want to get this done and over with. I have a lot on my plate, you know?
DOCTOR: Here. Get it done. And try not to worry unnecessarily. It’s probably nothing. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you. I really appreciate it. I'll go get the tests done right away. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Finally. .
