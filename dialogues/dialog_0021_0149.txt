DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Good to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, I don't rightly remember what all the fuss is about. My daughter, bless her heart, scheduled this. Something about not wanting… things done? I keep telling her, I know my own body. Been a podiatrist for… well, a long time. Longer than you've been alive, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… helpful. It's good you're proactive about your health, of course. But even the best of us can miss things. Let’s just try to go through a few things, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, I assure you, dear, I haven’t missed anything. I fix feet for a living. What could you possibly tell me? Though, I suppose you went to school for all this, didn't you? Still… feet are a very specific thing. Not everyone understands them. It's a gift, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. I understand you have a lot of experience. But this isn’t about feet, is it?
PATIENT: Well, everything is about feet eventually, dear. Balance, posture… it all starts with the foundation, you know? But no, my daughter… she’s been fussing about some tests, some… interventions. I told her no. Perfectly healthy as far as I'm concerned. Though, my memory… it’s not what it used to be. What were we talking about again?
DOCTOR: Right. Let's see… your daughter scheduled this appointment, and you're not sure why. According to the notes, she was concerned about some recent lab results. Do you recall having any blood work done recently?
PATIENT: Blood work? Hmm… maybe. I go to the doctor for my Medicare check-ups, of course. They poke and prod, take vials of things… Honestly, it all blends together. I don't pay much attention to the numbers, I just trust they're doing what needs to be done. My daughter’s the one who worries about all that. Why is she so upset about it? Everything feels perfectly normal to me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, according to these results from July 15th, your Vitamin D levels are quite low, and your TSH is a little elevated. Your daughter is concerned about possible thyroid issues. Have you been feeling any fatigue, weight gain, or feeling cold more easily than usual?
PATIENT: Thyroid… Now there’s a word I haven’t heard in a while. My first husband… he had something with his thyroid. A lot of swelling, I remember that. But I feel fine. A little tired, perhaps, but who isn’t? I'm eighty-three years old! And I’ve always been a bit on the thin side, so weight gain isn't something I worry about. Honestly, I think your daughter is making a mountain out of a molehill. She always has been a worrier.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, low Vitamin D can cause fatigue, and an elevated TSH can indicate an underactive thyroid. But it's not always a cause for alarm. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But don't expect miracles. I haven't been as spry as I used to be. And really, poking and prodding won't tell you anything you can't find in a blood test. My daughter and her modern medicine… It's all very… invasive.
DOCTOR: Just a quick look, Wynell. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and feel your thyroid gland. Nothing invasive, I promise. Please, have a seat here. Heart sounds are regular, a little faint. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is normal for your age. Thyroid feels… slightly enlarged, but no nodules that I can detect. Do you experience any difficulty swallowing or any pain in your neck?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No. Pain in my neck? Not particularly. A little stiffness sometimes, but that's just old age, dear. I told you, I feel perfectly fine. Honestly, you're making me nervous with all this poking and prodding. I think my daughter sent me here just to… fuss over me. She always has to be in control. And I haven't had any trouble with my feet, if that's what you're wondering. Perfectly healthy feet, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: No one mentioned your feet, Wynell. I'm trying to understand why your daughter is concerned about these lab results. An enlarged thyroid, even if it's not painful, combined with the low Vitamin D and elevated TSH, warrants further investigation. We could repeat the TSH to confirm the results, and possibly order an antibody test to check for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Hashi… what now? Auto…immune? Honestly, dear, you're losing me. I’ve lived a long life, I know my own body. It's perfectly capable of functioning just fine without all these… tests and labels. My daughter and her fancy medical terms… She read something on the internet, I guarantee it. No, I don't want any more tests. I'm perfectly healthy, and I'm going home. I've wasted enough time here already.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. I understand your reluctance. However, ignoring these results could lead to complications down the line. I strongly recommend at least repeating the TSH test. If you’re still hesitant about further investigation, I’ll document your refusal. But I also want to emphasize the importance of monitoring for any new symptoms – fatigue, weight changes, constipation, or feeling cold. Before you go, do you have any allergies or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Fine, fine. Repeat the test. Just to get it over with, you understand. Don’t expect me to come running back if it’s the same thing. And no, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. As for medications… just a little something for my arthritis. Can’t remember the name, it’s a small white pill. My daughter handles all that. Honestly, I’m too tired to remember all the details. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll order the repeat TSH test. We'll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. I'll have the nurse give you a requisition form and information about the lab. And I'll make a note of the arthritis medication – it might be helpful to know the specific name for potential interactions. Here's a piece of paper with the lab information. Please call to schedule your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, dear. That’s quite enough. I think I've wasted enough of both our time. Just… get it over with, and I’ll be on my way. Honestly, all this fuss… it’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Wynell. And please, don't hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. .
