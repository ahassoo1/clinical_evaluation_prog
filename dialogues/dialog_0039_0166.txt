DOCTOR: Hello Tarin, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Kamahele. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… persistent enough that I thought it best to get it checked out. It started a few weeks ago, I believe, sometime in late July.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your leg, starting in late July. That's good you came in to get it checked out. Hmm… Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s primarily in my left leg, though occasionally I feel a slight tingling in my right one. The sensation itself is…difficult to describe. It’s not exactly pain, more like a… lack of feeling? Like when your foot falls asleep, but it doesn't quite go away completely when I move it. It seems to be worse after I’ve been standing for a long time, or if I’ve been sitting in the same position for a while. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A “pins and needles” feeling, or a lack of feeling that doesn’t quite go away with movement… alright. And is it just in your leg, or does it go anywhere else—like your foot, or up into your back or hip?
PATIENT: It’s mostly confined to the leg itself, Dr. Kamahele. Though, now that you mention it, there is a bit of discomfort in my lower back sometimes. Not constant, and not severe. More like… a dull ache. It doesn't always coincide with the numbness in my leg, but I've noticed it more frequently in the last week or so. It’s on the left side, naturally. I hadn’t thought to mention it before, as it wasn't particularly bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the lower back pain. It’s helpful you brought that up, even if it's not constant. Now, thinking back to when it started in late July… did anything specific happen around that time?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… I was working on a particularly involved animation project, actually. Lots of long hours at my workstation. I was doing a lot of motion capture work, which involved… quite a bit of physical exertion, surprisingly. Running through various movements, holding specific poses for extended periods. It wasn’t strenuous exertion, but it was… repetitive and demanding on my muscles and joints, I suppose. Nothing out of the ordinary for the job, but perhaps that's relevant? I did also take a fairly long hike with a friend on July 18th, but I wouldn’t have thought that would be the cause.
DOCTOR: Alright, animation work with motion capture, and a hike… okay. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any weakness in your leg?
PATIENT: Weakness… that’s another good question. I haven’t consciously noticed any significant weakness, no. Though, I will admit, I did stumble slightly the other day while walking down the stairs. Just a little misstep, nothing major. I initially chalked it up to being clumsy, but now that you ask… perhaps it was more than that? It was just the one instance, and I haven’t experienced anything similar since. It felt like my leg just… gave way a little. It was brief, and I quickly regained my balance.
DOCTOR: Okay, a single instance of stumbling. Good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Dr. Kamahele. I generally consider myself to be in good health. I eat a reasonably balanced diet, try to get regular exercise when my work allows, and I don't smoke or drink alcohol. I did have my appendix removed when I was younger – about ten years ago – but that was uncomplicated, and I haven't had any complications since. Otherwise, just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I have private insurance through my employer, if that's relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Appendix removed ten years ago, otherwise healthy. That's helpful. And do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any medications on a regular basis. Not even over-the-counter things, unless I have a headache, in which case I might take ibuprofen. But that’s infrequent, and it’s not a daily occurrence. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Kamahele, I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never experienced an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I’ve eaten a wide variety of foods throughout my life and haven’t had any issues. I've never had any reactions to insect bites or stings either. My family doesn't have a strong history of allergies, either, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No allergies. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Dr. Kamahele. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed whenever you're ready. I understand the need for a physical examination.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. If you could sit on the examination table, that would be great. Let's start with your reflexes. Okay, reflexes are… slightly diminished on the left side, but not significantly. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. Can you push your leg straight out against my resistance?
PATIENT: Certainly. I believe I can. Is this sufficient resistance? I can try to push harder if needed.
DOCTOR: That’s good, that’s good. A little weaker on the left, but still within a normal range. Now, can you lift your foot up, against my resistance?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Is this enough pressure? I'm trying to maintain consistent force. I apologize if it fluctuates slightly; I'm not accustomed to this sort of testing.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, you’re doing great. A little weakness there as well on the left side, but not alarming. Now, let’s check sensation. Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It's… a light pressure, I suppose. A bit of tingling, perhaps, but I assume that's normal given the numbness I've been experiencing? It's localized to the area you're touching, though. It doesn't radiate outwards.
DOCTOR: Yes, a little tingling is understandable. Now, what about here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that as well. It's… similar to the previous sensation. Perhaps a little less distinct, but I can definitely feel something. It feels… almost like a vibration, if that makes sense. Not painful, just… a subtle sensation. It’s still localized to the area you’re touching.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Sensation is a little diminished on the left side, but not completely absent. Alright, Tarin. Based on the physical exam, and what you’ve told me, it sounds like you might have some nerve compression in your lower back or leg. The weakness and diminished sensation are consistent with that. It could be something like sciatica, or a pinched nerve. However, to be certain, I’d like to order an MRI of your lower back to get a better look at the nerves and spinal cord. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, that sounds reasonable, Dr. Kamahele. If that’s what you recommend to get a more definitive diagnosis, I’m certainly in agreement. I trust your professional judgment. Would you need a referral from you, or can I schedule it directly? And… is it likely to be painful? I admit, I'm not particularly fond of enclosed spaces.
DOCTOR: That's a good question, and a valid concern. I can write a referral for you. It shouldn't be painful, but it does involve lying still in a fairly enclosed space for about 30-60 minutes. They can offer you medication to help you relax if you’re feeling anxious. I'll write the referral to the imaging center just down the road; they have open MRI machines available, which might be more comfortable for you. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that aggravates the numbness, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, as you’ve been doing. If the pain becomes severe, or if you experience any loss of bowel or bladder control, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. Here's the referral. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment, whether it’s physical therapy, medication, or something else. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds excellent, Dr. Kamahele. An open MRI machine would be a significant relief, I must admit. And thank you for the detailed instructions and the warning signs to watch out for. I appreciate your thoroughness and your understanding. I’ll schedule the MRI as soon as possible and get in touch with you once I have the results. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I feel much better informed now, and I'm hopeful we can get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, if anything changes, especially any loss of bowel or bladder control, go to the emergency room. Have a good day, and I look forward to hearing from you.
