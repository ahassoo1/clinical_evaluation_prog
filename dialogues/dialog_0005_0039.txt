DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse just told me it was somethin’ about my cholesterol bein’ high. Hyper…hyper… somethin’ like that. I don’t rightly remember all the big words, to be honest. It was on a paper, but I mostly just remember her sayin’ it wasn’t good.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia. Yes, that's it. High cholesterol. It’s… common as people get older, unfortunately. And you’re right to be concerned. Now, has anyone explained to you what high cholesterol actually is, or what the risks are?
PATIENT: No, not really. They just said it was high after the blood test. I mostly just know it’s somethin’ bad. I always ate pretty good, you know? Lots of fish, not too much red meat. My wife, bless her heart, she was a good cook. Kept me regular, that’s for sure. But I don't understand what this cholesterol does to me, or why it's a problem now, after all these years.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, think of cholesterol as a fatty substance that builds up in your arteries – those are the tubes that carry blood around your body. When you have too much, it can make those arteries narrow and hard, which makes it harder for your heart to pump blood. That can lead to chest pain, heart attack, even stroke. It's good you ate well, but sometimes genetics play a role, and sometimes it just happens with age. Now, have you ever had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Not really. My ankles do get a little puffy sometimes, now that I think about it, especially if I'm on my feet all day. I used to work with the kids, you know, protective services. Lots of walkin’ and standin’. But I just figured it was my age. Never thought it was anything serious. Chest pain… no, not really. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but I take something for that. It burns, but it’s not like a pain pain. Shortness of breath… not so much either. I get winded climbin' stairs, but that's just gettin’ old, right?
DOCTOR: “Just getting old.” It’s a common thought, Mr. Bohnett, but we still need to rule things out. That puffiness could be related to the cholesterol affecting circulation. And shortness of breath, even with stairs, is worth investigating. Now, do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, my knees are bad. Real bad. Arthritis, the doctor told me years ago. Makes it hard to get around, like I said. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, so I have to have someone help me with my medicine sometimes. Oh! And I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now. Other than that… nothin’ much. I’m pretty tough, you know? Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis, vision problems, gallbladder removal… good to know. Any family history of heart disease, high cholesterol, or stroke?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me see… my mother, bless her, she had a weak heart. She died when I was pretty young, maybe in her sixties. The doctor said it was somethin’ with her heart. And my older brother, he had a stroke a few years back. He’s still alive, but he can’t move one side very well. Other than that… not that I remember. It was a long time ago, and my family wasn’t one for talkin’ about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s… relevant. Mother with heart problems, brother with a stroke… increases the risk. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your heartburn?
PATIENT: Just the one for the heartburn, like I said. Something for the acid reflux. And sometimes, when my knees are really bad, I take a little somethin’ over the counter for the pain. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. But that’s it. I try not to take too many pills, you know? Don't like feelin’ all drugged up.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. The nurse always asks, and I always say no. I ate everything as a kid, my mother made sure of that. And I’ve never been stung by a bee or anything like that. So, no, I don’t think so. Maybe a little trouble with shellfish once, a long time ago. But that might have just been a bad oyster.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible shellfish sensitivity… noted. Now, Mr. Bohnett, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Then we can discuss some options. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I don’t mind a bit. Just tell me what you find, alright? I always like to know what’s goin’ on with my body, even if it’s not good news.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. If you could just sit up on the table for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 88. Your pulse is regular, but a bit fast. I hear a slight murmur—a whooshing sound—when I listen to your heart. It’s not necessarily concerning, but it warrants further investigation. Your lungs sound clear. Now, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she was the one who kept me straight on that. Said it was bad for your health, and she was right about most things. I did drink a little bit, sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe a glass of wine on special occasions. But I haven't had a drink in years. Not since she passed. Just didn't feel right, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. And how would you describe your diet these days?
PATIENT: Well, I mostly eat what I can manage on my own. I used to enjoy cookin’, but it’s harder now with my knees and all. So, I get a lot of frozen meals, you know, the ones you heat up in the microwave. They're not fancy, but they fill me up. I try to get some fish in there when I can, like salmon or tuna. And I eat my vegetables. I do have a sweet tooth, though. I like a little somethin’ after dinner, like a cookie or a piece of chocolate. Can’t resist a good cookie, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, based on what you’ve told me – your family history, your cholesterol levels, the slight murmur I heard, and your diet – it's likely a combination of factors contributing to your high cholesterol. It's not something to panic about, but it does need to be addressed. We can start with lifestyle changes – improving your diet and increasing physical activity. I’ll give you some resources for healthy eating. However, given your family history and the murmur, I also want to order a lipid panel to get a more detailed breakdown of your cholesterol levels, and an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A little more information can’t hurt, I suppose. And I’ll try to eat better, I promise. Maybe I’ll get one of those meal delivery services, the ones with the healthy options. And I’ll try to walk a little bit more, even if it’s just around the block. An EKG… what does that involve? Is it painful? I don’t like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not painful at all, Mr. Bohnett. An EKG—electrocardiogram—is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. We just put a few small stickers—electrodes—on your chest, arms, and legs. It doesn’t involve any needles, thankfully. It takes just a few minutes, and it doesn’t hurt. We’ll get the results pretty quickly. The lipid panel will give us a more detailed picture of your cholesterol levels – your LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. Knowing those numbers will help us determine if we need to consider medication in addition to lifestyle changes. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: HDL… LDL… those are the good and bad ones, right? The nurse mentioned somethin’ about that when she took my blood. And triglycerides… is that somethin’ with fat? I always get these big words mixed up. Medication… I don’t know. I’m not too keen on takin’ a lot of pills, like I said. But I understand you need to do what’s best for your health. If you think it’s necessary, I’ll give it a try. I just hope there aren’t too many side effects.
DOCTOR: You're right, HDL is the "good" cholesterol, and LDL is the "bad" cholesterol. Triglycerides are a type of fat in your blood. High levels can increase your risk of heart disease. We’ll start with the tests and lifestyle changes first. We can discuss medication options later if needed. And if we do consider medication, we’ll choose one with the fewest possible side effects and start with a low dose to see how you tolerate it. I understand your concerns about taking pills, and we’ll approach it cautiously. Okay. I’m going to write you a referral for the EKG and give you some information about healthy eating and exercise. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to review your test results and discuss your progress. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. A month sounds like a good amount of time to see if I can make some changes. And I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. It makes me feel a lot better knowin’ what’s goin’ on. Yes, please schedule a follow-up. I'll try my best to follow your advice. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. That’s what I’m here for. I’ll just get this referral printed out for you, and I’ll have the nurse schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Here you go. The lab is located just down the street, and you don’t need an appointment for the EKG. Just bring this with you. If you have any questions between now and your follow-up, don’t hesitate to call the office. Alright. Do you have any questions for me before I go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate your patience with an old man like me, always forgettin’ things and askin’ silly questions. I’ll try to take better care of myself, I promise. And thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all, Mr. Bohnett. And you’re not old – you’re experienced! And it’s good you’re taking this seriously. I’m confident you can make positive changes. Alright. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in a month. .
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. And thank you again.
