DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... a pleasure, I suppose. I’ve been feeling quite thirsty lately, and… well, hungry, too. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s a bit bothersome, to be frank. I’d like to get it sorted, if you don’t mind. I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling thirsty and hungry for a few weeks is certainly something we should look into. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about that thirst?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s not just a dry mouth, if you understand. I mean, I feel… compelled to drink, constantly. I’ll finish a glass of water and then feel like I need another one almost immediately. And it's not related to the weather, or activity. I feel this way even if I've just woken up. It’s… quite disruptive, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not simply feeling dry, but more of a constant urge to drink, regardless of how much you've had or what you've been doing. That's helpful to know. And you said it's been going on for a few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks now. Maybe… six, seven weeks? It’s hard to say exactly, I don't really keep track of these things. It started gradually, just noticing I was refilling my water glass more often. Now… well, now it's a bit of an obsession, if I’m honest. I just want to know why, and if it's something serious. I have commitments, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and wanting to know the cause is very reasonable, especially with commitments to keep. Six to seven weeks… alright. Aside from the increased thirst, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes. Let me think. I suppose… I've been eating more. Not necessarily craving anything specific, just… larger portions, more frequently. And perhaps a bit more tired than usual, though that could be the lack of sleep, to be fair. I work long hours. I don't know if that’s relevant. It's… hard to pinpoint anything definite, other than the thirst and the increased appetite.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased appetite alongside the thirst and some fatigue. Those things can be related. Just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination… yes, actually. I suppose I have. I'm going to the bathroom… more often. Especially at night, which is rather inconvenient. It’s not painful, just… more frequent. Perhaps larger volumes each time, too. I hadn't really connected that to the thirst, but now that you mention it… yes, that's been happening. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Christen. Increased urination, particularly at night, is definitely something we need to consider along with the thirst and appetite changes. It sounds like we have a few key symptoms here. Do you have any family history of diabetes, or any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes… my mother’s sister had something, years ago. I don’t recall the specifics. Something to do with sugar levels, I think. She lived in Scotland, so it was hard to keep track. As for other conditions… my father had high blood pressure, I believe. Nothing major, as far as I know. He was a… a stoic man, didn’t talk about his ailments much. I don't believe either of them had anything… serious. Though, to be frank, we weren't close. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, thank you. A family history of diabetes, even a distant relative, is something we'll keep in mind. And high blood pressure as well. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. I don't take anything regularly. I had a brief course of antibiotics a couple of years ago for a chest infection, but that was it. I pride myself on my health, generally. I don't like relying on pills and potions if I can avoid it. I prefer to… get on with things, if you understand. Is that… relevant? I'd rather not spend all day in here if possible.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your preference. Not taking any regular medications is good to know. Alright, Christen. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, and then I'd like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… acceptable. As long as it doesn’t take too long, Doctor. I have a shipment arriving this afternoon that I need to oversee. Blood tests are… fine, I suppose. So long as I don't have to fast for an unreasonable amount of time. I need to eat, you see. Is there anything I should avoid doing beforehand?
DOCTOR: Of course. The exam shouldn't take long, and the blood tests will require a brief fast – about eight hours, so ideally nothing to eat or drink after midnight tonight. We'll get those results back quickly. First, let's just check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a quick look at your general condition. Alright?
PATIENT: Very well. Eight hours… I suppose I can manage that. I’ll make arrangements for a simple breakfast tomorrow, then. Let’s… get this over with, shall we? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you’d be comfortable, please change into the gown. Once you're ready, I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not alarming on its own. Now, if you could lie back for me, please?
PATIENT: Right. Get on with it, please. I haven't got all day, you see.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. I notice a slight increase in abdominal girth, but nothing significant. Reflexes are normal. Feet show no signs of neuropathy, but there is some mild edema in the ankles. Alright, Christen. Everything seems generally within normal limits, but the elevated blood pressure, rapid heart rate, mild ankle edema, and increased abdominal girth, along with your symptoms, warrant further investigation. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I need a straight answer, if possible. I can't afford to be laid up with some complicated illness. I have a business to run.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Christen. It's difficult to say definitively without the blood test results. However, your symptoms, combined with the physical findings, could indicate a few possibilities, including pre-diabetes or early-stage diabetes, or possibly a cardiovascular issue. The elevated blood pressure and rapid heart rate are also concerning. It’s important not to jump to conclusions, though. These tests will help us rule things in or out. It doesn't necessarily mean a complicated illness, but it does mean we need to address this proactively. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible and discuss them thoroughly. Would you like me to explain what the blood tests will be looking for specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain it to me. I need to understand what's going on. And what are the… chances, if you don’t mind? Chances of it being… serious. I’m not afraid of a bit of hard work, but I need to know what I’m facing. And if it is something… bad, what does that mean for my commitments?
DOCTOR: Alright. The blood tests will primarily look at your glucose levels – both fasting glucose and A1C, which gives us an average glucose level over the past three months. We’ll also check your cholesterol levels, triglycerides, and kidney function, as well as a complete blood count to look for any signs of inflammation or other issues. As for the chances of it being serious… it's difficult to put a precise percentage on it without the results. However, the symptoms you’ve described are often associated with diabetes, and if left unmanaged, diabetes can lead to serious complications, such as heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision loss. However, early detection and management can significantly reduce those risks. If it is diabetes, it means lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, and potentially medication – will be necessary. It may require some adjustments to your commitments, but many people with diabetes live full and productive lives. If it turns out to be something else, such as a cardiovascular issue, the treatment plan will vary accordingly. We'll discuss all options thoroughly once we have the results. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Right. Lifestyle changes… diet, exercise… that’s… inconvenient, to say the least. I don’t have time for all that. But… I suppose I’ll have to manage. And medication… I’d rather avoid that if possible. So, the tests… how long will they take? And when can I expect the results? I need to know if I need to start… preparing. If it is something serious, I need to get things in order.
DOCTOR: The blood tests themselves should only take a few minutes. You’ll need to fast for eight hours beforehand, as we discussed. The lab usually has the results back within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available, either by phone or through the patient portal. In the meantime, you could start thinking about small, manageable changes you might be able to incorporate into your routine – perhaps taking a short walk during your lunch break, or swapping sugary drinks for water. But don’t make any drastic changes before we have the results. It’s important not to jump to conclusions. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… get the results back quickly, please. I need to know what I’m dealing with. And… thank you. I suppose.
