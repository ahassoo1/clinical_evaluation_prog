DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepno. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been having some pain… down there. It's in my… testicles. I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… difficult to talk about.
DOCTOR: Testicles?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s right. I… I wasn’t sure how else to put it. It’s not constant, you understand. More of a…ache, sometimes sharp. It’s been going on for… well, I honestly can’t say how long. A few weeks, perhaps? Time seems to slip away these days. I do hope you aren't judging me, Doctor. It feels rather silly to be discussing this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepno, while it is unusual for someone of your gender to be experiencing pain in that area, I assure you I'm not judging. It's my job to assess any medical concern, regardless of how…unconventional. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Though, it could be longer. I have… trouble remembering details these days. It doesn't seem related to any particular activity. It's just… there, sometimes. And it's definitely gotten more noticeable recently. I haven’t had any injuries, if that helps. Or… I don’t think so. I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has there been any swelling, redness, or any other changes in that area, besides the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… swelling… I haven’t specifically looked… but I don’t think so. No redness that I’ve noticed. And, no, nothing else has changed, not that I am aware of. It’s just the ache, and sometimes a sharp… pinch, I suppose you could call it. I'm so sorry I can’t be more precise, Doctor. It’s all a bit of a blur. Do you need me to… examine myself now?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Stepno, that won’t be necessary at this point. We'll get to a physical exam shortly. It's…highly irregular, as I mentioned, for a woman to experience testicular pain. Have you had any recent surgeries, or any unusual medical history that you recall?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix removed, a very long time ago. Perhaps… thirty years? And I had a hysterectomy… also a while back, I suppose. Other than that… nothing comes to mind immediately. I’ve always been relatively healthy, I think. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. Is this… serious, Doctor? Should I be worried? It feels… strange even talking about it.
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say without a proper examination. However, the combination of your history and current symptoms does warrant further investigation. The fact that you’ve had a hysterectomy… well, that changes things slightly. We need to rule out a number of possibilities. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I believe I had a reaction to penicillin as a child. A rash, mostly. And I am a bit sensitive to codeine; it makes me very drowsy. Other than those two, nothing that I’m aware of. I apologize for being so… unhelpful. I wish I had a clearer recollection of everything. It's like trying to grasp smoke. Would some tests help figure things out?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Stepno, tests will be necessary. Before we order anything, let's do a quick review of your current medications, just to be certain there are no interactions. And then, we’ll need to perform a physical exam. I will need you to change into a gown, and we will begin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. A gown, you say? Of course. I… I suppose I should ask… what kind of physical exam? I’m just… a little nervous, Doctor. This is all very… unexpected. And frankly, quite embarrassing. I haven’t spoken to anyone about this, let alone a doctor.
DOCTOR: It will be a standard abdominal and pelvic exam, Ms. Stepno. I will also need to palpate your inguinal area, to assess for any… abnormalities. I understand your discomfort, and I assure you I will be as thorough and professional as possible. We need to rule out a number of things – referred pain, potential hernias, and less common possibilities. It's important to get a clear picture of what's going on. Please take your time getting changed, and I’ll be back shortly.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for explaining. I… I’ll just go change now. I appreciate your… kindness. I truly do. .
