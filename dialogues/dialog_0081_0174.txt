DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been…myself lately. It’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I just…don’t feel much of anything anymore. It’s been going on for a while now, and my daughter insisted I come see someone. She worries.
DOCTOR: “Not feeling like yourself,” alright. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started… probably around November, last year? Maybe October? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. Time does seem to slip away these days. It hasn’t been constant, you understand. More… waves. Good days and not-so-good days. But the not-so-good are becoming more frequent, I think.
DOCTOR: November or October…so roughly eight to nine months now. And you describe it as “waves.” Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Yes, waves is a good way to put it. Some days I wake up and I can manage. I can do my usual things – a bit of gardening, speak to my grandchildren on the phone. But then… it just comes over me. A heaviness, mostly. Like a weight on my chest. I lose interest in everything. Even the things I enjoy. And… well, I just want to be left alone. It’s not that I want to feel this way, you understand. It just… is. Then, after a day or so, it lifts a bit, and I can function again. But it always comes back.
DOCTOR: A heaviness, loss of interest…and a desire to be alone. Has anything specifically triggered these “waves,” as you call them?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. I’ve tried to figure that out myself. Nothing major, not that I can recall. Perhaps… the anniversary of my divorce? That was last spring. But it didn’t feel particularly bad then. Sometimes it seems to come on for no reason at all. Just… happens. And lately, even pleasant things don't seem to lift my spirits like they used to. I used to love my book club, but I haven't felt much enthusiasm for it recently. It feels… pointless, I suppose. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: So, no clear trigger, and a general lessening of enjoyment. Let’s move on to other aspects of your health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I have a touch of arthritis in my knees, nothing too serious. It flares up sometimes, especially when the weather is cold. And my blood pressure is a little high, but I take medication for that. Lisinopril, I believe it's called. Aside from that, I’m reasonably healthy, for my age, I think. I try to stay active, you know. Walking, gardening...as much as my knees allow. And I eat a fairly balanced diet, though I do have a sweet tooth. One must have some enjoyment in life, mustn't one?
DOCTOR: Arthritis in the knees, hypertension managed with Lisinopril… And a fondness for sweets. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, I had a hysterectomy when I was 42. And I broke my wrist a few years ago, falling in the garden, embarrassingly enough. Nothing else major, I don’t believe. Just the usual bumps and bruises that come with a long life. Is that something you need detailed information on? I can ask my daughter, she keeps better records than I do.
DOCTOR: No, that’s sufficient for now. Now, Ms. Derasmo, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any mental health conditions – depression, anxiety, anything like that – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a difficult question. Mental health wasn't… discussed openly in my family when I was growing up. My mother was a very stoic woman, and my father… well, he was just a quiet man. I believe my aunt on my father’s side spent some time in a sanatorium when she was younger, but no one spoke about it much. They just said she was “delicate.” As for depression or anxiety… I don’t know. Perhaps, but it wasn’t something that was ever acknowledged. I’m not much help on that front, I’m afraid. It’s not something we talked about.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your social history, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned, I’m divorced. It was… a long time ago. We didn’t have any children. I have a few close friends from book club, and I speak to my grandchildren regularly. They live in another state, unfortunately. I used to be very active in the community, volunteering at the hospital and things, but I haven't been as involved lately. It’s… hard to explain. I just haven’t had the energy or the motivation. Does that answer your question, Doctor? I’m not much of a social butterfly these days.
DOCTOR: And do you use alcohol, tobacco, or any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never. I have always believed in moderation. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's it. And I certainly don’t smoke. My late husband tried it once, and I put a stop to that quickly. Recreational drugs… the very idea! I’m a respectable woman, Doctor. I’ve lived a good life, and I’ve always tried to make sensible choices.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the Lisinopril, and a daily vitamin. Nothing else. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis, when it flares up, but that's it. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Ginger tea helps with the arthritis sometimes. Old wives’ tales, I suppose. But they sometimes work better than the medication.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Now, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. It’ll just be a quick check of your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. Please sit back and relax. I’ll need you to remove your shoes and socks, if you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. That sounds… sensible, I suppose. Yes, I can remove my shoes and socks. I do hope it won't take too long. I have a bridge game scheduled for this afternoon. It's just... time feels so precious these days.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/85. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, no asymmetry. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Neurological exam is grossly intact. I also note some mild pallor. Overall, your physical exam is relatively unremarkable.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. “Relatively unremarkable” is good, isn’t it? I do feel a bit tired sometimes, as I mentioned. Perhaps that explains the pallor. Is that something to be concerned about, Doctor? I hope it’s not anything serious.
DOCTOR: It could be related to fatigue, Ms. Derasmo, but we should investigate further. Given your symptoms – the persistent low mood, loss of interest, and now this pallor – I’d like to order some blood work. We'll check a complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. This will help us rule out any underlying medical causes for your condition. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Yes, you have my consent. But please, try to keep it brief. I really do have that bridge game… and I’m not good when I've been poked and prodded. And where will I have this done? Will it take long?
DOCTOR: You can have the blood work done at the lab just down the hall. It shouldn’t take more than twenty minutes, Ms. Derasmo. The results will take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a referral to a psychiatrist. I believe a specialist evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Do you have any objections to this referral?
PATIENT: Oh. A psychiatrist. Well, that’s… rather a lot, isn’t it? A blood test and a psychiatrist? I… I don’t know, Doctor. It feels a bit extreme. I just feel a bit down, not… unwell. Isn't there something else we could try first? Perhaps some… vitamins? Or a change in diet? I'm not sure I want to talk to a… a specialist about my feelings.
DOCTOR: Ms. Derasmo, with all due respect, your symptoms have been ongoing for nearly a year. Simply suggesting vitamins or a dietary change would be… inadequate. We need to rule out any underlying medical causes and assess your mental health properly. Dismissing the possibility of a psychiatric evaluation would be… irresponsible. I understand your hesitation, but I assure you, it's the most prudent course of action. This isn’t about labeling you; it’s about understanding what’s going on and getting you the help you need. Do you consent to the referral?
PATIENT: Oh… very well, Doctor. If you insist. But… please, could you recommend someone… discreet? I don't want everyone knowing my business. And I’d prefer someone who… understands. I don’t want to be treated like… a crazy woman. If you could give me a name and number, I suppose I can make an appointment. But I still feel this is… rather a lot, Doctor. Rather a lot.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m recommending Dr. Eleanor Vance. She has excellent bedside manner and specializes in geriatric mental health. Here’s her number and address. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the blood work results and your experience with Dr. Vance. In the meantime, try to maintain a regular sleep schedule and engage in some gentle exercise. And please, if your symptoms worsen, don't hesitate to contact my office. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that’s all. Thank you. I suppose I should go and have my blood drawn. And then… call Dr. Vance. It’s all rather overwhelming. Thank you… again. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Derasmo. .
