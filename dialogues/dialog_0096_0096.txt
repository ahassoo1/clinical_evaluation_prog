DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, hi Doctor. Well, it’s kinda strange, to be honest. I’ve been getting really bothered by the sun lately. Not like a sunburn, exactly… more like my eyes just really hurt when I’m outside, even with sunglasses. It's been happening for a few months now, and it's getting worse.
DOCTOR: Hmm. "Bothered by the sun," you say. For months, getting worse... Right. And you are wearing sunglasses when you’re out, yes?
PATIENT: Yeah, I am. Good quality ones, I thought. I always have, actually. Even on cloudy days if I'm going to be outside for a while. It doesn't seem to help much, though. It’s… hard to explain. Everything just feels too bright, even through the glasses. And it’s not just my eyes, sometimes my head starts to ache after being in the sun too.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, bright lights… headache. And you’ve been wearing sunglasses consistently. Are these new sunglasses, or have you had them for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, I've had them for… maybe two years now? They're the same ones I always use. I haven't changed brands or anything. They used to be fine, totally blocked out the glare. It’s like something changed, not the glasses. It just started happening gradually, you know? A little more sensitive each time I went out.
DOCTOR: Two years… hmm. Well, sometimes things just… happen. But we need to rule some things out. Tell me, have you noticed any changes in your vision besides the sensitivity to light?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything looks pretty clear, as far as I can tell. I haven't needed a new glasses prescription or anything. I can read fine, watch TV, all that. It’s just the brightness of everything is the problem. And the ache, sometimes. It's not a sharp pain, more like a dull pressure behind my eyes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Dull pressure… Okay. Have you had any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I mean, I've been a little more tired lately, but I figured that was just from work. It’s been busy at the dental office. Oh! And, this is probably nothing, but my eyes sometimes feel… gritty, like there's something in them, even when I know there isn't. But that doesn’t happen all the time. It's mostly just the light and the headache.
DOCTOR: Gritty feeling… right. And busy at work. Stress can certainly cause all sorts of things. But we need to be thorough. Have you had any problems with your eyes in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always had good eyesight, honestly. No infections, no injuries, nothing. My mom always said I had hawk eyes. I never had to wear glasses until I hit my thirties, and even then it was just for reading. This is… new, completely new. It's worrying me a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. Well, we'll see what we can figure out. Let’s have a look at your eyes, shall we?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: Right. If you'll just sit here and look straight ahead. I'm going to check your pupils and a few other things. Don't blink unless I tell you to.
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. It's a little bright, but I'm okay.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light… though slightly sluggish. Conjunctiva is clear. No obvious signs of infection. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little… pressure, maybe, but not pain. Like a dull ache, like I said. It’s hard to explain. It's not a sharp, throbbing thing, just… uncomfortable. It's been worse on sunny days, definitely. It feels like the light is making it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just check your peripheral vision. When I hold up these fingers, tell me when you can see them, even if it's just a shadow.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. There… and there… I think I see something now… yep, there it is.
DOCTOR: Visual fields appear intact. Well, Mr. Komarov, based on what you’ve told me, and the preliminary examination, it could be a few things. We need to rule out some more serious causes, but it’s possible you’re experiencing something called photophobia, sensitivity to light, possibly related to stress or eye strain. It could also be a migraine variant, even without a severe headache. But to be absolutely certain, I'd like to order a few tests. We’ll do some blood work to check for inflammation, and I think a referral to an ophthalmologist wouldn’t be a bad idea, just to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Okay, that… that sounds good. Blood work and seeing a specialist. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? Is it… is it anything serious, Doctor? I've been a little worried. Especially with my… with my wife passing last year, I'm a bit more anxious about things. I just want to be sure it's nothing to really be afraid of.
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov, I understand your anxiety, especially given your recent loss. However, jumping to conclusions won’t help. The tests are simply to rule things out. It's highly unlikely it's anything truly serious. But we must be thorough. I’m going to write up the lab order now. The phlebotomist will be able to take the blood sample right here in the clinic. As for the ophthalmologist, I’ll give you a referral. Dr. Anya Sharma is very good. She’s a bit… particular, but excellent. In the meantime, I recommend minimizing your exposure to bright light, wearing sunglasses even indoors if it helps, and trying to manage your stress levels. Easier said than done, I know. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay, Dr. Sharma… I'll write that down. And I will try to stay out of the sun as much as possible. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, and for ordering the tests. It’s just… it’s unsettling, not knowing what’s going on. Do you think I should be worried about driving while I wait for the results? It’s… it's mostly just the brightness that bothers me, but I don’t want to risk anything.
DOCTOR: Driving… Honestly, Mr. Komarov, if the only issue is sensitivity to light, and you can manage with sunglasses, I don’t see an immediate reason to restrict your driving. But use common sense. Avoid driving during peak sunlight hours if possible, and if the glare becomes too much, pull over. Don’t put yourself – or anyone else – at risk. Here is the lab order. The phlebotomist is just down the hall. And here is the referral to Dr. Sharma. You can call her office to schedule an appointment. I'll have the lab results sent to my office, and we can discuss them next week. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Okay, common sense… I understand. No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Thank you again for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll go see the phlebotomist now, and schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma. I appreciate it. Have a good day, Doctor.
