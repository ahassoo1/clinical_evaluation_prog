DOCTOR: Hi Sasha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my legs. They are swelling. It started after the cancer treatment, you see. It's not so bad all the time, but it worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your legs after cancer treatment. That definitely warrants a look. Can you tell me a little more about when it started, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… maybe a month after I finished? Yes, about a month. It didn't come on suddenly, it was…slow. Little by little, they got bigger. I don't know, it's hard to say exactly when it started started, you know? It was just…more and more.
DOCTOR: I understand, it's often hard to pinpoint an exact start date. So, about a month after you finished cancer treatment, you noticed gradual swelling in your legs. Is it in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Both legs, Doctor. Mostly in my ankles, but it goes up a bit higher sometimes. Not always, but…yeah. Both legs. It's not painful, not really. Just…uncomfortable, and I worry what it means.
DOCTOR: Okay, both legs, primarily in the ankles, and it comes and goes. Not painful, just uncomfortable and concerning. That's good information. Can you tell me what kind of cancer treatment you had?
PATIENT: Oh… um. It was…chemotherapy, I think? And… radiation? Yes, definitely radiation. They did it… at the hospital, you know, near my… well, never mind. A long time ago. It was a lot of appointments. I forget the names of everything, honestly. It was… a while ago. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, thank you. Chemotherapy and radiation. That gives me a better picture. And roughly when did you finish treatment?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a hard one. I think… two years ago? Maybe a little more? It feels like forever, you know? Everything gets mixed up. Let me think… 2023, maybe? Yes, I think it was 2023. Definitely before this year, for sure. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, treatment finished in 2023. That's helpful. Now, besides the swelling, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not really. My energy is… low, sometimes. But that could be anything, you know? I get tired easily. And my skin is a little dry. But I think that's just from being old! No, nothing else… not that I can think of, anyway. Just the swelling. And worrying, of course!
DOCTOR: Okay, low energy and dry skin, but nothing specific that you’ve noticed in relation to the swelling. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better look at your legs and check a few things. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know if it’s something serious. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m feeling your ankles now… and the swelling seems to be mostly around the lower legs, as you described. The skin is warm to the touch, and there doesn’t seem to be any redness or tenderness. I’m checking your pulses now… Your pulses are a little weak, but present in both legs. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to rule anything else out. Breathing sounds are clear, heart sounds are regular. Okay, everything sounds and feels okay, but we need to figure out what's causing this swelling. I’m going to order some blood work to check your kidney function, liver function and also rule out any blood clots. We’ll also do a quick EKG just to make sure everything’s stable. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… like a lot. Blood work and… an EKG? Is it very serious? I don’t like needles, you know. And I get nervous at the hospital. But if you think it's necessary… yes, okay. Whatever you think is best. Just… please be quick, if you can? I just want this figured out. Are those tests expensive? I’m on Medicare.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I want to reassure you we'll do everything as quickly and comfortably as possible. The tests will give us important information to help figure out what's going on. Medicare should cover most of the cost, but we can check with their coverage guidelines to get a better estimate before we proceed. We'll also send the results to your primary care physician. Now, before we get those tests done, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see… No, I don’t think so. Not that I know of, anyway. The doctors always ask, but I usually say no. I've taken a lot of pills over the years, and nothing ever happened. I can’t remember ever having a reaction. No allergies, I don’t think. Just… old. I’m just an old lady, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Alright, I’m going to write out a referral for the blood work and EKG, and the nurse will help you schedule the appointments. She'll also go over the instructions with you. Once we get the results back, we can discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, try to elevate your legs whenever possible, and avoid prolonged standing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Elevate my legs. I can do that. And the nurse will help me schedule things? Good. I'm not very good with computers, you know. Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s everything, isn’t it? I just want to go home and sit down. .
DOCTOR: Yes, that's everything for today. The nurse will be in shortly to go over everything with you and schedule those appointments. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was lovely meeting you, Sasha.
