DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin' to you too, Doctor. It’s my blood pressure, I reckon. Been a little high lately, the nurse told me at the pharmacy. I don’t rightly know what all that means, just that I needed to get it checked by a real doctor. I’m Venna, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Venna. I see that the pharmacy flagged a few readings. “A little high” can mean different things, of course. Let’s get a better idea of what's going on. Now, when did you first notice you were getting these higher readings, or when did the nurse first mention it to you?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It was… oh, maybe a month or so ago? The nurse, Betty, she’s a sweet girl, she just said I should come see somebody. I don’t usually bother doctors much, if I can help it. It just felt… normal, to be honest. I didn’t feel different.
DOCTOR: "Normal," right. Well, high blood pressure often doesn’t have any symptoms, which is why it's good you're getting it checked. A month ago... and has it been consistently higher since then, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: Fluctuate… I think so. Some days I feel alright, other days I just feel a little… tired, maybe? But I'm ninety years old, Doctor! I get tired easy these days. It's hard to say what's normal and what's not. I bake a lot, you see. That can tire a body out.
DOCTOR: Baking does sound strenuous. Alright. And when you say "a little tired," is that just a general feeling of being worn out, or is it something more specific?
PATIENT: More like… just draggin'. Like I got no pep. And sometimes my head feels a little…fuzzy. Not a bad headache, just… not clear, if that makes sense? I don't know if that’s the pressure, or just old age, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And are you experiencing any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Well… now that you mention it… things haven't been quite as sharp lately. I just figured it was my eyes gettin' older too. I haven't been to the eye doctor in…oh, goodness, probably ten years. Is that somethin' I should be worryin' about?
DOCTOR: It’s certainly something to consider. Alright, Ms. Steines. I’m going to need to take your blood pressure now, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam—just listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just get me back to my bakin’ as quick as you can, alright? I got a blueberry pie crust needs rollin’.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's get started then. Could you please sit back and relax, and try to keep your arm still?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Relaxin’… tryin’ to, anyway. Blueberry pie isn’t gonna roll itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally. Hmm. 162 over 98. And your pulse is a little fast at 88. Not ideal, Ms. Steines. Heart sounds are a bit muffled, and I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but you’re breathing a little shallowly. Now, I need to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other health conditions – diabetes, high cholesterol, kidney problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds…bad. Well, Dr. Reynolds, bless his soul, he delivered me, and he always said I had a strong heart. But he passed away… goodness, fifty years ago? Let me think… diabetes… no, never. Cholesterol… maybe? I don't rightly remember. I eat pretty healthy, mostly. Fruits and things. And I bake with butter, but that's just… part of life, you know? Kidney problems… no, not that I know of. I drink plenty of water, always have. I did have rheumatic fever when I was a little girl, but that was a long, long time ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Rheumatic fever can cause long-term heart problems, yes. It's good you mentioned that. And do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t. Never really been one for pills. A little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's about it. I mostly just…try to stay active. And bake. Although my joints ain’t what they used to be…
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat all sorts of things. Wild berries, greens... everything my grandma taught me to find. She was Cherokee, you see. Lived off the land. Never had trouble with allergies. Unless you count bees, but that ain’t an allergy, is it? Just common sense to stay away from ‘em.
DOCTOR: Ms. Steines, based on your blood pressure reading and your history, I'm concerned about possible hypertension. The murmur I detected is also a bit troubling, especially given the history of rheumatic fever. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and rule out any other underlying issues. We should also do an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. And frankly, you really should see a cardiologist for a proper evaluation. I can give you a referral.
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds…like a lot. Tests and doctors… I just wanna bake my pies, Doctor. Is it…bad? Is it gonna keep me from bakin’? I got a blue ribbon to defend next month at the county fair. I don’t want to have to give up bakin’.
DOCTOR: Ms. Steines, it's not ideal, but it’s also not necessarily a death sentence. It could be nothing, or it could be something that needs managing. We need to get some information before we jump to conclusions. The tests will give us a clearer picture. As for the baking… we’ll see what the tests reveal. But ignoring this could lead to more serious problems down the road. A stroke, heart failure… those are things we want to avoid, especially if you're aiming for another blue ribbon. I understand you want to keep baking, and I'm not trying to take that away from you. I’m trying to ensure you can continue baking for years to come. Are you willing to get the tests done?
PATIENT: Years to come… That does sound nice. A blue ribbon ain't worth much if I can't enjoy it, I reckon. Alright, Doctor. Yes. Do the tests. And… get me a referral to that heart doctor. Just… please, don't make me wait too long. This whole thing is makin' my joints ache just thinkin' about it. And… is there anything I can do now? To… help it, while I’m waitin’? Besides stop bakin', I mean.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll order the blood tests and schedule the EKG for tomorrow morning. I'll also get the referral to Dr. Chen, a cardiologist in town. As for what you can do now… try to reduce your salt intake. Avoid processed foods, limit fast food, and be mindful of what you’re adding to your cooking. And… unfortunately, reducing stress is also important. I realize that's easier said than done. Perhaps consider pacing yourself with the baking. Don’t try to do everything at once. I'll have the lab orders and referral information ready for you before you leave. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Salt… and stress… Easy for you to say, Doctor. Salt makes everything taste better! And stress comes with tryin’ to win a blue ribbon, I reckon. Alright, alright. I’ll try. I can’t promise nothin', but I’ll try. How long ‘til I get the results? And… will it hurt? The tests, I mean. I don't like needles much. And… if it's bad, what happens then?
DOCTOR: The blood tests will take about 24-48 hours to come back. The EKG is painless – it just involves placing electrodes on your chest. As for the needle… it's a small prick, and it’s usually over quickly. Try not to dwell on it. As for “if it’s bad”… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. There are many possible treatments for hypertension, ranging from medication to lifestyle changes. We’ll discuss all your options if necessary. I'm not going to speculate on worst-case scenarios. Let’s get the tests done first, and then we can formulate a plan. Now, I’m going to print out the lab orders and the referral information. Do you need help getting to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I can manage. I know the way. Been drivin' since I was fifteen. Lifestyle changes… that means less butter, don't it? Fine. Less butter. But you tell that heart doctor I expect a good explanation if I lose my touch. I’ve been bakin’ blueberry pies for eighty years, Doctor. Eighty years! And… is there anything else I need to know? Before I go? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Just…try to stay calm and avoid strenuous activity until we have the test results. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headaches, go to the emergency room immediately. And yes, less butter. It's not ideal, but it's better for your health. I understand you’re concerned about your baking, Ms. Steines, but your health is the priority. I think that covers everything. If you have any questions, you can call my office. Have a good day.
