DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Knabenshue, yes. I see you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Sink. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am here regarding the requirements at my place of work… about wearing masks and other protective gear. It’s causing me some difficulty, and I was hoping to discuss a possible exemption.
DOCTOR: An exemption, yes. Well, these things are… complicated. Let's get this over with quickly. So, what specifically is causing you difficulty with the masks and gear?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a discomfort, exactly. It’s more… a feeling. A deep feeling of… restriction. It’s hard to explain. I work with people, you see, and being able to see faces, to truly connect… it’s important in my line of work. The masks feel like a barrier to that connection. It’s… unsettling. And some of the other gear feels… disrespectful to the traditions I was raised with. It's hard to put into words, I apologize.
DOCTOR: A “feeling.” Right. And this feeling… how long has it been present?
PATIENT: It started when the requirements were first put in place, about six months ago. At first, I thought I could adjust, that it would pass. But it hasn’t. It’s… grown stronger, if that makes sense. It affects my ability to focus on my work, to provide the support people need. It's not something I can simply ignore.
DOCTOR: And what is your line of work, exactly?
PATIENT: I am a Protective Service Worker. I work with families, assisting them with various needs… ensuring the safety and well-being of children, supporting parents… things of that nature. It requires a great deal of trust and understanding, Doctor. It’s not just paperwork and procedures, you see. It's about people. It's about connection.
DOCTOR: Protective Services… of course. And you believe this… connection is hindered by standard protective equipment?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. A mask hides expression, and for many of the people I work with, they've already experienced a great deal of trauma. They rely on reading faces, on seeing sincerity. It's hard to build trust when half of my face is covered. And some of the other equipment… the gloves, the gowns… they feel… sterile, impersonal. It's a small thing, perhaps, but it creates a distance. A barrier. It feels disrespectful to their vulnerability.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I’m a physician, not a… cultural sensitivity trainer. Have you discussed these concerns with your employer?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Several times. I explained my concerns, and I even suggested alternatives – perhaps face shields, or increased testing to reduce the need for masks. But they are firm in their requirements. They cite safety protocols and regulations. I understand their position, but it feels like my concerns are being dismissed. That’s why I came to you, Doctor. I was hoping you might be able to offer some… guidance, perhaps a medical justification for an exemption.
DOCTOR: A medical justification. Hmm. Do you have any diagnosed anxiety or… claustrophobia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I have never been diagnosed with either of those conditions. It's not a fear, precisely. It’s… a feeling of disconnection, of being unable to fully engage with the people I’m trying to help. It’s a deep-seated unease, a sense that something essential is missing. I've always been a very… observant person, attuned to subtle cues, to body language. The masks interfere with that ability. It impacts my effectiveness, and ultimately, it impacts the people I serve. It's difficult to explain, I know.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no concrete medical issue. Just… a feeling. Have you considered… a different line of work?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. I have dedicated many years to this work. It is not simply a job, you see. It is a calling. It is a part of who I am. I feel a strong sense of responsibility to my community, to the families I serve. To simply abandon that… it feels wrong. I want to continue helping people, but I need to be able to do so in a way that is authentic, that respects both their needs and my own. Is there anything medically that could be documented to support my request, or am I simply… out of luck?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Knabenshue, I'm not going to fabricate a medical condition. You're describing… a personal discomfort, not a disability. I'm a physician, not a therapist. I can document that you’ve expressed these feelings, but that won't likely be enough for an exemption. Perhaps you should revisit your employer and explore alternative solutions. Or, as I said, consider a different career path. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. I appreciate your honesty, even if it’s not what I hoped to hear. I suppose I was hoping for… some validation, perhaps. Some acknowledgement that my concerns are legitimate. It feels… dismissive to be told it’s simply a “personal discomfort.” It impacts my ability to do my job, and ultimately, to help people. No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Knabenshue. .
