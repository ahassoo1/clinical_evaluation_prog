DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Oh, dear. What does bring me in… Well, it’s this pain. Down low, you see. It comes and goes, but when it’s here… it’s quite something. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about… well, I have trouble remembering the exact name, but a condition that affects many parts of the body. It flares up sometimes, and this pain feels connected to that, I think. I apologize for being so vague; my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No need to apologize at all, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly common for things to be a bit hazy, and we'll take our time to figure things out. You mentioned pain “down low” – could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… difficult to describe precisely. It’s not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a… cramping, heavy ache. It’s mostly in my lower abdomen, you see. Sometimes it radiates to my back, just a little. And it’s… unpredictable. It can come on suddenly, or build slowly over a day or two. I’ve noticed it’s worse when I… well, when I’m trying to be active. Even just walking a bit too far can bring it on. It’s been… troublesome, to say the least. I do try to rest when it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cramping, heavy ache in the lower abdomen, sometimes radiating to your back, worse with activity. That’s helpful. And you mentioned it’s been troublesome – how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That is a good question. The pain itself… I suppose it's been a few months, at least. But the… condition that causes it, the one my previous doctor spoke of? That’s been with me for… well, quite some time. Perhaps ten years? Or more? It comes in waves, you see. Sometimes I feel quite well, and other times… this happens. It’s hard to pinpoint when the pain started specifically, because it feels like it’s always been a possibility. Does that make sense? I apologize for being so muddled.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Glymph. It sounds like you've been dealing with this for a while, and it's understandable that it's a bit difficult to separate the different parts. You mentioned a condition your previous doctor spoke of - do you recall anything about what that condition was called, or what they said it involved?
PATIENT: Hmm… It began with an “S,” I think. Something about the body attacking itself? And… joints, yes. It affected my joints quite a bit. And skin rashes sometimes. Oh, and fatigue! A great deal of fatigue. It wasn’t… Lupus, was it? Is that right? I seem to recall hearing that name. Yes, I believe it was Lupus. Systemic… something Lupus. But I’m terribly unsure. It was a long time ago, and the doctor spoke so many medical words. I just remember feeling very tired and achy, and the rashes were quite unpleasant. Does that… sound correct?
DOCTOR: That sounds very plausible, Ms. Glymph. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, or SLE, certainly fits with what you're describing – the joint pain, fatigue, and skin rashes. We’ll want to review your records to confirm, but it’s a good starting point. Now, to get a clearer picture of what's going on now, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing recently?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I am glad I remembered something useful. Well… let me see. Besides the pain and the fatigue, which are… constant companions, really… I have noticed a bit of swelling in my ankles, sometimes. Not terribly noticeable, but enough to make my shoes feel a bit tight. And my hands… they feel stiff in the mornings. It takes a while to get them moving. And… oh dear. I've been rather thirsty lately, too. Drinking more water than usual. I didn't think much of it, just assumed it was the weather. But perhaps it is connected? I do apologize for being so… scattered. I’m afraid my mind isn’t as sharp as it once was.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Glymph. You’re providing very helpful information. Swelling in the ankles, morning stiffness in your hands, and increased thirst – those are all things we need to consider. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides the possible Lupus?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. That was… quite some time ago now. And I’ve always had slightly high blood pressure, though it’s usually well-controlled with medication. Otherwise… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing significant, at least. Oh! I did have a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. And… I’ve had the usual vaccinations, of course. I try to stay up-to-date on those. But beyond that, I can't think of anything. I truly hope I'm not forgetting anything important. It is rather worrisome, relying on a memory like mine.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Glymph. Gallbladder removal, controlled high blood pressure, and a past episode of pneumonia. We’ll make a note of all of that. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see… For my blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, ten milligrams each morning. And I take a multivitamin daily, just to keep things balanced. Oh, and sometimes, when my joints are particularly achy, I’ll take Ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, of course. Two hundred milligrams, as needed. And… that is all, I believe. I try to avoid taking too many medications, if possible. I prefer a natural approach, whenever I can. But the blood pressure medication is necessary, and the Ibuprofen helps with the pain when it gets bad. I do hope I haven't forgotten anything. It's a constant worry, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily for blood pressure, a multivitamin, and Ibuprofen 200mg as needed for joint pain. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction, thankfully. I think I might be slightly sensitive to shellfish, but it’s more of a stomach upset than a true allergy. Nothing life-threatening. And… no, I don't recall any allergies to medications. I've taken a variety of medications over the years, and never had a problem. But it’s always best to be sure, isn't it? Perhaps I should ask my sister; she has a better memory than I do. She might remember something I’ve forgotten. But as far as I know, I have no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I do hope it won’t be too… unpleasant. My joints are rather sensitive at the moment, you see. But I understand it is necessary. Please, let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Glymph. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, Ms. Glymph. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, your heart rate is slightly fast, and I'm noting some tenderness in your lower abdomen and mild swelling and tenderness in your hands and ankles. I also observe some mild skin rash on your forearms. Do you notice this rash often?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I do. It comes and goes, you see. It’s usually more noticeable after I’ve been in the sun. It doesn’t itch terribly, but it’s… unsightly. I’ve always assumed it was just a sensitivity to the sunlight. I put sunscreen on, of course, but it doesn’t always prevent it. It's been happening for… well, as long as I can remember, really. Is that… significant, Doctor? Is it connected to the pain, perhaps? I do apologize for being so anxious. I tend to worry about these things.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, Ms. Glymph. The rash is certainly something to consider, and it could be related to your other symptoms. It’s consistent with Lupus, although other conditions can cause similar rashes. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’m suspecting Lupus, but we need further testing to confirm. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an antinuclear antibody test, and an anti-double-stranded DNA antibody test. We may also need to order some urine tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If that’s what’s necessary to find out what’s going on, then yes, please. Blood work and urine tests. I understand it’s all part of the process. I trust your judgment entirely. Please, let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare for the tests. And… how long will it take to get the results? I do hope it won’t be too long. I dislike being in limbo, you see. But I understand these things take time.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Glymph. We'll get these tests ordered right away. You don't need to do anything special to prepare for them – just drink plenty of water beforehand. The lab usually takes a few days to process the results, so we should have them back within a week. In the meantime, to help manage your pain, you can continue taking Ibuprofen as needed, but try not to exceed the recommended dosage. Also, try to avoid strenuous activity that aggravates your symptoms. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. Continue the Ibuprofen, avoid strenuous activity, and a follow-up appointment next week. I shall mark it on my calendar. Thank you for listening to me, Doctor. It’s… a relief to finally be taking some concrete steps to find out what’s going on. I do appreciate your patience and understanding. And… if I happen to think of anything else, anything at all, would it be alright to call the clinic? Or should I wait until our appointment?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I'm glad I could help. Please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you think of anything else, or if your symptoms worsen before our appointment. We're here to help in any way we can. I'll have the nurse schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all, for now. You’ve answered all of my questions, and I feel much more… at ease, knowing that we’re taking steps to find out what’s going on. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I truly appreciate it. Perhaps… perhaps we'll have some answers next week. That would be… a blessing.
