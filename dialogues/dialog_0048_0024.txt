DOCTOR: Right. Kiante Sayar, 33 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Sink. It’s… a bit of a strange one, really. I need a letter saying I’m able to fly. My travel insurance company needs it, but it’s been a bit of a hassle getting it sorted. They just need confirmation from a doctor, that’s all.
DOCTOR: A letter for travel insurance… Yes, well. It seems we’re increasingly becoming glorified note-writers. And what precisely are they concerned about that requires a doctor’s confirmation for air travel?
PATIENT: It's not so much a concern, Doctor. My husband… he passed away unexpectedly a few months ago. We had a trip planned, already paid for, and the insurance company is being very strict about refunds or transfers, needing this letter to cover everything. They didn’t explain it very well, just said a doctor’s note confirming I’m fit to travel is needed to process things. It's probably just a formality, really. I just want to get it done.
DOCTOR: I see. A bereavement trip… Right. Well, I suppose I can document that you are medically cleared for travel. But honestly, these insurance companies… demanding letters for everything. Still, I need to at least pretend to assess you. Have you been experiencing any… unusual symptoms lately?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing unusual. I’ve been… sad, of course. Grief does that. But physically, I feel fine. Perfectly normal, I think. No dizziness, no chest pains, no trouble breathing. I’ve been eating okay, sleeping… well, as well as can be expected. I really don’t think there’s anything medically wrong with me that would stop me from flying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any pre-existing conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I’ve always been very healthy. I don’t take any medications regularly, haven’t had any serious illnesses, and haven't been to the hospital in… well, years. Honestly, I think the biggest health risk I run is from stress, but I’ve been trying to manage that. Does that make sense? I just want to be clear I don't have anything that would stop me traveling.
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly clear. No medications, no prior illnesses, no hospitalizations… Well, that is convenient. Just to be thorough, let’s do a quick blood pressure check. And I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, just for the record. Please have a seat.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. No problem at all. I appreciate you being thorough, even if it seems unnecessary. It’s just one of those things I need to get done, you know?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 120 over 78. Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Right. Everything appears… normal. As you said. Do you have any allergies I should document?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, Doctor. Food, medication, pollen… nothing. I've always been lucky that way. So, is that enough for the letter? I really need to get this sorted before the insurance deadline.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. I suppose it is. I’ll draft a letter stating that you are medically cleared for air travel, with no known contraindications. It will be a fairly generic statement, as there’s nothing specific to document. Just so we're clear, this is not a comprehensive medical evaluation. It's simply a confirmation that you appear healthy enough to fly at this moment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I completely understand, Doctor. It’s just a confirmation, not a full check-up. That’s perfectly fine. Thank you so much for doing this. How long will it take to get the letter? And will it be emailed, or do I need to come back to pick it up?
DOCTOR: It’s done. Here you are. It will state that you are cleared for travel as of today’s date. As I said, it's a basic confirmation. The clinic policy is to charge a small administrative fee for these letters. That will be \$30, please. And I would advise you to consult with a therapist regarding your bereavement. Anything else?
PATIENT: Okay, perfect, thank you! Yes, this looks great. Thirty dollars is fine. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And… I appreciate the suggestion. I am seeing someone, actually. It’s… helpful. No, that’s all, thank you again for getting this done so quickly. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a… safe trip. .
