DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my back. It’s been painful. I’d like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you'd like to get to the bottom of this quickly. We'll do our best. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: It’s…sharp, mostly. And it feels like it goes all the way around. Not just in one spot. It started…let me think…about three weeks ago, I believe. I was working, putting up fence. It happened when I was lifting a post. A heavy one.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp pain all the way around your back, starting about three weeks ago while lifting a heavy fence post. That gives us a good starting point. When you say "all the way around," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: It’s…difficult to explain. It’s not just my upper back, or lower back. It feels like a band, going around my whole back. Like someone is squeezing it. And it hurts when I bend over, or twist. Even just sitting for too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, a band-like sensation around the whole back, worsened by bending, twisting, and prolonged sitting. That helps. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s not…constant. It’s better when I’m resting, mostly. But it flares up with any kind of movement, really. Even walking can bother it sometimes. It’s worse in the mornings, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, better with rest, worse with movement, and particularly worse in the mornings. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs or into your arms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not in my legs or arms. Just…my back. Thankfully. I've had enough trouble with this back, to be honest. Is it something serious? I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and wanting to get back to work is important. We’ll figure out what’s going on. To help me understand better, have you had any similar back pain episodes in the past?
PATIENT: Yes. Several times, over the years. Working this job…it takes a toll. I pulled something, I think, maybe ten years ago. And another time, about five years ago. It always seems to happen when I'm lifting. They usually just…went away on their own, with rest. This one feels different, though. More…constant. Even when I’m trying to rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of similar episodes related to lifting, but this one feels different – more constant, even at rest. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. Just…the pain. And a bit of stiffness, I suppose. It’s hard to bend over, like I said. It feels like something is…locked up. But no tingling, or weakness. I can walk, I can stand, I can…function. Just not comfortably.
DOCTOR: Alright, no numbness, tingling, or weakness. Stiffness and difficulty bending are present. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like arthritis, osteoporosis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Just my age, Doctor. And…Medicare. I don’t have any…fancy conditions. I take a vitamin D supplement, that's all. My mother had…trouble with her bones, when she got older, but I don’t know what it was. Nothing diagnosed for me, personally. I try to stay active, as much as my job allows.
DOCTOR: Okay, no diagnosed medical conditions, just a vitamin D supplement, and a family history of bone trouble in your mother. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t had any problems with medications before. I haven’t taken much, to be honest. Just…pain relievers, occasionally, when needed. Nothing regularly. I prefer to just rest it off, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just…would appreciate it if we could be quick about it. I have things to get back to. And…I’d like to know what you think it is, when you’re finished.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. I'll be as thorough and efficient as possible. First, I’m going to have you stand and I'll observe your posture and how you move. Then I’ll gently palpate your back to check for tenderness and muscle spasms. Finally, I’ll assess your range of motion. Please let me know immediately if anything causes you significant pain. Okay, I notice some tenderness in your lower back, particularly on the left side. There's some muscle spasm as well. Now, I'm going to ask you to bend forward, backward, and side to side. Again, stop if you experience any sharp pain. Okay, your range of motion is limited in both forward flexion and side bending. The movements are causing you some discomfort. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain – a muscle injury in your lower back. The lifting incident is consistent with this diagnosis. However, to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to get an X-ray of your lumbar spine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… Alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it’s better to be safe. How long will that take? And…will it show anything definite? I just…need to know what I’m dealing with. And if I can get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Reihner. An X-ray will help us rule out fractures or other structural problems. It’s a relatively quick process; it should take about 15-20 minutes, including the time to position you and take the images. It won’t necessarily show a muscle strain directly, as strains are soft tissue injuries, but it will help us exclude other causes of your pain. If the X-ray is clear, it strongly suggests a muscle strain is the most likely cause. I’ll order the X-ray now, and we can discuss a plan of action once we have the results. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding heavy lifting, bending, and twisting. You can use over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen to manage the pain. And applying ice or heat to your back can also provide some relief. While we're waiting for the X-ray results, is there anything else you'd like to discuss, or any questions you have?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything, for now. Just…the X-ray, and then a plan to get back to work. I appreciate you not keeping me waiting all day. I've got things to do. If you need anything from me, just let me know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you’re eager to get back to your routine. I will let you know as soon as the X-ray results are available. In the meantime, please follow the recommendations I gave you: rest, avoid heavy lifting, and use pain relievers as needed. A technician will be in shortly to take the X-ray. They will provide you with instructions on positioning. Do you have any questions for me before they arrive?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just…thank you. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. I’ll be waiting for the results. Let me know as soon as you have them. I'd rather not sit here any longer than I have to.
