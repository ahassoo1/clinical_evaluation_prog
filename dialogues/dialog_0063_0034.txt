DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Miss Bonck. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's... well, I just moved here. And, um, I guess I need to get, like, set up with a doctor? It’s kinda what my husband said to do. I don’t really… remember much about having a doctor before. I think I had one, back home, but… it’s fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, establishing care is sensible. Though frankly, at your age, most things resolve on their own. Still. Fuzzy recollections are…unhelpful. Are you experiencing any current health problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I feel okay. A little tired sometimes, but… that’s just from work, I think? I build stuff. Mechanical things. It’s… hard work. I don't feel sick, if that makes sense? Like, no cough, no pain… just… tired. And a bit forgetful, I guess. But I already told you that.
DOCTOR: Forgetful. Right. Well, tiredness and minor memory lapses are exceedingly common. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of? My husband doesn’t mention anything. He handles… most of that stuff. I think I’m pretty healthy, honestly. I eat okay, I try to get enough sleep… I just… work a lot. Is there a way to… check if I have something? Like, a test?
DOCTOR: A “test,” as you call it, is hardly a panacea. Very well. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Hmm… I… I don’t think so. Maybe when I was a baby? But I definitely don’t remember it. My husband might know, but… he’s at work right now. He’s really good with dates and stuff. I'm terrible with those. I think I broke my arm once, when I was little, but that was a long time ago. Was that a hospital?
DOCTOR: A fractured limb, potentially requiring hospitalization... noted. And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, I don’t think so. Definitely not. I mean… I haven’t had anyone cut me open. I don’t think. I'd remember that, right? Unless… maybe I was really little? Oh, this is hard. I really wish my husband was here. He remembers everything.
DOCTOR: We are attempting to establish a baseline, Miss Bonck, not reconstruct your entire life history. Let us move on. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… oh. Um… my mom passed away a long time ago. And I don’t really talk to my dad. He lives… far away. And I don’t have any siblings. My husband’s family is really big, but… I don't know much about their health stuff. They don’t really talk about it. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: Family history can be pertinent. Still. Very well. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. I eat lots of different things. Shellfish, nuts… sometimes I get a little itchy, but I always thought that was just from… being outside. We have a lot of plants where I'm from. I don’t carry an EpiPen or anything.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I drink tea when I'm sick, and that usually helps. My husband tries to get me to take vitamins, but I always forget. He leaves them on the counter, and then… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Very well. Now, let's conduct a brief physical examination. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. A check-up. That's good. Is it going to be… painful?
DOCTOR: No, it will not be “painful.” Simply a routine assessment. Your weight is 82 kilograms. Your height, according to the intake form, is 150 centimeters. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Heart sounds are… within normal limits, though slightly rapid. Blood pressure is elevated, 138/88. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Lungs are clear to auscultation.
PATIENT: Okay. Um… is everything okay? My blood pressure being high sounds… bad. Should I be worried? Is that from being nervous, maybe? Or from work? I do a lot of heavy lifting.
DOCTOR: Slightly elevated. It is not alarming, but warrants attention. It could be a number of factors – stress, physical exertion… or simply a temporary fluctuation. We will repeat it later. Do you smoke, or consume alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. I don't smoke, ever. And I don’t drink. My husband likes a little beer sometimes, but I don’t touch it. Makes me feel… funny. And I need a clear head for work, you know? Building things is important.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your…vague history and current elevated blood pressure, I recommend a basic blood panel to assess your overall health. It will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid profile. And a urinalysis. This will give us a baseline to work with. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Um… a blood panel? That sounds… scary. What will you be looking for? And how much blood will you take? I get… faint sometimes. And what’s a lipid profile? Is that something bad? This is a lot.
DOCTOR: It is a standard procedure, Miss Bonck. We will take a small amount of blood – a few vials. The lipid profile assesses your cholesterol levels. It is not necessarily “bad,” simply informative. It helps us determine your risk for cardiovascular disease. As for fainting, we will have you lie down during the procedure. Do you consent to the blood work?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Cholesterol. I think my husband mentioned that once. If it helps… yes. Yes, okay, I consent. But… could you maybe just take a little bit? And make sure I lie down? I really don’t like needles. And… maybe tell me when you’re going to do it? So I can… prepare?
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will come to draw your blood shortly. She will explain the procedure in detail. I will review the results when they are available. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your water intake and attempting to reduce stress. And, Miss Bonck, try to recall any specific details about your medical history. It would be… helpful. That will be all for today.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… try to remember things. And I’ll drink more water.
