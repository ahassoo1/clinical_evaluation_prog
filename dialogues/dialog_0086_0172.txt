DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it’s just… a formality, really. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see, and he’s very particular about these things. Social visit, he called it. Medicare requires it, I believe. Honestly, I’m perfectly fine. Just trying to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Right. A formality. Well, even formalities require a bit of information, Candice. It’s… standard procedure. For the record, though, is there anything at all bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Heavens, no. I’m a perfectly healthy woman for my age, you know. Always have been. A bit of… stiffness in the mornings, perhaps. But who doesn't have that? It’s the weather, I suspect. Terribly humid lately. And honestly, Doctor, I don't have time to list every little ache. Is there a form I need to fill out? Let’s just get this done quickly, shall we?
DOCTOR: Humidity, yes… A common complaint. Still, we need to establish a baseline, Candice. It’s… prudent. Before we dismiss everything as 'humidity,' let's just run through a few questions. It won't take long, I assure you. Have you noticed any pain besides the morning stiffness?
PATIENT: Pain? Goodness, no. Not really. Well… my bunions have been acting up lately, but that’s hardly something a doctor needs to worry about. It’s shoes, you see. Dreadful things. Always too tight. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. Is this going to take much longer? My husband is expecting me for tea.
DOCTOR: Bunions. Right. And no pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you fishing for something? I told you, I’m fine. Perhaps a little tired, but who isn't? Old age, you know. It comes with the territory. I truly don't understand why I'm here. Is there a fee for this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: “Interrogation” is a rather strong word, Candice. We simply need to rule things out. It’s… responsibility. Have you had any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Oh, honestly. My husband is an excellent cook. I eat perfectly well. Steak, usually. Or fish. Though, the quality these days is just dreadful. Honestly, I don't need to discuss my diet with you. It’s perfectly adequate. Are we quite finished yet? I do have things to attend to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Let's move on. Any trouble with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Well, I do wake up rather early. My husband is an early riser, you see. Always puttering about. It’s a bit distracting, but one gets used to it. Honestly, I wouldn't say I have trouble sleeping. Just… not as long as I used to. Is that what you're asking? Because really, Doctor, what is the point of all these questions?
DOCTOR: Candice, with all due respect, you're being… less than forthcoming. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Excuse me? I find that question quite… impertinent. Honestly, Doctor, I did not come here to discuss such… personal matters. This is highly unprofessional. I think I’d like to speak to your supervisor. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ve wasted enough of my time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. If you insist. However, for the record, I do recommend a follow-up appointment to discuss these concerns properly. Perhaps with a different physician, if you prefer. I’ll have the receptionist schedule something for you.&#x20;
