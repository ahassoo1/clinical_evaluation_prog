DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Hainley. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Soodeen. Nice to meet you too. Um, it’s this bruising. I’ve been getting bruises really easily lately, and it’s…well, it’s a bit much, you know? I'm on a blood thinner, so I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bruising easily, especially while on a blood thinner, is certainly something we should investigate. To start, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started, oh, maybe a month ago? It wasn't a big deal at first, just a little bump here or there, like I always get. But the last couple of weeks, it’s been… different. Bigger bruises, and they seem to pop up with nothing much happening. I don’t even remember how I got some of them. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A noticeable change is important. And you mentioned being on a blood thinner – do you know the name of the medication and the dosage you're taking?
PATIENT: Yep, it’s Warfarin. And… let me see… the little card says 5 milligrams every evening. I’ve been on it for, oh gosh, almost three years now. Something about my heart, I think. I usually get my refills at the same pharmacy, so they keep track of it all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin 5 milligrams daily for three years. Good, that’s helpful. Now, besides the increased bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Not really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? And maybe a few more headaches. But nothing major, nothing I'd normally run to the doctor about. Just the bruises, mostly. They’re just… concerning.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Fatigue and headaches can sometimes be related, so it’s good you mentioned them. Let's do a quick review of your medical history. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Well, I had my appendix out when I was a kid, that was a long time ago. And… oh, about five years back, they put a stent in for a blocked artery. That’s probably the biggest thing. Aside from that, just the usual aches and pains, you know? Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of bleeding disorders or easy bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. My grandmother, on my mom’s side, she used to bruise really easily. Everyone always joked she was made of glass! But I don’t think it was ever properly diagnosed or anything. Just… family lore, you know? As for anyone else, not that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your current medications, aside from the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a vitamin D supplement, just because it's winter and I don't get much sun. And sometimes, if my back's acting up, I take ibuprofen. But that's it, really. Nothing else on a regular basis. Oh! And I use a medicated cream for my eczema, but that's topical, so it doesn’t go in my body.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I can eat anything, take any medicine… never had a problem with that. I'm pretty lucky, actually. It's just… this bruising thing is new and a little scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Um… okay. I’m single, never married. I live alone, work full-time as an information security analyst. I don't really drink, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a blue moon. And I don't smoke. Does that cover it? I'm not a big partier or anything. Just… a pretty quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to assess the bruising and look for any other potential signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'd like to take a look at the areas where you've been bruising. Could you please point out the most recent bruises for me?
PATIENT: Sure. Um… okay. My arm, here, I bumped it against the doorframe a few days ago, and it turned purple really fast. And… here on my leg, I honestly don't remember how I got this one. It just showed up. And there's a little one starting on my hip, I noticed it this morning.
DOCTOR: Okay. The bruising does appear more extensive than expected for minor trauma, and the color suggests they're at different stages of healing. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72, both within normal limits. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam just to get a baseline. Your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear, and neurological exam is normal. Given your history of Warfarin use, and the extent of bruising, I think it’s important to run some blood tests. I’d like to check your INR level to see how well your blood is clotting, as well as a complete blood count to rule out any other underlying issues. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… smart. I mean, if it's something with the Warfarin, I want to know. And if it's something else, I want to know that too. Blood tests are fine. Whatever you think is best, Doc. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Great. I'll write an order for the lab tests. The phlebotomist will come in shortly to draw your blood. It’s just a routine blood draw, but let them know if you're afraid of needles or have had issues with blood draws in the past. While we wait for the results, it’s important to avoid any activities that could cause injury. Do you have any plans for strenuous activity in the next few days?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s pretty quiet usually. I was planning on just relaxing this weekend, maybe watch some movies. No hiking or anything crazy. So avoiding injury shouldn’t be a problem. I’m usually pretty careful, to be honest. Hopefully it's just a simple fix with the medicine.
DOCTOR: Good. And just to be safe, I’m going to order a basic metabolic panel while we’re at it. It will give us a broader picture of your overall health. It should only take a few hours to get the results back. We'll review them together then. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual bleeding, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your stool or urine, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, I understand. Unusual bleeding, go to the ER. Got it. Those are all things I haven't experienced, but I'll definitely watch out for them. So… just wait for the results, and try not to bump into anything? This is a little stressful.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Just wait for the results and avoid injury. I understand it’s stressful, but we’re being proactive, and getting the information we need to determine the cause of the bruising. It could be something simple, or something that requires further investigation, but we'll address it accordingly. Do you have any questions for me before we wait for the lab results?
PATIENT: Um… not really, I guess. You've explained everything pretty well. I mean, I'm a little worried, obviously, but I trust your judgment. I'm just hoping it's not something serious. Is there anything I should be doing right now, besides not hitting things? Like, should I change my diet or anything?
DOCTOR: That's a fair question. At this point, there's no need to make any dietary changes. We need to see the lab results first. Vitamin K, found in leafy green vegetables, can affect Warfarin levels, but altering your diet without knowing your INR could be more harmful than helpful. Let’s focus on getting the results back and then we’ll discuss a plan tailored to your specific needs. I'll also print out a sheet with warning signs of bleeding for you to keep at home. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… perfect. No messing with my diet yet. Good. And the sheet sounds helpful, just to have it. Okay. So… just sit tight and wait for the lab person, then you'll call me with the results? Thanks, Doc. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It helps a lot.
DOCTOR: Exactly. I’ll have the lab person come in as soon as they’re available. And you're very welcome. It’s my job to ensure you understand everything that’s going on and to provide the best possible care. Please don’t hesitate to let me or the nursing staff know if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, I'll go ahead and let the lab know to expect you.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. I'll just sit here and try not to think about bumping into anything.
