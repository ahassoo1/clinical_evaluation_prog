DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I’m Dr. Yackey. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Please, tell me what brings you in. And try to be concise; my schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Schneer, yes, that’s me. Well, it’s my ears, you see. Things ain’t as clear as they used to be. Can’t hear folks talkin’ like I used to, and the television… well, forget about it. It’s just… faded, I suppose. I don't rightly know when it started, to be honest. Just happened little by little.
DOCTOR: “Little by little,” you say. Hmm. And how long has this “little by little” been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe a year? Two? I get my years mixed up sometimes, you know. It’s not like it happened overnight, that’s for sure. More like… slowly creepin’ in. I don't keep track of dates too well. I mostly just know it’s August, 'cause the garden’s doin’ well. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Vague recollection… noted. Alright. And has this hearing loss affected your daily life in any specific ways beyond difficulty with conversation and television?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, it has. It's mostly... well, I used to enjoy the birds singin’ in the mornin’. Now, I barely hear 'em. And when I'm at the store, I sometimes get confused when folks are talkin' to me. I don’t always understand what they’re askin’. Makes me feel a bit foolish, if I'm bein' honest. It's not a big deal, I suppose, but it gets… lonely sometimes. Not hearin’ things clearly.
DOCTOR: I see. Loneliness is… unfortunate. Let's proceed with a brief examination. Please sit facing away from me. I'm going to use an otoscope to look in your ears. Just relax. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. Facing away, you say? Just let me… …like this? I hope I don’t make a mess of things. My balance ain’t what it used to be either, you know. Just take your time. I'm not in a rush.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There appears to be cerumen impaction in both ears. It’s quite significant, actually. This is likely contributing to your hearing difficulties. The tympanic membranes themselves appear intact, but visualization is limited due to the wax. It's not uncommon at your age, Mr. Schneer, but it needs to be addressed.
PATIENT: Cerumen… what now? Wax, you say? Oh. Well, that makes sense, I suppose. I don't do much ear cleanin’ myself. Always thought it was best to leave it alone. Didn’t want to poke around in there and cause trouble. So, the wax is makin’ it hard to hear? Can you… get it out? Is that somethin’ you can do? I just want to be clear, I don't like things poked at, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schneer, cerumen is earwax. And yes, we can remove it. There are several methods. We can attempt manual irrigation, or I can use a specialized suction device. Both are relatively straightforward. As for "poking around," it's done with instruments designed for this purpose, and by someone trained to do it. We are not using just anything. The irrigation is generally gentler, though. Would you prefer to start with that?
PATIENT: Irrigation sounds… better. Gentler is good. I don’t like the sound of suction, no sir. Reminds me of… well, never mind. Irrigation it is, then. Will it hurt? I’m a bit of a worrywart, you see. And how long does it take? I got a roast in the oven, and I don't want to burn it. Not a fancy roast, mind you, just a simple one, but still.
DOCTOR: It should not be painful, Mr. Schneer. You may experience a slight sensation of fullness or pressure, but it’s generally well-tolerated. We’ll use body-temperature water, and I will explain each step. As for time… it shouldn’t take more than fifteen to twenty minutes, assuming it’s not excessively impacted. We’ll need to assess after the initial irrigation to determine if further treatment is necessary. If you’ll just recline back in this chair… we’ll get started.
PATIENT: Alright. Fifteen to twenty minutes, you say? That should be alright. I think the roast can handle that. Go slow now, Doctor. And tell me what you're doin', just so I know. I don't like surprises. And if it starts to hurt, please stop. I'm not ashamed to say it.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schneer. I’m using a bulb syringe with body-temperature water. I will gently introduce the water into your ear canal to loosen and flush out the wax. I will stop immediately if you experience any discomfort. We will start slowly, and I will continually check for any adverse reaction. How does that feel, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a bit… cool. And… weird. Not painful, exactly, but… strange. Like somethin' is swimmin' in there. Is that normal? And it feels a little bit… echoey? Like I'm underwater, a little bit. It's not too bad, but… just a bit unsettling, you know? Can you… maybe go a little slower? Or… less water? I don't want to drown in there.
DOCTOR: Yes, that sensation is normal, Mr. Schneer. The water is entering the ear canal, and it can create a temporary feeling of fullness and echo. I will reduce the amount of water used, and proceed more slowly. We are not attempting to drown you. How is that now?
PATIENT: That's… better. Much better. Still a little strange, but not… scary. It feels like somethin’ is movin’ around in there, but not painful. I can feel a little bit of… a tickle, maybe? And I think… I think I can hear a little bit clearer already. Just a little, mind you, but… somethin’ is happenin’. Thank you, Doctor. You're bein' very gentle. Is it almost done?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Let’s take a look. Hmm. There is still some cerumen remaining, but significantly less than before. Your tympanic membrane is now visualized, and appears normal. Your hearing should have improved, but it may not be fully restored until all the wax is removed. We can repeat the irrigation one more time, or we can schedule a follow-up appointment with an audiologist for a more thorough cleaning and hearing assessment. I recommend the audiologist, frankly. They have specialized equipment. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: An audiologist, you say? That sounds… fancy. And probably expensive. I'm on a fixed income, you see. I don’t want to cause too much trouble. Would one more try be alright? If it's not too much trouble for you, Doctor. And if it doesn't work, I understand if we have to stop. I don’t want to be a bother. Just… one more try? If you think it's safe.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schneer. One more attempt it is. But please understand, if it remains significantly impacted after this, I strongly recommend seeing an audiologist. They have the tools and expertise to address this safely and effectively. How does that feel now?
PATIENT: Oh… that was a bit… more. Like a little pop, maybe? And… …yes! I can hear you clearer! Much clearer! It’s not perfect, mind you, but… I can hear the television, I think. And… and I think I can hear the birds singin’ a little bit. That’s… wonderful, Doctor. Truly wonderful. Thank you. I think… I think that might be enough. I don’t want to push my luck.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, the tympanic membrane is now fully visualized, and the ear canal appears significantly clearer. Your hearing should continue to improve as any remaining wax gradually dissolves. Alright, Mr. Schneer. We’ve successfully removed the bulk of the cerumen impaction. I will document these findings. I recommend avoiding the use of cotton swabs in your ears, as they can further impact the wax. And if you experience any pain, discharge, or worsening hearing loss, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve answered everything. No cotton swabs, I remember. And I will contact you if somethin' goes wrong. I… I just want to thank you again. You were very patient with me. And gentle. I was a bit worried, you know, but you made me feel comfortable. Thank you. I think I can finally hear the birds singin’ again. And that’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was my pleasure. Please, take care. And enjoy the birdsong. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for a routine check in six months. Have a good day.
