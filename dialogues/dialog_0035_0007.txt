DOCTOR: Good morning, Lakiya. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… painful. That is why I am here. I would like to be quick, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I understand wanting to be quick. “Painful” is a little broad, though. Could you tell me more about where it’s painful, and what that pain feels like?
PATIENT: It is… in my back. Lower back, mostly. Feels like… old wood breaking, maybe? When I move certain ways. Or… when I lift things. It is not a sharp pain, more like… a grinding. It makes it hard to work. I erect fences, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, feeling like “old wood breaking” – a grinding sensation, worse with movement and lifting. That sounds… unpleasant. And it’s affecting your work, which is important. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: About… three months now. Started small, I thought it would go away. I kept working, but it just got worse. It is worse now than it has ever been. I am worried it will stop me from being able to work at all.
DOCTOR: Three months… and progressively worsening. That’s good to know. Have you tried anything to manage the pain so far?
PATIENT: Yes. I tried… heat packs. And I took some things my neighbor gave me. White pills, I think. They did not help much. They made me sleepy, mostly. I stopped taking them. I do not like taking things unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, heat packs, and some pills from a neighbor… I understand your reluctance to take medication if you don't need to. Do you know what the pills were?
PATIENT: No, I do not. She just said they were for pain. I do not know her very well. I should not have taken them, I suppose. But the pain was… bad. I just wanted it to stop. I do not remember the name of them, or what they looked like exactly. They were small and white.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good you stopped taking them. It’s always best to know exactly what you're putting into your body. Now, let's talk a little bit more about the pain itself. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say your pain is right now?
PATIENT: Right now? … Maybe a six. It is not constant. It comes and goes. But when I try to bend over… it goes to an eight, maybe even a nine. It is… difficult to explain. It is not just a pain. It feels… wrong.
DOCTOR: A six, spiking to eight or nine with bending… and that feeling of it being “wrong” – I understand. It's good you're able to describe it, even if it's hard. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Down my left leg, mostly. Not all the way to my foot, but… to my knee. It feels like a… tightness. Like a cord pulling. It happens when I have been working all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness radiating down the left leg to the knee… That gives me a better picture. And you said you erect fences for work. Does that involve a lot of twisting, lifting, or repetitive bending?
PATIENT: Yes. All of those things. Lifting posts, stretching wire… bending over to set the posts. It is hard work. I have been doing it for… many years. It used to not bother me so much. I am getting old, I suppose. But I need to work. I have no other way to support myself.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’ve been doing physically demanding work for a long time, and this is affecting your livelihood. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That is alright. The quicker we can find out what is wrong, the quicker I can get back to work. I just… please be quick.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as efficient as possible. If anything feels uncomfortable during the exam, please let me know immediately. First, let's have you lie down on your back on the examination table. Okay, now I'm just going to gently feel along your spine to check for tenderness or muscle spasms. Please try to relax. Okay, I’m feeling some muscle spasm on the left side of your lower back. And there is some tenderness when I press here. Now, could you slowly bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: It hurts. I cannot go very far. It feels like something is… stuck. Like a knot. It is worse when I bend. I can feel it pulling on my left side. It is not… good.
DOCTOR: Okay, stop there. That's enough. I can see you’re in discomfort. Now, let's try straightening your leg out while I gently raise it. Does that cause any pain to radiate down your leg?
PATIENT: Yes. It hurts. Down my left leg, like you said. Not as bad as bending, but… a sharp pain. It is… pulling. Like a wire being stretched. It feels… wrong. I do not like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That's good information. Now, let’s have you sit up, if you can. I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength seems to be good on both sides. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain, possibly with some nerve irritation. The pain radiating down your leg suggests that the irritation is affecting the sciatic nerve. However, to rule out other possible causes, such as a disc issue, I would like to order an x-ray of your lower back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An x-ray… yes, alright. If that is what you think is best. I just want to get this fixed. Can I go back to work after the x-ray? Or will I have to… rest? I do not have insurance money to be spending on this. Medicare… is that enough?
DOCTOR: Medicare should be sufficient, yes. We will verify that with the billing department. As for going back to work, that depends on the results of the x-ray and how you’re feeling. I don't want you to push yourself and make things worse. For now, I recommend avoiding heavy lifting, twisting, and prolonged bending until we know more. We can discuss potential modifications to your work if needed. I will have the nurse draw up an order for the x-ray. It should be quick and easy, and we will get the results back relatively fast. Would you like me to call in a prescription for a mild pain reliever in the meantime?
PATIENT: A pain reliever… yes, please. Something that will not make me too sleepy. I need to be able to think. And thank you. You are very helpful. I just want to get back to work. It is… important. It is all I have. Do I need to go somewhere else for the x-ray? Or can I do it here?
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. I understand. This is a prescription for ibuprofen, which is generally well-tolerated and shouldn't make you overly sleepy. It's important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. And you can get the x-ray done right here in the clinic, thankfully. The nurse will give you instructions on where to go after this. I will review the results as soon as they come in and call you to discuss them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I do not think so. Just… thank you. I hope it is nothing too serious. I need to work. I have to. I will follow your instructions. Can I just… go now? I need to get home and rest, like you said.
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: Of course. I understand. We’ll get this figured out. Here’s the prescription, and the nurse will be right with you to give you instructions for the x-ray. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest, Lakiya. We'll be in touch. .
