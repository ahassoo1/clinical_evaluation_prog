DOCTOR: Good morning, Lucia. Welcome. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, I keep… belching. It’s a lot. It’s been happening for, I think, maybe a week now? It’s just… a lot of air, you know? It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lot of belching for about a week. I understand that can be quite bothersome, and even embarrassing. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? It doesn’t seem to be just after I eat, not always. Sometimes it’s just… random. Like, I could be walking, or sitting, or… just doing anything. But I think maybe it’s worse after I drink something fizzy? Like soda. I like soda sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So it's not consistently related to eating, but seems to be aggravated by carbonated drinks. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the belching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really. My stomach sometimes feels a little… full, even when I haven't eaten much. But not always. And maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but I get that sometimes anyway. I don’t know if that’s related. It’s not bad heartburn, just… a little burning. Nothing I usually worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some occasional fullness and mild heartburn alongside the belching. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat about the same as usual, I think. Maybe a little less when my stomach feels full, but I still feel hungry. I like to cook, so I usually eat. I make a lot of Cuban food… it’s good. But yeah, no big changes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was a little girl. But nothing… serious. I don't really go to the doctor much. I try to stay healthy. I walk a lot, and like I said, I cook good food. Mostly healthy food, anyway. Sometimes I have a treat.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical diagnoses and a history of a broken arm as a child. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Nothing like that. Just the broken arm, and they put it in a cast. That’s it. I’m a little scared of hospitals, to be honest. That’s why I don’t go often.
DOCTOR: I understand that completely, Lucia. Many people feel that way about hospitals. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions, like frequent heartburn, stomach problems, or anything else that runs in the family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had a lot of… stomach trouble. She always complained about it. And my uncle, he has… I think it’s diabetes. But other than that, I don’t really know. We don’t talk about health much. It’s… not really a thing in my family, you know? We talk about other things. Food, mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any medications. Nothing at all. I try to stay away from them if I can. I prefer to just… deal with things myself, if possible. I drink a lot of water, and I try to eat healthy, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Do you have any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat lots of different foods… Cuban food has a lot of spices! I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But I’m not one hundred percent sure, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your stomach and checking for any tenderness. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s fine. That sounds okay. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have to get back to work later. But yeah, you can listen to my stomach. I just… I don’t like doctors very much.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll keep it quick and as comfortable as possible. If you could sit up there for me, that would be great. Okay, I’m listening now. I do hear some increased bowel sounds… a little more active than I’d expect. And no obvious signs of pain when I gently press on your abdomen. A little tenderness in the upper stomach, but nothing alarming. Based on what you've told me and this quick exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some functional indigestion, possibly exacerbated by the carbonated beverages. It’s quite common, and often related to how quickly you eat or drink, and what you’re consuming. It's not usually serious.
PATIENT: Functional indigestion… that sounds… complicated. Is that bad? I just want to stop belching! And I like my soda. So… what does that mean? Do I have to stop drinking soda?
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound as scary as it sounds, Lucia. "Functional" just means there isn't an obvious underlying cause like an ulcer or infection. It’s more about how your digestive system is working. And you don’t necessarily have to stop drinking soda completely! But we could try reducing your intake and see if that helps. Drinking it slowly, and not on an empty stomach, could also make a difference. We can also discuss some dietary changes and over-the-counter medications that might help with the bloating and belching. Would you like to talk about those options?
PATIENT: Okay… reducing it, not stopping. That’s good. And what kind of dietary changes? Do I have to eat… special food? I like to cook, but I don’t want to have to learn a whole new menu. And what kind of medications? I don't really like taking pills.
DOCTOR: No, definitely no whole new menu! Some simple changes can make a big difference. Try to avoid very fatty or greasy foods, as those can slow down digestion. Eating smaller, more frequent meals instead of large ones can also help. And chewing your food thoroughly is really important – it gives your stomach less work to do. As for medications, there are some over-the-counter options like simethicone, which helps with gas, or antacids if you get heartburn. We could start with those and see if they provide some relief. If those don’t work, we can explore other possibilities, but let’s try the simpler things first. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… doable. Smaller meals, chew my food… I can try that. And I’ll try the simethicone thing. Where do I find that? At the pharmacy? I think I can manage that. It’s just… embarrassing, you know? Belching all the time.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can find simethicone at any pharmacy, usually right near the antacids. It's completely understandable that it's embarrassing, Lucia. Many people experience similar issues, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. So, let’s start with reducing your soda intake, eating smaller meals, chewing your food thoroughly, and trying the simethicone. Give that a try for a week or two, and if you’re not seeing any improvement, or if your symptoms get worse, please come back and see me. We can then discuss further options, perhaps including a referral to a gastroenterologist, just to rule out anything else. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A week or two, and see what happens. And if it doesn’t get better, I’ll come back. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better now, just knowing what it might be.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lucia. I'm glad I could help. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And don’t hesitate to come back if you have any questions or concerns. Here's a little handout with some information about functional indigestion and dietary tips. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lucia. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and please take care. .
