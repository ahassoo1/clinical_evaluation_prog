DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. It’s… well, it’s a bit hard to explain, exactly. I’m hoping you can help. I feel like I just need a… a reset, if that makes any sense. Like a jumpstart to get things going again. I’ve been feeling… not bad, precisely, just… sluggish, I suppose. And not as… vibrant as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Sluggish, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s difficult to describe. It’s not a pain, or a sickness. More like… everything feels a little… muted? Like the volume has been turned down on life, perhaps. And my energy… it’s just not what it used to be. I used to be very active, you see. I work with my hands a lot, shaping things, and that requires… well, it required a lot of stamina. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Shaping things… what exactly do you do with your hands, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Oh! Forgive me, I should have been more specific. I’m a… a molder and shaper. Mostly ceramics, though I do work with other clays sometimes. I create… decorative pieces, mostly. And some functional things – bowls, vases, that sort of thing. It's quite physical, you see, working the clay, the kiln… it takes a lot out of you. I’ve been doing it for… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Right. Ceramics. And you say this has been going on for… how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It hasn’t been sudden, you understand. It’s been… gradual. Perhaps the last six months, I would say. Though it’s hard to pinpoint. I just noticed, slowly, that things were becoming… more effortful. Less enjoyable. It’s not debilitating, Doctor, I can still do my work, but… I don’t have the same… spring in my step, you might say. And I find myself needing more rest afterwards.
DOCTOR: Six months. And you've noticed increased fatigue… anything else?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my sleep hasn't been the best. Not that I can't fall asleep, exactly. It's more… restless. I wake up a few times during the night. And I haven’t been… as hungry as usual. It's not a loss of appetite, just… less interest in food, I suppose. Nothing drastic, though. And… sometimes I feel a little… forgetful. Little things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, or a name I should remember. But nothing alarming.
DOCTOR: Restless sleep, decreased appetite, some forgetfulness… Alright. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I have Medicare, so I see my doctor regularly for check-ups, but they haven’t mentioned anything significant. I've never been diagnosed with anything, not ever. I’m a fairly healthy person, generally. I mean, apart from this… sluggishness, of course. My husband, Ricardo, worries a bit, but I tell him it’s just getting older. He’s always fussing.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any surgeries. I’ve been very fortunate, in that regard. Just the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing serious. Ricardo… my husband, he had his appendix out years ago, but that’s about it. We’ve both been quite lucky, all things considered. I’m not one for doctors, if I can avoid it, you see. So, I tend to put things off. But this… this is starting to bother me. It’s affecting my work, and I enjoy my work very much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I haven’t taken many medications in my life, honestly. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, and nothing stronger than ibuprofen, I think. Ricardo takes something for his blood pressure, but I don’t know the name. I suppose if there were an allergy, I would know by now. I’m usually quite careful. And I always read the labels, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I suppose you'll want to listen to my heart and lungs? And check my… reflexes? I haven't had a proper check-up in… well, it's been a while. I apologize for that.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 130/80. Not terrible. Now, heart sounds. Regular rate and rhythm. A slight murmur, but likely insignificant given your age. Lungs clear. Now, reflexes. 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Your weight is 115 pounds, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct, Doctor. 115. I… I haven’t gained or lost any weight recently, not that I’ve noticed. I tend to stay around that weight. I’m quite tall, you see – almost six feet. So, I’m fairly… slender. Perhaps that explains the murmur? Being tall, I mean. I’ve always been… long-limbed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it could be a number of things. However, given your age and weight… and the reported fatigue… we need to rule out a few possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. And, just to be thorough, a basic metabolic panel. It’s probably nothing serious, but we need to have a baseline. I also recommend a urine analysis. The lab is just down the hall. You can go whenever you’re ready.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work, urine analysis… yes, I understand. I appreciate you being thorough. I… I just want to feel like myself again, you see. I suppose I should go to the lab then. Are there any specific instructions I should follow? Should I fast beforehand? Or… Is there anything else I need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. No food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. And try to be as relaxed as possible when they take the samples. The results should be back in a few days. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment. Try not to worry too much. It’s likely just a vitamin deficiency or something minor. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just… thank you. For your time, and your attention. I will fast, and I will go to the lab. And I will wait for the nurse to call. Hopefully, it is just a vitamin deficiency. Thank you again. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Next. .
