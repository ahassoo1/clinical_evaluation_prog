DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have time for pleasantries. It’s my stomach. It’s been… awful. And nothing the other doctor gave me is doing a thing. I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. It’s never fun dealing with persistent stomach issues, and it sounds like you’ve already been trying to get it sorted. Let’s focus on getting this figured out. When you say “awful,” could you describe exactly what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well, what do you want to know? It's diarrhea. Constant diarrhea. I’ve been running to the bathroom all week. It’s not…normal. And it’s weak, watery…look, I don't need to go into details with you, okay? It’s embarrassing enough as it is. I’ve tried everything over the counter, and like I said, the pills that other doctor gave me didn’t help. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good start. I appreciate you telling me. Constant diarrhea for a week is definitely concerning, and we need to figure out what’s going on. I completely understand your discomfort talking about this, and I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Just to be thorough, when did this start exactly?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t remember the exact date. Sometime last week, probably around…Tuesday? Maybe Wednesday. It all kind of blends together when you’re stuck inside. It started mild, and then just…got worse and worse. It's not like I'm charting this, you know? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. “Around Tuesday or Wednesday” is helpful. And it progressively worsened, you said. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Look, I haven’t been keeping a log, okay? I eat normal food. Sometimes I skip a meal if I’m busy painting, but that's it. It doesn’t seem to matter what I eat, it just…happens. I’ve stopped drinking coffee, just in case, but that hasn’t made a difference either. Honestly, I'm starting to think it's just one of those things. Maybe I just need to ride it out. But my energy is gone, and I can’t keep missing work.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. It sounds incredibly disruptive. And you're right, trying to pinpoint a specific trigger when it's happening regardless of diet is challenging. Let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain, yes. Cramps, mostly. Not constant, but they come and go, and they’re pretty bad when they hit. No fever, thankfully. And no vomiting, just…everything else. I’ve been so dehydrated, though. I’m constantly thirsty. Look, I'm a painter, not a doctor. I don’t know all the fancy terms. Is that enough for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Cramps and dehydration are important to note. No fever or vomiting is good. Now, have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Really? You have to ask that? Look, I’m not going to… no. No blood. And no, I’m not inspecting my… stool. It’s just…diarrhea, okay? And I’m trying to get this over with so I can get back to work. I'm losing money every day I'm stuck inside. Do I need to go into graphic detail with you?
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question was unpleasant, Ms. Woodring. It’s a standard part of evaluating diarrhea, and I certainly don’t want to cause any discomfort. And I understand your frustration with needing to be away from work. Let's move on. Have you traveled anywhere recently – even within the country – or been exposed to anyone else who's been sick?
PATIENT: Travel? No. I haven't left the city in months. And no, I haven’t been around anyone sick. I mostly keep to myself, especially now. It's just me, my work, and… this. Honestly, I think I just picked something up. It probably goes around. Everyone gets sick sometimes, right? I don’t need a full investigation, I just need something to make it stop.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Okay, and just to cover all bases, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Like I said, I tried some over-the-counter stuff for the diarrhea, but it didn’t do anything. Otherwise, no. I don’t take anything regularly. I try to stay healthy. I eat okay, I get enough sleep when I can… Look, I'm not a complicated case. I just have a bad stomach. Can we just skip to the part where you give me something that will actually help?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I understand your frustration and desire for a quick solution. Before we jump to a prescription, I’d like to do a quick physical examination. Just a listen to your abdomen and check for dehydration. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have work to do. And please don't make me talk about my… personal life. This is a professional visit, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Woodring. This is a professional visit, and I'll keep it concise. Okay. Your abdomen is tender to the touch, which isn’t surprising given your symptoms. I’m also noticing some decreased bowel sounds. You do appear slightly dehydrated, but not critically so. I'd like to order a stool sample to check for any bacterial or parasitic infections. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? I have to take a… a sample? Look, I'm a painter, not a lab technician. I don't even know where I’d start. Can't you just give me something strong and be done with it? I don’t have time for tests. I have deadlines. This is ridiculous. Can I get a second opinion?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Woodring. However, prescribing medication without knowing the cause of your diarrhea isn't ideal. It could mask the underlying problem, or even worsen it if it’s caused by a bacterial infection. The stool sample is a relatively simple procedure. The clinic can provide you with a collection kit and instructions. It's the safest and most effective way to determine the best course of treatment. I’m happy to answer any questions you have about it. As for a second opinion, you certainly have the right to seek one. However, I believe this test will give us the information we need to get you feeling better quickly. Would you like me to explain the collection process in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Explain it. But make it quick. And don't expect me to be happy about this. I’m losing valuable work time over this whole… ordeal. Honestly, I’ve never dealt with such inefficiency in my life. I'm a professional. My time is important. Just tell me what I need to do so I can get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's a pamphlet with detailed instructions, but I'll walk you through it quickly. You’ll receive a collection container and a couple of swabs. You’ll collect a small stool sample – about the size of a walnut – using the provided instructions, and then place it in the container. It’s best to collect it first thing in the morning, if possible. The lab will provide you with instructions on how to transport it. The test itself usually takes 24-72 hours for results. Once we have those, we can determine the appropriate treatment – whether it’s an antibiotic, an anti-parasitic medication, or simply rehydration therapy. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids – water, broth, or electrolyte solutions – to prevent dehydration. Avoid sugary drinks, as they can worsen diarrhea. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Fine. I'll try. But don't expect miracles. I have deadlines. And if this doesn't work, I’m going somewhere else. This whole thing is a waste of my time. Just give me the container, and let’s get this over with. I need to get back to work. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being treated like a child.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if you feel I’m not taking your time seriously. I assure you, I'm doing my best to get you back to feeling your best as quickly as possible. Here is the container. The lab is just down the hall; they'll explain any further details. Once you’ve collected the sample, just bring it to them. I’ll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen significantly – such as developing a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or signs of severe dehydration. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. I have work to do. And honestly, I expect a quick recovery. This whole ordeal has been incredibly disruptive. Don't bother calling me with anything trivial. I'll contact you if I need something. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Woodring. Please take care, and I wish you a speedy recovery. My assistant will be in touch to schedule your follow-up. .
