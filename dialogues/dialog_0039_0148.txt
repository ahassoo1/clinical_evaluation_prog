DOCTOR: Hello Noelani, welcome! It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit awkward to talk about, truly. I've been having some… pain. Down there. In the… testicular area. Though, I’m not entirely sure how to describe it. It's… discomfort, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort in the… testicular area. That is a bit awkward to talk about, you’re right, but you've come to the right place. We can figure this out. Just take your time. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. It’s… difficult to pinpoint. It doesn’t really come and go, it’s more… a constant ache? And sometimes, a sharp twinge. Not terribly often, though. It's been… a few weeks, I believe? Or perhaps a month? It's hard to remember exactly when it started. I haven't injured myself, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: A constant ache with occasional sharp twinges… a few weeks to a month. Okay. And you haven't experienced any injury to the area that you can recall?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing that I remember. I… I do a lot of woodworking, you see. It's my profession. But I'm quite careful, usually. Though… sometimes I do get sawdust everywhere. But I don’t think that would cause this, would it? It just… gets irritating, that's all. It’s probably nothing, really. Just an old woman's aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, woodworking. Good to know. And you're right to mention the sawdust - irritation is possible. But we want to rule out anything more serious, just to be safe. Now, have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth in that area?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… Swelling… I don’t think so. I haven’t really looked, to be honest. It’s… a bit embarrassing to examine myself, you see. Redness… no, I don’t recall any redness. Warmth… no, it doesn’t feel particularly warm. Though, it is quite warm in here, isn’t it? I truly don’t believe it’s anything serious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Noelani. It’s perfectly alright that you haven't examined it closely. We can certainly take a look ourselves. Would you be comfortable with a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Oh dear. Is it… necessary? I mean, I understand you need to, to be thorough. It’s just… private. But if you think it’s best, then yes. Yes, I suppose. Please be gentle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod gently. “Of course, Noelani. I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. We’ll take things slowly, and you can tell me to stop at any time. I'll explain everything as I go. First, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then I’ll gently palpate the area. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Listening and… palpating. Slowly is good. Very slowly. And please do explain. It… helps to know what you're doing.
DOCTOR: Alright, I don’t hear anything concerning there. Now, I’m going to gently feel your lower abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. There’s a bit of tenderness here, on the left side… and just a little bit of… something firm. It’s small, though. Not large. And it doesn't seem to cause you significant pain when I press on it, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s where it feels… odd. A little tender, you’re right. And yes, a small firmness… I hadn’t noticed it myself, to be honest. It doesn’t hurt terribly, it’s more… a dull ache. Like a bruise, perhaps? It's a bit… unsettling, knowing it's there.
DOCTOR: Okay. A dull ache with a small firm mass… That could be a number of things. It’s too small to be very concerned about right now, but we should investigate further to be sure. It’s possible it’s a cyst, or even a small hernia. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order a scrotal ultrasound. That will give us a clear picture of what’s going on in that area. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will give you a clearer picture, then yes, please. I don’t want it to be anything… serious. A cyst, you say? Is that… painful? I suppose I should ask… is this covered by Medicare? I do have Medicare, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover the ultrasound, especially given your symptoms. I’ll have the office staff verify that for you before we schedule it, just to be certain. As for cysts, they can sometimes be painful, but many are painless. It really depends on the size and location. We won't know for sure until we get the ultrasound results. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I've never had any reaction to anything, not that I recall. As for medical conditions… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, but that was… oh, almost thirty years ago now. And I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but nothing major. It just aches sometimes. I don't think that would interfere with an ultrasound, would it? It's just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, and some arthritis in your hands. That's good to know. Neither of those should interfere with the ultrasound. Alright, I’m going to go ahead and order the scrotal ultrasound. The office staff will call you to schedule an appointment. It's usually a quick procedure, and shouldn’t be too uncomfortable. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, or notice any redness or swelling, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Does that sound good, Noelani?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Doctor. Sudden, severe pain… I will remember that. Thank you for your patience. It was… difficult to talk about, truly. But you made it much easier. And thank you for verifying the Medicare coverage. That’s a great comfort. I suppose I should be going now?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Noelani. It’s perfectly alright that it was difficult to talk about. That’s what I’m here for. And yes, I’m happy we could verify the coverage for you. Yes, you can absolutely go now. The office staff will be in touch to schedule the ultrasound. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. We’re going to get to the bottom of this, Noelani. And more often than not, these things turn out to be nothing serious. Take care of yourself.
