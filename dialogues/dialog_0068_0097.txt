DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband suggested I come. He’s been reading things online, and he thinks I should have one of those… forms. An advance directive, I believe he called it? Something to do with… what happens if I can’t speak for myself. Honestly, I don’t really understand why it’s necessary. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Right, an advance directive. Yes, a sensible precaution, though I understand your hesitation. It’s… it's about planning for the unexpected. Even healthy people can experience sudden illness or injury. It’s less about expecting something to happen, and more about ensuring your wishes are known. Before we delve into that, though, are you experiencing any health concerns currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. As I said, I am quite well. A little tired, perhaps, but that’s all. This is… frankly, a bit of a waste of my time, if you ask me. My husband worries excessively. He reads too much on the internet. It’s always something with him. But, if you insist, I suppose we can discuss this… form. Though I fail to see the point, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Chilla. It’s… good that you’re feeling well. Just to be thorough, though, and to rule things out… when you say "tired," can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… a general lack of energy. I used to be able to do so much more, you understand? I managed the household, kept up with my social engagements, graded papers… now, I find myself needing a nap in the afternoon. And I’m not sleeping as well at night. It’s probably just… getting older, I suppose. Though I do try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I eat very well, and I get plenty of… well, I used to get plenty of exercise. It’s just… harder now. It's not something I’m particularly concerned about, Doctor. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I see. A decrease in energy, some difficulty with sleep... and has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I suppose. It’s been… oh, perhaps six months now? It started slowly, just feeling a bit more fatigued than usual. Then, the sleep started to become… less restful. I thought it was just stress from the students, to be honest. They’re… not always the most diligent learners, you understand. It requires a great deal of… effort to motivate them. But it hasn't improved, even with the summer break. Though, again, it’s not something I’m losing sleep over, if you’ll pardon the pun. I just thought I'd humor my husband and get this… form sorted.
DOCTOR: Right. Six months of fatigue and disturbed sleep… Do you notice any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been a bit… forgetful lately. Small things, you understand. Where I put my glasses, the name of a student… nothing major. My husband pointed it out, of course. He says I repeat myself sometimes. Honestly, I think he just doesn’t listen properly. But, yes, perhaps a little more forgetful than usual. It’s probably just… age. Or stress. Everything is stress these days, isn’t it? I don’t see what this has to do with this… advance directive, though. Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Fatigue, sleep disturbance, and some increasing forgetfulness… I see. And has your appetite been normal?
PATIENT: Yes, perfectly normal. I eat very well, as I said. I enjoy cooking, and I take pride in preparing healthy meals. No change there at all. I’ve not lost any weight, either. In fact, if anything, I might have gained a little. My husband is always telling me to watch my figure, but honestly, I think he’s just being… difficult. I really don’t understand why we’re discussing my diet. This is about this… directive, isn’t it? Can we please get back to that? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We'll get back to the directive. Just… trying to get a complete picture. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, Ms. Chilla?
PATIENT: Changes in my mood? Honestly, Doctor, what are you implying? I am perfectly fine. A little… exasperated, perhaps, with my husband’s constant worrying, and now with all these questions. But my mood is perfectly stable. I'm not depressed, if that’s what you’re asking. I have a good life, a comfortable home, a fulfilling career. I simply don’t have time for… melancholy. Are you quite finished with the interrogations? Because I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Very well. Perhaps it would be helpful to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue and memory issues?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor? I came here for a form, not a medical examination. I told you, I'm perfectly healthy. I fail to see the logic in this. Are you suggesting I’m… ill? This is quite insulting, actually. I think I’ve wasted enough of my time here. I'm going to go now. Please send me the form, and I will have my husband sign it. Good day.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, please… just a brief check of your blood pressure, pulse, and a listen to your heart and lungs. It’s a standard precaution. It would only take a few minutes. It's… standard procedure. I can document it for your records, as well. If you're truly adamant against it, we can proceed with the advance directive paperwork, but I do strongly recommend a basic assessment, given your reported symptoms.
PATIENT: Symptoms? You make it sound as if I’m deathly ill. I simply said I was a little tired and forgetful. Honestly, Doctor, you are being needlessly alarmist. Fine. A brief check. But I assure you, it will be a waste of both our time. And then, I expect the form immediately. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Pulse is 78, regular. Lungs sound clear, but there’s a slight… diminished breath sound at the bases. Not alarming, but worth noting. Your blood pressure is a bit higher than ideal, and your breath sounds… are slightly reduced. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment for further evaluation, including some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. It is... standard procedure.
PATIENT: Diminished breath sounds? Now you’re just trying to frighten me! I told you, I am perfectly fine. This is ridiculous. I do not need a follow-up appointment. I do not need blood work. I came here for a form, and that is all I want. Are you going to give me the form, or am I going to have to find another doctor? I am wasting my precious time.
DOCTOR: Please, Ms. Chilla, sit down for a moment. I understand your frustration. But ignoring these findings isn’t… advisable. It's not about frightening you; it's about being thorough. I can provide you with the advance directive paperwork, but I strongly recommend you reconsider a follow-up. If you refuse, I will document your refusal in your chart. But I will not simply dismiss these findings without further investigation. It’s… ethically irresponsible. We can discuss the paperwork after we address this. Perhaps it would be helpful if I explain why I’m concerned?
PATIENT: Explain, then. But make it quick. I have a garden party to attend this afternoon. And I assure you, my garden is perfectly healthy, unlike whatever you seem to think is wrong with me. Just get it over with. I’m not interested in a medical lecture.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, elevated blood pressure, even slightly, can contribute to fatigue and, over time, cognitive issues. Diminished breath sounds could indicate a number of things – reduced lung capacity, mild inflammation, even early signs of… fluid retention. These are not necessarily serious, but they need to be investigated. The blood work will give us a clearer picture. Ignoring these symptoms won't make them disappear, and it could potentially lead to more serious complications down the line. We can start with a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. It's… a relatively simple procedure. Regarding the advance directive… if you’re truly against further evaluation, I will provide you with the form. But I must document your informed refusal in your chart. I also strongly recommend you discuss this with your husband. It's your decision, Ms. Chilla. But I strongly advise reconsidering.
PATIENT: Fine. Document whatever you like. I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions, and I’ve made one. I do not need your lectures, your blood work, or your concern. I’m going now. And please, do not contact me unless it’s absolutely necessary. Good day, Doctor. And tell your staff to send the bill. I expect it to be reasonable. .
