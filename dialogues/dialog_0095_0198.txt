DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking a lot lately… and I was hoping to talk about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I’ve heard it can be helpful for, you know, just feeling more… centered. I don't really know where to start, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, mindfulness and meditation. That's… not typically something I address directly as an internal medicine doctor, but I understand the appeal. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms – anxiety, stress, difficulty sleeping – that you’re hoping mindfulness might help with?
PATIENT: Oh, not really symptoms, no. It’s more… I work a pretty physical job, fixing signals and track switches. It can be stressful, constantly being aware of safety and making sure everything's right. And I find my mind races a lot, even when I'm off work. It's not terrible, but I think it would be good to learn how to quiet things down a little. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. So, it’s more preventative – wanting to improve coping mechanisms for work-related stress and a busy mind, rather than treating a specific condition. Alright. And how long has this been going on – feeling like your mind races, even when you're not working?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a long time, really. Probably… most of my adult life, if I'm being honest. It comes and goes, but it's definitely been more noticeable in the last few years. I suppose as I get older, I think more! It's not debilitating or anything, just… tiring. I’d like to be better at relaxing, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, Ms. Sugino. While I’m not an expert in mindfulness techniques myself, I can certainly offer some resources and perhaps rule out any underlying medical contributors to your stress and difficulty relaxing. Do you have any history of anxiety or depression that’s been formally diagnosed?
PATIENT: No, not formally diagnosed. I’ve thought about talking to someone before, maybe when I was younger, but I never really followed through. I’ve always just… pushed through things, you know? I don’t want to sound silly. It's not like I’m constantly upset or anything. It's more… a constant low-level worry, I guess. And a busy brain.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound silly at all. Many people experience that. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. Just Medicare covers my basics. I try to stay healthy, eat well, get enough sleep when I can. I don't really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to, if I'm honest. I prefer to… manage things myself, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything. I'm lucky that way. My grandmother, now she had allergies! But not me. Are you thinking something is physically causing this, Doctor? Because if so, I’m happy to have some blood work done, if that’s what you recommend.
DOCTOR: It's good to rule things out. While less common, certain thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, or even subtle sleep disorders can contribute to anxiety and a racing mind. So, a basic blood panel wouldn't be a bad idea. It’ll give us a baseline. Beyond that, as I said, I'm not the best resource for mindfulness techniques. Would you be open to a referral to a therapist or counselor who specializes in stress management and mindfulness?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work is fine, absolutely. And yes, a referral would be wonderful, if you have someone you recommend. I’ve heard good things about those techniques, and it's probably best to learn from a professional. I'm not sure where to even start looking on my own.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. I can definitely provide you with a list of therapists in the area who accept Medicare and specialize in mindfulness-based stress reduction. Let me just finish up documenting this, then we’ll get an order in for a basic metabolic panel and thyroid function tests. And then I’ll print out that referral list for you. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen and for offering those options. It’s very helpful. I appreciate it. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do on my end, like scheduling the blood work or anything.
DOCTOR: No, I'll have the lab order sent directly to [Name of local lab]. They should contact you to schedule an appointment. I’m also printing a summary of our conversation for your records. Here are the referral list and the summary. Now, regarding the blood work, it’s best if you fast for at least eight hours beforehand – so, no food or sugary drinks. Just water is fine. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, that's all very clear, thank you. Eight hours fasting… I can manage that. This is great. Honestly, just knowing I'm doing something proactive feels… better already. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I think that’s everything for me. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sugino. Glad I could help. Remember, proactive steps are always a good thing. If anything changes or you have any concerns before your follow-up, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day. .
