DOCTOR: Good morning, Tasmia. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time. The blood pressure thing? My husband made me come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand you're short on time, and that your husband is concerned about your blood pressure. That's good of him to encourage you to get it checked. Just to clarify, he's the one who noticed some concern with your blood pressure readings?
PATIENT: Noticed? He bought one of those machines. Now he takes it all the time. Drives me crazy, honestly. It's always a little high, but I just get stressed when he's poking and prodding with it. It's probably that, not anything real.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. So the readings are higher when he's taking them, and you suspect it's related to the stress of having your blood pressure measured frequently?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. He doesn't understand how annoying it is. Always asking if I’m feeling okay, making me sit still... It's ridiculous. Is that all you need to know? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It sounds like the frequent monitoring is causing you more stress than reassurance, and that's definitely something we need to consider. Before we dismiss anything, though, I’d like to get a more complete picture. It would be helpful to understand a bit more about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or is this something new?
PATIENT: No. Never. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. This is all new because he started this whole thing. Honestly, I think he just likes playing doctor. Can we just… say it's stress and be done with it? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me how you feel. It's good to know you feel perfectly fine overall. While it's possible it's just stress, it's important to rule out any underlying issues, even if you've never been diagnosed with high blood pressure before. It only takes a few minutes, and could give us peace of mind. Would you be willing to let me take your blood pressure here in the office?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. But if it's high, I'm telling you right now, it's his fault. Don't go giving me a lecture.
DOCTOR: Okay, I won't lecture. Let's just get a reading and see where we stand. Just relax your arm, please, and try to breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/92. That's a little elevated. And your pulse is 76, which is normal. Would you mind if I listened to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline?
PATIENT: Elevated? See? This is what I mean. It's the stress of being here. And now you're making it worse by telling me numbers. Fine. Do whatever you need to do. Just hurry. I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's true that being in a medical setting can temporarily raise your blood pressure. However, 148/92 is elevated enough that I'd like to investigate a little further, even accounting for potential anxiety. Your heart sounds normal, and your lungs are clear. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a medical history. I rarely get sick. A cold now and then, that’s it. I eat okay, I guess. My husband worries about that too. He's always saying I should eat more vegetables. Honestly, I think he just likes being in control of everything. Are you writing all this down? It's a little insulting.
DOCTOR: I am taking notes, Tasmia, but it's simply to ensure I have a complete picture of your health. It's not a judgment of your lifestyle, just information gathering. It sounds like you generally feel healthy and have minimal medical issues, which is great. To clarify, have you ever been hospitalized or had any significant illnesses besides the occasional cold?
PATIENT: No. Never. Not even chickenpox as a kid. I was always healthy. Strong, too. I used to hike all the time before… well, before things got complicated. Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous. I should’ve just told him I was fine and stayed home. You’re just going to tell me I need to change my diet, aren’t you?
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling frustrated and like this is a waste of your time. I’m not going to tell you what to do, but I want to rule out anything serious. It’s good you were active previously, and it's helpful to know you don't have any history of serious illness. Do you have any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Ugh. My mom… she had some problems. With her heart, I think. But she didn’t go to the doctor much. She didn't like them. My dad was fine, always healthy. He worked outside his whole life. That’s all I know. Honestly, I don't keep up with that sort of thing. It's depressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart problems on your mother’s side. That’s useful information. To get a clearer picture, would you mind if I asked about your lifestyle a bit more?
PATIENT: Look, is this going to take much longer? I really need to get going. I promised my husband I'd stop at the store. He has a whole list. And if I don’t get back soon, he'll just start worrying again. Can't we just…write down 'stress' and be done? It's the most logical explanation.
DOCTOR: I understand you're eager to leave and I apologize if this is taking longer than you’d like. I want to be respectful of your time. However, because of the elevated reading and family history, I do want to run a couple of simple tests just to be thorough. It's a quick blood draw, and we can also do a basic EKG, which is a quick, painless scan of your heart’s electrical activity. It would help rule out anything serious and give us peace of mind. Would you be willing to do those?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. And if it’s anything, it’s just stress. Don't expect me to suddenly start eating kale or something. Let's just get it over with. Do I have to wear a gown? Because that would be ridiculous.
DOCTOR: You don’t need to wear a gown. We'll just do a simple blood draw, and the EKG involves placing a few stickers on your chest and arms. It won't take long at all. If you’ll have a seat here, I’ll get the lab technician. They'll be in shortly to take a few samples. Then we’ll do the EKG right here in the exam room.
PATIENT: .
