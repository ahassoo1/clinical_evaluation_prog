DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… unsteadiness, I suppose is the best way to put it. It’s difficult to explain, and truthfully, my recollections aren’t what they used to be. It feels like losing my balance, but not always. It’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Lilyanna. “Unsteadiness” is a good way to describe it. And it's perfectly alright if your recollections aren't clear; we'll take our time and try to get to the bottom of this. Could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. I wish I could give you a precise date. It feels like it’s been… several months, perhaps? It’s all rather blurred, I’m afraid. It didn’t happen suddenly, it was more… gradual. I suppose it worsened over time. Is that helpful? And… forgive me, but what exactly do you mean by “when this started”? Do you mean when I first noticed it, or when it became… concerning?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It’s very common for these things to be difficult to pinpoint. When I ask when it started, I'm trying to understand when you first noticed the unsteadiness, even if it was very mild at the time. Knowing that helps us understand the pattern. So, thinking back several months, even if it was just a slight feeling, when do you remember first experiencing this?
PATIENT: Hmm… several months… I believe… around February, perhaps? Yes, February feels right. It was shortly after… after my husband passed. It was very mild then, just a little… off-balance feeling when I stood for too long. I honestly attributed it to… well, everything that was happening. It didn’t seem significant at the time. It was just… another thing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilyanna. Experiencing something like that after such a loss is incredibly difficult, and it’s easy to dismiss things when you have so much else going on. So, the unsteadiness started mildly in February, and has gradually worsened since then. Can you describe what it feels like now?
PATIENT: Now… it's… different. It’s not just when I stand for a long time. Sometimes it happens when I’m walking, and I feel like I might stumble. And… occasionally, even when I’m sitting still, I feel a bit… dizzy, I suppose. It’s not a spinning sensation, not usually. More like… the room is swaying slightly. It’s unsettling because it’s unpredictable. I work… I operate a rotary drill for oil and gas, and it’s… concerning when it happens there. I don't want to put anyone at risk.
DOCTOR: That’s important information, Lilyanna, and I’m glad you’re being so forthcoming about it, especially considering your work. The unpredictability and the fact that it’s interfering with your job are definitely things we need to address. You mentioned it happens when walking, sitting, and standing. Does anything specifically seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I haven’t noticed anything specific, truly. It doesn’t seem to be related to how much I’ve slept, or what I’ve eaten. And… I don’t believe it’s related to stress, although… admittedly, it’s difficult to separate that out. Perhaps… bending over quickly sometimes makes it worse? But not always. Honestly, Doctor, it feels… random. Which is what makes it so frightening. I feel as though I could… fall at any moment.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lilyanna. “Random” is certainly unsettling. Okay, so it's not consistently triggered by anything, but bending over quickly sometimes makes it worse. To get a better understanding, let’s go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the unsteadiness – things like headaches, vision changes, ringing in your ears, nausea, or difficulty hearing?
PATIENT: Let me see… headaches, not really. Occasional mild ones, but nothing out of the ordinary. Vision changes… perhaps a little blurriness sometimes, but I wear glasses, so I assumed that was just my prescription needing adjustment. Ringing in the ears, no. Nausea, no, not at all. Difficulty hearing… no, I don’t believe so. Actually… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little more fatigued than usual lately. But I attributed that to the work, and… everything else. It's difficult to know what is normal anymore. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Lilyanna. The fatigue is good to know. And it’s perfectly reasonable to attribute things to work and everything you’ve been through. Okay, so we have unsteadiness, gradual onset around February, occasional blurriness, and fatigue. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: I… I had high blood pressure for a time, but it was managed with medication. I haven't taken the medication in several years, though. My doctor at the time said it was under control and I could stop. And… I had a bout of pneumonia several years ago, but that was… well, a long time ago. Other than that… no, not that I’m aware of. I've always been… relatively healthy, I believe. My husband… he always took care of the medical things, and I tended to… let him handle it. Is that a problem, Doctor? I apologize if I'm not being very clear. My memory…
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It’s very common for one partner to take the lead on medical matters, and it's not a problem at all. We'll work through this together. So, you had high blood pressure that was managed with medication, and a bout of pneumonia some years ago. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not currently. I don’t take anything regularly. Occasionally, I might take something for a headache, like ibuprofen, but that’s… very infrequent. And I definitely don't take any herbal supplements. I’ve always been a little wary of those. My husband felt they weren't… reliable. I suppose I inherited his skepticism. He was a very practical man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. No current medications or supplements. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, neurological disorders?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she had heart problems, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don't remember much detail. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. He also passed away when I was young. On my husband’s side… his mother had some sort of… neurological disorder, I think. Something with her balance, actually. It’s… vague, I'm afraid. We didn't discuss medical history much, even with him. It seems I have very little concrete information, Doctor. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: It’s not unhelpful at all, Lilyanna. It's very common for family medical history to be incomplete, especially when parents passed away young. We're gathering information, and we'll work with what we have. So, heart problems in your mother, diabetes in your father, and a balance-related neurological disorder in your husband’s mother. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I worked as a crane operator for many years, and now I operate a rotary drill, and those jobs require a clear head, you see. And… frankly, I just don't have any interest in those things. It’s just never appealed to me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Lilyanna. And it makes perfect sense given your profession. Okay, last question regarding your history. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I've never had any allergic reactions to anything. I can eat most foods without issue, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard, I suppose. Is that all, Doctor? I feel as though I’ve given you a very lengthy account of my rather unremarkable life.
DOCTOR: No, Lilyanna, it's not unremarkable at all. Thank you for being so thorough. Alright, with your permission, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few neurological tests to assess your balance and coordination. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be causing your unsteadiness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I’m… ready when you are. I hope it won't take too long.
DOCTOR: It won’t take long at all. First, I’ll check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not significantly concerning given the setting. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I do feel a bit unsteady, even now. It’s difficult to keep my balance, even when I’m trying to. Is this what you expected? I apologize for being such a… challenge.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly alright. This is helpful information. You are exhibiting a mild unsteadiness, as you noted. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes and extend your arms out to your sides. Okay. Now, I’m going to gently push you backwards, and I want you to try and maintain your balance. You sway a bit with the push, which indicates some issues with your balance. Now, let's check your gait. Could you please walk a few steps forward, and then turn around?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s… difficult to walk normally. I feel as though I have to concentrate very hard on each step. I don’t usually walk like this. It’s… disconcerting. And… I apologize if I’m taking up too much of your time. Perhaps I should have stayed in bed.
DOCTOR: You're not taking up any time at all, Lilyanna. It’s important we take the time to properly assess this. Your gait is slightly unsteady, and your steps are indeed smaller than usual. Now, one final quick check. I'm going to gently check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Okay, Lilyanna. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, you're experiencing unsteadiness and some difficulty with your balance. The unsteadiness started gradually, has worsened over time, and isn't consistently triggered by anything. Your reflexes are normal, but your balance and gait are affected. Given your history of high blood pressure and the gradual onset of these symptoms, my initial concern is possible orthostatic hypotension – a drop in blood pressure upon standing. However, the neurological exam also suggests we should investigate other potential causes.
PATIENT: Orthostatic… hypotension? That sounds… rather complicated. Is it serious, Doctor? And… what does “investigate other potential causes” entail? I confess, I'm beginning to feel quite anxious. I was hoping for a simple explanation, but it seems this is… more complex than I anticipated. And… will this affect my ability to work? I rely on that, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to feel anxious, Lilyanna. It is a bit complex, and I want to explain everything as clearly as possible. Orthostatic hypotension simply means your blood pressure drops when you stand up, which can cause dizziness and unsteadiness. It's often related to medications, dehydration, or underlying medical conditions. It's not necessarily serious in itself, but it's important to identify the cause and manage it appropriately. To investigate other potential causes, I'd like to order a few simple tests. First, a complete blood count to check for any underlying infection or anemia. Second, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And third, an EKG to check your heart rhythm. We may also consider a tilt table test if the initial tests are inconclusive, but let’s start with these basics. Regarding your work, it's too early to say definitively whether it will be affected. However, until we have a clearer understanding of the cause of your unsteadiness, I would recommend avoiding any activities that require a high degree of balance or coordination, such as operating heavy machinery. I'll be happy to provide a note for your employer, if needed. Does that make sense, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that does make some sense. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and EKG… I can manage that. And… a note for my employer. That would be… very helpful, thank you. I’m… relieved to hear that you have a plan. And… how long will it take to get the results of these tests? And… will I need to make another appointment? I confess, the thought of more appointments is… rather daunting.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed, and we'll take things one step at a time. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. And yes, I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. How about we schedule something for about a week from today?
PATIENT: A week from today… yes, that would be… acceptable. I suppose I should have anticipated more appointments. Very well. A week from today will do. And… thank you, Doctor. For being so patient and understanding. I confess, I haven’t been very easy to deal with. My memory… Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Or any paperwork I need to fill out? I want to ensure I haven’t overlooked anything.
DOCTOR: You haven't been difficult at all, Lilyanna. It’s my job to be patient and understanding. And you haven’t overlooked anything. My nurse will give you the lab requisition form and a copy of the note for your employer before you leave. She'll also schedule your follow-up appointment and provide you with instructions on how to access your test results online. Before you go, do you have any questions for me at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve answered all of my questions. I'm… remarkably reassured, despite everything. Thank you, again, for your kindness and patience. I appreciate your thoroughness, and I’m… hopeful that we can determine the cause of this unsteadiness. I believe that is all. Thank you, Doctor Alanes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could reassure you. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember to take things easy. My nurse will be with you shortly. It was a pleasure meeting you.
