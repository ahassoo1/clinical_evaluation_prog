DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 85 years young. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Yes, eighty-five, give or take a day or two. It’s about a…well, a rather foolish diet I’ve been attempting. A friend – a younger fellow, mind you – convinced me it was the key to…revitalisation. It involves a great deal of cabbage, and very little else, I’m afraid. I thought it best to have a professional opinion before I completely deprive myself of a decent meal.
DOCTOR: A cabbage-centric diet, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. A rather…monotonous one, as it turns out. It’s called the “Cabbage Soup Challenge,” apparently. I confess I hadn’t heard of such things until young Timothy – that’s my friend – explained it with such…enthusiasm. He's lost a considerable amount of weight, but he’s also rather excitable, so I’m taking his results with a grain of salt, if you’ll pardon the expression.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long have you been adhering to this…challenge, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Oh, not long, thankfully. Just over a week, I believe. August 2nd, you see, and I started around the 25th of July. It was initially intended to be ten days, but I began to feel…a distinct lack of energy, and my wife – my ex-wife, rather – pointed out I was looking rather pale. She still cares, you understand, despite everything. It seemed prudent to seek your advice before I continued. It's not terribly comfortable, I must say.
DOCTOR: Ten days on a primarily cabbage-based diet. And you've noticed a decline in energy levels, and your wife expressed concern regarding your appearance. Very well. Before we proceed, let’s get a thorough history. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain with this diet?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no violent reactions. Just…a general feeling of emptiness. And a rather persistent…aroma. Cabbage is a robust vegetable, you see. No vomiting, no diarrhoea, just a feeling of…lethargy, and a distinct lack of appetite for anything but cabbage, which is rather ironic, don’t you think? It's a vicious cycle, really. I've also found I'm…regular, if you understand my meaning, but perhaps too regular. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is relevant, Mr. Vantine. Frequent bowel movements can be a sign of irritation. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or changes in its consistency beyond being…frequent?
PATIENT: No, no blood, thankfully. And the consistency…well, it's…rather watery, I suppose. More so than usual. Not alarming, mind you, just…not my typical constitution, if you’ll pardon the expression. I usually have…a more…solid experience, shall we say? I apologize for the rather graphic details, Doctor. I'm not accustomed to discussing such matters with anyone but my physician, and even then, only when absolutely necessary. It's a rather undignified subject for a man of my age.
DOCTOR: It’s quite alright, Mr. Vantine. These details are important. Now, let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of omeprazole, Doctor. For…indigestion. A rather common ailment, I’m afraid, particularly as one ages. And a multivitamin, occasionally, but not religiously. I try to eat a balanced diet when I'm not…experimenting with cabbage. I suppose that rather negates the point of the multivitamin, doesn't it? I’ve been on the omeprazole for…oh, must be five years now, at least. My previous physician prescribed it. No allergies, thankfully. And I'm not diabetic, if that's relevant. I enjoy a small glass of sherry with dinner, when I have dinner.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you briefly describe your typical diet before you began this…challenge?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I've always enjoyed a rather…traditional English diet, I suppose. Roast dinners on Sundays, with all the trimmings, naturally. Fish and chips on Fridays, a rather guilty pleasure. I enjoy a good shepherd's pie, and a steak occasionally. Plenty of vegetables, usually peas and carrots, and potatoes, of course. I'm rather fond of a full English breakfast on the weekends – bacon, eggs, sausage, black pudding, the whole affair. Not terribly healthy, I concede, but I've always been a hearty eater. I've never been one for overly restrictive diets, until Timothy convinced me otherwise. It seemed like a good idea at the time, a way to…feel more invigorated. Clearly, I was mistaken.
DOCTOR: A hearty diet, indeed. Very well, Mr. Vantine. I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination, just to assess your overall condition. Could you please step onto the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. An examination sounds…prudent. Though I daresay I'm not in the best of condition at the moment, given my recent dietary…misadventures. Do let me know if there's anything I need to do, or any discomfort I should expect. My joints aren't what they used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Just relax, Mr. Vantine. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths, please. In and out… Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: As you wish, Doctor. A little tender, yes. Just here, on the left side. Not a sharp pain, just…a dull ache. Perhaps it's the cabbage. Or the lack of…substantial food. It feels rather…empty, if I'm honest. I suspect my digestive system is rather…unhappy with me at the moment. Is that concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's not immediately alarming, Mr. Vantine, but it is indicative of some irritation. Your abdomen is slightly distended, and there's some mild tympany – that is, increased resonance to percussion. This suggests some trapped gas. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. Overall, your examination suggests some dehydration and digestive upset, likely exacerbated by your restrictive diet. No immediate cause for significant concern, but we need to address this.
PATIENT: Dehydration and digestive upset…that sounds about right, Doctor. I have been feeling rather parched, and my…regularity, shall we say, has been rather excessive. It’s reassuring to hear it’s not anything more serious. What do you recommend, Doctor? Should I immediately abandon the cabbage? I confess, I’m rather losing my appetite for it, even now. Perhaps a nice roast chicken would be more…restorative.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, I strongly advise you to discontinue this diet immediately. It’s providing no nutritional benefit and is clearly causing digestive distress. A roast chicken sounds infinitely more sensible. We’ll focus on rehydration and restoring your gut flora. I recommend a clear liquid diet for the next 24 hours – broth, water, electrolyte solutions. Then, gradually reintroduce bland, easily digestible foods – toast, crackers, rice, bananas. I’m going to order a basic blood panel to check your electrolyte levels and kidney function. We’ll also do a stool sample to rule out any infection. I’ll also prescribe a probiotic to help restore your gut bacteria. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That sounds…infinitely more appealing. A clear liquid diet, bland foods…and no more cabbage! You’ve lifted a great weight off my mind. A blood panel and a stool sample…yes, of course. Whatever is necessary. And a probiotic, excellent. No, I don't believe I have any questions at the moment. Just…a profound regret for ever listening to young Timothy. Is there anything I should be doing, besides drinking broth and avoiding cabbage? Any particular signs I should watch out for?
DOCTOR: Good. Avoid Timothy for the time being. Beyond the clear liquid diet, monitor yourself for signs of dehydration – decreased urination, dizziness, extreme thirst. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or bloody stools, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to review your blood work and assess your progress. Here are the lab requisitions, and the instructions for the clear liquid diet. And this is the prescription for the probiotic. I'll have the nurse draw the blood before you leave. Do you have any further concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. Thank you. No Timothy, monitor for dehydration, blood work, probiotic…yes, I believe I have it all. No, I don’t think I have any further concerns at the moment. You’ve been most thorough and reassuring. I shall avoid cabbage, heed your warnings, and…attempt to regain my appetite for roast chicken. Thank you again, Doctor Hembrey. You’ve saved me from a rather unfortunate fate. Perhaps I’ll see you in a week, feeling more…substantial.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Vantine. I expect to see improvement in one week. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any difficulties before then. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood.
