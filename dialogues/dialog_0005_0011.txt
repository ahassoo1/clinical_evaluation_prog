DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Doctor… Don…ate, is it? Yes. Look, I ain't got all day. Just need a paper signed, somethin' about… fixin' myself up a little. Cosmetic… procedure. That’s what the young lady at the place said. A clearance, she called it. I work with towers, you understand. Dangerous work. Gotta look presentable.
DOCTOR: "Fixin' yourself up a little," you say. Right. And this “place”... is this a medical facility?
PATIENT: Medical facility? Well, they got… equipment. And people. Look, I don't need a lecture, Doctor. It's a perfectly reputable establishment. They specialize in… enhancements. I just need you to say I’m healthy enough to go through with it. Simple. I ain't askin' for your opinion on whether I should do it, just if my ticker can handle it. Don’t recall the name of the place, though. It was… advertised.
DOCTOR: Advertised, huh. Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I need more information than that. I can't just sign off on a procedure I know nothing about, performed by… who knows who. That's not safe, and it’s certainly not ethical. Tell me, what exactly is this procedure?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I told you, I don't recall details. It’s… somethin' with my face. Makes me look younger, they said. A lift, maybe? Or somethin’ tightened. Honestly, I don't pay attention to those things. I just want it done. I’m 64 years old, you understand. Time marches on. It’s… a rejuvenation. Is that good enough? I don't need a whole song and dance about ethics. Just tell me if I’m fit enough, or not. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're frustrated, but I need to know more. A “lift” or “tightening” can involve a number of procedures, some minor, some… considerably more involved. Without knowing what they're planning, I can't assess the risks, and I absolutely won't put your health on the line. Do you have any paperwork from this establishment?
PATIENT: Paperwork… hmm. Let me see… Ah, here. It’s… a receipt. For a deposit. "Glamour Renewals." That’s it. No details, just a price. And a phone number. Look, I'm tellin' you, I didn't ask a lot of questions. They seemed professional enough. I just wanted to look a little better. Now are you gonna sign the paper, or not? I got things to do. Real work.
DOCTOR: "Glamour Renewals…" Hmm. Well, this is… concerning. Mr. Honcoop, this establishment has a number of complaints filed against it. Primarily regarding… substandard care and unqualified personnel. It's not a licensed medical facility, and there are reports of infections and complications.
PATIENT: Complaints? Bah! People complain about everything these days. Probably just folks who didn't follow the aftercare instructions. I can assure you, Doctor, I am a very careful man. I don’t go lookin’ for trouble. I’m tryin’ to improve my appearance, not end up in the hospital. Are you tellin’ me you won’t sign the clearance? 'Cause if that's what you're sayin', I’ll just go somewhere else. I got my rights, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you have rights, and I respect your autonomy. However, my primary responsibility is to protect your health. This isn’t about aftercare instructions; this is about potentially dangerous practices performed by individuals who are not qualified to provide medical care. I will not sign a clearance for a procedure at this establishment. It would be irresponsible and unethical. I strongly advise you to reconsider. Perhaps we can discuss legitimate options for cosmetic procedures performed by licensed and qualified professionals?
PATIENT: Legitimate options? Qualified professionals? Look, Doctor, I appreciate your… concern, but I didn’t come here for a lecture on responsible choices. I came here for a signature. Clearly, you’re not going to provide it. Fine. I’ll find a doctor who understands that a man is free to do what he wants with his own face. Don't expect me to come back if things… don’t go as planned. You've wasted enough of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I want to be clear: I am doing this for your own safety. I strongly recommend you do not proceed with any procedure at this establishment. If you do, and you experience complications, please seek immediate medical attention. Here’s my card. If you change your mind, or if you require medical attention, please don't hesitate to contact me. .
