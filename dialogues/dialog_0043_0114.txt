DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. I’m here because I have trouble breathing when I lie down flat. It’s been happening for… oh, a little over a month now, I’d say. It’s quite bothersome, really. I like a good night’s sleep, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Vanderwiele. A good night's sleep is essential. Trouble breathing can certainly disrupt that. Let's explore this further. When you say trouble breathing, could you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a… a gasping feeling, not exactly. It’s more like… a tightness in my chest. And I feel like I can’t get a full breath. Like something is… pressing on me. It’s worse when I try to lie completely flat. If I prop myself up with pillows, it’s a little better, but not much. It just feels… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Vanderwiele. “Tightness in the chest” and feeling like you can’t get a full breath are helpful details. And it's good to know that propping yourself up with pillows provides some relief. Now, about how long after lying down does this tightness typically begin?
PATIENT: Oh, almost immediately, Doctor. Within… five minutes, perhaps. Sometimes even quicker. It doesn’t take long at all to notice it. It used to not bother me, lying flat. I could read for hours, but not anymore. It's quite a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Almost immediate onset is important information. And to clarify, is this feeling constant once it starts, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty constant, once it begins. Doesn't really let up until I sit up. Or prop myself up with pillows, like I said. It’s not a sharp pain, mind you. Just… a pressure. A tightness. It’s rather… persistent. I suppose that’s the best way to put it. It doesn't go away until I change position.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Vanderwiele. “Persistent” is a good description. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I have been coughing a little more lately. Not a terrible cough, mind you. Just a… dry tickle in my throat. And… I do feel a bit more tired than usual. But I'm seventy-one, Doctor. Being tired comes with the territory, doesn’t it? I’m not sure if that’s related.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point, Ms. Vanderwiele, and it’s good you’re considering all possibilities. The increased cough and fatigue are useful information. Is the cough worse at any particular time of day, or when you're doing specific activities?
PATIENT: It’s… worse at night, I think. Before I try to lie down, even. And when I’ve been doing… well, anything much, really. A little walking, even. It’s not a hacking cough, just a… a little irritation. I usually have a glass of water and it calms down, but it seems to come back quicker than it used to. I haven’t been drinking enough water, perhaps. Is that it?
DOCTOR: It's possible dehydration could be contributing, Ms. Vanderwiele, and it's good you're mindful of that. Now, let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any history of heart problems, like heart failure or arrhythmia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve always had a strong heart, or so the doctors told me. I had my annual check-ups, of course. Never any problems. My father had high blood pressure, but that was it. He lived to be eighty-eight, so I suppose I inherited the good genes. I’ve always been careful with my diet, too. Not much salt, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Vanderwiele. No personal history of heart problems and a family history limited to high blood pressure is helpful. And being mindful of your salt intake is excellent. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, COPD, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I've never smoked a day in my life, and I haven’t spent much time around smokers either. I used to work in the library, you see. Lots of dust, but no smoke. I’ve never had any trouble with… wheezing or shortness of breath, aside from this recent issue. My lungs have always been… quite clear, I thought.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No history of smoking and a clear lung history is reassuring. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure medication. A small dose, once a day. And… I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me my levels were a bit low. That's all. Nothing else. I don't believe in loading up on pills, you see. Natural is best, whenever possible. I take my blood pressure medicine every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Vanderwiele. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like pollen or food?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I’m aware of. I used to help in the garden, and I was around all sorts of plants. Never any trouble. I eat pretty much everything. Not fond of beets, but that’s a matter of taste, not allergy, you see. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing, ever. I’ve always been a rather… sturdy person, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies is helpful. Now, Ms. Vanderwiele, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need. I want to get to the bottom of this, you see. This breathing trouble is… quite unsettling. I'm ready when you are. Just let me know what you’d like me to do. Hopefully it won’t take too long. I have a book club meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I understand your wanting to get this resolved, and I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Alright. I’m hearing slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs, and your heart rate is regular, but a little elevated. Now, I'm going to check your legs for any swelling. Do you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not usually. Sometimes a little bit after I’ve been on my feet all day, but nothing major. A little puffiness, perhaps. I usually put my feet up and it goes away. But it’s not a constant thing. I haven't noticed any swelling lately, specifically. They feel alright now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Vanderwiele. No recent significant swelling is good to know. Finally, I’m going to take your blood pressure and oxygen saturation. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a bit elevated, and your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is within the normal range. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings—the diminished breath sounds, slightly elevated blood pressure, and your description of the symptoms—it could be a number of things. However, given your age and symptoms, the most likely possibilities are either early heart failure, fluid buildup in the lungs, or possibly COPD, although you have no smoking history. It’s also possible it’s a combination of factors. To help narrow things down, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. The X-ray will allow us to see if there’s any fluid in your lungs, and the EKG will check your heart rhythm. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever it takes to find out what's going on. An X-ray and… an EKG, you said? Alright. Yes, please. I trust your judgment. Hopefully it won’t take too long. I really don't want to miss my book club meeting. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your meeting, Ms. Vanderwiele, and we'll try to expedite things as much as possible. The X-ray technician is just down the hall in Room 3. They’ll need you to remove any jewelry or metal objects from your chest area. The EKG will be done right here in the examination room. It involves placing some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs—it doesn’t hurt at all. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and give you the necessary paperwork and instructions. She’ll also schedule the tests for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to prop yourself up with pillows when you lie down. Also, try to limit your salt intake and keep track of any changes in your symptoms—like if your cough gets worse or if you develop any new symptoms, such as swelling in your ankles or shortness of breath when you're resting. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That sounds… quite thorough. No, I don't think so. Just… when will I get the results? And will Sarah be able to tell me how long the tests will take? I have to arrange transportation, you see. And I promised my friend I’d bring the cookies to book club. It’s just… a busy afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Vanderwiele. We’ll aim to get the results back as quickly as possible. Typically, the X-ray results are available within a few hours, and the EKG results are usually immediate. Sarah will be able to give you a more precise timeframe when she schedules the tests. She’ll also be able to help you estimate how long each test will take. I'll ask her to come in right away. Please, stay seated and I’ll have Sarah in shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else I can assist you with before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s all for now, I believe. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Just… please tell Sarah I’m a bit pressed for time. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’ll be sure to let Sarah know. Sarah, could you please assist Ms. Vanderwiele with scheduling a chest X-ray and EKG?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Alright. Let’s get this over with, shall we? I have a book club meeting to attend. Hopefully it won’t take all day. And… please be gentle with the sticky pads.
