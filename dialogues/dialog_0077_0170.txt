DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for a life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know? The insurance company sent me. I’m Waleed Putney, by the way. Just want to get it over with, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Putney. A life insurance physical. Perfectly alright. I understand wanting to be efficient. Let me just pull up your information… Ah, yes, Waleed Putney, age 49. And I see your height and weight are listed as 174 centimeters and 97 kilograms, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. About right, yeah. Is that important? I don’t really keep track of those numbers.
DOCTOR: It is important, yes, as it helps us get a baseline for your health. We’ll use it along with other information we gather today. Now, let’s start with a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I had a bad back for a while, working in hotels, you know? Lots of lifting. But I went to a chiropractor for that. Nothing a doctor ever told me I had, if that makes sense. I get regular checkups, but they usually just say I’m okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of back pain managed with chiropractic care. And you say you have regular checkups where you’re told you are generally in good health. That’s good to hear. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Nope. Not even as a kid. I’m pretty lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. That's helpful to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. Family… that's a tough one. My mom, she had… something with her heart, I think? She passed away a while ago. And my dad, he had diabetes, I think so. But honestly, I wasn't really paying attention to all that stuff when I was younger. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about health much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Putney. It's very common for families not to discuss these things openly. Knowing even a little bit is helpful, so thank you for sharing what you recall about your mother’s heart condition and your father’s diabetes. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… uh… I work. A lot. I manage a hotel, so it's always busy. Long hours. I try to eat okay, but it's hard when you're running around. And… I don't really exercise much. I walk around at work, is that exercise? I used to fish a lot back home, but not so much anymore.
DOCTOR: Walking around at work does count for something, Mr. Putney. It’s a start. And it's understandable that it's hard to prioritize exercise with a demanding job. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Just… whatever I need for a headache sometimes. Like ibuprofen or something. But not regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And just occasional ibuprofen for headaches. One last question before we proceed with a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I’m Marshallese, we eat a lot of fish and coconut!
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's all very helpful information, Mr. Putney. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a few other basic things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Let’s get it over with. Sounds good. Just… try to be quick, if you can?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but within a normal range. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. 140/90. That’s slightly elevated. Pulse is regular and strong. We'll need to monitor this. Alright, Mr. Putney, everything seems generally within acceptable limits, but your blood pressure is a bit high. We should repeat this measurement later, and I may recommend some lifestyle modifications or further testing to investigate this.
PATIENT: Okay. High blood pressure, huh? Is that bad? I don’t really understand all this medical stuff. Lifestyle modifications… like what? Less work?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be confused, Mr. Putney. Elevated blood pressure means your heart is working harder than it should to pump blood through your body. It doesn't necessarily mean it's bad right now, but it increases your risk for heart disease and stroke if left unmanaged. As for lifestyle modifications, it doesn’t necessarily mean less work, although reducing stress is always helpful. It means things like eating a healthier diet – lower in salt and fat – and getting regular exercise, even just a 30-minute walk most days. We can discuss this in more detail. I’d also like to order some blood work to get a better picture of your overall health – cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function, just to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Blood work sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. Less salt… that’s going to be hard. Everything has salt in it these days. And exercise… I guess I can try. As long as it doesn’t take too much time.
DOCTOR: It can be challenging, Mr. Putney, but even small changes can make a difference. We can discuss strategies to make it easier. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood samples before you leave. While we wait for the results, I’m going to write a referral for a basic EKG just to rule out any underlying heart issues given your slightly elevated blood pressure. It's just a precautionary measure. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: An EKG… is that one of those machines with the stickers on your chest? This is a lot. Will this affect my insurance? I just need to make sure I can still get covered. I’m trying to get a policy for my daughter.
DOCTOR: Yes, an EKG uses stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It’s a quick and painless procedure. And I understand your concern about insurance coverage. The tests I’m ordering are standard preventative measures, and should be covered by Medicare. However, it’s always best to double-check with your insurance provider to confirm their specific policies. I can provide you with the billing codes for the tests if that helps. Let me write down the billing codes for you now. Here you are. Also, I’m going to give you a handout with some information on healthy eating and exercise. This will give you a starting point for making some lifestyle changes. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: Okay, thanks. Billing codes… good. I’ll have to ask my daughter to look into that. And yeah, I guess that's all. I just want to get this done and over with. So, what happens next? Do I need to come back?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The nurse will draw your blood now, and the lab results should be back in a few days. Once I have those, I’ll review them and give you a call to discuss the results and schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. You'll also need to schedule the EKG separately, I'll have the nurse provide you with information on local facilities. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Putney?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. Hopefully, everything will be okay.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Putney. I hope so too. Remember, even small steps can make a big difference. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Putney.
