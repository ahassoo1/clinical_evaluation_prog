DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, you know. It’s this…shaking. Hands mostly. Been happening a bit lately. Not sure what it is, to be honest. Probably just old age, if you ask me. Doctors these days… always gotta make a fuss over everything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. We want to rule out anything serious, even if it is just age-related. And you're right, sometimes it is just that. But it's good to check. When did you first notice this shaking?
PATIENT: Honestly? Can't rightly say. A few weeks, maybe? Months? Time all blurs together when you get to be my age. It comes and goes, you see. Not constant. It's worse when I… well, when I try to do something precise. Like tying my tie. Or holding a fork. It's embarrassing, really. My wife... she used to help. But that's neither here nor there now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks to months, worse with precise movements… and you mentioned it’s affecting things like tying your tie and holding a fork. Has it gotten steadily worse over that time, or does it come and go in waves?
PATIENT: Waves, I suppose. Some days it's barely noticeable. Others… well, others I feel like a parkinson's patient, if that makes sense. Though I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, mind you. Don't go jumping to conclusions. I just... read things. My daughter keeps sending me articles. Drives me mad, she does. Honestly, I haven’t changed my diet or anything. It just…started. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. And it’s good you haven’t noticed any changes to your diet or any other new symptoms alongside the shaking. We'll take it slowly. Have you noticed the shaking in other parts of your body besides your hands?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe a little in my leg. Not often. Just a sort of… restlessness, I guess. Like I need to tap my foot. My wife used to tell me to sit still! Always nagging. But no, nothing major. It's mostly the hands. Definitely the hands. And it’s not like it’s constant, you understand. I can still… function. Barely.
DOCTOR: Okay, some occasional restlessness in your leg, but primarily the hands. And you’re still able to function, though it’s becoming more difficult. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I’ve got a touch of the arthritis, you know, in my knees. Nothing serious. Just aches and pains. And the doctor told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high, so I take a little pill for that. Small white one. Can’t remember the name of it. Honestly, I take so many pills these days, it's a blur. And… that’s about it, I think. Nothing life-threatening, thankfully. Is this what you do all day? Ask old people about their pills?
DOCTOR: It’s important to know everything, Mr. Baide, so we can make sure everything is working together as it should. And yes, sometimes it is about making sure the pills aren't causing any unexpected effects. You mentioned arthritis and high blood pressure. Do you know the names of the medications you take for those?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, I told you, I don't keep track of these things! My daughter handles all that. She brings me the little plastic containers every week. Says it's important. I just swallow them. It's a blue pill for the pressure, I think. And a little white one for the arthritis. That's all I know! Are you going to examine my hands or what? I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a look. Please relax your hands for me. I’m noting a slight tremor in both hands, even when you’re relaxed. The muscle tone seems normal. And your reflexes are a little diminished, which isn't uncommon at your age. I'm also checking your pulse here... Normal. I'd like to rule out any underlying medical issues that could be causing this. Would you be open to a few basic blood tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, for heaven's sake. More poking and prodding? I swear, doctors just want to keep themselves busy. Look, I’m not a fan of needles. Never have been. But… alright, fine. If you have to. Just get it over with quickly, will you? I’ve got a lunch appointment. And don't tell me it's going to be a whole vial of blood, either. I faint at the sight of it. But honestly, I doubt it’s anything serious. Probably just old age, like I said.
DOCTOR: We’ll just take a small sample, Mr. Baide. And I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle and quick. It’s standard procedure to rule out things like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies that can sometimes cause tremors. I'll order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. While we're waiting for those results, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, who remembers that stuff? My parents are long gone. I had a brother, but we weren’t close. He worked in a bank somewhere. As far as I know, nobody in my family had… shaking. Or tremors. Or whatever this is. Everyone just… got old and died, like normal people. Is this really necessary? I mean, I’m 80 years old. What are you hoping to find? A magical cure?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know, even if it's just to rule things out. And you’re right, at 80, we’re often looking at age-related changes. Do you drink alcohol, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: A little. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Nothing excessive. My wife used to enjoy a little glass with me. Good Chianti, usually. But I haven't been drinking much lately. Lost my appetite, you see. And… well, it’s not the same without her. It just doesn't taste the same. So, no, not really. Just a little now and then. Certainly not enough to cause… shaking. What are you implying?
DOCTOR: I'm not implying anything, Mr. Baide. It’s just part of a routine medical history to understand all possible factors. And I understand it’s not the same without your wife. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she tried it once, when she was young. Hated it. Said it smelled awful. No, never. Always told me it was a foolish habit. And she was usually right about things. So, no. Never smoked. Are we almost done here? I really do have that lunch appointment. And frankly, I’m starting to feel a little lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a few more questions. Have you experienced any recent changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm. Now that you mention it… it's not as sharp as it used to be. Everything's a little blurry around the edges. But I've got cataracts, the doctor told me years ago. He said I should get them fixed, but… I never bothered. Too much fuss. And frankly, I don't drive anymore, so it hasn't been a big deal. My daughter does all the driving. So, yes, a little blurry. But nothing new. It’s been like that for years. Is this finally the end?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, I think that covers everything for now. We'll get those blood tests done, and I’ll review the results as soon as they come back. In the meantime, I’m going to start with a working diagnosis of essential tremor, which is a very common condition that often develops with age. It’s not usually a sign of anything serious. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, which is why we're doing the blood tests. I’m going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a formal evaluation and to discuss potential treatment options, if you're interested. They can offer more specialized care and monitor the progression of the tremor. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? More doctors? Honestly, it’s always something. Look, I’m 80 years old. What’s the point? I’m not going to be running marathons anytime soon. But… alright, fine. If you think it’s necessary. But I’m not promising anything. And tell them to keep it brief. I haven’t got all day, you know. Just… get it over with. What time is it, anyway? I’m going to be late for lunch. Let's just get these tests done, and I’ll see what happens. It’s probably nothing. It’s just old age.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. We’ll get the blood tests done right away. And I’ll have the neurology referral sent over to you. I understand your concerns, and we'll take it one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. And, it's currently 11:45 AM. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
