DOCTOR: Right, well. Have a seat. So, Courtnye, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hi. It’s the bruising. I bruise really easily now, and it's been getting worse. I’m on, you know, the blood thinner… Warfarin, I think it’s called? It just feels like any little bump now leaves a mark that lasts forever. It’s a bit worrying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Bruising, yes. And you said it’s been…worsening?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. Like, a couple of weeks ago it was just little ones if I bumped into something. Now, I swear just thinking about hitting my arm on the doorframe makes a purple spot appear. It’s not painful, not really, just…a lot of it. And it’s taking ages to fade. I haven’t changed anything about how I take the pills, or anything else for that matter.
DOCTOR: Right. And you’re certain you haven’t… increased your dosage recently?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I get the little packets from the pharmacy, same every month. Two pills every evening with dinner, same as always. I'm pretty good about that sort of thing, gotta be with this stuff. I haven’t touched them.
DOCTOR: Okay. And…do you recall why you were put on warfarin in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was, um… about three years ago now. I had a…a blood clot. In my leg. Deep vein thrombosis, the doctor called it. Scary stuff. That’s why they started me on the Warfarin, to stop any more forming. Honestly, it all feels like a blur now. It was a stressful time.
DOCTOR: Right, a DVT. Yes. And have you had any other clots since then?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. That’s what worries me, right? That it might be another one forming, but… it doesn't feel like one. No swelling or pain, just… purple. It’s just the bruising that's different. I really don’t want to end up back in hospital.
DOCTOR: Hm. Alright. Let’s have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Sure, go ahead. It's mostly on my arms and legs, I guess. Though, to be honest, I’ve probably got a few spots hiding everywhere. It’s just… a lot. Is there something seriously wrong? I really hope it’s nothing.
DOCTOR: Well, the bruising is quite extensive, yes. And some of these appear relatively recent. I’m just going to check your blood pressure and pulse quickly. And then we'll talk about some blood work, just to see where your levels are at with the warfarin. It’s likely just a slight adjustment needed, but we need to be sure. Do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, that sounds sensible. No, I don't have any allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. Been pretty lucky on that front. Blood work… alright. Hopefully it's not a big deal. This is just… frustrating. I can’t even hug my niece properly without worrying I’ll leave a mark!
DOCTOR: Right. And are you taking any other medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just the usual paracetamol for headaches, maybe once a month? And sometimes a vitamin D tablet in the winter. That's it. Nothing else. Definitely not anything that would interact with the blood thinner, I don't think. I'm pretty careful with that sort of thing. I remember the doctor warning me about mixing things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll get a blood test done to check your INR levels and just make sure everything is within the therapeutic range. It’s possible the dose needs adjusting, or there's something else going on. I’m going to order a complete blood count as well, just to rule out any other issues. And, honestly, given your concerns, I'd like to order a D-dimer to rule out any new clot formation. Better safe than sorry, as they say. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I mean, worrying is the worst, so getting it checked properly is definitely the best thing. D-dimer… that’s the thing that checks for clots, right? So you are thinking it might be that? Honestly, I'd rather know. The sooner we figure it out, the better. Do I need to go somewhere else for the tests, or can I do them here?
DOCTOR: Yes, the D-dimer checks for clot breakdown products. We'll do all the tests right here in the clinic. Nurse Patel will get you set up. It’s just a standard blood draw. Then we’ll have the results back within a few days, and we can discuss them. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause injury, and if you do bump yourself, apply ice immediately. Don’t panic, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Here, in the clinic, that’s much easier. And ice… yes, I can do that. Right, avoid bumps and ice. Got it. A few days… that feels like a long time to be worrying, but alright. Thank you, Doctor Havird. I appreciate you taking it seriously. Hopefully it’s just a little tweak to the medication. I really hope so. .
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll get those tests ordered for you and Nurse Patel will be in shortly. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or you develop any new symptoms. Try not to fret.
