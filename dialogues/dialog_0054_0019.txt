DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what bring me? My wife… she want… baby. We old, you know? I think… we need help for baby. It is good thing, yes? We want to plan. I forget… the words. But she say… talk to doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your wife is hoping to start a family, and you’re here to discuss options, given your age. That’s perfectly alright, and a very common reason to come to see me. It's good you're planning ahead. Just to clarify a few things, Mr. Carlotta, when you say 'start a family', are you and your wife hoping to conceive naturally, or are you considering assisted reproductive technologies, like in-vitro fertilization, or perhaps exploring other options?
PATIENT: Ah… conceive… yes. Naturally… if can. We try… a little. Not much. She say… maybe old. I don't know… what is… vitro? Sounds… fancy. We just want… baby, if God allow. I think… she want to know if… possible? And… safe? For her, you know? She is good woman.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s wonderful that you’re both thinking about this, and it’s very thoughtful of you to be concerned about your wife’s health and safety. “In-vitro fertilization,” or IVF, is a process where we help the egg and sperm meet outside of the body, then place the resulting embryo back into the uterus. It's one option, but definitely not the first one we'd explore. Before we talk about any specific procedures, let’s gather some information. Could you tell me a little bit about your wife’s medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Hmm. She go to doctor… sometimes. For… regular check. She healthy, I think. No big sickness. Maybe… little tired sometimes. She work hard. She like garden, and cook. Oh! And she had… baby before. Long time ago. One baby, a girl. She is… grown up now, with children of her own. I forget how old she is... maybe thirty? She say… I don't remember things so good anymore. Is okay if she come with me next time? She explain better.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. It's good she's generally healthy and has had a previous pregnancy. Having a history of a successful pregnancy is a positive sign. And it’s perfectly fine – and actually often preferable – for her to come with you next time. She can definitely provide more details. Just a few more questions for you, Mr. Carlotta, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No… not really. I work with metal and plastic. Make small things, you know? Model things. Strong hands. Sometimes… back hurt a little. Old man things. But no doctor say… big sickness. I go for check… when Medicare say. They check… blood and things. I think everything… okay. I eat good food… mostly. My wife cook good food.
DOCTOR: Good. It’s good you're generally healthy and keep up with your check-ups. The back pain is something to keep in mind. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… medications… let me think. Sometimes, for the back… little pill. White pill. I forget the name. My wife get it for me. And… sometimes, vitamin. For old bones. That’s all. Nothing big. I don’t like take many pills. Make me sleepy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill for your back pain and a vitamin for your bones. We can try to figure out the name of the back pain medication later if that’s bothering you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. I think. Never had… bad reaction. Maybe… little itchy sometimes, with dust. But not… allergy. My wife… she is allergic to cats. She sneeze a lot around cats. But I am okay. I like cats.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies for you, and your wife has a cat allergy. That’s good to know. Now, a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoke. Bad for the lungs. My father… he smoke. He get sick. Drink… sometimes. Little wine, with dinner. Not much. Maybe… one glass. And… no. No drugs. I am old man. I like quiet life. Work with my hands. And garden with my wife.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. A quiet life, working with your hands and gardening with your wife sounds very peaceful. Alright, Mr. Carlotta, that gives me a good starting point. Given your age and your wife’s previous pregnancy, there are options to explore. However, before we discuss specifics, it would be best to have your wife come in for a proper examination and some blood tests. This will help us assess her overall health and fertility. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that is good. She come with me. She explain better. And… tests… okay. If that help. I just want… baby. If God allow. And… make sure she okay. She is good woman.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. I completely understand. It’s very thoughtful of you to prioritize her health. Okay, let's schedule an appointment for your wife as soon as possible. We can get the blood tests ordered then as well. Would Tuesday afternoon work for her?
PATIENT: Tuesday… yes. She usually free Tuesday. Afternoons… good. She not work Tuesday. She take care of garden then. Yes… Tuesday afternoon is good. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let me just get that scheduled for you. And you're very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I'm happy to help. I'll have the receptionist give you a call to confirm the appointment details. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Just… the appointment. Thank you very much, Doctor. You listen good. And… you kind to old man.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. It was my pleasure meeting you. We’ll do our best to help you and your wife. Have a wonderful day, and please tell your wife I look forward to meeting her on Tuesday.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
