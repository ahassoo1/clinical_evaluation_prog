DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… my foot. It’s been hurting, and there’s a sore that won’t get better. It’s on the bottom, you see. Very troublesome.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on the bottom of your foot that’s been causing you trouble. I understand. Let’s get some more details about it. First, can you tell me when you first noticed the sore?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… maybe two, three months ago? It started small, like a little cut. I didn’t think much of it at first, just thought I bumped it. But it hasn’t gone away. It gets bigger sometimes, and it’s very sore to walk on. I don’t remember exactly when, though. Old age, you know. Things get fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Stoegbauer. Memories can definitely become a bit fuzzy with time. Two or three months, okay. And you said it started as a small cut?
PATIENT: Yes, a little cut. I was walking barefoot in the yard, maybe. Or… perhaps in the house. I can’t be certain where I got it. It didn’t hurt much then. Just a little scratch. I put a bandage on it, and thought that would be that. But then… it just stayed. And got worse. Now it’s… well, it’s not a scratch anymore. It’s a hole, almost.
DOCTOR: A hole, almost… okay. And is it painful constantly, or does the pain come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly when I walk. If I'm just sitting, it doesn't bother me too much. But as soon as I try to stand up and walk around… oh, then it really hurts. It’s a sharp pain, and it feels hot, too. Sometimes, especially after I've been on my feet for a while, it throbs. It keeps me up at night sometimes. Not every night, but often enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp pain with walking, a hot sensation, and throbbing, especially at night. That gives me a better idea. Have you noticed any redness or swelling around the sore?
PATIENT: Yes, there is redness. And… it feels puffy around the edges, I think. My wife, bless her soul, she always noticed things like that. She would say, “Emiliano, that’s looking swollen!” But she’s… gone now. So, I’m not as good at noticing things myself. But yes, I believe it’s red and puffy. It’s not huge, but it’s definitely not just the sore itself.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s alright, you’re doing a good job describing it. Redness and swelling are definitely important things to note. Have you tried anything to treat it yourself?
PATIENT: Oh yes. I’ve tried a few things. I’ve put some ointment on it… some cream my neighbor gave me. And I’ve kept it covered with bandages. I tried some of those special bandages for blisters, too. But nothing seems to help. It just… stays the same, or gets a little worse. I didn’t want to bother the doctor unless it was really bad, you know. But it’s been so long now… and it hurts to walk. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’ve tried ointment, regular bandages, and blister bandages. And it hasn’t improved. I appreciate you trying those things first. Now, let’s take a look at the foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just give me a moment. Here you are, Doctor. It’s… not a pretty sight, I’m afraid. Be gentle, please. It’s quite tender.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. I see the sore. It's located on the plantar aspect of your foot, approximately here. It measures about 1.5 centimeters in diameter. There is a significant amount of surrounding redness and some swelling. It does appear tender to the touch. I also notice some… …some loss of skin integrity, and it looks like there may be some exposed tissue. I'm going to document these findings. Based on what I’m seeing, and given the duration and lack of improvement with self-treatment, this could be a developing infection. I'm concerned about the possibility of a diabetic foot ulcer, even though you haven't specifically mentioned being diabetic. Because of your age, it’s very important we rule that out. Do you have a history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, my. An infection? That doesn't sound good. No, Doctor, I don’t think I have diabetes. No one ever told me I did. My wife, she took care of all the doctor appointments. She always said I was as healthy as a horse. She would always scold me for eating too much poi, but… she never mentioned diabetes. I go to the doctor for checkups, but they never said anything about that. Is it something they would have told me?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Stoegbauer, diabetes is something a doctor would definitely tell you about. And it's very common, especially with age. We need to check your blood sugar levels to be sure. Even if you haven't been diagnosed, it’s best to rule it out. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order a blood test to check your glucose levels, as well as a wound culture to identify any bacteria that may be present in the sore. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps to find out what’s wrong, then yes, please. Blood test and… a culture? Whatever that is. As long as it helps my foot. I just want to be able to walk again without hurting. What will the culture involve? Will it be painful?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The wound culture involves taking a small sample of the fluid or tissue from the sore. We'll use a sterile swab to gently collect the sample. It might feel a little uncomfortable, a brief pinch, but it shouldn't be very painful. I'll also need to ask you some questions about your medical history, allergies, and any medications you're currently taking. And, if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to check your pulses in your feet to assess circulation. Then, we can discuss the next steps once we have the results of the tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A little pinch I can handle. And questions, I can answer questions. My memory isn’t what it used to be, but I’ll do my best. And checking my pulses… yes, that’s fine too. Please, ask away. I hope this helps us figure out what’s wrong with my foot. I just want to be able to walk again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer. Let's start with allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. No, I don't think so. Never had a problem with any medications, as far as I remember. My wife always said I was lucky that way. No allergies to food either. I eat everything, almost! Except… maybe too much poi. But that’s a weakness, not an allergy. No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any pills or anything like that. Never have, really. Just… sometimes a little cream for my skin. But nothing regularly. I try to stay healthy, you know? Fresh air, good food… that’s what I believe in. No medications at all. Nothing prescribed, nothing over-the-counter. Just the cream, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And you mentioned using cream for your skin occasionally. What kind of cream is it?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just a simple lotion. For dry skin. My skin gets very dry, especially in the winter. It’s… it’s a white bottle. I think it’s from the drugstore. Nothing special. My neighbor gave it to me a long time ago. I don’t remember the name, sorry. Just a lotion for dry skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lotion for dry skin, no specific name. Thank you. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes, even if you've already mentioned you haven't been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don’t believe so. My wife always took me to the doctor. She handled all that. I’ve been generally healthy, as far as I know. I’ve had a few aches and pains, you know, being an old man. But nothing serious. No heart trouble, no high blood pressure… nothing the doctor ever told me about. Just the usual aches and pains. No, I don't think I've been diagnosed with anything serious. She would have told me, wouldn't she?
DOCTOR: Yes, she would have. Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm... surgeries. Let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long time ago. And… I think I had a small growth removed from my face, years and years ago. That’s about it. Nothing major, nothing recent. Just the appendix and that little growth. That's all I can remember, Doctor. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a growth removal. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That’s a tough one. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had some trouble with her heart when she got older. My father… he was a strong man, but he had a stroke when he was very old. And… my sister, she had some sort of cancer, a long time ago. But I don’t remember what kind. It’s been so long, Doctor. And we didn’t talk about these things much. Just… heart trouble, a stroke, and cancer. That’s all I can remember. It was a long time ago. And my sister lived far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble, stroke, and cancer in the family. Thank you. Now, I’m going to check your pulses in your feet to assess the circulation. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here I am, Doctor. Be gentle, please. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m checking your pulses now. Your dorsalis pedis pulse is… weak, but present. And your posterior tibial pulse is also weak, but palpable. This suggests there might be some reduced blood flow to your feet. We'll need to investigate this further. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she didn’t like smokers. And I always thought it was a foolish habit. No, never touched a cigarette. Always liked fresh air too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked. That’s good. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little, Doctor. Sometimes, on special occasions. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Or a small beer. Nothing regular, nothing excessive. Just a little now and then. I don't drink very much. Never have. Just enough to be sociable, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, just a little alcohol occasionally. And finally, can you tell me about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well… I used to be very active. I used to love gardening, fishing, walking in the hills. But now… I don’t get around as much. I mostly stay at home. I read, I watch television, I sit on the porch. I go for short walks sometimes, but not very far. My foot… it makes it difficult. I’m not as active as I used to be, Doctor. I mostly rest these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer. Thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, let’s take a closer look at your foot. It appears to be an open sore with some redness and swelling. Given the weak pulses, your age, and the lack of improvement with self-treatment, I’m concerned about the possibility of a developing infection and potential complications. We need to rule out a few things. I'm going to order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection, a blood glucose test to rule out diabetes, and a wound culture to identify any bacteria present in the sore. I’ll also get an x-ray of your foot to check for any underlying bone infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it helps find out what’s wrong, then yes. All those tests. CBC, glucose test, culture, x-ray… whatever you think is best. I just want to be able to walk again, you know? It’s been so long since I’ve been able to enjoy a good walk. Please, do whatever you think is necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer. I understand. I'll get those orders sent to the lab and radiology department right away. A nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. The x-ray technician will then call you when they're ready to take your foot x-ray. In the meantime, I’m going to clean and dress the wound to keep it protected. I'll also recommend that you keep weight off your foot as much as possible until we get the results back. Do you have crutches or a walker at home?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't have crutches or a walker. Never needed them before. I have a cane, but… it doesn't help much with this foot. It’s hard to balance, you know? I mostly just try to stay off it as much as possible. It’s difficult, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. In that case, I’m going to write you a prescription for a temporary walking boot to provide support and reduce pressure on your foot. And I’ll also give you instructions on how to care for the wound at home. A nurse will come in to show you how to apply the dressing and explain the instructions. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to discuss the results of the tests and determine the best course of treatment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A boot? That sounds… helpful. And a follow-up appointment. Yes, that’s good. Let me think… Will the tests be painful? And… how long will it take to get the results back? That’s my biggest concern, really. I just want to know what’s wrong. And… will I be able to walk again?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Stoegbauer. The blood draw will be a quick pinch, but it shouldn’t be very painful. The x-ray is painless; it’s just a brief exposure to radiation. The lab usually takes 24-48 hours to get the results of the blood tests back, and the x-ray results should be available within a few hours. As for whether you’ll be able to walk again, that’s what we’re trying to figure out. The tests will help us determine the cause of the sore and the extent of any infection. Once we have the results, we can develop a treatment plan to help you heal and regain your mobility. I can't promise you a specific outcome right now, but I assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get you walking again. In the meantime, please keep weight off your foot as much as possible, follow the wound care instructions carefully, and call my office immediately if you notice any signs of worsening infection, such as increased pain, redness, swelling, fever, or pus. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reassuring. No, it sounds very sensible. Keep weight off it, follow the instructions, call if it gets worse… I can do that. And I will. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better now, knowing what to expect. I appreciate your kindness. I think that’s all my questions for now. I’ll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any other questions or concerns. I’ll leave you to rest now. The nurse will be in shortly to get started. Have a good day, and we’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: .
