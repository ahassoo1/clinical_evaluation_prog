DOCTOR: Hi Radford, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Condray, is it? Yes. A rather… unpleasant situation, really. Something of a… leakage. Down there. It’s been going on for a bit now, and my wife insisted I come. She fusses terribly, you know. Always has. Though, frankly, I don’t see what the fuss is about. It’s not painful, precisely. Just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A bothersome leakage. Not painful, but concerning enough for your wife to encourage a visit, which is good! To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this leakage?
PATIENT: More about it? Goodness. Where does one begin? It’s… discharge, I suppose. A fluid. Not a great deal, mind you, but… noticeable. Especially on my undergarments. It's… yellowish, I think. Or perhaps greenish? Honestly, the colours all seem the same these days. It's been… a week, maybe two? Time rather slips away, you know. I haven't been feeling particularly unwell otherwise, though. No fever, no… burning. Just this persistent… dampness.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish or greenish discharge for about a week or two, without any fever or burning. And it's not causing any other symptoms besides the dampness. That gives us a starting point. Have you noticed any change in your urination – any difficulty, frequency, or urgency?
PATIENT: Urination… now, let me think. No difficulty, no. It flows as it always has. As for frequency… well, I go when I need to, naturally. Perhaps a little more often than usual, now that you mention it. But that could simply be the heat. It’s been dreadfully warm lately, hasn’t it? I’m not one to dwell on such things, Doctor. Old men go to the bathroom more, I expect. It’s just… nature, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You're right, frequency can definitely increase with age, and the heat certainly plays a role. But it's good we're noting it. Now, have you noticed any odor associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Odor… yes. A rather… unpleasant one, I’m afraid. Not overpowering, thankfully. But noticeable. A sort of… stale smell. I can’t quite place it. Not like anything I’ve encountered before, really. My wife mentioned it first, of course. She has a very sensitive nose, you see. Always complaining about something. Though, in fairness, it is rather… distinct.
DOCTOR: Okay, a distinct, stale odor along with the yellowish/greenish discharge and increased frequency. Radford, to get a clearer understanding, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An exam? Goodness me. I haven't had one of those in… well, decades, I suspect. Very well, Doctor. If you insist. Though, I must say, I find the whole thing rather… undignified. I trust you’ve seen this sort of thing before? One wouldn’t want to be a novice, now, would one?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Radford. I’ve seen plenty of this, and I assure you, it's a very routine part of the exam. I'll do my best to make it as comfortable and quick as possible. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table, and I’ll just take a look. Let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. Alright, if you could just lie back for me... and we'll get started. Okay, I’m just taking a look now... I do notice some mild redness and discharge at the urethral opening. No obvious signs of injury or inflammation beyond that. I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen as well, just to check for any tenderness or swelling. No significant tenderness there either. Overall, it doesn't seem to be anything acutely concerning, but the discharge does need to be investigated. I’m going to order a urine analysis and a urine culture. That will help us determine if there’s an infection present and what kind of bacteria might be causing it.
PATIENT: Palpating, you say? Rather intrusive, if you ask me. But very well. An infection, you believe? Honestly, I haven’t been feeling unwell at all. Perhaps it’s just… old age creeping up. These things happen, you know. I suppose a urine sample won't be too terrible. Though, I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a rather important appointment with the garden club later this week, and I wouldn't want to miss it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Radford. It's good that you aren't feeling unwell overall – that's a positive sign. And you’re right, it could be a simple infection, or something else entirely. The tests will help us pinpoint the cause. We'll get the sample collected quickly, and it shouldn’t interfere with your garden club appointment. Here's a sterile cup. I’ll leave you with some privacy to collect a sample. Please try to catch the mid-stream portion – that’s the most accurate for testing. Just follow the instructions here, and I’ll be right outside when you're finished. Let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: Mid-stream, you say? Honestly, the indignities just keep piling up. Very well. Let's get this over with. Garden club… can't miss the prize-winning roses…
DOCTOR: Alright, Radford, I have your sample. We'll send this off to the lab right away. It usually takes 24-48 hours to get the results back. In the meantime, to be on the safe side, I'm going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics. It's a broad-spectrum antibiotic, so it should cover most common infections. If it turns out to be something else, we can adjust the treatment accordingly. I'll also recommend increasing your fluid intake – drink plenty of water. And avoid any irritating soaps or lotions in that area. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Antibiotics, you say? Broad-spectrum, is it? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for all these medications. They never seem to do much good. But very well. If you insist. Increasing fluids… I suppose that’s sensible. And avoiding irritating soaps… my wife will be pleased to hear that. She’s always fussing about what I use. Will this medication have any… side effects? I have a rather delicate constitution, you know. And I absolutely must be in good form for the garden club judging.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Radford. It’s always best to be cautious with medications. The broad-spectrum antibiotic I’m prescribing – Cephalexin – is generally well-tolerated. The most common side effects are mild nausea or diarrhea, but those usually resolve on their own. In rare cases, some people experience allergic reactions, so we’ll be watching for any rash, itching, or difficulty breathing. Here's the prescription. Take it as directed – twice a day for seven days. If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking the medication immediately and contact me. I’ve also given you a sheet outlining the potential side effects and my contact information. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll follow up in a week to see how you're doing and review the lab results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Seven days, you say? Very well. Hopefully, it won't interfere with my rose bushes. Hmm… no, I don’t believe I have any further questions at this time. Just… please, Doctor, do try to keep the medication to a minimum. I’m a rather… sensitive individual, you know. Thank you for your time. Though, frankly, I’m not entirely convinced anything good will come of this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Radford. I understand your concerns, and I'll certainly keep the medication to a minimum. We’ll monitor your progress closely, and adjust the treatment plan if needed. I hope you feel better soon and enjoy your garden club judging. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day, Radford.
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. Though, I remain skeptical.
