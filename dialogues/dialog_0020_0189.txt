DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Beinborn, you say? Well, it’s about time someone got around to seeing me. It’s my… plumbing, mostly. Been noticing a bit of red when I… well, you know. Not a good sign, is it? I’ve seen things in my life, flown all sorts of places, and this is concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re noticing some blood when you use the restroom. That’s definitely something we want to look into. Just to be clear, is this blood bright red, or darker in color?
PATIENT: Bright red, mostly. Sometimes a little… mixed in, you could say. Like raspberry jam, though I haven’t had good raspberry jam in years. Honestly, everything tastes bland these days. It's probably something serious, knowing my luck. I always get the bad batches of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright red blood is often a sign of something closer to the rectum. “Mixed in,” you said?
PATIENT: Well, it's not separate, if that's what you mean. It’s in the stool. All through it. Like… like someone stirred it up. And it's been going on for a few days now, maybe a week. Can’t rightly remember. Things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, you understand. I used to be able to land a plane in pea soup, but remembering when I last… went to the bathroom? That’s a challenge now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s completely normal for memory to be affected as we get older. “All through it,” you said - so the entire stool is affected?
PATIENT: Yes, the entire stool. Not just a drop here or there, mind you. The whole thing. And it's... well, it’s not a pleasant sight, I can tell you that much. Makes a fella worry, doesn’t it? At my age, you don’t bounce back like you used to. Everything’s a bit more… final.
DOCTOR: It does sound concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, I've been a bit tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And… my stomach’s been rumbling a bit. Not pain, exactly. More like… unsettled. And I haven’t been as regular as I used to be, if you catch my drift. Everything just feels… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, some abdominal rumbling, and changes in your bowel habits. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. My clothes feel a bit looser, now that you mention it. I haven’t actually stepped on a scale in… well, a long time. I used to be a lean fella, always had to watch my weight for flying. But I haven’t been worrying about that much these days. Everything's just… going downhill.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Nausea… no, not really. I haven't thrown up a thing. Dizziness… occasionally, when I stand up too fast. But that's just old age, I figure. Happens to everyone at my time of life. I’m not made of iron, you know.
DOCTOR: Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, lovely. Just what an old man needs. More poking and prodding. Still… better to know, I suppose. Don't want anything nasty lurking around. Yes, alright. Get on with it. But don't expect me to be comfortable, alright? I’ve got sensitive skin. And I don’t appreciate surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. We'll take it slow and easy. I'll explain everything as we go. First, I’d like to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll just do a quick digital rectal exam. It won’t be pleasant, but it’s important to check for any abnormalities. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Digital… what now? You’re going to poke around down there? Honestly. I haven’t had anyone poke around there in decades. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t you just, I don’t know, take a sample of the… you know? I’d much prefer that to someone sticking their finger.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom. A digital rectal exam allows me to feel for any lumps or tenderness that might not be visible otherwise. It’s a very important part of the examination, especially given your symptoms. We can collect a stool sample as well, absolutely. But the exam provides more immediate information. It will only take a moment, and I will be as gentle as possible. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Hmph. Gentle. You young doctors all say that. Still… I suppose if it's absolutely necessary. But don’t go digging around too much. And warn me before you… well, you know. I don’t like surprises. And try to be quick about it. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I'll explain everything as I go and we’ll go as slowly as you’d like. I'll also warn you before each step. “First, I’m going to ask you to lie on your side with your knees bent. Then, I'll apply a little lubricant to the finger, and gently insert it into the rectum to feel for any abnormalities. It might be uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. If you feel any pain, please let me know immediately.” “Are you ready for me to begin?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But I’m warning you, if it hurts, I’m going to say something. Don’t think I won’t. And don’t you go rummaging around in there like you’re looking for treasure. Just a quick look, alright? A quick look.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. A quick look. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. "Okay, Mr. Rowbottom, I'm just applying a little lubricant now… and gently inserting my finger. Please take a few deep breaths. This will only take a moment.” “Okay, I’m finished. I did feel some… slight irregularities. Nothing immediately alarming, but it does warrant further investigation." "I'd like to order a fecal occult blood test to check for hidden blood in your stool, and a complete blood count to assess your overall health. We should also consider a colonoscopy to get a better look at your colon.”
PATIENT: Colonoscopy? Now you're talking. That sounds… unpleasant. Is that absolutely necessary? I've heard stories about those things. And what about the blood test? Will that require a lot of poking around? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like a pin cushion.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom. A colonoscopy is the most accurate way to visualize the colon and identify any potential problems like polyps or tumors. It does require bowel preparation, which is often the least pleasant part, and a mild sedative. “However, given your symptoms – the bright red blood, fatigue, and potential weight loss – it’s important to rule out anything serious. The fecal occult blood test is a simple stool sample that can be collected at home. It won’t require any poking around at all.” "The blood test will require a small sample from your arm, but it will provide valuable information about your overall health and help us determine the best course of action. We can discuss the risks and benefits of each test in more detail, and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have.”
PATIENT: Hmph. Risks and benefits. Always with the risks and benefits. Fine, fine. I'll do the stool sample. Anything to avoid more poking and prodding. But that colonoscopy… I need time to think about that. And I want a full explanation of what’s involved. No sugarcoating, alright? I’ve lived long enough to know doctors sometimes… omit details.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I completely understand. You deserve a full and honest explanation, and I promise there will be no sugarcoating. “This pamphlet provides a good overview of the procedure. Essentially, it involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera into your rectum to visualize your colon. We'll give you a sedative to help you relax, and it typically takes about 30-60 minutes. The biggest challenge is the bowel preparation, which involves drinking a large volume of liquid to clear out your colon.” “We'll discuss the risks and benefits in detail, and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have. We can also schedule a consultation with a gastroenterologist if you’d like a second opinion. For now, let’s focus on getting the stool sample collected and scheduling the blood test.”
PATIENT: Fine. Blood test and… the stool sample. Get it over with. Just tell me how to collect this… sample. And make it quick. I don’t want to spend the rest of my day fussing with… that. And no surprises, alright? I want clear instructions.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. Clear instructions. It’s very straightforward. I’ll give you a collection kit with simple instructions. You'll need to collect a small amount of stool after your next bowel movement – about the size of a walnut is sufficient. The kit includes a special paper to place the sample on, and a container to keep it in. "The instructions emphasize the importance of avoiding certain foods and medications before collecting the sample – the sheet has a full list. You'll need to bring the sample to the lab within 24 hours, and the results usually take a few days. Here’s the lab’s address and phone number." “Do you have any questions about the collection process?
PATIENT: Walnut size, you say? Well, that's… manageable. And no certain foods? Oh, bother. I just want a nice biscuit with my tea. Alright, I think I understand. Lab address, phone number… check. I suppose I can handle this… inconvenience. No, I don't think so. Just… get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get back to my peace and quiet.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. We've covered the stool sample, the blood test, and we've discussed the colonoscopy. I’ll order those tests for you now. The lab will contact you to schedule your blood draw. “I’ll also follow up with you in a few days to discuss the results and answer any further questions you may have. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, or dizziness – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately." “Do you have any final questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Hmph. No, I don't think so. Just… try to remember I’m not made of iron. And don't expect me to be cheerful about all this poking and prodding. I appreciate you explaining things, I suppose. Alright then. I’ll be on my way. Let’s just hope this doesn’t turn into a complete disaster.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand. We’ll take things one step at a time. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. "It was nice to meet you. Take care and get some rest.”
