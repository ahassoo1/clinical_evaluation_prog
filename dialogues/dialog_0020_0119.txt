DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It's...well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be frank. I don't usually bother doctors with...this. But it's been going on a little while now, and I thought I really ought to get it checked. It's... a discharge. From, well, down there. A man’s problem, really, but… my son is away and… well, it’s his problem, and he sent me to get it looked at.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're getting it checked out, and you're right to be concerned if it’s been ongoing. It's not embarrassing at all to seek medical attention, and we'll get to the bottom of it. Just to clarify – this discharge is related to your son’s health concern, and you are seeking care on his behalf?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. He’s... a bit hesitant, you see. Doesn’t like doctors much. Thinks he’s fine, mostly. But I noticed it, and well… a mother knows, doesn’t she? He said it doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… is there. And it's not… pleasant. It’s a bit… yellowish, I think. Though honestly, I'm not terribly good at distinguishing colors these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very thoughtful of you to be so attentive to his health, and it's good he has someone looking out for him. Not everyone is comfortable with medical visits. So, just to be sure I have it right: he’s experiencing a discharge that he describes as not painful, but noticeable, and you've observed it to be yellowish in color. Has he noticed any other symptoms—burning, itching, odor, or any changes in urination?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… he has been going to the bathroom more frequently, I suppose. And he did complain, just the other day, about a bit of… discomfort when he finished, if you catch my drift. Not pain, precisely, but… a stinging, he said. He didn't seem overly concerned about it, thought it might just be… exertion, or something. Honestly, he’s not very forthcoming with details. A typical young man, you know how they are.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do know. It's common. So, increased frequency of urination and a stinging sensation after urination… that’s helpful information. Has this been happening recently, or for a while now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… a month, maybe? Hard to say precisely. He doesn't volunteer information unless I specifically ask, and even then… it’s usually a very brief answer. The stinging is newer, I think. He mentioned it just last week. The frequency, though, he’s been running to the bathroom more often for a while now. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel terribly foolish explaining all this. It’s his body, not mine.
DOCTOR: Not foolish at all, Jinnie. You’re a concerned mother, and that’s perfectly valid. It's very helpful for me to have a full picture, even if the details are coming indirectly. Okay, so we have a yellowish discharge, increased urinary frequency for about a month, and a stinging sensation after urination that’s developed within the last week. Now, has he had any fever, chills, or any lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, that I’ve noticed. And no abdominal pain. He’s quite active, you see. Works construction, very physical job. Always complaining about aches and pains from that, but I don’t think it’s anything more than the usual. He's a very sturdy young man. Always has been. No, nothing like abdominal pain. I would have noticed that, certainly.
DOCTOR: Good, no fever, chills, or abdominal pain. That’s helpful. Alright, Jinnie, to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your son, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. It will involve listening to his abdomen, and then a gentle examination of the genital area. Of course, I’ll explain everything as I go, and he can stop me at any time if he’s uncomfortable. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. Though I’m not entirely sure he'll allow it. He’s a bit… sensitive, you see. Doesn't like anyone poking around. But I can try. Though I warn you, Doctor, he can be quite stubborn. And I’m not as strong as I used to be, so… restraining him might be difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We will proceed gently and at his pace. I’m very experienced with these types of examinations, and I’ll be very respectful of his comfort level. We won’t force anything. If he’s not comfortable, we can discuss alternative approaches, like a referral to a specialist. Perhaps if you explain to him that I’m just trying to understand what’s going on and that we can stop at any time, that might help. Would you like me to come out and speak with him directly?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be… lovely, actually. Perhaps you explaining it would be more effective than me. He tends to tune me out, you see. Thinks I worry too much. Yes, please, if you wouldn't mind. He's in the waiting room, I believe. Just let me quickly… freshen my lipstick. I feel dreadful sending him in looking like this.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Give me just a moment to review his chart again, and I’ll go speak with him. You take your time. I'll meet you both back in the examination room shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. You are a very kind woman. I’ll just sit here for a moment.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: .
