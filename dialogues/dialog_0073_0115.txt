DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my skin. It’s turned rather yellow, you see. A bit worrying, it is. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it's been getting more noticeable. Something about… the liver, I believe? The young man at the front desk mentioned something. It's all a bit muddled, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Hmm, yes, I see a note here about the front desk staff mentioning possible jaundice. Alright. And you say it’s been getting more noticeable… Can you describe where on your skin you’re noticing this yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, really. But… mostly on my face, I think. And… the whites of my eyes, too. They aren’t very white anymore, are they? I… I don’t remember the last time they were white, come to think of it. Is that bad? I do apologize, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, yellowing of the skin and eyes – that’s what we call jaundice, as the young man mentioned. It can indicate a problem with the liver, but there are other possibilities as well. We’ll need to investigate further. Now, besides the yellowing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, other symptoms… Let me think. I… I’ve been feeling rather tired lately. More so than usual, perhaps. And… a bit of an ache, around my stomach. Though, I have aches and pains everywhere these days, so it's difficult to say if it’s connected. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure. Everything feels a bit… foggy. Is this something serious? I do hope not.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue and abdominal discomfort… We need to rule some things out. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements…? Oh dear. I… I suppose they’ve been a little paler than usual, yes. And… not as frequent. But I always have trouble with those sorts of details, you see. It's not something I pay much attention to, I’m afraid. Is it important, Doctor? I truly don't mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Durig. Changes in bowel habits can be a clue. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No nausea or vomiting. I’ve been eating alright, I suppose. Not much of an appetite, but… I haven’t been sick, no. I’m just… very tired. And this yellowing, it’s quite alarming, you see. I do hope it's nothing too serious. I haven't had much luck with my health lately, I must confess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any liver problems – hepatitis, cirrhosis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Hepatitis… I… I believe I had something once, a long time ago. When I was much younger. A doctor gave me some injections, I think. But it was so long ago, I can barely remember the details. Something about being very ill after a trip… somewhere. Europe, perhaps? It’s all terribly foggy, I’m afraid. And cirrhosis… no, I don’t believe so. I don't recall ever being told that. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is a complete mess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me see… Oh, yes. I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. And… I think I had something done on my knee, a long time ago. But it was so long ago, and so many doctors, you see. It's all rather blurred. I apologize for being so unhelpful, Doctor. I wish I could remember things more clearly. It’s a dreadful feeling, not knowing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal and a knee surgery… Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family…? Oh, dear. My husband passed away many years ago. No children, I’m afraid. And… my siblings are all gone now, too. I'm rather alone, you see. I don't know if anyone in my family had… whatever it is I might have. It’s been so long since I’ve thought about it. I truly apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be of more help. Is this going to take much longer? I have… a little appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll keep this as brief as possible. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see... Just a little something for my arthritis, you see. It helps with the aches and pains. And… sometimes I take something for sleep, when I can’t get to rest. That’s all, I think. A very small dose, mind you. Nothing too strong. I don't really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Would you like to know the names, Doctor? I believe I have them written down somewhere… in the kitchen, perhaps? It would take me a moment to fetch them, though.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright for now. We can perhaps get that information later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don't believe so. Never had any problems with allergies, thankfully. I can eat whatever I like, and I've never had a reaction to any pills or anything. So that's one thing I don't have to worry about. But truthfully, Doctor, I am quite tired now. Is there anything else you need to know? I do have that appointment, you see, and I wouldn't want to be late. It's just a little hair appointment, but… still. I really do appreciate you seeing me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Durig, based on what you’ve told me, we need to investigate this jaundice further. I’m going to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. And then, I’ll need to order some blood tests to check your liver function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, yes. Blood tests… very well. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… a physical exam? Is that going to be… uncomfortable? I do hope not. I have a rather sensitive stomach, you see. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a fan of doctors, if I’m being truthful. But I appreciate you taking the time to see me. Please be gentle, won't you? And… could you tell me what you suspect it might be, once you’ve had the results? I do hate being kept in the dark. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. I will be as gentle as possible. Let's start with listening to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. And I understand your concern about the unknown. We'll do everything we can to get a clear answer quickly. I'm listening for any unusual sounds... Hmm. Slightly distended, but soft to the touch. No obvious tenderness, which is good. Now, I'm going to palpate your liver. It may be slightly enlarged, but difficult to say definitively at this point. No sharp pain on palpation, but there is a mild discomfort. Finally, I will examine your sclera… Yes, as you mentioned, definite jaundice present. The whites of your eyes are significantly yellowed. Overall, these findings are consistent with possible liver dysfunction. We'll need those blood tests to confirm. I'll have the nurse draw them right away.
