DOCTOR: Right. Reneisha Selbitschka, age 41. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Todoro-vich. It’s… Selbitschka, pronounced Sell-bit-ska. And I apologize for the pronunciation, it trips people up often. I’ve been experiencing… a rather perplexing weight gain, and I haven’t altered my diet or exercise routine. It’s quite concerning, actually.
DOCTOR: Sell-bit-ska. Yes, well. It’s…common for weight to fluctuate. But perplexing, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, perplexing. I maintain a very… structured life, Doctor. I work as an orderly at the hospital – a physically demanding job, as you can imagine – and my husband and I have the same dinner every Tuesday. It's roast chicken, always. And yet, over the past six months, I’ve gained nearly twenty pounds. It’s… unusual for me. And it's affecting my ability to do my job comfortably.
DOCTOR: Right. Twenty pounds in six months. And you’re certain there haven’t been any changes to your usual routine, aside from the weight gain?
PATIENT: Positive, Doctor. Absolutely certain. I keep a… rather detailed schedule. My husband would notice if I started snacking, and I assure you, he would say something. We both enjoy a consistent lifestyle. I wake at six, prepare breakfast, leave for work at seven-thirty, finish my shift at three-thirty, and then… well, it’s very predictable. Perhaps… is there a test you could run? To determine the cause?
DOCTOR: A test… Well, we can certainly consider some basic bloodwork. But before we jump to that, let’s try to be thorough. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… Let me think. My sleep has been… a little disrupted. Not severely, but I wake up more often than usual, and I haven’t been feeling quite as… energetic. Though that could be the job, truthfully. And… now that you mention it, my hands do feel a little… swollen sometimes. Not constantly, but periodically. Is that relevant? I apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Swollen hands, disrupted sleep… Alright. And your appetite is the same as usual?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely the same. I eat the same portions, the same meals, at the same times. It’s quite baffling, Doctor. I feel as though I’m describing a broken clock; everything is functioning as it should, yet the outcome is… incorrect. It’s unsettling, to be frank. Is it possible this is… something more serious? I worry about my heart, if I am being honest.
DOCTOR: Now, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Worrying won’t help. We’ll run some basic tests to rule things out. Have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: No, not recently. The last time I was ill was… Last February, I had a rather nasty cold, but that was short-lived. Just the usual sniffles and aches. Nothing significant. I've always been quite resilient, health-wise. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Though, I suppose that doesn't preclude a sudden… change. Do these tests require fasting? I have a very strict schedule, as you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, some will. We’ll need a lipid panel, and that requires a twelve-hour fast. And a complete metabolic panel. Frankly, given your… insistence on everything being normal, we’ll need a thyroid panel as well. Just to be thorough. I’ll have the nurse draw the labs now. Afterwards, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your vitals and listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: That… sounds reasonable, Doctor. A thyroid panel, you say? I haven’t considered that. A twelve-hour fast will be… inconvenient, but necessary, I suppose. My husband can manage, though he does prefer me to cook. Very well. Let's proceed with the labs and the examination. I appreciate your thoroughness. Perhaps… it is simply a minor imbalance. Though, as I said, it’s quite perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nurse will be in shortly. And while we're waiting, let’s get your height and weight documented.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. One hundred and thirty-eight pounds. And my height is… five feet two inches. It's unfortunate, really. I used to be much lighter. A more manageable weight. Is there anything else you require at this time?
DOCTOR: No, that’s sufficient for now. Let’s just wait for the nurse. Don't change clothes, she'll need to take your blood pressure and listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will remain here, as instructed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a moment.
PATIENT: I am ready when you are.
