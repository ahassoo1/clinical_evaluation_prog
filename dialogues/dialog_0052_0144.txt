DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s lovely to meet you. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Dr. Shely, is it? Well, I don’t rightly know why I’m here, to be honest. My daughter just said I should come. Said I ought to… check things out. Old age, I suppose. It's not like anything's wrong, you know? Just... being thorough.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's always wise to be proactive with one’s health, and it’s excellent that your daughter encouraged you to come in for a check-up. That's very thoughtful of her. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit more about any specific concerns you have, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Concerns? Hmm. Well, my knees ache something fierce when it rains. Always have, but it's worse lately, I think. And I forget things, naturally. Though, everyone forgets things, don’t they? I mostly just… misplace my reading glasses. It's a nuisance, really. I swear I had them just a moment ago...
DOCTOR: It’s common for joints to ache with changes in weather, and forgetfulness can certainly happen as we age. We’ll address both of those. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit more about the knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not a constant pain, dear. More of a… throbbing, when the air gets damp. And it gets worse if I’ve been on my feet too long. I used to garden, you see. Loved my roses. Can't do much of that anymore, though. Hurts too much to bend down. It’s probably just old age catching up with me, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Gardening is wonderful exercise, but I understand how it can strain the joints. We'll explore that further. You mentioned it worsens with damp weather and prolonged standing. Does it affect your ability to walk, or is it more of a discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, walkin’ isn't a problem, thankfully. I still get around just fine. It’s more like… a stiffness, a reminder that I’m not twenty anymore. It doesn’t stop me, mind you, but I don’t bounce around like I used to! And I definitely need to sit down after a bit. It just… bothers me.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. It sounds like it’s not severely limiting your activity, but causing discomfort. Now, you also mentioned some forgetfulness. Is this a recent change, or something that’s been gradually occurring over time?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… a while, now. Not like I can pinpoint a specific date, you see. My daughter keeps saying I ask the same questions twice. And I leave things in odd places. Like the TV remote in the refrigerator. Silly things. I just… don't always remember where I put things. It’s probably just me getting old, really.
DOCTOR: It’s common to experience some memory lapses with age, and it sounds like your daughter is rightly observant. To help me better understand, do you have any difficulty remembering recent events, or is it more related to misplacing items and repeating questions?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s mostly the little things, I think. Like what I had for breakfast this morning. Or the name of that nice young man who delivers the mail. Not big things, mind you. I know who my daughter is! I just… it slips my mind sometimes. And then I worry I’m becoming a bother.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel concerned when experiencing memory changes, and it’s good you’re aware of them. It’s very common for memory recall to vary. To get a broader picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that's a question. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out, goodness, years ago. And I broke my wrist when I was a child, fell out of a tree, silly me. Aside from that… I don’t rightly remember much. I go to the doctor for my check-ups, of course, and I take a little pill for my blood pressure, I think? Honestly, my daughter handles most of that.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful. I see here in your chart you had a cholecystectomy—gallbladder removal—in 1998 and a wrist fracture as a child. It also indicates you are currently prescribed Lisinopril for hypertension, as you mentioned. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I used to get hives when I was a girl, but that was a long time ago. Nothing I’ve noticed lately. My daughter always asks, and I always say no. I don't recall ever having a serious reaction to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… Now that’s a difficult one. My mother… she lived a long life, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses. She was a strong woman, always busy. My father… he passed when I was young, I think. A heart condition, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I was just a child. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s common for details to become less clear over time. Now, to understand a little more about your lifestyle, could you tell me about your typical diet and exercise routine?
PATIENT: Oh, my diet… well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of vegetables, when I can. I used to love to cook, but it’s just me now, so I mostly just have simple things. Soup and sandwiches. Toast. Nothing fancy. And exercise… I walk a little, when the weather is nice. Mostly just around the house, to be honest. And I sit a lot. I enjoy watching television.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, Ms. Calvery, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will help me assess your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s fine. Though I don’t expect you’ll find anything particularly wrong! Just doing my due diligence, I suppose. Go right ahead. I suppose it can’t hurt, can it?
DOCTOR: Very good. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148/82, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Finally, I'll just do a quick neurological assessment. Gait is slightly unsteady, but stable. Balance is within normal limits. Everything appears within reasonable limits for your age, Ms. Calvery. However, the slightly unsteady gait and mildly elevated blood pressure warrant some attention.
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s a lot of fancy words, dear! Unsteady gait, you say? Well, I am getting older, aren’t I? And blood pressure...my daughter keeps telling me to watch my salt intake. So, what does all that mean? Am I sick? You’re not telling me anything terrible, are you?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Calvery, I am not telling you anything terrible at all. It simply means we have a couple of areas to monitor and potentially address to help keep you healthy. The unsteady gait can be common with age and can often be improved with exercises to strengthen your legs and improve your balance. And the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to manage, as consistently high blood pressure can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. It’s a very common condition, and often manageable with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. Based on our conversation and the examination, I’d like to order some blood work to get a more complete picture of your overall health, including your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and thyroid function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that doesn't sound too bad. Blood work… I’ve had that before. Anything to keep me ticking along, I suppose. And if it keeps my daughter happy, even better! So, yes, dear, go ahead and order whatever tests you think are necessary. Just… no surprises, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. I will order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, a complete blood count, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. The results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to maintain a healthy diet—focusing on fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins—and incorporating regular, gentle exercise into your routine. Even a short walk each day can make a difference. I’d also like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and formulate a plan based on what we find. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that’s fine. Gives me time to… forget what you told me, probably. But seriously, yes, that works. And I'll try to walk more. My daughter will be pleased to hear that. And I'll try to eat my vegetables, though I still prefer a nice bowl of soup.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And don’t worry too much about remembering everything, Ms. Calvery. That’s what the follow-up appointment is for. Before we conclude, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… no, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, dear, even if I don't remember half of it. Just… thank you. You've been very patient with an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Calvery. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. Here is a printout of the lab orders and a summary of our conversation. Have a wonderful day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You too. And tell your daughter thank you for sending me. I suppose it’s good to get these things checked out, even if I don’t always understand why. Now, where did I park the car…? .
