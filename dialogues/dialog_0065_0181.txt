DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I requested a general check-up, a sort of… a look at everything, if you will. I just turned seventy-four, you see, and while I feel quite well, I believe it’s prudent to have a comprehensive assessment done. I like to stay ahead of things, if possible. My wife suggested it too, naturally. She always looks out for me.
DOCTOR: A comprehensive assessment, alright. Seventy-four is… a good age for that, I suppose. Though, frankly, most people wait until something is wrong. But, we can certainly do that. To start, let’s go through your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… hmm. Let me think. As a young man, I had a rather nasty bout of malaria when I was visiting family in the interior, back in Venezuela, of course. That was… oh, goodness, nearly fifty years ago now. I recovered fully, though. Other than that, nothing major, thankfully. A few broken bones working construction over the years – a sprained wrist here, a cracked rib there – but nothing that required a lengthy hospital stay. Just the usual wear and tear, I suppose. Is that the sort of thing you're looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: "The usual wear and tear" isn’t entirely helpful, Mr. Mombrun. We need specifics. Were these fractures recent?
PATIENT: Ah, you are quite right, Doctor. My apologies. Specifics it is. Let me see… the wrist, that was… approximately twenty years ago. A bit of a tumble off some scaffolding. It healed cleanly, with a cast for about six weeks. The rib… that was more recent. Perhaps five years ago? I was lifting a rather heavy beam, misjudged the weight, and… well, a sharp pain. No break, thankfully, just a bad contusion and a few cracked ribs. I took it easy for a month or so, and it healed on its own. I haven’t had any issues with either since. Does that clarify things for you, Doctor? I do tend to ramble, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Yes, actually. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, perhaps ten or twelve years of age. It was a rather common procedure, even back then. And… let me see… oh, yes! About fifteen years ago, I had a small growth removed from my back. Benign, thankfully, the doctor assured me. A simple outpatient procedure. Nothing serious at all. I believe that’s everything, Doctor. I’m quite meticulous about remembering these things, you see. My wife always jokes I have a better memory than she does.
DOCTOR: A better memory than your wife is… common, Mr. Mombrun. Now, family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my wife does say I remember everything… perhaps to a fault! As for family history… that is a bit more complicated. My father, he lived to a good age, eighty-seven, but he suffered from high blood pressure in his later years. My mother… she passed away relatively young, at sixty-two, from complications related to diabetes. It was a difficult time. And… my older brother, he had heart disease. He needed a bypass operation about ten years ago. Still going strong, though, thankfully. He lives in Caracas. Does that give you a reasonable overview, Doctor? It’s a large family, you see, scattered across several countries.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. No, Doctor, I don't believe so. I’ve never had any reaction to any medication I’ve ever taken. I've had the usual antibiotics for various minor infections over the years, and some pain relievers for the injuries I mentioned, but never any adverse effects. No allergies to food, no hay fever, no skin irritations… nothing at all, thankfully. My wife always says I'm remarkably robust. Is that sufficient, Doctor? I do try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, you see. I eat a balanced diet and get regular exercise, when my knees allow, of course.
DOCTOR: And currently, are you taking any medications, even over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Currently… yes, as a matter of fact. I take a low dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, as a preventative measure, Doctor. My physician recommended it about two years ago. It seems to be doing its job. And… I take a daily multivitamin, just to ensure I'm getting all the necessary nutrients. And… occasionally, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen, over-the-counter, of course. But that’s only when absolutely necessary. Other than that, nothing at all, Doctor. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. I believe in a natural approach to health, you see.
DOCTOR: "A natural approach," of course. Right. And your social history?
PATIENT: My… social history, Doctor? What precisely are you asking? I'm a married man, as I mentioned. We enjoy spending time with our grandchildren. I’ve been a construction laborer for nearly fifty years. Is that what you mean? I’m not entirely certain what sort of ‘social’ information is relevant to my health assessment. I hope you don’t mind my asking. Perhaps you could clarify your question for me, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no, Doctor! Absolutely not! Never have, never will. My father was a smoker, and he suffered terribly for it. It’s a dreadful habit, and I’ve always avoided it. My wife would never allow it, either. She’s a very health-conscious woman. A clean living, Doctor, that’s what I believe in. Is that what you were trying to ascertain?
DOCTOR: And alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol… yes. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner on occasion. Perhaps two or three times a week. Nothing excessive, Doctor. A moderate amount, for enjoyment. And, occasionally, a small glass of brandy after a particularly hard day at work. But that's a rare occurrence. My wife also enjoys a glass of wine with dinner, you see, so it's a shared pleasure. We certainly don't drink to excess. A relaxed indulgence, that’s what it is. Does that answer your question adequately, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I'll start with your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you require. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position. My knees aren't quite what they used to be, you see. And please, don't hesitate to ask if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm entirely at your disposal. Proceed when you’re ready, Doctor. I trust your expertise entirely.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Everything seems… within acceptable limits for your age. A bit of hypertension, but nothing that can't be managed.
PATIENT: That's… reassuring to hear, Doctor. I do try to take care of myself. My wife always tells me I worry too much, but one can never be too cautious, can one? Is there anything else you need to examine, Doctor? Or are we finished with the physical portion of the assessment? I'm quite prepared for whatever you require. Perhaps we could discuss the lab results now? I’m keen to understand what the numbers reveal, if you don’t mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: We’ll get to the labs. Now, I want to check your thyroid. Please extend your neck. Thyroid feels… normal. No nodules detected. Alright. That completes the physical exam for now. I've ordered some routine blood work to assess your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. We'll review those results together when they come back. I also want to run a complete metabolic panel, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. That all seems… quite comprehensive, and I appreciate your thoroughness. When can I expect the results to be available? And how will I receive them? Will you contact me directly, or will I need to schedule a follow-up appointment? I’m rather busy with work, you see, so knowing the timeframe is helpful. And will the results be explained in language I can understand? I’m not a medical professional, as you may have gathered.
DOCTOR: The results should be available in approximately three to five business days. My assistant will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. And yes, I will explain them in layman’s terms. However, I do expect you to ask questions if anything is unclear. Do you have any questions now before we conclude this initial assessment?
PATIENT: Hmm… Yes, actually. One small question, if you don’t mind. You mentioned the hypertension, my blood pressure being slightly elevated. Is that something I should be concerned about immediately? Should I be making any changes to my lifestyle now, before we receive the lab results? Perhaps reducing my salt intake, or increasing my exercise, even though my knees aren’t cooperating? Or is it too early to make any adjustments without a more comprehensive picture? I just want to be proactive, you see, and ensure I'm doing everything I can to maintain my health.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your proactive attitude, Mr. Mombrun, it's premature to make drastic changes based on a single blood pressure reading. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle – a balanced diet, regular exercise within your limitations, and stress management – is always advisable. Reducing your salt intake wouldn't hurt. But I need to see the lab results to determine the best course of action. Let’s wait for those results before we jump to any conclusions. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. My assistant will be in touch shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. Thank you for your time and expertise. I appreciate you taking the time to address my concerns. I shall await my assistant’s call and look forward to discussing the results with you. I wish you a pleasant day, Doctor. And thank you once again. .
DOCTOR: Good day.
