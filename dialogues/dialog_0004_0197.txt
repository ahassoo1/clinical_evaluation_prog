DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarotta. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Just trying to get this card so I can keep driving, you know? For work. It’s… a commercial driver thing, I think? They said I needed a check-up for it. I want to be quick, if that’s alright. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. A commercial driver’s license physical. Yes, I understand. We'll try to be efficient. However, these are important exams, Mrs. Sciarotta, and I need to ask a thorough set of questions to ensure your safety, and the safety of others on the road. It's not simply about getting a card. Now, let's start with the basics. Do you have any current medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, safety first. You’re right. Let’s see… well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years now? And my knees aren’t what they used to be, but who’s knees are at my age? Nothing the doctors ever really worried about, though. I take something for a little high blood pressure, a small pill each morning. That’s about it, I think. I really try to stay on top of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cholecystectomy twenty years ago, some knee discomfort… and you mentioned medication for hypertension. Can you tell me the name of that medication, and the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… it’s a little white pill… Lisinopril, I think? Yes, Lisinopril. And the dosage… it’s… 20 milligrams, I believe. Every morning with my breakfast. I always make sure to take it with food, like the doctor told me. It’s been a long time, so it's hard to remember everything exactly. But I haven't missed a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. Consistency is important. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I used to think I was allergic to cats, but it turned out it was just the dust they carry around! So, no. Nothing I’m aware of. I eat pretty much anything. I like sushi, if that tells you anything. No allergies, Doctor. Lucky me, right?
DOCTOR: “Lucky” is a relative term, Mrs. Sciarotta. We still need to cover a few more areas. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a long one. My mother, she had diabetes, type 2, I think. And her mother, my grandmother, she had heart trouble. My father… he lived a long life, but he had some problems with his prostate when he got older. Nothing major on my siblings' side, as far as I know. They're not the best at keeping me updated. That’s about it, I suppose. The usual old-age things, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history, Mrs. Sciarotta?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Like… what do I do for fun? I work, mostly. Logging equipment operator, you know. It keeps me busy. Divorced, no kids. I don’t really go out much anymore. Quiet life. I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees… well. Do you need to know about drinking or smoking? I don’t do either. Never have.
DOCTOR: No, that’s sufficient for now. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, let’s move on to your current symptoms. Are you experiencing any pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, vision changes, or any other unusual symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes my hands get a little numb, especially in the cold. And I get tired easily, but that’s just getting old, I think. No pain, no shortness of breath. My vision is a little blurry sometimes, but I have glasses, like you see. No dizziness, no headaches. Nothing major, Doctor. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older. I’m not falling apart yet.
DOCTOR: “Just getting older” is not a diagnosis, Mrs. Sciarotta. We need to investigate these symptoms. The numbness in your hands, for example – where exactly are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. It’s mostly in my fingertips, all of them. And sometimes it goes up my wrists a little. It’s worse in the morning, when it’s cold. And when I’m using the equipment, you know, gripping the levers and stuff. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… tingly and weak. It’s not constant, though. Comes and goes. I just figured it was the cold and the work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned fatigue. Can you describe that fatigue?
PATIENT: It’s just… tired. All the time. Not like I’m sick tired, but just… worn out. Like I don’t have the energy I used to. I used to be able to work all day without a problem. Now, I need to take breaks. And I sleep plenty. Eight hours, usually. But I still wake up feeling tired. It’s just… getting older, I guess. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a dramatic thing. Just… less pep, you know? Less go. It’s making it harder to keep up with the work. That’s why I’m getting this card, to make sure I can still do it safely.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sciarotta, while I appreciate your attempts to minimize your symptoms, it’s my job to investigate them thoroughly. Fatigue and numbness can be indicative of several underlying conditions. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But please, let's be quick. I have things to do, you know? A physical exam... very well. But don't go poking around too much. Just... get it over with, please. I'm sure it's nothing. Probably just old age. But go ahead.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Slightly elevated blood pressure, but not alarming. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Again. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Now, I'm going to assess your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? I try to squeeze pretty hard. It’s a little stiff, you know? From the work. My hands aren't what they used to be. The equipment… it takes a toll. Is everything okay so far? This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Cranial nerves are intact. Now, I'm going to perform a quick neurological exam. Can you close your eyes and follow my finger?
PATIENT: There. I'm following it. Is this necessary? I’ve never had any problems with my eyes. I can see just fine, with my glasses, of course. Hurry up, please. I really need to get going soon. I have deliveries to think about.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone level, and a Vitamin B12 level. We’ll also need an EKG to evaluate your heart murmur. Based on my examination and your symptoms, I’m concerned about potential Vitamin B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism, which can explain your fatigue and numbness. The EKG is to further investigate the heart murmur. I’ll also order a urinalysis just as a matter of routine. I understand you’re busy, Mrs. Sciarotta. However, these tests are necessary to ensure your safety and determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. I’ll also need you to provide a list of all medications you’re currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements. Do you have that list with you?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. More tests. Fine. But I don’t have a list. Just the Lisinopril, like I told you. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they act up. That’s it. Nothing else. Can’t you just give me the card? I’ve been driving for years. I’m a careful driver. This is just… ridiculous. I’ll try to write the ibuprofen down when I get home. But I really need to get this card. Can we just skip the rest of the tests? Is that possible? It's probably just old age, honestly.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sciarotta, I understand your frustration, but I cannot in good conscience issue a commercial driver’s license without a thorough evaluation. Your safety, and the safety of others on the road, is my primary concern. Ignoring potential medical issues is not an option. The ibuprofen is relevant, as long-term use can have side effects. And while you may feel fine, there are objective findings – the slightly elevated blood pressure, the heart murmur, the unsteady gait – that warrant further investigation. I'm ordering the tests. I understand you’ve been driving for years, but things change. We need to make sure you're still fit to operate a commercial vehicle safely. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid operating heavy machinery until we have a clearer picture of your health. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you have to do. But this is going to cost me a fortune, isn’t it? And I’ll have to take time off work… This is just great. No, I don’t have any questions. Just… schedule the tests. And get it over with. I need to get back to work. As soon as possible. Is there anything else? I really need to go. .
DOCTOR: Here are the orders for the blood work and EKG. You can schedule those appointments at the lab and cardiology department. The lab is located… And here is a referral to a cardiologist for the EKG. I have scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results. I will also need you to bring a list of all medications, including dosages, at that time. I understand this is inconvenient, but it is necessary. Do you have any questions about the paperwork or the scheduling process?
