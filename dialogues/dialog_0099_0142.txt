DOCTOR: Right. Jaxston Lawther, 22 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. It's… my head. It's been giving me trouble. Like, really bad headaches. And I get all sweaty when they hit, and my heart races, you know? It's happened a few times now. I can't really… pinpoint exactly when it started, to be honest. It just kinda… began.
DOCTOR: "Kinda began," you say. Well, that’s… helpful. Let’s try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Yeah, sorry. It’s just… hard to remember. Everything feels a bit fuzzy, you know? I guess… maybe a couple of months ago? Or was it longer? I’ve been working a lot, that’s for sure. Long shifts. Does that… matter? I don’t even know what triggers it, honestly. Sometimes it just comes on for no reason.
DOCTOR: Working a lot… of course. What exactly do these headaches feel like?
PATIENT: Um… they’re… really intense. Like a throbbing, all over my head. Mostly in the front, I think. And behind my eyes. It feels like… pressure, building up. It's hard to describe. And like I said, I get really sweaty, really fast. And my heart just… pounds. It kinda scares me, to be honest. It feels… different than just a normal headache.
DOCTOR: Different how?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, a normal headache, I can usually just… ignore it, or take something for it and it goes away. This… this feels like something serious is happening. It's not just pain, it's like… everything's speeding up, you know? And I feel kinda… dizzy sometimes when it's really bad. It's hard to explain, I'm not good at this. Sorry. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Dizzy, you say. And a racing heart. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your vision during these episodes?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision? Uh… not that I’ve noticed, not really. Everything looks… normal, I think. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, so… that’s normal, right? I haven't seen any spots or anything like that. Honestly, I'm usually just trying to get through it and not… panic. Does that make sense? It all happens so fast.
DOCTOR: You wear glasses. For what, exactly?
PATIENT: Uh… just regular nearsightedness, I think. I've had them since I was a kid. Nothing fancy. They help me see things far away. I get new prescriptions when… well, when they stop working as well, you know? I haven't had them checked recently though, not for a while. I should probably get that done, huh? I just… haven’t gotten around to it. Everything's been kind of hectic.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Any family history of headaches, migraines, or… anything neurological?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a good question. I… honestly don’t really know. My mom passed away when I was pretty young, and my dad… he wasn't really one for talking about family medical stuff. I know my grandma on my dad’s side had… high blood pressure, I think? But I don’t know about headaches or anything like that. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It's not something we ever really talked about.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said you’ve been working long shifts. What kind of work are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, it’s… production work. Mostly packing stuff, you know? At a warehouse. It’s… pretty physical. Lots of bending and lifting. And it's loud. Really loud. Earplugs help, but still. It's… not glamorous, to be honest. Just trying to make a living, you know? It’s kinda repetitive too. Does that matter? I don’t know if it could be related to the headaches, but… maybe?
DOCTOR: Repetitive physical labor in a loud environment… yes, that could be relevant. Alright. Now, let's talk about your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no. No smoking. Never have. I… I don't really drink much either, maybe a beer with friends sometimes, but that's about it. I try to stay pretty healthy, considering the job. I eat… okay, I guess. Lots of takeout, I admit, because I’m always tired after work, but nothing… crazy. Does that make sense? I'm trying to be honest here. I’m just… not really sure what’s going on with my head.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. I haven’t really had to take much medication. I get over-the-counter stuff for colds sometimes, like… ibuprofen or something, and that’s fine. I haven’t had any reactions. I don’t think so. Is that… useful? Sorry, I’m really trying to think. It's just… I haven't spent a lot of time at the doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Lie back on the examination table. I’ll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll do a basic neurological exam.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. That sounds… good. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I'm a little clumsy. And… I hope it's not anything too serious. This whole thing is kinda freaking me out.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is elevated, 140/90. Pulse is 88, regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds normal, no murmurs. Reflexes are normal. Balance is slightly off, but could be from fatigue. Cranial nerves are intact. No obvious focal neurological deficits. So, based on what you've told me and this quick exam, it could be tension headaches exacerbated by stress and physical exertion. Your blood pressure is a little high, but that's not uncommon with stress. However… given your description of the sweating and racing heart, and the dizziness, we need to rule out a few other possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That sounds… kinda scary. What other possibilities? Like… what are we talking about? I’m kinda nervous now, to be honest. Is it something serious? Is it… something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions. It could be a number of things. We need to rule out things like dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and… less likely, but we can’t ignore it, a cardiac issue. Given you’re uninsured, extensive testing is problematic. However, I’m going to order a basic blood panel - complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and a thyroid panel. We also need to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. I will also order a urinalysis. I will also write you a prescription for a mild muscle relaxant to help with the tension headaches. Take it as directed. And drink plenty of water. The lab requisition is here. Go to the lab across the street. The EKG will be done there as well. Come back in a week with the results. If your symptoms worsen before then - severe chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting - go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… a blood panel, EKG, and urinalysis. And a prescription for muscle relaxants. Okay, yeah, I understand. Chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting… go to the ER. Okay. That’s… a lot. How much is all this going to cost? I’m really worried about the bill, to be honest. And… is it serious? You said “rule out”. That sounds… bad. Is it likely to be something serious?
DOCTOR: Look, I understand your concerns about the cost. Unfortunately, I cannot provide an exact figure. The cost depends on the lab and the insurance negotiation, which, given your uninsured status, will likely be a cash price. As for "ruling out" - it’s standard medical practice. We need to exclude possibilities before we can pinpoint the cause. It does not automatically mean something is seriously wrong. It means we're being thorough. Now, I have other patients waiting. Get the tests done, bring me the results, and we'll reassess. Don't catastrophize. And try to relax. Another one with self-diagnosed anxiety.
PATIENT: Okay… right. Don't catastrophize. Easier said than done. Thank you… I guess.
DOCTOR: Next! .
