DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. I have been… having trouble breathing. Like a whistling sound when I breathe. It has been happening for a few days now. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a whistling sound, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… when you blow across the top of a bottle. But… inside my chest. Is that… normal? I don’t think so. It happens when I walk, mostly. And sometimes at night when I lie down.
DOCTOR: No, a whistling sound with breathing isn’t typically “normal,” Mrs. Kilton. We need to figure out what’s causing it. When you say “a few days,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started… maybe last Tuesday? Yes, Tuesday. I was gardening, pulling weeds. It was a hot day. I felt a little… tired afterwards, but nothing too bad. The whistling started later that evening. It was very quiet at first, but it has gotten worse. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So, it started after some physical activity, gardening specifically. And it’s progressively worsened. Have you noticed anything else accompanying the whistling?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Sometimes my chest feels… tight. Not painful, just… squeezed. And I have been coughing a little. Not a bad cough, just… a dry tickle. It doesn't bring anything up, if you understand. Mostly at night, like the whistling. I try to drink tea with honey.
DOCTOR: Alright. A tight chest and a dry cough. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever. I checked myself. And no chills, not at all. And definitely no night sweats. I sleep very warmly, so I always feel a little warm at night, but not… sweaty. I hope that makes sense. It is just the whistling and the squeezing that concerns me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s go through some of your medical history then. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have always been a very healthy woman. I walked every day, up until this started. My husband… my late husband… he had some problems with his heart, but I… I have always been strong. I used to be an athletic trainer, you see. I helped many people get better. It is strange to need help myself now.
DOCTOR: Right. Athletic trainer. And any other significant medical problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… old age aches and pains, I suppose. My knees bother me a little in the cold weather. And I had my gallbladder out many years ago, but that was no trouble. I have been divorced for a long time now, and I live alone. Mostly quiet, peaceful life. I am a Bhutanese woman, you see. We value peace and good health. This… whistling… is disturbing my peace.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of lung problems – asthma, emphysema, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. My mother… she had a cough in the winter, every winter. But she lived to be very old. And my brother… he smoked for many years, but he… he passed away from something else. I don’t think he had trouble breathing. Bhutanese people don’t really talk about illnesses much. We prefer to focus on happiness. I am sorry, Doctor. I am not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mrs. Kilton. Let's move on. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. I drink herbal tea, and I eat a healthy diet. That is what my mother always told me. “Good food, good health,” she would say. I do take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because I don’t get much sun. But that is all.
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I am a very simple woman, you see. Simple life, simple diet, simple… everything. This whistling is very confusing. I have never had anything like this before. It makes me anxious. Perhaps it is just old age?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mrs. Kilton, I think we need to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. It’s possible this is something simple, but we need to rule out anything more serious. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. That sounds… sensible. I will do whatever you think is best. I hope it is not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your breathing with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay… take a deep breath in… and out… again… I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, Mrs. Kilton. It’s not severe, but it’s present. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is acceptable, but on the lower end of normal. I’d like to check your heart rate and blood pressure as well.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That is… reassuring to know you can hear it. And that you can measure it. I feel a little better knowing we are doing something. My late husband always said, “Knowledge is power.” Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning in itself. Pulse is 78, regular. Given your symptoms, your age, and the wheezing I’m hearing, I suspect you may be experiencing a mild exacerbation of a condition called COPD – Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It’s common in people who have been exposed to irritants like smoke or pollution, even if they haven’t smoked themselves. It’s not an immediate emergency, but it does need to be managed.
PATIENT: COPD? I… I don't understand. I have never smoked. And I live in a very quiet, rural area. There is not much pollution here. My mother always said the air in the mountains is the cleanest in the world. Is that… is that serious, Doctor? I worry about being a bother to people. I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: It can be serious if left untreated, Mrs. Kilton. But it’s manageable. And it’s not always caused by smoking. Exposure to dust, fumes, even severe respiratory infections can contribute. Now, I understand you’re worried about being a bother, and I appreciate that, but your health is important. We’ll need to do a spirometry test – it’s a breathing test that measures how much air you can exhale and how quickly – to confirm the diagnosis. If that confirms COPD, we can discuss treatment options, which might include a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways. We will also want to rule out other conditions. It is possible it is just a bad cold. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A breathing test… and an inhaler? I… I am not good with tests. They make me anxious. And I don't like taking medicine. But… if it will help my breathing… I suppose I can try. Will the test be painful? And what does the inhaler… do exactly? I am sorry to ask so many questions, Doctor. I just… I like to know what is happening. It helps me feel less worried. Is it okay if my neighbor drives me? She is a very good woman.
DOCTOR: The breathing test is not painful, Mrs. Kilton. It simply involves breathing into a machine. It might be a little tiring, but it doesn’t hurt. As for the inhaler, it delivers medication directly to your lungs to help relax the muscles and open your airways, making it easier to breathe. It's very simple to use. And yes, it is perfectly fine if your neighbor drives you. In fact, it’s a good idea. We’ll schedule the test for next week. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of a mild steroid inhaler to see if it helps reduce the inflammation in your airways and alleviate your symptoms. If it doesn't help, or if your symptoms worsen, we'll need to consider other possibilities. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As I said, just old age aches and pains. And a little trouble sleeping sometimes. But nothing serious. My knees bother me when it rains. Is that… a medical condition? I don’t want to take anything for that. I just wrap a warm scarf around them. And try to stay inside. I am a very simple woman, you see. I don’t like to complain. But thank you for asking. I appreciate your kindness. I am a little worried about the cost of all this, though. My late husband… he handled all the finances. I am not very good with money.
DOCTOR: Right. We can discuss the financial aspects with the billing department, Mrs. Kilton. They have payment plans available. Now, let’s focus on getting your breathing under control. I will write a prescription for the inhaler and a referral to the pulmonary function testing lab. They’ll call you to schedule the appointment. It's important to get this done as soon as possible. Here are your papers. The instructions for the inhaler are included. If you have any questions, please call my office. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is all. You have explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience. And your kindness. It is good to know you are here to help. Do you think… do you think I will be able to walk again? I miss my walks very much. It makes me sad to sit inside all the time.
DOCTOR: We’ll see how you respond to treatment, Mrs. Kilton. If we can get your breathing under control, there’s no reason you shouldn’t be able to resume your walks. But it’s important to be realistic. We need to take things one step at a time. Alright. Well, I wish you all the best. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
