DOCTOR: Right. Good morning. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, Ms. Weichers, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… well, I’ve been… coughing up some blood. It was in my spit, you see. It’s… quite worrying.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood, you say. Alright. How much blood, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a difficult question. Not a lot, Doctor. More like… streaks, really. A few times now, over the past… maybe three days? It’s not a constant thing, thankfully. It’s… enough to scare me, though. I’ve never seen this before.
DOCTOR: Streaks, alright. And you said three days?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Maybe a little longer… it’s hard to remember exactly when it started. I noticed it first when I was brushing my teeth, I think. A little spot on my toothbrush. Then again yesterday morning. It’s… not a huge amount, but enough to make me quite concerned. I didn't want to wait, you see.
DOCTOR: And you haven’t experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I’ve been a little tired, perhaps. More tired than usual, but I thought that was just from… life, you know? And maybe a little bit of a cough, but that started around the same time as… well, as the blood. Nothing too bad. No fever, no chest pain, no weight loss. Just the tiredness and the cough… and the blood, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had a fever checked recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't checked my temperature. I don't usually… check my temperature unless I feel very sick, you see. I just thought… the blood was the most concerning thing. I was hoping you could tell me what it might be.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Weichers, blood in the sputum – that’s what we call it when you cough it up – can be a number of things. It's rarely anything serious, usually. But we need to rule things out. Now, have you had any recent respiratory infections?
PATIENT: Respiratory infections… um. Not that I am aware of, Doctor. I haven’t been to see a doctor for a cold or anything in a very long time. I try to stay healthy, you see. Just the usual little sniffles sometimes, but nothing that required a visit to the doctor. Is it… is it possible it’s just something small?
DOCTOR: It is possible. Though, as you've rightly pointed out your concern, we need to investigate. Now, let's go through your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or tuberculosis?
PATIENT: Oh my. Let me think… No, Doctor. I don’t believe so. I was a healthy child, and I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I’ve never been told I have any of those things. My husband… he had some heart trouble, but that was many years ago. Nothing for me, though. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. Just a few fillings at the dentist, you know. Nothing… serious. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's important to have a complete picture, Ms. Weichers. Now, family history. Any history of lung disease, cancer, or tuberculosis in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s… a difficult question. My mother… she had some breathing problems when she was older, but I don't know exactly what it was. She didn’t go to the doctor very often. And my father… he was very healthy, as far as I know. No cancer, no tuberculosis that I am aware of. My husband’s family… I didn’t know them very well. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor! Absolutely not. I have never smoked in my life. My husband used to smoke, but he quit many years ago. It was very bad for his heart, you see. I always told him it was a terrible habit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, Doctor. Very occasionally. Nothing… excessive. Perhaps once or twice a week? I don’t drink very much at all. It doesn't agree with me, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Weichers, I’m going to need to listen to your lungs and perhaps do a quick examination. Can you please sit up and take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. I'm ready whenever you are. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm a little nervous, you see, but I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your lungs sound… relatively clear, though there is a slight wheezing on the left side. Nothing too concerning, but we should investigate further. Now, can you say “ninety-nine”?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Ninety-nine. Is that alright, Doctor? I hope I said it clearly enough. It’s a little difficult to speak loudly sometimes, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, can you cough for me, if you can?
PATIENT: Ahem… like this, Doctor? It's not a very strong cough, you see. I haven't been coughing very much, just a little tickle in my throat. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Alright. It appears to be… a small amount of blood-tinged mucus. We'll need to send a sample to the lab for analysis, just to be safe. I’m also going to order a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Oh… an X-ray? And sending a sample to the lab… That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it something bad? I’m starting to worry now, you see. What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Ms. Weichers, it’s standard procedure. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We’re simply ruling things out. The X-ray will help us visualize your lungs and identify any potential issues, like pneumonia or other infections. The lab test will confirm whether there are any bacteria present in the sputum. It's better to be thorough, wouldn't you agree?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. You’re right. Better to be thorough. I just… I get anxious easily, you see. It's silly, I know. So, what happens next? Do I need to go somewhere else for the X-ray? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a friend coming to visit next week, and I… I was hoping to feel better by then.
DOCTOR: The X-ray is done just down the hall, Room 203. The technician will explain the procedure. It’s quick and painless. As for the results, the lab test usually takes 24-48 hours, and the X-ray report should be available within the same timeframe. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild cough suppressant to help alleviate your symptoms. It won't address the underlying cause, but it should provide some relief.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. A cough suppressant sounds wonderful. So, just go to Room 203, and then schedule a follow-up appointment… I think I can manage that. Is there anything else I should do in the meantime? Drink more water, perhaps? Rest? I always worry about doing something wrong, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, drink plenty of fluids and get some rest. Avoid strenuous activity. And try not to worry, Ms. Weichers. We're taking all the necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms. I’ll have the nurse come in and explain the dosage instructions for the cough suppressant. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies, Doctor. Not to any medications, or anything else, as far as I know. My husband had a lot of allergies, but I seem to have been spared. I always felt lucky about that. Thank you for asking, though. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate it. I'm sure everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. If your symptoms worsen – such as increased bleeding, high fever, or difficulty breathing – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Increased bleeding, high fever, or difficulty breathing… go to the emergency room. I will remember that. Thank you again for everything. I feel a little better now, knowing what to look out for. I hope it’s just something small, you see. I really do.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll know more once we have the test results. You can schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist on your way out. Have a good day, Ms. Weichers.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will go schedule an appointment.
