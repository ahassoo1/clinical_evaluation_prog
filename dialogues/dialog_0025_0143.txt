DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Yes, well… it's a bit… complicated. My, uh, my friend and I… we're thinking about… having a baby. But I want to make sure everything is okay first, you know? Before… before we start. I thought maybe… a check-up? It’s been a long time since I’ve… well, since anything like this.
DOCTOR: A baby, you say. At 66. Well. Alright. It’s… prudent to get a check-up, certainly. Though I must say, this is… not a common situation. Let’s start with the basics. You said it’s been a long time. Can you tell me about your general health?
PATIENT: Yes, a long time. Very long. I used to… work a lot. Sales, you know? Traveling. Not much time for… doctors. I think I'm okay, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, right? My back aches a bit when it rains, but… old age, I guess. I don't really feel sick, if that makes sense. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh dear, I couldn't even guess. Maybe ten years? Longer?
DOCTOR: Ten years. Right. And you say a little tired, back aches… vague symptoms are not particularly helpful, Mr. Verrall. We need specifics. When did this fatigue start?
PATIENT: Oh, um… the tiredness? It’s come and gone, really. It's not… all the time. Maybe… the last few years? Hard to say. When I was working, I was always tired. So maybe it’s not new. And the back… it’s when the weather changes. Damp weather, mostly. It just… feels stiff. Like an old door that needs oiling. Is that… helpful? I don't know what kind of details you need.
DOCTOR: An old door. Well. We're attempting to ascertain if you're fit to undertake a pregnancy, Mr. Verrall. That requires a degree of precision. Let's move beyond metaphors. Do you have any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? Oh, dear. Let me think. No… not that I know of. I’ve never been told I have anything… chronic. Sometimes my stomach… upsets. But that's just from eating something bad, I think. And… oh! I had a bit of a cough last winter. But it went away. Nothing… serious. I don't take any… pills. Or anything. Except maybe a painkiller if my back really bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known chronic conditions, occasional stomach upset, a cough last winter… and over-the-counter painkillers. What about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a good question. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. He died when I was young. And my mother… she lived a long life, but she had… trouble remembering things when she got old. Like me, a bit, now that I think about it. But… I don't know about any serious illnesses. Nobody really talked about it much. We weren't close, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Weak heart in your father, memory issues in your mother… and you’re noticing some forgetfulness as well. Alright. Let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. I tried it once when I was very young, with some friends. Didn’t like it. Always thought it was a silly habit. I do… enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just one, maybe two. Nothing heavy. And… I like to walk. When the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: One or two glasses of wine… occasionally. And walking. Right. Let’s get to the important part, Mr. Verrall. You're considering fathering a child at 66. We need to assess your overall health very carefully. I’m going to need to do a physical exam, and we'll need to order some blood work. It's standard procedure. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Blood work… exam… sounds… thorough. Allergies? Let me see… I think I might be allergic to… dust, maybe? My nose gets itchy sometimes when I’m cleaning. And… I had a rash once when I touched a certain flower. A yellow one. But it was a long time ago. I don't usually have… bad reactions to anything. I'm not very sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: Dust and a yellow flower. Right. Well, Mr. Verrall, let’s start with the exam. Please undress from the waist down, and we’ll begin. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and… assess your general physical condition. I’ll need a urine sample as well, if you don't mind. It’s a comprehensive assessment, as you requested.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Undress… from the waist down. Yes, of course. Is there… a gown or something? I hadn’t expected… so much. This is all very… detailed, isn’t it? A urine sample, too. Yes, yes, I understand. Just… give me a moment.
DOCTOR: There’s a gown. And yes, it is detailed, Mr. Verrall. As I stated, we're assessing your fitness for a significant undertaking. I’ll give you a few minutes of privacy. Please call when you're ready. And try not to take too long. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: .
