DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's… a bit embarrassing, really. I've been having trouble going to the bathroom. It's just… hard to start, you know? And it takes a long time, even then.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Yadao. It’s certainly not uncommon to experience difficulty with urination as we age, and you shouldn’t feel embarrassed discussing it with me. It’s important to figure out what’s going on so we can find a solution. To help me understand the situation better, could you describe this difficulty in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Well, it's not painful, exactly. More… like it doesn't want to go. I have to push, a bit, and sometimes it comes out in little spurts, not a steady stream like it used to. It feels like there's something blocking it, but I don't think it's pain. Does that make sense? And it takes a good while to empty completely. I just sit there... and sit there.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Yadao. Thank you for explaining that so clearly. The sensation of incomplete emptying and the intermittent stream are helpful details. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me approximately how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, I'd say, maybe six months ago? At first, it was just now and then. I thought it was just because I was drinking too much tea. But it’s gotten worse steadily since then. Definitely more noticeable in the last month or so. It’s starting to worry me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Yadao. It's good you're bringing this to my attention. Six months of gradual worsening is definitely something we need to investigate. Now, aside from the difficulty starting and the intermittent stream, have you noticed any other changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I seem to be going to the bathroom more often, especially at night. I wake up two, sometimes even three times to pee. I usually only had to go once, maybe twice if I drank a lot before bed. And… I feel like I'm always a little bit… empty, even after I’ve just gone. Not a full, comfortable empty, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand, Ms. Yadao. Frequent urination, particularly at night – what we call nocturia – and the sensation of incomplete emptying are both important pieces of the puzzle. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you please tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see… I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it doesn’t bother me too much. And I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been controlled with medication for years now. I take a little pill every morning. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. I try to walk every day, when the weather's good.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. Arthritis and controlled hypertension are helpful to know. And it's good to hear you're able to stay active. Could you please tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it right here in my purse. It's Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for… oh, goodness, I think about ten years now. It seems to be working alright, my doctor checks it every six months.
DOCTOR: Excellent, thank you. Lisinopril is good information. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! When I was younger, I had my gallbladder removed. That was… oh, goodness, must be forty years ago now. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, but that was a long time ago too. Other than that, no, not really. Nothing serious, anyway.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. That's good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family's medical history, if you're aware of it?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother had diabetes, I think. And my father… he had heart trouble, I know that much. My brother had some kind of… prostate problems when he got older, but I don’t really know the details. It wasn't something we talked about much, to be honest. My grandparents… well, they lived a long time, but I don’t know what they died of. It was a long time ago, and nobody really kept track of those things back then.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Yadao. Family history can sometimes be difficult to recall. Diabetes, heart trouble, and prostate issues in your family are relevant. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. Always have been careful about my health, really.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Yadao. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, I have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just one, though. A small glass. I enjoy it with my food, but I don't drink very often. Maybe three or four times a week, if that. Nothing heavy, you understand.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. I’m usually pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. That completes my initial questions. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, if that is alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a gentle neurological exam. We may also want to check a urine sample. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A urine sample… yes, I can do that. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please collect a urine sample in this cup, and then bring it back to me. I’ll then perform the physical exam while you are getting that done. I will need you to disrobe from the waist down and put on this gown. I will knock before entering the room. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. A urine sample and an exam… yes, that makes sense. It's probably just something simple, anyway. The restroom is right over there, you said? I’ll go do that now. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, right over there. Take your time. I'll be just outside when you’re ready.
