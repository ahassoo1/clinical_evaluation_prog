DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sucich. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's lovely to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. They just won't stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re… persistent, to say the least. It’s a bit embarrassing, really, especially when I'm trying to have a nice chat with people.
DOCTOR: Persistent hiccups, alright. A couple of days, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Started on Monday, I believe. August 1st. I remember because I was telling my granddaughter about a funny dream I had, and hic… well, you can imagine. It’s been on and off ever since, but mostly on now, if that makes sense? It's not painful, thankfully, just… irritating. And a bit tiring, constantly jumping.
DOCTOR: August 1st… constant jumping, you say. Okay. And have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… not really, not that I’ve noticed. I had a cup of tea yesterday afternoon, but I drink tea every day. I wasn’t doing anything particularly strenuous, not that I remember. I was sitting and reading a book, a mystery, quite a good one actually, and they started up again. I did laugh a bit at something in it, maybe that started it? But I laugh all the time, Doctor. I'm a cheerful person!
DOCTOR: That's good, being cheerful is important. Laughing shouldn't be a problem, but it's helpful to rule things out. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing else. No pain, no shortness of breath, no… well, nothing at all except the hiccups. I’m eating normally, sleeping okay, feeling pretty good actually, aside from this little… annoyance. It just feels a bit strange, you know? To have something go on and on without a reason. I usually have a pretty good handle on what’s going on with my body. I worked as a psychiatric aide for years, you see, so I'm used to listening to people describe their symptoms. It’s odd to be the one with the strange thing happening!
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Ms. Sucich. And working in healthcare certainly gives you a good perspective. Just to be thorough, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. I don't mind at all. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I suppose it’s always good to be sure, isn’t it? Lead the way!
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit here, we’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then I’ll take a look at your abdomen. I’ll also check your neurological function quickly. It won’t take long. Heart sounds are regular, normal rate. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Soft, non-tender. No masses. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Go right ahead. I always thought reflexes were fascinating. The way the body just… does things without you even thinking about it. It’s quite remarkable. I used to explain it to some of the patients I worked with, when they were feeling anxious about their bodies. Sometimes just understanding how things worked helped them calm down.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No obvious focal neurological deficits. Everything appears normal on the physical exam, which is reassuring. Given your history and the exam findings, these are likely benign, idiopathic hiccups. Sometimes they just happen, and resolve on their own. However, given the duration, we can try a few things to help them along. Have you tried any home remedies already?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. I've tried a few things! My granddaughter, Leilani, she's quite the researcher, she told me to hold my breath, and drink a glass of water upside down. That just made a mess, really. And I tried breathing into a paper bag, but that didn’t help either. I even asked my neighbour, old Mr. Henderson, and he swore by a spoonful of sugar. Didn't work for me, I'm afraid. Seems these hiccups are determined to stay! It's good to know it’s not something serious though, that's a relief. What do you suggest, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Those are all common remedies, yes. Sometimes they work for some people, but not everyone. Since those haven't been effective, we can try a medication. I’m thinking Baclofen, a muscle relaxant. It’s often used for hiccups that don’t respond to simpler measures. We'll start with a low dose, and see if it helps. It does have some potential side effects – drowsiness is the most common – so we'll monitor you closely. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Baclofen, you say? A muscle relaxant. Hmm… drowsiness doesn’t sound too bad, honestly. I’m a good napper! Yes, that sounds perfectly alright to me, Doctor. If it might get rid of these pesky hiccups, I'm willing to give it a try. What's the dosage, and how long should I take it for? And will I need any follow-up appointments? I do like to be well-informed, you see. It comes with the territory, working with people and their health for so many years!
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll start with 5mg three times a day for a week. If that doesn’t provide sufficient relief, we can increase it to 10mg three times a day, but we want to start low and go slow. It's important to take it with food to minimize any potential side effects. As for follow-up, let's schedule an appointment in one week to see how you're responding. If the hiccups worsen or you experience any concerning side effects before then – such as confusion, dizziness, or severe weakness – please call the office immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds very sensible, Doctor. 5mg three times a day with food, and a follow-up appointment in one week. I’ll make a note of that right away. And I’ll definitely call if anything feels… off. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your thoroughness. It’s reassuring to know we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sucich. I’m happy to help. I’ll send the prescription to your usual pharmacy. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been wonderfully helpful. I'm feeling much more optimistic now, knowing we're taking steps to address this. Thank you again for your time and patience. I suppose I should be off then, and let the Baclofen do its work! It was lovely meeting you, Doctor Annesley.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Ms. Sucich. I hope the medication works quickly and you get some relief. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and enjoy your week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a lovely day too. .
