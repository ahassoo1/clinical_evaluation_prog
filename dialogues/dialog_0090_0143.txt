DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… a bit hard to explain. Something about… getting ready for a baby? My… a friend suggested I come talk to someone. I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. It was a lot of talk about… things being okay before… you start?
DOCTOR: Getting ready for a baby… at your age, that's… unusual, but certainly not impossible. And you're coming in for a check-up related to that?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. She said something about making sure everything is okay… before. Before it… happens. I'm not very good with remembering these things. Is this… a normal thing to do? I mean, for someone… like me? It feels a bit strange, if you don’t mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s advisable to have a check-up before any… significant life event, regardless of age. It’s simply responsible healthcare. Let's start with some basics. You said a friend suggested this… are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh… uh… well, yes. Recently. That's… that's why I'm here, I think. She said… things change as you get older, and… and it’s good to be careful. I don’t really know what she meant exactly. Is that… a strange question? Sorry, I don’t mean to be difficult. My memory is… patchy.
DOCTOR: Not strange, Mr. Verrall, simply… pertinent. And your memory being “patchy” is noted. Let's clarify. How long have you been sexually active with your current partner?
PATIENT: Current…? Oh. Well… not very long. A few months, maybe? It's hard to say exactly. We haven’t… been together for very long, and… it’s all a bit new, to be honest. I didn’t really think much about… checking up on things, until my friend mentioned it. Is it important that it's only been a few months? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Mr. Verrall. New partners always introduce risks. Now, have you had any sexually transmitted infections in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. I… don’t think so. I’ve never really… talked about those things with anyone. I had… some tests a long time ago, with a… previous partner, maybe? But I don’t remember what they were for, or what the results were. It was… years ago. A very long time ago. Is it important to know those things? I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s highly important, Mr. Verrall. We need to establish a baseline, and your lack of recollection is… concerning. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I have an allergy to… penicillin, I think. Yes, penicillin. I got a very bad rash once, years ago, after taking it. My doctor told me to avoid it. That I do remember. Is that… helpful? I’m glad I remember something useful. Though, I don’t take many medicines, generally.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. And what other medications do you take, Mr. Verrall?
PATIENT: Let me see… um… just something for my… blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a while back. It’s a small white pill. I take it every morning. And… sometimes, if my back hurts, I take something over the counter. But that's not very often. I don't remember the names of anything, I’m afraid. I really wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, with all due respect, your lack of detailed medical history is… problematic. It makes providing adequate care difficult. We're going to need to do some basic blood work and a physical exam. I'd also like to discuss STI screening, given your recent activity. Now, I'm going to need you to disrobe from the waist down, and we'll begin. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh dear… um… STI screening? Disrobe…? Well, that’s… a bit sudden, isn’t it? I wasn’t expecting that. I… I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that, to be honest. Especially without… knowing more about why it’s necessary. And… I'm not very good with… those kinds of things. Is there anything else we can do first? Maybe just the blood work?
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, given your recent sexual activity and lack of a clear medical history, STI screening is essential. It's a standard procedure. However… if you are truly uncomfortable, we can postpone that portion for now. But understand that places you at risk. As for the blood work, that will at least give us a starting point. Let's proceed with that first. The nurse will be in shortly to draw some samples. And I strongly advise you to reconsider the STI screening. It’s for your own well-being.
PATIENT: Yes… the blood work sounds… good. That I'm comfortable with. Thank you, Doctor. I… I'll think about the other thing. I appreciate you explaining everything… even if I don’t understand all of it. I’m really just trying to do the right thing, and… I’m sorry I’m making this difficult.
