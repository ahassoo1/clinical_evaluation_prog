DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Glazewski, you say? A… a rather unusual name. But never mind that. I suppose I'm here about… a bit of a delicate matter. It’s rather embarrassing, truthfully. I’ve noticed… a discharge. Yes, a discharge. It’s… unpleasant. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it's been… some time now. It’s not comfortable, let me assure you.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. These things can be uncomfortable to discuss, and you've done the right thing by coming in. It takes courage to address these concerns. Don’t worry, we’ll figure it out. When you say “discharge,” could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Describe it… Hmm. That’s a difficult request, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s fluid, of course. And… yellowish, I believe. Though, honestly, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. It’s not… copious, thankfully. Just… a persistent dampness, if you will. And occasionally… a bit of an odor. Not a pleasant odor, mind you. I certainly wouldn’t call it fragrant. It’s… concerning, naturally. I’ve never experienced anything quite like it before. Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? My wife is quite worried, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish fluid with an odor… persistent dampness. Thank you for describing it so clearly, Mr. Krok. It’s good you’re noticing these details. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me where exactly you're noticing this discharge?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, that’s… rather obvious, isn’t it? It's coming from… down there. From the… the source, if you will. I suppose I shouldn’t have to spell it out. Honestly, I find this whole line of questioning rather… indelicate. I’m a man of some years, you know. I’ve had a perfectly functional… apparatus for the better part of eight decades. And now this. It’s most unsettling. Are you certain you need such… graphic detail? My wife handles most of these… practical matters, usually.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel that’s a personal question, Mr. Krok, and I apologize if I’ve been too direct. It’s simply that pinpointing the source is important. And you’re correct, it’s unnecessary to be overly graphic. So, to confirm, it’s a discharge from the penis?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, precisely. From the… penis. Is that satisfactory? Honestly, this is all rather… humiliating. I haven’t had to discuss such things with anyone outside of my wife in… well, decades. And even with her, it’s usually a brief, practical matter. “Keep it clean,” she says. “Don’t neglect it.” Very sensible woman, my wife. But this… this is different. It's persistent. It's bothersome. And frankly, I’m worried it’s a sign of something… serious. I don’t want to be a burden, you understand. I’ve always been a self-reliant man. A farmer, through and through. We fix things ourselves, usually. But this… this requires a professional, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krok. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and you’re not a burden at all. We're here to help. And it’s good you're taking this seriously. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Well, there’s been… a slight burning sensation when I… urinate. Not severe, mind you. Just a little discomfort. And… occasionally, a bit of itching. Nothing debilitating, but… noticeable. I’ve also been feeling… rather tired lately. Though, that could simply be my age, I suppose. I’m not as spry as I used to be. And my wife keeps telling me I haven’t been eating enough. She makes a lovely stew, you know. Very nourishing. But I haven’t much of an appetite these days. And… now that I think about it, there’s been a bit of… discomfort in my lower abdomen. A dull ache, mostly. Is that… is that important, Doctor? I'm trying to recall everything, but my mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so burning with urination, occasional itching, fatigue, and a dull ache in your lower abdomen. Thank you for sharing all of that, Mr. Krok. It’s very helpful. Now, have you had any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Fever or chills… Hmm. Let me see. I haven't taken my temperature, I can assure you. My wife usually handles those sorts of things. But I don’t feel feverish. I haven’t been shivering or anything of the sort. I might have felt a little… warm a couple of nights ago, but that could have simply been the blankets. She likes to keep the house rather cozy. No, I don’t recall any significant fever or chills, Doctor. Though, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit… off-color for the past week or so. A general malaise, if you will. Just not quite myself. Is that… is that the same thing as a fever? My vocabulary isn’t what it used to be, either, I'm afraid. It’s all rather frustrating. One forgets things so easily these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, "general malaise." Thank you. Now, Mr. Krok, do you have any history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, never. My wife is very particular about our diet. Lots of fruits and vegetables. She insists on it. High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something about it a few years ago, I believe. He prescribed some pills, I think. I’m not entirely sure. My wife handles the medications, usually. She keeps them all organized. I take them as she instructs, of course. But I don’t recall the specific name of the condition, or the pills. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is… fragmented, at best. I used to be able to recall dates and figures with remarkable accuracy. Now, I struggle to remember what I had for breakfast. As for other conditions… I had a bout of shingles a few years back, quite painful it was. And I broke my wrist falling off a ladder, but that was decades ago. Does that… does that matter? I'm probably rambling. It's just… difficult to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, hypertension managed with Lisinopril, and a history of shingles. You mentioned you take the Lisinopril as your wife instructs. Do you know how much you take each day?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that’s the name of it. She gives me one pill each morning, with breakfast. A small, white pill, I believe. She keeps them in a little container, labeled with the date and time. I trust her implicitly, of course. She’s a very organized woman. I’ve never questioned the dosage. She’s always been very careful about my health. She reminds me every morning, “Take your pill, Radford.” And I do. Without fail. I believe it’s ten milligrams, she mentioned something about that number. But I don’t recall the specifics. Honestly, Doctor, I rely on her to manage all of these… medical details. I’m more of a… practical man. I fix things, I grow things. These… internal matters are best left to her. Is it important that I know the exact dosage? Perhaps she can provide more specific information?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Krok. And yes, it’s helpful to confirm details. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix removed when I was a young man, quite a long time ago. And I had a hernia operation, many years later. That was… rather painful, I recall. I was laid up for several weeks. Other than that… I don’t believe so. I had a rather nasty fall from a ladder a few years back, but I didn’t require surgery for that. Just a broken wrist. And I had some stitches when I cut myself with a scythe, but that was… decades ago. A farmer's life, you see. Always getting nicked and scraped. But no major surgeries, other than the appendix and the hernia. Do you need the exact dates, Doctor? I doubt I could recall them. My memory is… exceedingly poor, I'm afraid. I apologize for my inability to provide more precise information. It’s just… time marches on, you see. And one forgets things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. You’ve provided helpful information. Now, is there any history of diabetes, heart disease, or cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… yes, let me see. My father… he had a weak heart, I believe. He passed away when I was a young man. And my mother… she suffered from arthritis, quite debilitating it was. As for cancer… my aunt, on my mother’s side, had breast cancer, I recall. She didn’t survive. Other than that… I don’t believe so. My siblings were all relatively healthy, as far as I know. We weren’t a particularly close-knit family, you see. We didn’t share much information. I haven’t seen most of them in decades. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t have much knowledge of their medical histories. We weren’t ones for discussing such things. It’s just… not the way we were raised. Does that… does that matter? I'm probably being unhelpful. I apologize for my poor memory. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krok. You’re providing whatever information you can, and that’s what’s important. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke… no, never. My father smoked, and it was… unpleasant. I swore I would never take up the habit, and I haven’t. Drink alcohol… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. My wife enjoys a glass of sherry, as well. We don’t drink every day. And recreational drugs… absolutely not. I’ve never had any interest in such things. I’m a farmer, you see. A simple man. I get my relaxation from working the land, tending to my crops. I don’t need artificial stimulants. And my wife… she wouldn’t approve. She’s a very… proper woman. So, no, I don’t smoke, drink excessively, or use any recreational drugs. I lead a… quiet life, you see. A simple life. Does that… does that satisfy your inquiry, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Krok. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me think. I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medications, as far as I know. My wife handles all of that, you see. She’s very careful about checking for allergies before administering anything. And food… I don’t recall any specific allergies. I eat most things. Though, I don’t particularly care for Brussels sprouts. But that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. I had a bit of a rash once, many years ago, after touching poison ivy. But that’s not an allergy, is it? More of an… irritation. So, no, I don’t believe I have any significant allergies. I’m a relatively healthy man, all things considered. Though, this… this discharge is rather concerning. It’s just… not like me. Does that… does that clarify your inquiry, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Mr. Krok. Now, I’d like to conduct a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your vital signs and a quick examination of the affected area. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, I suppose so. Though, I must warn you, Doctor, I’m not particularly fond of being… prodded and poked. But if it’s necessary, I’ll cooperate. Just… be gentle, if you would. And please, try to be as quick as possible. I have chores to attend to, you see. And my wife will be wondering where I am. Just… be efficient, if you would. And please, maintain a professional demeanor. I’m a man of some dignity, you see. So, yes, proceed with your exam. But be gentle, if you would. And quick.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod reassuringly, adjusting my gloves. "Of course, Mr. Krok. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. I understand your concerns." I begin by checking his blood pressure: 148/82. “Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. We can discuss that later.” I check his pulse: 72 bpm, regular. “Pulse is good.” I listen to his lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally. “Lungs sound clear.” I then gently examine his abdomen. "Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Tenderness… Hmm. A little bit, yes. Right here… lower abdomen, just below the navel. Not excruciating pain, mind you. Just a… discomfort. A dull ache, as I mentioned earlier. It’s been… intermittent, coming and going. But it’s definitely more noticeable when I… strain myself. Lifting heavy objects, for example. Or… exerting myself. It’s not a sharp pain, just a… pressure. A tightness. It’s been bothering me for a few days now. It’s not debilitating, but it’s definitely… unsettling. Is that… is that concerning, Doctor? I'm trying to recall if anything specific triggered it, but my memory is… fragmented, as always. Just a dull ache, lower abdomen. That’s the best way to describe it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krok. Based on the physical exam and your symptoms, it seems you're experiencing symptoms of urethritis – inflammation of the urethra. The mild tenderness, redness, and discharge are consistent with that. Given the elevated blood pressure and your symptoms, I'd like to order a few tests to help determine the cause and rule out other possibilities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, I suppose so. Though, I must admit, Doctor, I'm not particularly fond of needles. Or… invasive procedures. But if it’s necessary to determine the cause of this… discomfort, I’ll cooperate. What sort of tests are you thinking of? A blood test? A urine sample? And how long will it take to get the results? I have chores to attend to, you see. And my wife will be wondering where I am. Just… be as quick as possible, if you would. And please, explain everything clearly. I'm a man of some dignity, you see. I need to understand what’s going on. And please, maintain a professional demeanor. Just… tell me what you need, and I’ll cooperate. But be quick, if you would. And gentle.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod understandingly, making a note of his concerns. "Of course, Mr. Krok. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll start with a urine sample to check for infection. It's a simple test, just collect a sample in a cup. I'll also order a blood test to check your overall health and rule out any other underlying issues. The blood test will involve a small needle prick, but it shouldn’t take long. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and avoiding any sexual activity. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Three to five business days… that’s… a considerable amount of time. And no sexual activity… yes, I understand. My wife will be… understanding, I suppose. Increasing fluid intake… yes, that’s sensible. I drink plenty of water, usually. So, a urine sample and a blood test… yes, that’s what you need. Where do I… collect the urine sample? And what about the blood test? Do I need to fast beforehand? I'm a man of routine, you see. I need to know what’s expected of me. And please, maintain a professional demeanor. Just… tell me what to do, and I’ll cooperate. But be quick, if you would. And gentle. Is there anything else I need to know?
DOCTOR: <stage>I smile reassuringly. "Of course, Mr. Krok. You’ll find a private restroom just down the hall. There’s a collection cup and instructions inside. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-way through. For the blood test, you do not need to fast beforehand, but please avoid any strenuous activity for a few hours before. The phlebotomist will take the sample right here in the examination room. It will only take a few minutes. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: A phlebotomist… yes, that’s the one who… draws the blood. I see. Mid-stream sample… yes, I understand. Start urinating, then collect mid-way through. It sounds… complicated. But I’ll do my best. I’m a man of some discipline, you see. I can follow instructions. And no strenuous activity… yes, that’s sensible. I’ll avoid lifting heavy objects. Just… please, be gentle. And quick. I have chores to attend to, you see. And my wife will be wondering where I am. Just… tell me when you’re ready, and I’ll cooperate. But be gentle. And quick. One last question, Doctor: Is this… contagious? I wouldn’t want to… pass anything on to my wife. It’s just… a thought. Is it contagious?
DOCTOR:
