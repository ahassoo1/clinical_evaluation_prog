DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… nice to meet you as well. Hmm. What brings me in… yes. Well, it is… difficult. I have trouble. Finding the words. It is not… easy to explain. It just… happens. Sometimes. I forget what I want to say. Or… the right word. It is frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. That can be quite unsettling. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with your memory and finding the right words. That's perfectly alright, take your time. We’ll figure this out together. Could you tell me a little more about when this started happening?
PATIENT: When it started… oh dear. That is… a difficult question. I… do not remember exactly. Perhaps… a few months ago? Or was it longer? It is… gradual, you see. It was not sudden. Just… slowly getting worse. I think… maybe after my wife… passed. But I am not… certain. It is all a bit… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months ago, perhaps gradually worsening, and possibly around the time of your wife’s passing. That’s helpful. I’m very sorry for your loss, Sherrell. Grief can certainly impact memory and concentration. So, it sounds like this is primarily trouble with recalling words, rather than, say, remembering events?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. It is… kind of you to say so. It is… difficult to talk about, still. And you are correct. It is not… remembering what happened. I remember… most things. It is… when I want to say something. The words… they do not come. Or… I know the word, but it is… on the tip of my tongue. Like a… a name you almost know, but cannot quite… grasp. It is very… annoying.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. So, more of a difficulty with expressive language – finding the words you want to use – rather than recalling memories themselves. And you describe it as feeling like the word is “on the tip of your tongue”. That's a very common way to describe it. Now, does this happen all the time, or are there certain situations where it's worse?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… exactly it. “On the tip of my tongue.” You understand. It does not happen all the time, no. Sometimes… it is fine. But it is worse when I am… tired, I think. Or… if I am speaking quickly. If I have to think… quickly, the words… disappear. And… when I am stressed. If I am nervous… then it is… very bad. Like now, a little. Talking to a doctor… is stressful.
DOCTOR: I completely understand – talking to a doctor can be stressful! Don’t worry, we'll go at your pace. It’s good that you’re noticing these triggers – fatigue, speed of speech, stress. That's helpful information. Now, outside of these situations, are there any other symptoms you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. No… I do not believe so. I sleep… okay, usually. A little… restless, perhaps. But nothing… major. I eat… normally. My vision… is fine. I do not… feel dizzy. No headaches. I… think that is it. I just… forget the words. That is the… main problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re sleeping relatively well, eating normally, no issues with vision or dizziness, no headaches – primarily the difficulty with word-finding. That’s good to know. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… fine. Ask away. Hmm… medical conditions. Let me see. I had… high blood pressure, a few years ago. But it is… controlled now, with medication. And… I had my appendix removed, when I was young. But that was… a long time ago. Nothing… serious now, I think. Just the blood pressure, and… I take a vitamin D supplement.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of hypertension, which is currently well-controlled with medication, and you had your appendix removed previously. You also take a vitamin D supplement. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… yes. I take… Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. Ten milligrams, daily. And… sometimes, I take something for… heartburn. Omeprazole, I think it is called. But only when… it is bad. And… the vitamin D. That is it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Lisinopril ten milligrams daily for blood pressure, Omeprazole as needed for heartburn, and vitamin D. Good. Now, do you have a family history of any neurological conditions – things like stroke, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, or Parkinson’s disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That is… a difficult question. My mother… she had… problems with her memory, when she was older. But we never… knew exactly what it was. The doctor… said it was just… old age. She… forgot things. Like names. And… where she was. But it was… slow. It took many years. My father… he was healthy. No… problems that I know of. My brother… he is fine, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had memory problems in later life, though the specific diagnosis wasn't clear. And your father and brother have no known neurological issues. That's helpful to know. Now, finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… yes. I drink… a little wine, usually. With dinner. Maybe… a glass or two, most nights. I do not… drink beer or liquor. Just wine. Red wine, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate red wine consumption. And do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And I do not… use any other tobacco products. I find it… unpleasant. I prefer… fresh air.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherrell. Thank you for answering all of those questions. That gives me a good overall picture. Based on what you’ve told me – the gradual onset of word-finding difficulties, the triggers you've identified, your medical history, and your family history – it sounds like you may be experiencing early signs of cognitive impairment. It’s important to stress that this is not a definitive diagnosis, and further evaluation is needed. However, given your mother’s history, it's worth investigating to rule out any underlying causes. Would you be comfortable with me performing a brief cognitive assessment here today?
PATIENT: A… cognitive assessment? Hmm. What does that… involve? I am… a little nervous, now. I do not… like tests. But I… want to know what is happening. If you think it is… necessary, then… yes. I suppose so. But please… be gentle.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness completely, Sherrell. It’s perfectly alright. This isn't a pass-fail test; it’s simply a way for me to get a baseline understanding of your memory and cognitive function. It involves a few simple questions and tasks – things like remembering a few words, naming objects, and doing some basic calculations. It will take about 15-20 minutes. I’ll explain everything clearly as we go, and we can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. I’ll be right here with you the whole time. Would you like me to explain a little more about what the assessment involves before we start?
PATIENT: Yes… please. That would… be helpful. I prefer to know what is… coming. Just… explain it slowly, and… clearly. Like you said. And… if I forget something, do not… worry. I told you, I have trouble with… words.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sherrell. As I mentioned, this assessment involves several short tasks. First, I’ll ask you to remember three simple words, and I’ll test your recall of those words later. Then, I’ll ask you to name some common objects – things like a pen, a watch, or a picture. I’ll also ask you to do some simple calculations, like counting backwards from 100 by sevens. There’s also a brief section where I’ll ask you to copy a few simple drawings. And finally, I’ll ask you a few questions about your orientation – things like the date, the day of the week, and where we are. It's really quite straightforward. It’s not about getting everything right; it's about getting a sense of how your brain is functioning. We can take breaks whenever you need them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… manageable. Counting backwards by sevens… that sounds… difficult. But I will… try. The pictures… and the naming of objects… that sounds… easier. Alright. Let us… begin. But please… be patient. And… remind me if I forget something.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherrell. We'll take it at your pace. No pressure at all. I'll be right here to help you along the way. Okay, let’s start with the three words. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to remember them. Try to repeat them back to me after I say them. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes… I am ready. Please… say the words. I will… try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, here we go. The first word is… apple. The second word is… table. And the third word is… penny. Now, can you repeat those three words back to me?
PATIENT: Hmm… apple… yes. Table… yes. Penny… yes. I… think I have them. Apple… table… penny. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Sherrell! That’s perfect. You remembered all three words correctly. Now, we'll move on to something else for a moment, and then we’ll come back to those words later to see how well you remember them. I’m going to show you a picture of a common object. Can you tell me what it is?
PATIENT: Yes… show me the picture. I will… try to name it.
DOCTOR: Here you are. What is this object?
PATIENT: Hmm… a… a thing you wear… on your… wrist. To tell… the time. It… it is a… oh dear. What do you call it? It… measures the… hours and… minutes. It is… a… watch! Yes. A watch.
DOCTOR: That's right, Sherrell! A watch. You got it! Sometimes it takes a little bit to find the right word, and that's perfectly alright. Now, let's move on to the next object. Here you go…
PATIENT: Hmm… a… a thing you write with. It… has ink… inside. You… press it… on the paper. Oh dear… I… what is it called? It is… for writing. A… a… pen! Yes. A pen.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Sherrell! Another one correct. You've remembered both objects perfectly. You're doing a very good job. Now, let’s try one more object.
PATIENT: Hmm… a… a fruit. Red… or green… sometimes yellow. You… eat it. It is… sweet… and… crunchy. It is… an apple! Yes. An apple.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Sherrell. You've correctly identified all three objects. Now, let's see if you can remember those three words I asked you to repeat earlier. Can you tell me what those three words were?
PATIENT: Hmm… three words… let me think. Apple… yes, I remember that one. And… table. Yes. And… Oh dear… the last one… it is… on the tip of my tongue. It… starts with a… P… Penny! Yes. Apple, table, penny! I think… I remember them.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Sherrell! That's perfect! You remembered all three words correctly. You've done very well. Now, let's move on to the next part of the assessment. I'm going to ask you to count backwards from 100 by sevens. Take your time, and don't worry if it's a little challenging. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh dear… counting backwards by sevens… that sounds… very difficult. But… I will try. One hundred… seventy… seventy… three…? Oh, this is… hard.
DOCTOR: It is challenging, Sherrell, and that’s alright. Take your time. If you get stuck, just say so, and we can move on. You've started well. 100, 93... keep going if you can. If not, that's perfectly fine.
PATIENT: Ninety… six…? Oh dear… this is… impossible. I am… losing track. I… I cannot do it. I am… very sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Sherrell. Don't worry about it at all. Counting backwards by sevens is very difficult for many people. It’s not a reflection of anything other than the challenge of the task itself. We can stop there. You’ve done a very good job, and I have enough information for now. Now, let's talk about what we've found.
PATIENT: Yes… please. What… what does it mean? Is something… wrong? I am… a little scared.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly natural to feel scared, Sherrell. Let me explain. Based on this brief assessment, you’ve shown some mild difficulty with word recall and some challenges with a complex cognitive task like counting backwards by sevens. This doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it does suggest that it would be prudent to investigate further. It’s important to rule out any underlying causes that could be contributing to these difficulties. There are many possibilities, including vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, and early signs of cognitive impairment. We can start with some blood tests to check for any deficiencies and make sure everything is functioning properly. And I may recommend a more comprehensive cognitive assessment to get a better understanding of your strengths and weaknesses. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and another assessment… yes. I suppose so. If that is… what is necessary. But… what if it is something serious? What if… my memory gets… worse? I am… worried about that.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly natural to worry, Sherrell. It’s good that you're asking these questions. If it is something serious, there are treatments and strategies available to help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression. We have medications that can help with memory and cognition, and there are therapies like cognitive rehabilitation that can help you learn strategies to cope with any difficulties. There are also support groups available where you can connect with others who are going through similar experiences. We’ll take things one step at a time. Let’s start with the blood tests and the referral for a more comprehensive assessment. We’ll get a clearer picture of what’s going on and then develop a plan together. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that is… all. I am… a little overwhelmed. But… thank you, Doctor. For… explaining everything. And… for being patient. I… appreciate it. When will… the blood tests be? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. I understand you’re overwhelmed, and that's perfectly alright. I'm glad I could help. I’ll write you a lab order for the blood tests right now. You can go to [Name of Local Lab] – they’re located at [Address of Local Lab]. You don’t need an appointment. Just bring your insurance card and a form of identification. The results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We’ll also get the referral for the comprehensive cognitive assessment underway. It may take a few weeks to get an appointment, but we'll get it scheduled as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that is… everything. Thank you… again, Doctor. You have… been very kind. I will… go to the lab tomorrow. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
