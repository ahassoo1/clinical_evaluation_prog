DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter saying my cholesterol was a bit high, from a blood test. I don't rightly understand all that stuff, but figured I should get it checked out. Old age, you know? Things start goin' wonky.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to discuss it. High cholesterol is very common, and we can definitely figure out what's going on and the best way to manage it. "Wonky" is a good way to put it – things do change as we get older. Okay, I see your cholesterol levels here from July 15th. Just to clarify, did your primary care doctor discuss the numbers with you at all, or was the letter the extent of the information you received?
PATIENT: Just the letter, Doctor. Old Doc Hemlock… bless his soul, he passed away last year. Didn't have much time for explaining things, always rushin' off to the next patient. Good man, though. So, this letter just said it was high. Didn’t say how high, or what that even means. I mostly eat pretty healthy, I think. Lots of fish, some vegetables… maybe too many potatoes, now that I think about it. My wife, bless her, she always made a good mashed potato.
DOCTOR: I see. That's understandable, and I'm sorry to hear about Dr. Hemlock. It’s not ideal when explanations are rushed. Let’s go over those numbers then. Your total cholesterol is 245, your LDL – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – is 160, your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is 40, and your triglycerides are 180. Generally, we want to see total cholesterol under 200, LDL under 100, HDL above 60, and triglycerides under 150. So, your LDL is a little high, and your HDL is a bit low. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Numbers… always did confuse me. So, higher is worse for the bad one, and lower is worse for the good one? And I'm off on both, huh? That doesn't sound good. I'm tryin' to follow, Doctor, really I am. You said LDL… is that the one that clogs things up? Like in your arteries, I think I heard on the television once.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right! Higher is worse for the LDL, and lower is worse for the HDL. You're doing a great job following along, honestly. It can be confusing. And yes, LDL is often called "bad" cholesterol because it can build up in your arteries, making them narrow and hard – that’s what we call atherosclerosis. That can lead to heart problems or stroke. HDL, the "good" cholesterol, actually helps remove LDL from the arteries. Do you mind if I quickly explain a little more about why we worry about these numbers, and then we can talk about what steps we can take?
PATIENT: No, no, go ahead, Doctor. I’ve got all the time in the world. Better to understand it than just poke at it blindly, right? I always liked knowin' how things worked. Used to fix radios when I was a young man. Still got a couple in the attic, if they weren't full of dust. So, show me this diagram, and tell me what all this means. And don’t worry about me gettin’ confused, I’ll speak up if I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfect way to look at it. Knowing how things work is always best. And fixing radios is excellent – that shows a good understanding of systems! Okay, so this diagram shows an artery – think of it like a pipe carrying blood from your heart to the rest of your body. This smooth lining is healthy. But over time, things like high LDL cholesterol can start to build up here – this yellow stuff is plaque. As it builds up, it narrows the artery, making it harder for blood to flow through. That can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, or even a heart attack if a piece of plaque breaks off and blocks an artery completely. HDL cholesterol, on the other hand, acts like a little scavenger, helping to remove that plaque from the arteries. That's why we want higher levels of HDL. Your triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood, and high levels can also contribute to heart disease. Does that explanation make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a good deal of sense, Doctor. Like a clogged pipe, I suppose. I used to have trouble with the plumbing in the old house… always gettin' backed up. So, the bad cholesterol builds up, the good one cleans it out, and the triglycerides… those just make it worse, is that right? And mine are all a bit off. So, what can we do about it? I don’t want to start takin' a bunch of pills if I don't have to. Is there anything I can do with my diet? More fish, maybe? Less mashed potatoes? My daughter always tells me I need to eat healthier, but she lives clear across the country, and it’s hard to change old habits.
DOCTOR: Exactly! You've got it. Like a clogged pipe is a very good analogy. And yes, more fish is a great start! Let's talk about what we can do. Thankfully, there are many things we can try before considering medication. Diet and exercise are the first steps. Increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids – found in fatty fish like salmon, tuna, and mackerel – can help lower LDL and raise HDL. Reducing saturated and trans fats – found in red meat, processed foods, and fried foods – is also important. And you're right to ask about mashed potatoes – while they aren't terrible, they are high in carbohydrates, which can affect cholesterol levels. I have a handout here with more detailed information on heart-healthy eating. We can also talk about increasing your physical activity. Even a brisk 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a big difference. Before we go further, do you have any allergies or other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, bless your heart for thinkin' of all that. No allergies, thankfully. And no other conditions, not that I know of. A bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age again. Doc Hemlock always told me to keep movin’ with it. So, I still walk a bit, though not as much as I used to. Used to hike in the mountains when I was younger, but those days are long gone. This looks a bit… overwhelming, to be honest. So many things to think about. Maybe we can start with just a few small changes? More fish a couple of times a week, and maybe cut back on the potatoes a little. And keep walkin’, like Doc Hemlock said. That sounds manageable. Do you think that would be a good start?
DOCTOR: That is a perfect start, Mr. Bohnett. Small, manageable changes are much more likely to stick than trying to overhaul your entire lifestyle at once. More fish two times a week, reducing your potato intake slightly, and continuing to walk are excellent goals. We can also talk about portion sizes – even healthy foods should be eaten in moderation. I’d like to recheck your cholesterol levels in three months to see how you're doing with these changes. I’ll also order a basic metabolic panel just to get a broader picture of your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds just fine, Doctor. Three months… gives me time to get used to things. And a check-up is always a good idea, I suppose. Can’t hurt. Now, about this check-up… will I need to fast beforehand? Doc Hemlock always made me fast for twelve hours. It always made me terribly hungry. And will my insurance cover it? I never did get around to gettin' new insurance after my wife passed… it just seemed like so much bother, and I hadn't been sick much before this.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw, I apologize for that inconvenience. It’s necessary to get an accurate reading of your cholesterol levels. And I completely understand about the hunger – it’s not pleasant. We can schedule it for first thing in the morning, so you don’t have to fast all day. Regarding insurance… unfortunately, because you are currently uninsured, you will be responsible for the cost of the blood work and the consultation. The lab work will cost approximately $150, and the consultation is $120. We do offer a payment plan if that would be helpful. I can also connect you with resources in the area that may be able to assist with healthcare costs. Would you like me to provide you with information on those resources?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a bit more than I was expectin'. I hadn't thought about the cost, to be honest. Been livin’ on a fixed income since I retired, and things are tight as it is. Resources… yes, that would be very helpful, Doctor. Anything that could ease the burden would be much appreciated. I don’t want to let this cholesterol thing go untended, but I also don’t want to bankrupt myself in the process. My daughter always tells me to ask for help when I need it… maybe she was right.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's perfectly okay to ask for help, and you’re doing the right thing by addressing this. Here's a list of organizations in the area that may be able to provide assistance with healthcare costs, as well as some programs that offer free or reduced-cost medical services. I've also included contact information for a financial counselor who can help you navigate your options. We’ll schedule your follow-up appointment for November 2nd, three months from today. In the meantime, focus on those small dietary changes and continue to stay active. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
