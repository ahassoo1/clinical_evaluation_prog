DOCTOR: Hi Zoie, nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's… something with the pee. Yes. I have trouble. It doesn't… come easy, you know? Like it sticks. It's been a little while now. Not a big rush, though. Just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble starting your urine stream, and it feels like it "sticks" a bit. And you said this has been going on for a little while now?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A little while. Hmm… maybe… a few months? It’s hard to say exactly. Time goes by, you know. I mostly just try not to drink too much before bed, but it still happens sometimes. My husband, he helps remind me to go, too. He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months. And you’ve noticed it’s more noticeable when you don’t limit fluids before bed. And your husband helps remind you to go – that’s good. Is it difficult to fully empty your bladder when you do go, or just starting the stream is the problem?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a good question. Let me think. I think… mostly just starting. Once it gets going, it's alright. Not perfect, but alright. I don't feel like… like there's much left after, if that makes sense? It's just… hard to begin.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mainly difficulty initiating the stream, but once you get going it feels pretty complete. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. It's not burning, not like… an infection or anything. Just… weak. Like it needs a little… push. It doesn't hurt, though. Thank goodness for that. Everything else works okay, you know? Just the pee.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain or burning, just a feeling of weakness and needing to push to start. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine, or any blood?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. I don’t think so. I haven’t really… looked, to be honest. I just go, you know? I haven't seen anything red, if that helps. Color… it looks like pee, mostly. Normal pee color. Is that a thing? You ask a lot of questions, dear. Not that's a bad thing, just… a lot.
DOCTOR: It is a lot of questions, and I apologize. Just trying to get a good picture of what's going on. Okay, no blood, urine color appears normal. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or flu, or any changes in your medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had a little sniffle back in… spring, maybe? Nothing too bad. Just a little cold. And… medications? I take a little pill for my blood pressure. A small white one. And… something for my bones, I think. A bigger one, I take with breakfast. That's all I can think of right now. My daughter helps me with those, mostly. She keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little cold in the spring, and you take a medication for blood pressure and something for your bones. Do you know the names of those medications, or would you prefer I check your records?
PATIENT: Oh… the names… No, dear, I don't remember the names. I just take the pills. My daughter, she knows everything. Checking the records would be much easier. I'm terrible with names and things these days. Don't blame me, I'm an old lady! It all gets jumbled up.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm pulling up your records now… Alright, it looks like you're on Lisinopril for blood pressure and Alendronate for osteoporosis – that’s the bone medication. Have you noticed any constipation or changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh! Alendronate! Yes, that’s it! My daughter always says it so fast. Constipation… hmm. Maybe a little. Not terrible, but not as… regular as usual. It’s been a little slow going, if you know what I mean. I drink a lot of prune juice, though. Helps a bit. It's just old age, I reckon. Everything slows down eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little constipation, but you manage it with prune juice. Now, just a few more questions. Have you had any recent surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think… Oh! Yes. A long time ago, I had my gallbladder out. That was… goodness, must be forty years ago now? And… I had a knee replacement a few years back. Maybe ten years? It’s a little blurry. No other surgeries, I don’t think. And no hospital stays recently, no. Just the usual check-ups with the doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal forty years ago and a knee replacement ten years ago. And no recent hospitalizations. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, dear. That's a long story. My mother… she had high blood pressure, just like me. And my brother… he had something with his heart. I can't remember exactly what. It was a long time ago. Lots of people in my family lived long lives, though. Lots of strong women. My grandmother lived to be ninety-five! But… that’s all I can really remember off the top of my head. It was a big family, and a long time ago. Things get lost, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and some heart trouble. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just checking your abdomen and doing a quick neurological check. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that's fine. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just be gentle, alright? My old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be gentle. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Everything sounds normal there. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Any pain or discomfort with this?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just feels… normal. A little pressure, but nothing bad. It's alright. You're very gentle, dear. Thank you. It's good to know someone is taking care of me. Old age is a little scary sometimes, you know? Everything starts to… wear down. But you're doing a good job.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes in your legs. And I’m going to have you squeeze my hands. Everything seems normal so far. I'm also going to do a quick digital rectal exam to assess your prostate and check for any abnormalities. This is standard procedure for evaluating urinary issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A… a what now? You want to… check there? Is that really necessary? I mean… I’m an old lady, dear. I’ve been to the doctor before, but… that sounds a little… personal. Is there another way? I trust you, but… that sounds very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and I apologize for not explaining that part better. A digital rectal exam helps me assess the prostate, which can sometimes contribute to urinary issues in women, and to check for any masses or tenderness. However, it’s completely your decision, and we can absolutely skip that part if you’re not comfortable. It’s not essential for initial assessment, and we can explore other options first. We could start with a urine sample to rule out infection, and potentially refer you to a urologist for further evaluation if needed. What do you think would make you most comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh… well. That's… that's good to know. I appreciate you asking. A urine sample sounds much better. Yes, let's do that first. And… maybe talk to a specialist, if you think it's needed. I just… I didn’t expect that part. Thank you for being understanding, dear. You’re a very kind doctor. I'm just an old lady, and everything feels a little… fragile these days. A urine sample sounds perfect. Let's start with that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A urine sample is a great first step. I’ll get you a cup and instructions now. Here you go. Just collect a mid-stream sample, and I’ll send it to the lab. It will help us rule out any infection or other problems. While you're doing that, I'll document everything we've discussed. It will take just a few minutes. Then we can discuss the results and next steps. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that sounds perfect. Thank you. I’ll go to the little room now. Just let me know if you need anything. It might take me a little while, my old legs aren't as fast as they used to be. But I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Zoie. I'll be right here when you're ready. .
