DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I’m Dr. Hembrey. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Thank you. It is… a telehealth visit, yes? My neighbor, she help me with the computer part. I am here because… well, the insurance, Medicare, they said I need to see someone. Something about a check-up, I think. I feel… okay. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here that Medicare has requested a comprehensive wellness visit. That’s perfectly alright. “Okay” is a rather broad term, Ms. Benites. Could you elaborate on that for me?
PATIENT: Elaborate…? Well, nothing is… broken. No pain, not really. My back, it gets a little stiff sometimes, from working on the cars, you know? But that is normal. I am a mechanic. Always have been. It is just… getting older, I suppose. I am 57. Things… ache a little more than they used to. But nothing I can't work through.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon to experience aches and pains as we age, especially with a physically demanding profession such as yours. However, it’s important for us to thoroughly assess everything to ensure there isn’t something more significant contributing to your discomfort. Let's start with a review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? Hmm. Let me see. The doctor, back in the Czech Republic, he said my blood pressure was a little high, once. Many years ago. But I do not remember taking any pills for it. And… no, I do not think so. No diabetes. My husband, he had that, but not me. Arthritis? No. My hands, they are strong. I work with them all day. Just… old. I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. My tonsils, when I was a child. A very long time ago. And… oh! When I broke my wrist, many years ago, working on a car. It slipped, you see? They put a cast on it. It healed okay. But that is all. No other surgeries. I try to avoid them, if I can. Everything has a risk, yes?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. Just… this. For the aches. When they are bad. Not every day. Just when I need it. And… sometimes, a multivitamin. But I forget, to be honest. My neighbor, she gives me some, too. Something for the bones, she says. I do not remember the name. That is all, I think. Mostly just the ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had one. I eat everything. I can handle spicy food, even! My husband, he could not. But me? No problem. No allergies to anything, I think. I have not had a reaction to anything, ever. I am a strong woman. I do not get sick easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No. My father, he passed away… many years ago. Heart trouble. And my mother… she passed away last year. She was very old. A good life, but… old age, you know? It is sad, but… it happens. My brother, he is still living. In the Czech Republic. We do not talk much anymore. He has his own life.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your losses, Ms. Benites. It sounds like you've experienced a great deal. Did either of your parents have any other significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had trouble with his breathing, I think. Not asthma, but… something with his lungs. The doctor said so. And my mother… she had arthritis, very bad. In her hands and her knees. She could not walk without a cane, the last few years. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had cancer. Breast cancer, I think. A long time ago. That is all I remember, really. It was many years ago. Family history… it is hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No! Never. My husband, he smoked, but I told him it was bad for his health. I always said so. I do not like smoking. It smells terrible, and it is bad for you. I do not smoke, never have.
DOCTOR: And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A little wine, with dinner. Not every night. Maybe a glass, two glasses, on the weekend. I do not drink much. I do not need it. It is just… a little something with the food. My husband, he liked beer, but I prefer wine. Not a big drinker, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you tell me a bit about your typical daily activity level?
PATIENT: Activity level…? I work on cars all day! That is very active, you know? Lifting, bending, crawling under things… it is hard work. I am always moving. I do not sit still very often. I keep busy. Very busy. I do not have time to sit around. I like to stay active. It keeps me young.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Benites. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and examining your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I am used to being poked and prodded, you know? With the cars… you have to check everything. So, go ahead. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm listening to your heart now. It sounds regular, but I do detect a very faint murmur. It's likely benign, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Blood pressure is 142/88, which is a little elevated. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. I will also check your reflexes and pulses. Your reflexes are 2+ and pulses are strong and equal in all extremities. Everything seems within normal limits, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur. I also noticed some calluses on your hands, consistent with your occupation.
PATIENT: Murmur…? I did not know I had a murmur. And my blood pressure… always a little high, I suppose. It is the stress, maybe? Working on the cars… sometimes, the customers are very… demanding. The calluses? Yes, of course. I am a mechanic! I have calluses everywhere. It comes with the job. So, what does this all mean, Doctor? Is everything okay?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Benites, the examination findings are not immediately concerning, but they do warrant further investigation. The murmur is likely benign, as I mentioned, but we should perform an EKG to rule out any underlying cardiac abnormalities. The slightly elevated blood pressure also requires monitoring. We can start with a trial of lifestyle modifications – reducing stress, maintaining a healthy diet, and regular exercise. I’d also like to order some routine blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel – to assess your overall health and rule out any other potential issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: EKG…? Blood work…? It sounds… complicated. I do not like going to the hospital. It makes me nervous. But… if you think it is necessary, Doctor, then okay. I trust your judgement. Lifestyle modifications… I can try. Less stress… that will be difficult. But I can try. Healthy diet… I eat mostly okay. And exercise… well, working on the cars is exercise, isn’t it? So, yes. Okay. Do what you think is best. Just… tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will write you a lab order for the blood work. You can have that done at the clinic on Tuesday morning, if that works for you. The EKG can also be performed here at the clinic, at your convenience. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a log of your blood pressure at home. You can purchase a blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Take your blood pressure twice daily – once in the morning and once in the evening – and record the readings. Bring that log with you to your follow-up appointment. I would also like to discuss some dietary changes and stress management techniques, but we can go over those in more detail during your next visit. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Blood work on Tuesday… check. Blood pressure log… check. I will try my best. Just… thank you. For taking the time to listen to me. And for not making me feel… foolish. Some doctors… they do not listen. They just want to rush you through. You are very kind. So, I think that is all. I will see you next time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. It was my pleasure. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, we will work together to address them. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or experience any new symptoms. Here is the lab order and a handout on lifestyle modifications and stress management techniques. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Ms. Benites.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day too.
