DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… something about a… tryout? For… sports, I think. My… ex-wife, she signed me up for something. I don't really remember all the details, to be honest with you. It's been a long time since I did anything like that. A long time.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like this was… somewhat unexpected?
PATIENT: Unexpected is… a kind word, Doctor. She likes to… keep me busy, you could say. Even after… everything. Honestly, I mostly just come when she tells me to. What exactly are we doing here? Is it like… a check-up before I get hurt? Because I don't bounce back like I used to. Not at all.
DOCTOR: It sounds as though this tryout is causing you some concern, and that's perfectly understandable. We want to make sure you're safe and healthy before participating in anything strenuous, yes. It is a good idea to assess your current condition. To start, could you tell me a little more about what kind of tryout this is?
PATIENT: Well, that's the thing, Doctor. She didn’t tell me. Just said “Tryout. August 2nd. Doctor's appointment.” I asked what kind of sports, she just waved her hand and said “You’ll see.” Honestly, it's probably something silly. Like… bowling or something. I’m not exactly… athletic anymore. More of a… supervisor, you understand? I tell other people what to do. It’s less… stressful.
DOCTOR: I see. That is… unusual. And certainly creates some uncertainty. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health and prepare for whatever this tryout may be, let’s start with a brief medical history. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect… regular? No. Not unless you count the dentist. And that’s only when something really hurts. My ex-wife, she’s always pushing doctors. Says I need check-ups, tests, the whole thing. But I feel fine. Mostly. A little ache here and there, you know? Old age. That’s all. I mostly just take a little… something for the pain, when it gets bad. But I don't really… keep track of it. It’s just… a pill. A white one, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you haven’t had a comprehensive medical evaluation recently. It’s good you’re here today, then, to address that. You mentioned a pill for pain. Do you remember how often you take it, or what it's prescribed for, if anything?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, like I said, I don’t remember everything. I take it when my… back acts up. And sometimes my knees. It’s… an old work injury. I used to do construction, you see? Heavy lifting. This was… a long time ago. My ex-wife orders it for me. Sends it over with the groceries. I just… take it. Maybe once or twice a week? Sometimes more, sometimes less. Depends on the weather, mostly. Damp weather, it really bothers me. She says it's for the… inflammation. Is that what it’s called?
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a little more to work with. Inflammation is certainly a possibility. It's good we're trying to get a handle on this. Now, besides the back and knees, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… sometimes I get a little… dizzy. Just for a moment. When I stand up too fast. My ex-wife says it’s my… pressure. Something with the blood. She keeps telling me to watch my salt intake. But I like a little salt on my food. It gives it flavor, you see? And… sometimes I have trouble sleeping. I toss and turn. Mostly just… thinking. About things. Old things. It's hard to explain. It's not a pain, exactly. Just… restless.
DOCTOR: Dizziness upon standing and difficulty sleeping are important things to note. And yes, thinking about things can certainly disrupt sleep. We'll certainly address these. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? No, not really. I mostly eat what my ex-wife cooks. She’s a good cook, I’ll give her that. Sometimes I don’t have much of an appetite. Especially when I’m… thinking. But I force myself to eat. She says I need to keep my strength up. For… things. The tryout, probably. As for changes… maybe I’m a little… softer around the middle? But that’s just old age, Doctor. Nothing to worry about. I haven't been doing much… heavy lifting lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's good you’re maintaining your appetite when you can, even if it fluctuates. Now, Mr. Bartok, before we move on to your past medical history, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Let me think. I don't think so. Not that I know of. I used to get a little… itchy sometimes, when I was a kid. But that was probably just the grass. Or the dust. I've never had a… bad reaction to anything. Nothing I can remember, anyway. My ex-wife always asks me this, too. "Any allergies?" She's very thorough, that woman. But no, Doctor. No allergies. As far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, aside from the pill you mentioned for pain?
PATIENT: Doctor, honestly, I mostly just take the white pill when I need it. That’s it. My ex-wife sometimes gives me… vitamins. Little orange ones. She says it's for my… energy. But I forget to take them half the time. And sometimes she gives me… something for my… stomach. A pink liquid. It tastes awful. But she says it's good for my digestion. But I don’t take those very often either. Mostly just the white pill. That’s the only thing I really… remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like you are taking a few things, even if it’s not regularly. To clarify, the white pill is for pain, you mentioned an orange vitamin, and a pink liquid for your stomach. Do you know the names of these medications?
PATIENT: Names? No, Doctor. Not at all. My ex-wife just… gives them to me. She keeps them in the kitchen. Little bottles. She knows all the names, she has a list, I’m sure. But I don't bother with names. I just… take what she gives me. It’s easier that way. Honestly, I mostly just worry about the white pill. That's the only one I really need. The others… they're just… extras. She says they're good for me. But I don’t really pay attention. I just want to get through this… tryout. Whatever it is.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like your ex-wife manages most of your medication, which can be helpful. However, it's important for me to have a complete list of everything you're taking, even the "extras," to ensure your safety. Perhaps we can try to get this information from her directly?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect… asking her would be… complicated. She likes to… lecture. And she'll want to know everything. Every little ache, every little pill. It'll be hours. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. Is it really necessary to know the names? I'm sure they're harmless. Just vitamins and… stomach stuff. Can’t we just… skip that part? I'm a little… tired of talking about pills, if you don’t mind. This whole tryout thing is stressful enough as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Bartok. And I apologize if I'm pressing the issue. You’re right, it’s frustrating to revisit things, especially if it involves a lengthy discussion. However, even seemingly harmless vitamins and stomach remedies can interact with each other or with the pain medication you're taking. It's crucial for me to have a complete picture to ensure your well-being, especially given the uncertainty surrounding this tryout. Perhaps we can approach this differently. Instead of focusing on names, could you describe what these medications look like?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Fine. But don't expect a detailed description. I don't pay much attention to these things. The white pill… it's small. Round. You know? Like most pills. And the orange vitamin… it's a little bigger. Sort of… oblong. And the pink liquid… it's in a small bottle. Plastic. And it's… pink. Very pink. It smells… fruity. But it tastes awful. Like medicine. Honestly, that's all I can tell you. Small, round, oblong, pink. Are you happy now? Can we move on? This is exhausting. I just want to know what I'm getting myself into with this… tryout. Whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bartok, that is helpful. Small round pill, larger oblong orange vitamin, and a pink liquid. Thank you. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else of that nature?
PATIENT: Serious… conditions? Hmm. Not that I know of. The doctor… a few years back, he said my cholesterol was a little high. But my ex-wife put me on a diet. And I took some… fish oil pills. So that probably fixed it. And I think… I think I had the flu once. A bad flu. But that was a long time ago. Other than that… no. I've always been pretty healthy. Mostly. I used to be very strong, you know? Construction work. But that was a long time ago. My ex-wife keeps telling me to get a check-up. She worries a lot. But I feel fine. Mostly. This whole tryout thing is making me a little anxious, though. What if I get hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, so high cholesterol in the past, but seemingly addressed with diet and fish oil, and a bout of the flu. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. I think… I think I had my appendix out when I was a kid. A long time ago. When I was very young. That’s all I remember. The doctor… he took it out. And I was in the hospital for a few days. Other than that… no. I’ve never had any other surgeries. I try to avoid hospitals if I can. They’re… unpleasant. And my ex-wife always wants to stay for days. It’s… exhausting. This whole tryout thing is making me a little nervous, you know? What if I need a surgery?
DOCTOR: Okay, so an appendectomy as a child. Good to know. Now, Mr. Bartok, how about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly, Doctor, I don't really pay attention to that stuff. My mother… she lived to be a pretty old age, I think. But I don't remember what she died of. And my father… he passed away a long time ago. I was very young. We didn't really talk about… medical things. It wasn’t something we did. My ex-wife asks about this too. Wants to know about… heart disease and… cancer. But I don’t know. Honestly, I just try to focus on the present. This tryout is stressful enough as it is. What if something happens?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bartok. It’s not uncommon to not have detailed knowledge of family medical history. Now, how about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? What do you mean? Like… what do I do for fun? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t really have much… fun. My ex-wife keeps me busy. She wants me to help her with things around the house. And now this tryout… Whatever it is. I used to… I used to go fishing sometimes. But that was a long time ago. I mostly just… relax. I like to sit in my chair and watch TV. It’s… peaceful. I don’t really… socialize much. Is that what you mean? I prefer quiet. This whole thing is making me anxious, you know? What if I have to socialize at this tryout?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a good understanding. Primarily quiet activities, limited social interaction. Now, have you ever smoked or used tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoked? Doctor, no. Never. My mother… she didn’t allow it. She said it was bad for your health. And I’ve always tried to stay healthy. Mostly. I’ve never been one for… vices. I prefer a good cup of coffee. And maybe a little something sweet. But smoking? No. Never. My ex-wife would never allow it, anyway. She’s very strict about that sort of thing. Honestly, this whole tryout thing is making me nervous. What if there are people smoking there? That would be unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Well… I have a glass of wine sometimes. With dinner. My ex-wife likes to have a glass of wine too. But it’s not… regular. Maybe once or twice a week? On special occasions. It’s… relaxing. But I don’t… drink a lot. I don’t need it. Honestly, I just want to get through this… tryout. Whatever it is. I hope there isn’t a lot of drinking involved. That would be unpleasant. This whole thing is making me anxious, you know? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional social alcohol consumption. Now, I'd like to ask about any allergies you may have, if any. You mentioned you didn't recall any, but sometimes people forget. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Doctor, honestly, I've already told you. I don't have any allergies. None that I know of. I eat everything. I don't avoid anything. My ex-wife always asks me this, and I always tell her the same thing. No allergies. I don't get hives, I don't have trouble breathing, I don't… react to anything. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I think I would remember if I was allergic to something. Honestly, this whole tryout thing is making me a little frustrated. Are we almost done? I just want to know what I’m getting myself into. What if I have an allergic reaction at the tryout? This is stressful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. No known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of your physical state, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: A physical examination…? Doctor, honestly, I wasn’t expecting that. I just thought you were going to ask me questions. What sort of examination? Will it be… uncomfortable? I’m not a fan of… poking and prodding. I’m not feeling very well, you know? All this talking about pills and allergies and… history. It's exhausting. Is it really necessary? Can’t we just… skip that part? I just want to know what this tryout is about. What if I pull a muscle during the examination? This is stressful. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Bartok. A brief examination is simply to assess your overall health and ensure your safety before participating in this tryout. It's fairly routine – I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and perhaps a quick look at your reflexes. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. It will help me determine if there are any potential issues we need to address before you begin. It will only take a few minutes. Would you be more comfortable if I explain each step as I go?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Fine. But please, be gentle. And explain everything. I don't like surprises. And don't poke too hard. My ex-wife always tells me I bruise easily. And please, hurry. I just want to get this over with. What if I have a bad reaction during the examination? This is stressful. Just… tell me what you're doing. And be quick. What is this tryout even for?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bartok. I will explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. This will help me assess their function. Take a nice, deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Good. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm. This won't hurt a bit. Blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, can you extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: 140/90… What does that mean? Is that bad? My ex-wife always talks about blood pressure. She worries a lot. And my legs… they ache a little. Old age, I guess. Construction work. Heavy lifting. Is this going to take much longer? I just want to know what this tryout is for. What if I pull a muscle? This is stressful. Just… hurry. And please, be gentle with my legs. They're sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. I'm checking your reflexes now. This is a normal part of the exam. Just relax your leg. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon with age. Now, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen to check for any unusual sounds. Take a nice, deep breath… and exhale slowly. Your abdomen sounds normal. Everything seems alright so far, Mr. Bartok. Now, before we discuss the next steps, perhaps you could tell me again what you know about this tryout?
PATIENT: Doctor, honestly, I've told you everything I know. Which is… nothing. My ex-wife just said "Tryout. August 2nd. Doctor's appointment." She didn’t tell me what it was for, she didn’t tell me who it was with, she didn’t tell me anything! I asked her, repeatedly, but she just waved her hand and said "You'll see." I suspect it's some sort of… bowling league. Or maybe shuffleboard. Something silly. She likes to humiliate me. This is stressful. What if it’s something physical? What if I pull a muscle? What if I embarrass myself? This is all her fault! She just wants to… I don't know. This is ridiculous. Why wouldn’t she just tell me?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bartok. It is unsettling to be in a situation without knowing the details. It sounds as though you're feeling anxious and unprepared. It's not uncommon to feel this way. Now, I have a thought. Perhaps we could call your wife and ask for clarification?
PATIENT: No! No, absolutely not! Do not call her! She’ll… she’ll lecture me for hours. And she'll want to know every detail of this appointment. And then she'll want to come with me to the tryout! It’ll be a disaster. A complete disaster. Just… don’t call her, Doctor. Please. I’d rather just… not know. I'd rather just go in blind. Maybe it’s something easy. Maybe it’s just bowling. Or shuffleboard. Anything is better than talking to her. This is stressful. Just… don’t call her. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. I will respect your wishes and will not call your wife. Now, given your concerns and your limited knowledge of this tryout, I recommend proceeding with caution. To be safe, I'm going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant to take before the event, just in case. And I suggest you warm up thoroughly beforehand. Do you have any existing medical conditions that would prevent you from participating in moderate physical activity?
PATIENT: Moderate physical activity… Doctor, honestly, I haven’t done any physical activity in years. The only exercise I get is lifting groceries. A muscle relaxant… that sounds good. I do ache a little, you know? Old age. Construction work. Existing medical conditions… hmm. Well, my back acts up sometimes. And my knees. And sometimes I get dizzy. But nothing major. Nothing that would prevent me from… shuffling around a bit. I just hope it’s not something too strenuous. This is stressful. What if I embarrass myself? What if I pull a muscle? This is ridiculous. What is this tryout even for?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Given your history of back and knee discomfort, as well as occasional dizziness, I will prescribe you a low-dose muscle relaxant and recommend a thorough warm-up before the tryout. I will also provide you with a list of warning signs to watch for, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop immediately and seek medical attention. Now, while we haven’t been able to determine the nature of this tryout, I think it’s prudent to proceed with caution. I’m going to write a note for your primary care physician, outlining our discussion and my recommendations. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions…? No, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. I’m still… confused about what this tryout is for. But I guess there’s not much I can do about it. Just… take it easy. Warm up. Watch for warning signs. And don’t call my wife. Is that right? This is stressful. I just hope it’s not something too embarrassing. Or too physical. What if I fall? This is ridiculous. Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s all. I just want to go home and relax. And maybe watch some TV. This whole thing has been… exhausting.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Bartok. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that you've done everything you can to prepare. Remember to take things slowly and listen to your body. And please, don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. Here's the prescription for the muscle relaxant, and the note for your primary care physician. I wish you the best of luck with this tryout. And remember, if it becomes too much, you can always stop. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Bartok. And try not to worry too much. Sometimes, the unexpected can be a pleasant surprise. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate it. I just hope it’s not something too silly. Or too embarrassing. Or too physical. Bye bye. Tryout… what a ridiculous thing. I just want to go home and relax. .
