DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Name and why are you here today?
PATIENT: Reneisha Selbitschka. And… well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve gained a fair bit of weight recently, and I haven’t… changed anything in my routine to cause it. It’s just… appeared. It’s been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Selbitschka… right. And how recently are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it began, properly, around… November of last year, I’d say. Perhaps October. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, but it was definitely after the colder weather arrived. And it’s continued steadily since then. Not a sudden jump, just… gradual. About fifteen pounds, I suspect. Maybe a little more.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds… and you haven’t altered your diet or exercise?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not at all. I eat… well, normally. I always have. Perhaps a little more potato than is strictly healthy, but nothing excessive. And I walk, usually to the market and back. It’s not strenuous, but it’s something. My husband says I’m just getting comfortable, but… it feels different this time. It's not just feeling 'softer', it's... more.
DOCTOR: "Normally"... Right. And what exactly does "normally" consist of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… for breakfast, usually a slice of rye bread with a little butter and some cheese. Sometimes an egg, if I have the time. Lunch is typically a soup – a potato soup, often, if I’m being truthful – and a small salad. And dinner… well, my husband is a very good cook. He makes hearty meals. Potatoes, usually, some sort of meat, and vegetables. We don't eat a great deal of sweets. Perhaps a biscuit with tea in the evening. It's… Lithuanian food, mostly. Traditional things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lithuanian… potatoes. Anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, well… I do enjoy a glass of kefir with my meals, sometimes two. And I occasionally have a small glass of cherry liqueur with my husband after dinner. But honestly, sir, it’s not like I’m indulging excessively. We are… sensible people. I simply can’t understand why this weight is appearing. It's concerning, as my mother… well, she had some health issues, and I worry it could be something similar.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, I’ve seen plenty of patients who “eat normally” and then gain weight. It’s usually… lifestyle. Now, let’s do a quick exam. Just to rule things out. Blood pressure, pulse… and I’ll listen to your lungs. Don't make me spend all day on this, alright?
PATIENT: Of course, sir. Whatever you need. I understand your time is valuable. I’m quite happy to have the examination. Though, truthfully, I don't believe it's a simple matter of “lifestyle.” But please, do what you need to do. I just want to know what's happening. It’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure first. Relax your arm. And try not to tense up. It throws off the reading.
PATIENT: I'll try, sir. It's just… waiting is never my strong suit. Is it possible it could be… a thyroid issue? I read something about that, online. Though, I realize that’s probably foolish, self-diagnosing…
DOCTOR: 140/90. A little elevated. And yes, thyroid issues can cause weight gain. But everything causes weight gain these days, according to the internet. Let's just get through this exam, alright?
PATIENT: Of course, sir. You are perfectly right. I do get carried away with reading things online. It’s… a habit. I apologize for wasting your time with speculation. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise entirely.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Pulse is… regular. Now, let me feel your abdomen. Just relax. Tell me if anything feels… tender.
PATIENT: It’s… no, nothing particularly tender. Just… a little full, perhaps. My digestion hasn't been quite right lately, if I'm honest. A little… sluggish. But I attributed that to the weather. It’s been a rather damp summer.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Look, I'm not seeing anything obvious here. It's likely... a metabolic thing. You're getting older. Metabolism slows down. But we can run some blood tests just to be sure. Cholesterol, thyroid, basic panel. I'll order them now. And I suggest you cut back on the potatoes. Seriously.
PATIENT: Very well, sir. Blood tests it is. And I shall… endeavor to reduce my potato intake. Though my husband may object. When will I receive the results? And… is there anything else I should be doing? Perhaps a specific type of exercise? Or a dietary change beyond simply… less potatoes?
DOCTOR: Results in about a week. I'll have the nurse call you. And exercise?
PATIENT: Yes?
DOCTOR: Walk more. Fewer potatoes. That’s it. Don’t overthink it. This isn't rocket science. Anything else, you'll be wasting both our time. I have other patients waiting. Next.
PATIENT: Very well, sir. Thank you for your time. I shall try to follow your instructions. And… I appreciate your… directness. I hope you have a pleasant rest of your day. .
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah. Next. .
