DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Honestly, I just want to get this over with as quickly as possible if that's alright. A friend suggested I look into something... something about preventing HIV. She called it PrEP, I think? I don’t really know much about it, but I figured I should ask.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Helaina. No problem at all, we can definitely discuss PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis. It’s a good thing you’re being proactive about this. To make sure it's appropriate for you, let’s go over some things. First, can you tell me a little bit about why your friend suggested it?
PATIENT: Oh, well… it's a bit complicated. I date, you know? And sometimes… sometimes I worry. It's not a regular thing, but I'd just like to be safe. She said it’s a pill you take to prevent getting anything, even if something were to happen. It just seemed smart. I don’t want to end up regretting anything, especially at my age.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible, Helaina. It is smart to think ahead and protect yourself. And you’re right, PrEP is a medication taken to prevent HIV. It’s very effective when taken consistently. Before we go further, just to be thorough, have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A few times, actually. The last time was… let me think… about two years ago, I believe. It was at the community clinic downtown. Everything was negative then, thankfully. I remember the nurse explaining the results very clearly. I’m pretty good with remembering details like that.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's good to know. And you said it was at the community clinic downtown?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The one on Elm Street. They have a walk-in clinic there. It was a Friday afternoon, if that matters. A young man, very polite, did the test. He gave me a pamphlet about safe practices too, which I still have somewhere. Honestly, I keep a lot of things. I just don't want to forget anything important.
DOCTOR: That's very thorough of you. Knowing the details is helpful. Now, besides the HIV tests, have you ever been diagnosed with any other sexually transmitted infections, or STIs?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. I've been… careful, mostly. It's just, you know, with dating… things can happen. And I’d rather be safe than sorry. That’s why I’m here, really. It's not something I've ever had to worry about before, so I figured it was worth checking out this PrEP thing. It just feels like a good idea for peace of mind.
DOCTOR: That’s a very responsible attitude, Helaina. And you’re right to explore options for peace of mind. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, which the doctor gave me something for a couple of years back, but that’s it, really. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy for my age. I get regular check-ups with Dr. El-Amin, she’s excellent, but they don't usually ask about... this sort of thing. I take a daily vitamin, and that's about it. Medicare covers everything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And Dr. El-Amin is a wonderful physician. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements besides the daily vitamin you mentioned?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the vitamin. Sometimes I take a pain reliever for my knees if they’re really bothering me, but that's an occasional thing, not a regular habit. Over-the-counter stuff, you know? Ibuprofen, something like that. Nothing prescribed. I really try to avoid taking too many pills if I can. It makes me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And just to be complete, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’m aware of. I eat everything, pretty much. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve had all the usual vaccinations, of course, when I was younger. I can’t think of anything I’m allergic to. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach! Although… dust bothers my eyes sometimes. But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that's not an allergy we need to worry about for PrEP. Just making sure we cover all bases. Now, before we discuss starting PrEP, it’s important to do a quick physical exam and some blood tests to make sure you’re healthy enough and to rule out any existing HIV infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds sensible. As long as it doesn't take too long, that is. I have a lunch appointment at one o'clock. I promised my niece I'd meet her. But yes, I’m happy to get it done. Whatever you need. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. The physical exam will be relatively quick – just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief general assessment. The blood tests will take a bit longer to process, but we can discuss those results later. Let's start with the physical exam. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here we go. . Honestly, I try not to look. It’s never good news. But alright, let’s get it over with. I just hope this doesn’t take all afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but nothing to be overly concerned about at this point. Now, let’s just listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and another one… excellent. Everything sounds clear. Do you have any discomfort anywhere?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. My knees ache sometimes, like I said, but that's just the arthritis. Nothing new today. Everything else is fine. Honestly, I feel pretty good for my age. Just a little… anxious about all this, I suppose. I just want to be sure I’m doing the right thing. So, what happens next? Is this PrEP thing going to be easy?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious. We'll get through this together. Now, to be absolutely sure PrEP is safe for you, we need to do some blood work. This will check your kidney function, liver function, and also confirm that you haven't already been exposed to HIV, even though you’ve had negative tests before. It's standard procedure. It will also rule out other sexually transmitted infections. The blood work will take a few days to come back. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and, if everything looks good, start you on PrEP. It’s a single pill taken daily, and it’s very effective when taken consistently. Do you have any questions about the blood work or the PrEP pill itself at this point?
PATIENT: Ugh, more blood work. Alright. Sounds… thorough, I suppose. What about side effects? Are there any? Because I really don't want to feel sick all the time. And is it expensive? My Medicare covers a lot, but I don't want a huge bill. Honestly, I just want this to be as simple and painless as possible. It's like everything is complicated these days.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about side effects and cost – those are important concerns. Fortunately, PrEP is generally very well-tolerated. Some people experience mild side effects initially, like nausea, fatigue, or headache, but these usually go away within a few weeks as your body adjusts. More serious side effects are rare. We will monitor your kidney function regularly while you're on PrEP, just to be safe. As for cost, yes, Medicare does generally cover PrEP, but there may be a copay depending on your specific plan. We have a billing specialist who can help you understand your costs and explore any potential assistance programs if needed. They can also verify your coverage specifics. I can have them reach out to you after this appointment. Does that help alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring. Knowing Medicare covers it is a big relief, honestly. And if there’s a billing specialist to help… that would be wonderful. I hate dealing with insurance companies. So, what happens now? Do I need to fast for this blood work? And where do I go? I really need to get to lunch by one, if possible. This is all very… overwhelming. I just want to be healthy, that's all.
DOCTOR: You don't need to fast for the blood work, thankfully. You can eat and drink as usual. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so you don't have to go anywhere else. I'll write you a lab requisition now, and then the phlebotomist will draw your blood. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. I understand it’s overwhelming, but we’ll take it one step at a time. After the blood work, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Here's the requisition. Just take this to the lab around the corner, and they’ll take care of you. The billing specialist, Sarah, will call you later today to discuss your insurance coverage. Do you have any questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: Okay, good. No fasting is good. And the lab is here? That’s a relief. Alright. Sarah, you said? I’ll look out for her call. I think… I think that’s everything for now. I just want this over with. Honestly, I'm a bit flustered, but thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. Have a good lunch with your niece. .
