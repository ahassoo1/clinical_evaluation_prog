DOCTOR: Right. Evann Buoniconi, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. It’s… good to meet you, Doctor Batara, I presume? Though, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I apologize in advance if I seem… scattered.
DOCTOR: "Presume" is a strong word. I am Doctor Batara. And scattered is… not ideal when discussing your health. But we'll manage. Now, let’s not dwell on memory. Tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, I… I understand it has to do with making some arrangements, just in case. A friend suggested I look into something… an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? She said it would be helpful to have things sorted out, should I become unable to speak for myself. I confess, the details are a bit fuzzy. I'm hoping you can explain it to me, and if it's the right thing for me to do.
DOCTOR: An Advance Directive. Right. A sensible, if somewhat…morbid, request for someone your age. Though, people do have… anxieties. It’s essentially instructions for your medical care if you are unable to communicate. A POLST form is more immediate, for those with serious illnesses, outlining specific treatments. You're asking me to help you decide if you need this. Frankly, most people don’t think about these things until a crisis forces them to. Before we get into legal documents, let's understand your overall health. Do you have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant… that’s a good question. I… I’ve always been quite slender, as you can see. I don’t recall any major illnesses, honestly. Perhaps some colds throughout the years, nothing lasting. I did have a divorce a few years back, and that was… stressful, but I don't believe it affected my physical health. I try to eat well, though I am rather forgetful about taking vitamins, if that counts. Is that the sort of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Divorce is… irrelevant. Slenderness is not a medical condition. And forgetting vitamins is… typical. We're looking for diagnoses, Ms. Buoniconi, not lifestyle habits. Let’s try this another way. Any hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hospitalizations… I… believe I was briefly hospitalized as a child, with a rather bad fever. But it was a very long time ago, and I don’t recall the details. Nothing since then, as far as I know. I’ve always been very careful to avoid getting sick, so I’ve mostly managed to stay out of hospitals. Is that helpful? I truly apologize for my lack of precision. It’s… frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: A childhood fever. Useful, but not particularly relevant to current health concerns. Let’s move on to family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, my parents… they passed away some time ago. My father, I believe, had some heart trouble in his later years, but I wasn't very involved in his care, so I don’t have many details. My mother… she passed away rather suddenly from an illness I can’t quite recall. It was… a difficult time. And honestly, I wasn't very close to either of them, so I don’t have much information about their medical histories. Does that… complicate things?
DOCTOR: Complicates things is… a polite way to put it. A lack of family history is… less than ideal. Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medication allergies… I don't think so. I haven't taken many medications in my life, truthfully. Perhaps a pain reliever for a headache now and again, but nothing regular. I haven't had any… reactions, that I'm aware of. I did once have a rather unpleasant rash after using a new soap, but I doubt that's relevant. It's just… everything feels so distant sometimes. I apologize for the rambling.
DOCTOR: Rambling is… unhelpful, Ms. Buoniconi. You're here to discuss your health, not your… recollections. Let’s try a more direct approach. Are you experiencing any symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms… No, not really. I feel… fine. Perhaps a little tired, occasionally, but that could be anything. I work as an etcher, you see, and it’s rather painstaking work. It requires a lot of concentration, and long hours. But no specific pain, or discomfort, or anything alarming. I just… want to be prepared, in case something does happen. I don't want to be a burden, or leave things a mess for anyone. Is that… unreasonable?
DOCTOR: “Fine” is subjective, Ms. Buoniconi. Your chart indicates a recent weight loss of 15 pounds over the last six months. You reported this to the front desk during intake, yet you failed to mention it to me. Is this accurate?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, that’s… correct. I hadn’t really thought anything of it. I’ve been… preoccupied with my work, and I suppose my appetite has been somewhat reduced. It didn’t seem important enough to mention, truthfully. I eat when I'm hungry, and I haven't felt unwell, so I didn't see the need to cause a fuss. Is it… a problem? It doesn’t sound good, does it? I apologize. I’m clearly not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds is significant, Ms. Buoniconi. Especially given your already slender frame. And failing to mention it is… concerning. I need to ask some more direct questions. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in… bowel habits? No, not really. Everything seems… normal, as far as I can tell. Perhaps a little… irregular, occasionally, but nothing alarming. I don’t usually discuss these things, Doctor Batara. It feels… personal. I apologize for my discomfort. I truly am trying to be helpful, but I’m not very good at medical conversations. Is this… necessary?
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconi, I understand your discomfort. However, unexplained weight loss and changes in bowel habits are red flags. We need to rule out serious underlying causes. I’m going to need a detailed description of these changes. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood… in my stool? I… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. But… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little more… fatigued lately. And occasionally, I’ve had some… stomach cramps. Nothing severe, but… uncomfortable. And I suppose my appetite has been decreasing gradually over the past few months. But I didn’t think it was anything serious. I thought it was just… stress, from my work. Is it something bad, Doctor Batara? I’m starting to get worried. I truly apologize for not mentioning these things earlier. I didn’t realize they were important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Buoniconi. We need to investigate this further. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool occult blood test. And, given your weight loss and reported symptoms, I’m referring you for a colonoscopy. It’s the most thorough way to evaluate the colon and rule out any serious issues. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy…? What… what does that involve? I’ve heard… unpleasant things. I hadn’t realized it would come to this. Is it… absolutely necessary? I feel quite overwhelmed, Doctor Batara. I thought I just needed some paperwork sorted out, not… invasive procedures. I… I need a moment to process this. I truly apologize for my emotional reaction, but I’m starting to get quite frightened. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Perhaps a different option?
DOCTOR: A colonoscopy involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera into your rectum to visualize the colon. It is the gold standard for detecting polyps or cancerous lesions. It's necessary, Ms. Buoniconi, given your symptoms and the weight loss. We need to rule out colorectal cancer. I understand your apprehension. You will receive a bowel preparation to empty your colon beforehand, which, admittedly, is not pleasant. You will also receive sedation to minimize discomfort during the procedure. It's a standard procedure, and we take every precaution to ensure your comfort and safety. For now, I'm also ordering a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a broader picture. Do you understand the need for these tests?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and a colonoscopy… It sounds… quite serious. I… I hadn't realized my situation was so grave. I thought I was just a little tired, and maybe losing my appetite. I truly apologize for not being more forthcoming earlier, but I didn't want to cause a fuss. Is there any chance… it’s nothing serious? Perhaps just a stomach bug? Or… stress? I… I don’t want to undergo all of these tests if it’s not absolutely necessary. Could we perhaps wait and see? Monitor my symptoms for a while longer? I understand you’re the doctor, and you know best, but… I’m starting to feel quite overwhelmed. And frightened.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconi, "waiting and seeing" is not an appropriate course of action given your symptoms and the potential for a serious underlying condition. We are not discussing a minor ailment here. Unexplained weight loss is a red flag, and colon cancer can progress rapidly. Delaying diagnosis and treatment can significantly reduce your chances of a successful outcome. I understand your anxiety, but I am obligated to prioritize your health and well-being. I will arrange for the CT scan to be performed as soon as possible. Once the results are available, we will schedule the colonoscopy. I'm going to prescribe an anti-anxiety medication to help you manage your stress and prepare for these tests. It’s important you address your emotional state as well. Do you have any questions regarding these tests or the medication?
PATIENT: Tears…? I… I don’t know what to say. It’s all happening so fast. I thought I was just… a little tired. Now… now it sounds like I have something very serious. I… I don’t think I can do this. I… I need to call my friend. I need someone to be with me. I can't face this alone. And… what if they find something? What if it’s… cancer? I… I need a moment. Please. Just… a moment. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Buoniconi. Take your time. I will give you a moment to compose yourself. I will provide you with the prescriptions and the referrals for the CT scan and colonoscopy, as well as the contact information for a local support group. I understand this is frightening, but you are not alone. We will face this together. Please, take all the time you need. I'll be in my office if you require anything. .
