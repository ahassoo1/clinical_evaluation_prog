DOCTOR: Hi Chelise, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is high. Hyper… something. It’s a bit of a worry, really. I don't really understand all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a letter from the lab about your cholesterol. That's a good reason to come in and get things checked out. Hyperlipidemia, that’s what they likely said - it just means high cholesterol. It’s very common, and we can definitely figure out what's going on and how to manage it. Let me take a quick look at those lab results... Do you happen to know when they were drawn?
PATIENT: Let me think… I believe it was about two weeks ago? July 18th, maybe? Yes, that sounds right. I had to fast for it, I remember that much. It wasn’t too bad, but I was awfully hungry afterwards!
DOCTOR: Okay, July 18th, fasting… got it. Yes, here we are. Your total cholesterol is 245, your LDL – that's the 'bad' cholesterol – is 160, your HDL – the 'good' cholesterol – is 40, and your triglycerides are 150. Those numbers are a little elevated, especially the LDL. Before we jump to any conclusions, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your health history, just to get a better picture of things. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Ask away! I don't mind at all. It's good to get to the bottom of things, you know? I try to be healthy, but… well, I suppose things happen. Those numbers… are they bad bad, or just… need a little work?
DOCTOR: They’re not emergency bad, thankfully. But they are high enough that we want to address them to reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. We aim to keep the total cholesterol under 200, LDL under 100, and HDL above 60 ideally. Yours are a bit outside those ranges, so let’s explore what’s going on. First, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve been pretty lucky, actually. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. My blood pressure is usually good when I go to the dentist, and I don't have diabetes. I've never been told I have a thyroid problem either. My mother had… arthritis, I think. And my father… he had a heart condition later in life, but I don't know much about it, really. He didn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Childhood illnesses, no current major health issues, mother with arthritis, father with a heart condition… we’ll note that family history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That’s about it, I think. And… I broke my arm once, when I was climbing a tree. But that didn't require surgery. Just a cast. No hospital stays, no… big illnesses. I've always been quite careful, you see. I don't like to take risks.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, broken arm… no major surgeries or hospitalizations. Good. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything like that?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. Every morning. And… sometimes, I take ibuprofen for a headache. But not very often. Maybe once or twice a month. That’s really it. I try to avoid taking pills when I can. They never seem to do much good, anyway. Mostly just upset my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. No regular medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything… well, almost everything. I don’t really care for shellfish, but that’s a preference, not an allergy. And no, I haven’t had any reactions to any medicine ever. I’m quite lucky, really. My sister is allergic to… something. Pollen, I think. But I’m fine.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked, unfortunately, but I always thought it was a dreadful habit. Horrible smell, and just… unhealthy. No, I don't smoke, never have.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, Doctor. Perhaps two or three times a week. Nothing excessive, I assure you. It helps me relax. A nice Pinot Grigio… but it’s not a habit, exactly. I can easily go without it for days, weeks even. It's just… a little treat now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine – a few times a week. Not a heavy drinker. Now, let's talk about diet and exercise. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a good question. I try to eat healthy. I have oatmeal for breakfast most mornings, with some fruit. Lunch is usually a sandwich, maybe a salad. And dinner… I cook most nights, so it varies. I like fish, chicken, vegetables. I do enjoy a good potato, though. And a little bit of chocolate after dinner… just a small square, you understand. I'm not a saint!
DOCTOR: Okay, oatmeal, sandwiches, home-cooked meals… you sound like you have a pretty balanced diet, overall. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Well… that’s where things get a little… difficult. I used to walk a lot, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I try to get out and about, but it’s not always easy. I do some gardening, which is good exercise, I suppose. And I walk around the house, of course. But… I don’t really exercise exercise, if you know what I mean. Not like going to a gym or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, some gardening, walking around the house… So not a lot of formal exercise. Alright. Last few questions. How would you describe your stress levels?
PATIENT: Oh, my stress levels… They're usually quite good, actually. I’m retired now, so I don’t have the pressures of work anymore. I have a nice, quiet life. I enjoy reading, and spending time with my friends. I do worry about things, of course, everyone does. But I wouldn't say I'm particularly stressed. I try to take things as they come.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Retired, generally low stress. That's helpful to know. Alright, Chelise, that gives me a really good picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. A quick exam is no trouble at all. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. And finally, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. It shouldn't take long. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Ears are clear. Throat looks normal, no redness or swelling noted. Everything sounds and looks good so far. I want to order some additional blood work, just to get a more complete picture of your cholesterol levels and rule out any other contributing factors. Specifically, I want to check your fasting blood glucose, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel with a breakdown of the different types of cholesterol.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. If you think it’s best to check a few more things, then I’m happy to do so. The more information, the better, really. A lipid panel… is that a different type of cholesterol check than the one I already had? And what does a comprehensive metabolic panel check, exactly? I don’t mind the blood work, I just… like to understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Yes, the lipid panel I'm ordering is a more detailed breakdown of your cholesterol. The first test gives us a total cholesterol number, which is helpful, but this one will measure the levels of LDL , HDL , triglycerides, and also some other types of fats in your blood. The comprehensive metabolic panel, or CMP, looks at different chemicals in your blood. It checks things like your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. It helps us make sure there aren't any underlying issues that could be contributing to your high cholesterol. We'll need to schedule a fasting blood draw for that. It's best to fast for 12 hours beforehand, just like the first time. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that makes sense. More detailed cholesterol check and checking my kidneys and liver… I understand. 12 hours fasting, just like before. I can definitely manage that. Do I need a special form or anything to take to the lab, or will you send the order electronically? And roughly… how long will it take to get the results back this time? I’m not in a terrible hurry, but I’d like to know what’s going on as soon as reasonably possible.
DOCTOR: I’m sending the order electronically to the lab now. They should be able to see it right away. You don't need a special form – just give them your name and date of birth, and they'll find the order. Results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once they're available, my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on some lifestyle modifications. We can talk about those in more detail at your follow-up appointment, but to start, try to incorporate more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into your diet. And aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week, if possible. Even a brisk walk can make a difference. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Fruits, vegetables, and walking… I can definitely work on that. I suppose I could try to take the stairs more often too. And maybe cut back on the chocolate a little bit! It's good to have a plan, and I appreciate you sending the order electronically. 3-5 business days… that’s perfectly acceptable. I think that’s all I need to know for now. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll look forward to hearing from your office when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chelise. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
