DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Frankly, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s get straight to it. It’s…a bit embarrassing, really. A sort of…white coating in my mouth. It's unpleasant. I haven't the foggiest idea what it is, but it's certainly not ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to be embarrassed, Mr. Schieber, we deal with all sorts of things here. A white coating in your mouth… when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to these things. Perhaps…a week ago? Maybe less. It’s not as if I’m constantly inspecting the inside of my mouth, Doctor. I just noticed it when I was…well, getting ready this morning. It's just…there.
DOCTOR: Right, a week or so. And has it been getting worse, staying the same, or better?
PATIENT: Worse, I believe. Definitely worse. It’s…more extensive now, if that makes any sense. And it's…sticky. An altogether disagreeable sensation. I do hope it’s nothing serious; I have quite a busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, “sticky” and more extensive. Does it cause you any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not exactly pain. It’s more…irritating. A constant, mild annoyance. And it makes it difficult to…enjoy my coffee, which is rather important, if you understand. Look, is it contagious? My wife would be furious if I gave her anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just irritation and difficulty with coffee. And you’re concerned about it being contagious. That’s good to ask. We'll get to that. Is it on your tongue, inside of your cheeks, or both?
PATIENT: Both, I suppose. Though…more prominent on my tongue. It makes speaking slightly…difficult, to be frank. And eating. It's affecting my appetite, which is most unwelcome. Is this going to take long, Doctor? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, both tongue and cheeks, more on the tongue, affecting speech and appetite. I understand you’re pressed for time, Mr. Schieber. Let me just take a quick look in your mouth. Can you open for me?
PATIENT: Please be quick about it. I truly haven't got all day. And…try not to poke around too much, if you would be so kind. It’s rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see what you mean. There’s a significant amount of white coating on your tongue and buccal mucosa. It does look somewhat patchy. No obvious ulcers or bleeding. Your gums look…slightly inflamed, but nothing too concerning. Have you been using any mouthwash recently?
PATIENT: Mouthwash? No. Why would I use mouthwash? I brush my teeth, of course. Twice a day. Though…my wife did recently switch brands of toothpaste. Some…organic concoction, I believe. Perhaps it's that? She’s always trying new things. A waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no mouthwash, a recent toothpaste change. And you brush twice a day. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Absolutely not. Weight loss…well, perhaps a pound or two, but that’s likely due to the stress at work, and this…inconvenience. I'm a busy man, Doctor. I don’t have time to be ill. Is it serious? You're making me anxious now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills or weight loss. It sounds like this came on fairly suddenly after the toothpaste change. It’s likely oral thrush – a yeast infection in the mouth. It's often triggered by changes in your mouth's environment. The new toothpaste could be a factor, or it could be related to stress, or even something else. Let's talk about a couple of options. I’m going to prescribe an antifungal mouthwash. It's a simple rinse, twice a day. And I'd like you to switch back to your previous toothpaste.
PATIENT: An antifungal mouthwash… sounds dreadful. And switch back to my old toothpaste? My wife will be furious. But…fine. If it gets me out of here quicker. Twice a day, you say? Will it interfere with my coffee? That's rather important. And…is there anything else? I’d rather not spend all afternoon dealing with this.
DOCTOR: Twice a day, and no, it shouldn’t interfere with your coffee, though avoid eating or drinking for about 30 minutes after you use it. Also, try to stay well-hydrated. I'm going to print out the prescription for you now, and a short instruction sheet. If it doesn’t improve after a week, or if you develop any difficulty swallowing or a high fever, please come back immediately. And if you are still concerned, consider seeing a dentist. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve never had any problems with…anything, really. Good. Let’s just get this over with. I have a very important client meeting to attend. Is that all? Please tell me that's all.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all for now, Mr. Schieber. The instruction sheet has more details about the medication and what to watch out for. I’m writing a note to your primary care physician just to let them know what we discussed. And again, if things don't improve, please don't hesitate to seek further medical attention. Get well soon.
PATIENT: Yes, well, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your…efficiency. Hopefully, this will solve the problem quickly. Good day.
