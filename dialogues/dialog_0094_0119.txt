DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Ka Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s…rather drafty in here, isn’t it? But never mind that. I’m here because… well, it’s a delicate matter. A gentleman friend of mine is experiencing…a discharge. It’s most unpleasant. And frankly, quite worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. It’s good you’re seeking medical attention for your friend. It's always best to get these things checked out. And you're right to be concerned; it’s important to determine the cause. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a bit more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Must we be so…graphic? It’s…it’s…well, it’s not clear. It's…a sort of yellowish color, I suppose. And there's a bit of an odor. Not terrible, mind you, but noticeable. He’s been trying to…clean things up, of course, but it just doesn’t seem to be helping. It’s been going on for…oh, maybe a week? I really don’t know precisely. He's not one to discuss these things openly, you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand it’s a difficult topic to discuss, Ms. Wartick, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. It's good he's attempting to keep the area clean. A yellowish discharge with an odor could indicate a few different things. About a week in duration is helpful information. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if he’s experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, obviously he's experiencing discomfort. What did you expect? But beyond that…let me think. He hasn't mentioned any pain, specifically. Though he is a bit…irritable, come to think of it. And he's been going to the bathroom more frequently, perhaps. Though that could be the water, honestly. We had quite a bit of rain last week. I don't believe he has a fever, but I haven’t taken his temperature. He’s generally quite robust, you see. A very healthy man. It’s just…this is rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so discomfort, increased irritability, and more frequent urination, but no reported pain or fever. That's helpful. You mentioned he's generally robust, which is good. Now, has he noticed any burning sensation during urination?
PATIENT: Burning sensation… Hmm. I don't recall him mentioning anything of the sort. He hasn’t complained of burning, no. Though, as I said, he isn’t one to share these… intimate details. Perhaps he hasn’t noticed? It’s possible. He's a practical man, you see, not overly sensitive. He simply deals with things. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not a medical professional. I’m simply relaying what he’s told me, and what I’ve observed. It's quite frustrating, trying to get a straight answer out of him!
DOCTOR: I appreciate you doing your best, Ms. Wartick. It can be difficult to get a complete picture in these situations. To continue, has he experienced any recent changes in his bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Really, Doctor? What has that got to do with anything? I mean, people have bowel movements, of course. But I don't see the relevance. Honestly, I’m beginning to wonder if you’re taking this seriously. It’s a discharge, Doctor. A rather unpleasant one. I fail to see how his…digestion…is pertinent. But, if you must know, no. He hasn't mentioned anything unusual in that regard. Everything seems…normal. Though, again, he doesn’t discuss these things with me. It’s all rather… vulgar.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Ms. Wartick. I apologize if my questions seem intrusive or irrelevant. I ask about seemingly unrelated things because sometimes there can be connections that help us understand the full picture. It's important to rule out all possibilities. Let's move on. Has he had any recent sexual contact with anyone other than yourself?
PATIENT: Excuse me? Are you…are you implying something? I find that question incredibly rude and frankly, offensive! I have been with my gentleman friend for quite some time, and your insinuations are wholly inappropriate. I will not answer that question. It’s none of your business. I came here for medical assistance, not a character assessment. Honestly, I've never been so insulted. Perhaps I should seek another doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh, Ms. Wartick, please accept my sincerest apologies. That was incredibly inappropriate of me, and I deeply regret asking such a personal and insensitive question. It was absolutely not my intention to offend you, and I understand your outrage completely. It was a lapse in my professional judgment, and I take full responsibility. Please, let’s forget I asked that. I should have been more considerate and focused solely on the medical symptoms. I value your trust and would never intentionally disrespect you. Would you be comfortable if I proceeded with a physical exam of your friend, if he is willing?
PATIENT: Well…that’s…better. An apology is a start. A physical exam…I suppose. He would likely be amenable. He wants this sorted, of course. He’s a practical man, as I’ve said. But I won’t be present, mind you. I simply couldn’t. It’s…uncomfortable. And I trust your professional judgment, Doctor. But if you require any further…indiscreet questions, I suggest you ask him directly. I've shared all I'm willing to share.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I completely understand and respect your boundaries. I will examine your friend privately and refrain from asking any further personal questions without his direct consent. If you’ll excuse me for a moment, I’ll go and see if he's ready. Please make yourselves comfortable in the waiting room. I will let you know as soon as I’m ready.
