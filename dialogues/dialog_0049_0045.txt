DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s... the flushing. My face gets very red. Happens sometimes, not all the time. It's been happening a few weeks now, I think. Maybe a month? Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Flushing…for a month, you say. And just your face?
PATIENT: Yes, just my face. And sometimes…my neck a little. Not my whole body, only the face and neck. It feels… warm, when it happens. Not painful, just warm. Like…when you’ve been in the sun a long time. But I haven’t been in the sun. It happens inside, mostly.
DOCTOR: Inside, you say. And does anything trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger? You mean…something makes it happen? I don’t think so. Not that I know of. Sometimes it happens when I'm… talking. Sometimes when I'm eating. Sometimes just…sitting. It doesn’t seem to follow any pattern. That’s what’s worrying me. It just…comes and goes. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: It’s…unusual, certainly. Do you notice any other symptoms with the flushing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. Maybe… a little bit of a fast heartbeat sometimes, when it happens. But not always. And sometimes… I feel a little shaky. But honestly, Doctor, it could just be me noticing things more because my face is red! It's hard to say. I’m an old man, things get shaky. Do you… understand?
DOCTOR: A fast heartbeat and shakiness…concurrently with the flushing. And you’re noticing this sporadically, no clear pattern. Have you experienced any dizziness, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath along with this?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness. Not lightheaded, no. And I can breathe okay. Never short of breath. I walk to the store every day, still. I think I would notice if I couldn’t breathe. It’s just… the flushing. It’s embarrassing, you know? People look at me. Is it something serious, Doctor? I don't have… insurance. That makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost. We'll try to be efficient. No shortness of breath is good. Are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. I used to, a long time ago, for my blood pressure. But the doctor took me off of it years ago. Said I didn’t need it anymore. And I haven’t taken anything since. Just…vitamins, sometimes. A multivitamin. But not every day. And I stopped taking those a few weeks ago, when the flushing started. I thought maybe they were doing something. But it hasn't helped.
DOCTOR: No medications, stopped vitamins a few weeks ago when the flushing began…Any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I used to love mangoes, even though some people are allergic. Never had a problem. My wife…she was allergic to cats. But I’m not allergic to anything, as far as I know. I haven’t been stung by a bee in years. Is that what you mean? Like… a rash or something? No rash. Just…red face. It’s very confusing.
DOCTOR: No known allergies… Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart, just to get a baseline. Then we'll take a look at your face more closely. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright, Doctor. Blood pressure is good. I remember the other doctor said it was good, before. You can check it, if you want. And listen to my heart. Anything to figure out what’s going on. My face…it doesn’t hurt, but it feels hot. Is there something I should be doing?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is…slightly elevated, 148 over 92. Not dramatically high, but something to monitor. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. There is noticeable erythema across your cheeks and forehead. No visible rash or lesions. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really. I eat the same things I always eat. Rice and lentils, mostly. Some vegetables. Fish sometimes. My wife used to cook a lot more… but she passed away last year. I don’t cook much anymore. Mostly just…simple things. I get takeout sometimes, from the Indian restaurant down the street. But I’ve been getting takeout for years. It hasn’t changed. Maybe…I've been eating a little more spicy food lately. Is that bad? I liked spicy food, even before.
DOCTOR: Increased spicy food intake… Could be a contributing factor, though less common. Given your age and slightly elevated blood pressure, we should rule out other possibilities. I am going to order a basic blood panel – complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. It will help us assess your overall health and identify any underlying issues. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Yes, I understand. Tests are good. I always liked tests. Knowing what's going on is better than not knowing. Will the tests tell me what’s making my face red, Doctor? And… how much will they cost? I don't have much money, you see. My wife… everything went to the funeral. It’s been a hard year.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will give us a clearer picture. While they won’t definitively pinpoint the cause of your flushing, they’ll help rule out several potential issues – things like thyroid problems or underlying inflammation. As for the cost… it varies. I will have the lab give you a cost estimate before they draw the blood. It should be relatively inexpensive, compared to other tests. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding spicy foods and alcohol, just to see if that makes a difference. And I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible. I can give you a referral to a low-cost clinic that offers blood pressure monitoring services. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Avoid spicy food… I can do that. It will be hard, but I can do it. And no alcohol, I haven’t had much lately anyway. And a clinic for the blood pressure… that’s very kind. Thank you. My wife always said I worry too much. Maybe she was right. So…what happens after the tests? How long will it take? And do I need to come back here?
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take 3-5 business days. I'll have the results sent directly to my office, and my assistant will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We’ll review the results, and determine if any further investigation is needed. Depending on the results, we may need to consider referral to a dermatologist or cardiologist, but let’s not jump to conclusions yet. For now, focus on avoiding spicy food and monitoring your blood pressure. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's just… nice to have someone looking into it. Thank you. I’ll try to avoid the spicy food. And I’ll wait for the phone call. Is there anything I need to do before the blood tests? Like… not eat for a few hours? I always forget things like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drink – except water – for 12 hours beforehand. I'll give you this form with detailed instructions. It also has the lab’s contact information. Please, don't hesitate to call them if you have any questions. Alright, well, I think we’ve covered everything for now. We’ll be in touch once the results are available. I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will see you then.
