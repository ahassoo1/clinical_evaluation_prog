DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Purtee. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in… how I smell, I guess. My body odor. It’s just… different than it used to be. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it’s enough that I noticed, and my daughter noticed too.
DOCTOR: Okay, a change in body odor. That's... certainly something we can look into. Hmm. And when did you first notice this change, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. It started… maybe three or four weeks ago? It wasn’t sudden, more like a gradual thing. At first I thought maybe it was just the heat, you know? But it hasn’t gone away, even when it's cooler. I usually notice things pretty quickly, so that's why I came in.
DOCTOR: Three or four weeks… gradual onset. Okay. And would you describe the odor as… stronger than usual?
PATIENT: Not necessarily stronger, no. It's just… different. Hard to explain. It’s not like I smell worse, it’s just… not me. It's almost… a little bit sour, maybe? I don't usually smell sour. I always try to keep things clean, you know? I shower every day, change clothes, everything.
DOCTOR: A sour odor… and you’ve maintained your usual hygiene routine. Alright. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this change in body odor?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t been feeling sick or anything. No fever, no sweating more than usual, no rashes… just this smell. My appetite's been normal, and I’m sleeping okay. I have been a little bit more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t these days? It’s been a hot summer. But that can’t be it, can it?
DOCTOR: No other symptoms… just the fatigue, which you attribute to the heat. Okay. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but other than that, I’m pretty healthy. I take a little bit of Vitamin D in the winter, but that's about it. I’m on Medicare, so they keep a good record of things, I guess. I haven’t seen a doctor in a while, to be honest. Just for checkups, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, Vitamin D supplement. I see your history here. No significant chronic conditions listed. Any family history of… unusual odors, or perhaps metabolic disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Not that I know of, no. My mother had diabetes, but that was later in life. And my father had high blood pressure. Nothing about… smells, specifically. My grandmother on my mother’s side, she always smelled really nice, like flowers. But that was just her, I think. She used a lot of perfume. I really don’t know of anything like what’s happening to me on either side of the family.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, pretty much. No reactions to any medications in the past, as far as I can remember. I did have a bit of a rash once when I was a kid, from poison ivy, but that doesn't count, does it? It was a long time ago. I haven't had any issues with anything since.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to rule out any obvious causes. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your skin, and just do a general assessment. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It's just… unsettling, you know? Not smelling like myself.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Purtee. Let's start with your vital signs. Blood pressure, pulse… everything looks within normal limits. Now, if you don't mind, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at your skin… any rashes, lesions, or anything unusual?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. My skin is just… my skin. A little bit dry, maybe, it’s been so hot. I use lotion, but that’s about it. No rashes, no bumps, no discoloration… just normal, older lady skin, I guess. I try to stay out of the sun as much as possible. I don’t tan easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. Skin appears normal, with some dryness consistent with the summer heat. Now, I’m going to gently check your thyroid gland. Thyroid is normal to palpation, no enlargement or nodules detected. This is all preliminary, of course, but so far, things aren't pointing to anything immediately concerning. Given the change in body odor and your fatigue, I'd like to order some blood work. It'll help us rule out a few possibilities, like metabolic disorders or thyroid issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. Blood work is fine. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Purtee. We’ll run a comprehensive panel, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and a metabolic panel. It's just a precaution. I’ll also include a urinalysis. The lab results should be back in a few days. I'll have my nurse draw the blood before you leave. In the meantime, if you notice any other symptoms – fever, weight loss, changes in appetite – please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. Just… thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's just been bothering me, and I was starting to worry it was something… I don’t know. I just needed to get it checked out. I’ll wait for the results and call if anything changes. Is there anything I should do before the blood work? Like, should I fast or anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. It’s good you came in. It's always best to investigate these things. And yes, good question. For the most accurate results, please fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks – just water is fine. My nurse will remind you of that when she draws the blood. We'll give you a call with the results as soon as they're available. Do you have any further questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Fasting for 8-12 hours, got it. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. We'll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
