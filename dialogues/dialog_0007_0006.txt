DOCTOR: Hi Jeannemarie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor Hernandez. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been coughing up some blood. It was… a little bit, but it scared me. It happened a few times now, and I thought I should get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, coughing up blood is definitely something we need to investigate. A few times now, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Maybe… four times in the last week? It’s not a lot each time, just… streaks in the mucus. It doesn’t hurt, but it makes me worry. I lost my husband last year, and… I am trying to take care of my health now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it's wonderful that you're prioritizing your health now. Okay, so streaks of blood in your mucus four times in the last week, and no pain associated with it. To get a better picture of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. The cough… it's not very strong, usually. More like a tickle in my throat. It happens mostly in the morning, when I wake up. Sometimes it happens if I try to lift something heavy, but not always. I don't feel sick, like with a cold or the flu. I have no fever, and I'm still eating normally.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a mild cough, mostly in the mornings, sometimes with exertion, but no other symptoms like fever or feeling generally unwell. And you're still eating normally. Good. Now, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been… a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I thought that was just from being… sad, you know? And I've lost a little weight, but not much. I haven’t been trying to lose weight, if that makes sense. Everything else feels normal, I think.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense. Fatigue and weight loss can definitely be associated with grief. Okay, so fatigue and unintentional weight loss alongside the cough and blood-streaked mucus. Let’s go through some more general health questions to get a better picture. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. Maybe a little itchy sometimes from mosquito bites, but that is all. I don’t take any medicines regularly, just sometimes a pain reliever for a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and only occasional pain reliever use. Good to know. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I had pneumonia when I was a child, a long time ago. And I had my gallbladder removed maybe ten years ago. But other than that… no, I don’t think so. I used to see a doctor regularly, but after my husband… it has been harder to keep up with things. I am sorry, I am not very organized.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jeannemarie. It's understandable things have been difficult. Pneumonia as a child and gallbladder removal ten years ago. No other major medical problems. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she had high blood pressure, and my father had some problems with his heart when he was older. My brother is very healthy, as far as I know. My husband’s mother had… I think it was diabetes? It has been a long time, I don’t remember all the details. It is a little embarrassing, I should know these things.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Jeannemarie. These things are easy to forget. Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure, heart problems, and diabetes. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. My husband used to smoke, but he quit many years ago. I always told him it was bad for his health. I try to eat healthy foods, mostly fish and vegetables. I don’t drink alcohol very often, maybe a small glass of wine sometimes with dinner. I like to walk in the park when the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: That's great to hear. No smoking history, healthy diet, limited alcohol, and regular walking. Very good habits. Alright, Jeannemarie. To get a clearer picture of what might be causing the coughing up of blood, I’d like to do a physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That is perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I'm going to listen to your lungs with the stethoscope first. Just breathe normally. Deep breaths in and out… Okay, good. Lungs are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to check your heart rate and blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to take a look at your throat… open wide and say "ah." Throat looks normal, no obvious signs of infection. I'm going to gently palpate your neck to check for any swollen lymph nodes. No swollen lymph nodes. I do want to get a chest X-ray to rule out anything serious. Also, I think a sputum sample would be helpful to see if we can identify any bacteria or other causes of the bleeding. Would you be able to cough up a sample of your mucus for us?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I can try to cough up a sample. It is not always easy, but I will do my best. An X-ray sounds… scary, but if you think it is important, then I trust you. What does it look for? And… will it hurt? I am just a little nervous.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be nervous, Jeannemarie. The X-ray is a quick and painless procedure. It uses a very small amount of radiation to create an image of your lungs, so we can check for things like pneumonia, bronchitis, or any other abnormalities. It doesn't involve any needles or injections. As for the sputum sample, we'll provide a sterile container and instructions on how to collect it. The nurse will go over that with you. I'm also going to order a complete blood count to check your overall health and look for any signs of infection or anemia. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. A small amount of radiation… that is good. And the blood test too. I trust your judgement. I just want to know what is wrong, so I can… feel better. The nurse will explain how to collect the sample? Thank you. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. I understand wanting to know what’s going on, and we’ll do our best to figure it out. The nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to collect a urine sample, take your blood, and give you detailed instructions on collecting the sputum. She’ll also go over the X-ray process with you. In the meantime, I'm going to document our findings and order those tests. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me before I leave to get that started?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you have explained everything very clearly. I just… thank you for listening to me. It makes me feel better knowing someone is trying to help. Perhaps… how long will it take to get the results back? Is it a long wait?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a bit. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back, sometimes a little longer depending on the lab. The nurse will let you know how to access them online or if we need to schedule another appointment specifically to discuss them. I’ll step out now to get the orders processed and Sarah will be with you shortly. Please don't hesitate to ask her any questions you think of. We’ll figure this out together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness very much.
