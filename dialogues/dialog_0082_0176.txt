DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been… oh, goodness, more than two days now. It’s really starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, alright. More than two days… yes, that is quite a while. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started… let me think… Tuesday, I believe. I was laughing with my friend Fatima, we were reminiscing about old times, and then hic just… started. At first, it wasn’t so bad, a few here and there. But they just keep coming, hic, no matter what I do. They don't really seem to be tied to anything specific now, just… random.
DOCTOR: Hmm, started with laughter, and now they're just… persistent. Do you notice anything that makes them worse, or perhaps anything that makes them a little bit better, even if it's just momentarily?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Nothing really makes them better, honestly. I tried drinking water quickly, like everyone says, hic, but that didn't help. And I don’t think anything makes them worse, specifically. I mean, bending over sometimes feels a bit… uncomfortable with them, hic, but that's just because of the pressure, I think. It's just… constant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Constant hiccups for over two days... and no relief with typical remedies. Have you experienced anything like this before, Ivette?
PATIENT: No, never. hic Not like this. I get hiccups sometimes, sure, but they always go away after a few minutes, maybe an hour at most. hic This is different. It’s… unsettling. I feel like I haven’t had a proper breath in days. It's exhausting, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. That does sound quite frustrating and tiring. Now, let's just run through a few general questions, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. hic I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been stable for a while now. My doctor back home said it was just stress-related. hic Other than that… no. I’m generally pretty healthy, all things considered. I try to eat well, get some exercise… you know, the usual.
DOCTOR: Alright, stable blood pressure after some previous issues... good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. hic Never needed any, thankfully. Just a few stitches when I was a child, climbing a tree… but nothing major. hic Just the usual bumps and scrapes, really.
DOCTOR: Good, no surgeries. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had some trouble with her heart later in life, hic, but that was when she was quite old. My father was healthy as an ox until the very end, really. hic No history of… prolonged hiccups, if that's what you’re asking. Just the usual things, you know. Arthritis, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ivette?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. hic I prefer to avoid them if I can. Just a multivitamin every now and then, but that’s it. hic I really believe in letting my body do its own healing, you know? I’ve been lucky enough to stay healthy without needing much help.
DOCTOR: Okay. No current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. hic I can eat pretty much anything. I love Egyptian food, of course, and I've travelled a lot, hic so I've tried all sorts of things. No reactions ever. I’m a pretty lucky eater, I suppose. hic
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No known allergies. Just one moment, Ivette. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look in your throat. Just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. hic That sounds perfectly reasonable. Anything to figure out what’s causing these dreadful hiccups! hic Go ahead, please. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a nice, deep breath for me, please… and hold it. Heart sounds are… regular. Lungs are clear. Throat looks… a little red, but nothing dramatic. No obvious swelling or irritation. Hmm. Everything sounds… normal, physically. Do you feel any pain anywhere when you hiccup?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. hic Not at all. It's just… the spasm. It feels like something catches in my chest, and then… hic I hiccup. But no actual pain. It's more… uncomfortable. And embarrassing, to be honest! hic Especially when I'm out with friends. It’s just… relentless. hic
DOCTOR: I understand. No pain, just the spasm and discomfort. Now, this has been going on for over two days with no relief... and everything sounds clear physically. It's unlikely to be something serious, but persistent hiccups can sometimes be caused by… well, a lot of things. Sometimes it’s nerve irritation, sometimes it’s related to the diaphragm, and sometimes… it just happens. Given your lack of other symptoms, I don't think we need to rush into any major tests right away. But I would like to try a medication that can sometimes help calm down the hiccups. It's a muscle relaxant. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. hic Anything to get rid of these. hic A muscle relaxant sounds good. I haven't taken anything in years, hic but I trust your judgment. What are the side effects, if you don’t mind me asking? hic I’d like to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Of course. It can cause some drowsiness, that’s the most common side effect. You might feel a little dizzy or have a dry mouth. Rarely, some people experience mild stomach upset. It’s important not to drive or operate heavy machinery if you feel drowsy. I'll start you on a low dose, and we'll see how you respond. Are you allergic to any medications in general, even those you haven't mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. hic I've never had a reaction to any medication before, thankfully. hic I used to take something for my blood pressure, a few years back, but I stopped when I didn’t need it anymore and I don’t recall any issues. hic Nothing comes to mind, no. hic I’m pretty careful about what I put into my body, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Now, I'm going to write you a prescription for baclofen, 10 milligrams, three times a day. Take it with food. If you don’t feel any improvement after three days, please call the office and we’ll reassess. And if you experience any unusual side effects, like severe dizziness or difficulty breathing, stop taking the medication and contact me immediately. Do you have any questions about the prescription or the medication itself?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. hic Baclofen, 10 milligrams, three times a day with food. hic And contact you if no improvement after three days, or if I have any bad side effects. hic That all sounds pretty straightforward. hic Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to help me. hic Hopefully, this will finally stop these dreadful hiccups!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I hope so too. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. We'll see how it goes. I'll make a note to check in with you in a few days. In the meantime, try to relax and get some rest. Here’s a patient instruction sheet as well, detailing potential side effects and what to expect. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. hic You've been very helpful, Doctor. hic Thank you again for seeing me so quickly. hic I really do appreciate it. hic I'll let you know how it goes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. Please do. And if they don’t stop, don’t hesitate to call. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. Take care.
