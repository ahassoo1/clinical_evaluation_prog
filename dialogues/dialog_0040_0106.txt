DOCTOR: Alright, Louine Cannington, 89 years young. Right. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my foot. This awful sore won’t heal. Been at it for… oh, goodness, feels like forever. It’s just getting worse, you know? And it hurts. It really does.
DOCTOR: "Forever" isn’t a very precise measurement, dear. How long, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you go getting smart with me, young lady. I know perfectly well what “forever” means. But if you must have specifics… let me think. It started… after I stubbed it on my bedpost. That was… April, I believe. Yes, April. So, three months, maybe a bit more. It hasn't gotten better since then, that's for certain. And it's not like I haven't been putting ointment on it! My niece, she’s a nurse, gave me some. Didn’t do a thing.
DOCTOR: Right. April. And what kind of ointment was that, if you recall?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't recall the name. Some fancy one, in a little silver tube. My niece knows best, always has. She said it was for… well, for sores, naturally. I just followed her instructions. Put it on twice a day, like she told me. It smelled… floral, I think. A strong floral scent. It didn’t burn, if that helps, but it certainly didn’t help.
DOCTOR: Floral… right. Well, sometimes those over-the-counter things aren't strong enough. Let’s have a look at it, shall we?
PATIENT: Finally. Took you long enough. It's on my left foot. And don’t go poking around too much, it’s quite tender. Honestly, I’ve had better attention from… well, never mind. Just be gentle, alright? It’s right here… on the top, near my toes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. There's some redness… and it is tender. How’s your circulation generally?
PATIENT: Circulation? What a question! I get cold feet sometimes, like anyone my age, naturally. Though I’ve always had good strong legs, walked miles when I was younger. Never had trouble with my legs. But my feet… they get chilly. Especially in the evenings. I always wear thick socks. Does that answer your question? Honestly, I don’t go around checking my circulation.
DOCTOR: Right, alright. Any diabetes in the family?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Goodness, yes. My brother, Harold, he had it something awful. Lost a leg, he did. Terrible thing. And my cousin, Millie, she had it too, but she managed to keep both her legs. It runs in the family, I'm afraid. My niece keeps telling me I need to watch my sugar. She's always on about my sugar.
DOCTOR: And have you been diagnosed with diabetes, Louine?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Years ago now. Don't remember exactly when, but Dr. Hemmings told me. I take pills for it. Little white ones. Two every morning, after breakfast. Sometimes I forget, to be honest. But I try to remember. My niece reminds me, of course. She's very good at keeping track of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what other medications are you taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Besides the little white pills for my sugar… There's a pink one for my blood pressure. Dr. Hemmings prescribed that too. And… oh, and a small blue one for my arthritis. My hands get so stiff in the mornings, you wouldn't believe. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take a half of a sleeping pill. A tiny, yellow one. That’s all I can think of right now, honestly. It's a lot to keep track of, you know, at my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to get a blood sugar reading to see where you’re at, and I'm going to want to send you for an X-ray of your foot, just to rule anything else out. It's likely this is a diabetic ulcer, given your history, but we need to confirm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ulcer? Sounds dreadful. Well, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. As long as it doesn't take too long. I don't do well waiting around, you know. And I don’t like needles. But if it’ll help my foot, I suppose I can manage a little prick. Where do we do this “sugar reading,” and what about this… X-ray?
DOCTOR: The phlebotomist is just down the hall, she’ll take a small blood sample for the sugar reading. Then we'll get you over to radiology for the X-ray. It shouldn’t take long. I’ll have the nurse draw up the orders now. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve always been fairly sturdy. Took all sorts of things when I was a child, never had a reaction. Though, my skin gets a bit itchy sometimes. But that’s just the dry air, I think. Lives in the Marshall Islands for so long, you get used to it. No, I don't think I have any real allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. The nurse will be in shortly to get you started with the bloodwork. And I’ll get the X-ray order sent over. We’ll take it from there. It’s likely this will need some diligent wound care, and we may need to consider a referral to podiatry. But let’s get the tests done first. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Wound care? Podiatry? It's all getting very complicated. I just want my foot to feel better! Diligent… what does that even mean? Look, I understand you’re the doctor and all, but are you sure this is necessary? It seems like a lot of fuss over a little sore. Can’t you just give me something stronger to put on it? Something that will actually work?
DOCTOR: Louine, with your history of diabetes, even a small sore can become a serious problem. It's not about what you want, it’s about preventing complications. “Diligent” means being careful and consistent with treatment. A stronger ointment won’t fix it if the underlying issue isn’t addressed. We need to rule out infection, assess your circulation, and ensure you are managing your blood sugar properly. I understand it’s frustrating, but ignoring this could lead to something much worse. The nurse will be with you shortly. Let’s just get the tests done, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, I know about complications. I told you my brother lost a leg! Don’t you talk down to me, young lady. I’ve lived a long life, and I know my own body. I just want a simple solution. But fine. Tests. Whatever. Just don’t expect me to be happy about it. And hurry up, alright? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve sent the orders to the lab and radiology. The nurse will be in to assist you. I’ll review the results when they come back, and we’ll discuss a plan then. Please let the nurse know if you have any questions. Have a good day.
PATIENT: A good day? Easy for her to say. Young and healthy, probably doesn't know what a proper sore even is. Honestly. Just… tests. Fine. I’ll just sit here and wait, I suppose. It’s always waiting, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: .
