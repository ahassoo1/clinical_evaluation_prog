DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh dear… what brings me in… now let me see. It’s… my stomach, I believe. A rather unpleasant pain, low down. It comes and goes, you see. It’s been happening… well, it feels like a while now. I do apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I understand it’s connected to… something I have? Lupus, perhaps? The name feels familiar.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly alright if you're unsure of the details; we can work through it together. You mentioned a low abdominal pain that comes and goes, and you suspect a connection to lupus?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Lupus… the doctors have spoken of it over the years. It flares up, doesn’t it? And when it does, this pain… it’s quite bothersome. It’s not… constant, thankfully. More like strong cramps, but lower down than I usually experience. I also… feel rather tired these days, but truthfully, I’ve been feeling tired for years. Is that relevant, do you think?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very relevant, Ms. Glymph. Fatigue is a common symptom with lupus, so it's helpful to know that's been ongoing. And you're right, flares are characteristic of the condition. Let’s try to get a better understanding of this pain. Could you describe it a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Let me see… it’s a… a squeezing sort of pain, I suppose. Not sharp, not really… stabbing. More like a heavy weight pressing down. And it radiates, I think that’s the word. It goes… across my lower belly, sometimes to my back. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly where it’s worst. It seems to be worse after I… well, after I eat, perhaps? But not always. I do try to eat a healthy diet, but… sometimes I indulge, I confess.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's very helpful. A squeezing pain radiating across the lower abdomen and to your back, worse sometimes after eating… Okay. And when you say “sometimes after eating,” is it any particular type of food that seems to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I honestly haven’t kept very good track, I’m afraid. It’s not like… a consistent reaction to anything specific. Spicy foods might aggravate it a bit, but I enjoy them so much! And… sometimes it happens even if I’ve eaten something very bland. Perhaps it's the amount of food, rather than the type? It's all very confusing. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Please don't apologize at all, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly normal to have difficulty pinpointing these things, and you're doing a great job describing what you're experiencing. It sounds like it’s not consistently linked to anything specific, and could be related to the amount of food. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… oh dear. That’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it? Well… yes, actually. I have been… more irregular lately. Sometimes… constipated, and other times… well, the opposite. It’s not severe, not alarming, but noticeable. And it seems to coincide with these bouts of pain, perhaps? It's all rather… unpleasant to discuss, but I want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: It is personal, and you're very kind to share that with me, Ms. Glymph. It’s important information, and I appreciate your openness. The irregularity coinciding with the pain is definitely something we should investigate further. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh my. Blood… Now that you mention it… yes, I believe so. Just a little, once or twice. It wasn’t… a lot, and it was… mixed in with everything, you see. I thought it might be from… hemorrhoids, perhaps? I have those from time to time. But it did worry me a little. I didn’t want to bother you with it, thinking it was nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Thank you for telling me, Ms. Glymph. It's good you mentioned that. Even a small amount of blood warrants further investigation, and it’s always best to err on the side of caution. Considering your history of lupus, the abdominal pain, the irregular bowel habits, and now the blood in your stool, I would like to perform a physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A physical exam sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. My energy levels aren’t what they used to be, and a long, complicated ordeal would be… difficult. But I understand you need to assess the situation properly. Please, proceed as you see fit.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. I appreciate your trust. I’ll do my best to be thorough and efficient. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently palpate your belly to check for any tenderness. I'll also need to do a quick digital rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it’s important. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A digital rectal exam… yes, alright. I suppose it’s unavoidable if it’s necessary. You’re right, it doesn’t sound terribly pleasant, but I understand it’s for the best. Please, be gentle, Doctor. And… perhaps tell me what you’re looking for? It helps to know what’s happening, I find.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Glymph. I’m looking for any masses, tenderness, or signs of bleeding. It will help me assess the source of the pain and the bleeding you’ve noticed. I will also be assessing your tone. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. I will explain what I'm doing as I go. I’m listening for any unusual sounds. Your bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. That could be related to the constipation you’ve been experiencing. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. A little… firm, perhaps, but not painful. Oh… there. Yes, that’s… a bit tender. Just on the lower left side. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. Is that significant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is significant, Ms. Glymph. Tenderness in the lower left quadrant is something we need to investigate further. It could be related to several things, including diverticulitis, which is inflammation or infection of small pouches that can form in the colon. Now I'm going to proceed with the digital rectal exam. Please take deep breaths, and let me know if you feel any pain. I'm checking for any masses or tenderness. I'm also assessing for any blood. I did not feel any masses, but there was some tenderness. I did note a small amount of dark, melenic stool, which confirms the bleeding you mentioned.
PATIENT: Melanic stool… that sounds… concerning. So, what does all this mean, Doctor? Is it serious? Diver… what was it? Diverticulitis? Is that something I should be very worried about? And the lupus… is it connected to all of this? I just… I’m getting a bit anxious now. I apologize. I tend to worry.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Ms. Glymph, and I apologize if I’ve caused you any alarm. It's good that you're asking questions, and I will do my best to answer them clearly. Based on the physical exam and your history, diverticulitis is definitely a possibility, and it's something we need to rule out. The tenderness in your lower left abdomen, along with the melenic stool, is consistent with that diagnosis. However, it's important to remember that other conditions could also be causing these symptoms. The lupus could be connected to all of this. Lupus can cause inflammation throughout the body, including the digestive tract. This can increase the risk of diverticulitis and other gastrointestinal problems. However, to be certain, we need to do some further testing. I would like to order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to visualize your colon and look for any signs of diverticulitis or other abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Testing is good. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. A CT scan… will that involve any radiation? I worry about those things, you see. And the blood tests… will they be painful? I bruise easily, unfortunately. I understand you have to do what you have to do, Doctor, but I do get a bit… flustered with medical procedures.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about radiation and bruising, Ms. Glymph. Yes, a CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis in your case outweigh the risks. We use the lowest possible dose of radiation to obtain the necessary images. The blood tests are generally not painful, but you might feel a brief sting when the needle is inserted. I will make sure the phlebotomist is aware that you bruise easily and will take extra care to minimize any discomfort. We can also apply pressure to the site after the blood draw to help prevent bruising. I will order these tests right away. I’ll also give you a prescription for a stool softener to help with the constipation. In the meantime, I would like you to follow a clear liquid diet for the next 24 hours. This will give your colon a chance to rest and help prepare you for the CT scan. Do you have any questions about the diet or the tests?
PATIENT: A clear liquid diet… That sounds… restrictive. What exactly does that entail? Can I have tea? And broth? I do enjoy a cup of tea in the afternoons. And… what if I feel unwell? I sometimes get a bit shaky if I don’t eat regularly. It's good of you to ask. I am rather particular about these things, you see.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Ms. Glymph. It's important to be clear about these things. A clear liquid diet means you can have fluids that you can see through. That includes water, broth , clear juices like apple or grape , plain tea or coffee , and gelatin. You can definitely have tea, as long as it’s clear and doesn't have any milk or cream added. If you start to feel unwell – shaky, lightheaded, or very weak – please let me know immediately. We can adjust the diet or discuss other options. I can prescribe you some electrolyte replacement drinks as well, to help prevent dehydration. It's important to stay hydrated during this process. Would you like me to write you a prescription for those?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Electrolyte drinks would be… reassuring. I do tend to worry about dehydration. And thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor. I know I ask a lot of questions, and I can be rather… particular. It's just… medical things make me anxious. So, to recap: clear liquid diet, electrolyte drinks, stool softener… and then the blood tests and the CT scan. I think that covers everything. Do I need to schedule the CT scan, or will your office handle that? And will I need a ride? I don't drive anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I understand your anxiety, and please, don’t hesitate to ask questions. That’s what I’m here for. Yes, you’ve got it. Clear liquid diet, electrolyte drinks, stool softener… and then the blood tests and CT scan. My office will schedule the CT scan for you. They’ll give you a call to set up an appointment. And yes, you will need a ride for the CT scan, as you will likely be given something to help you relax. I will also give you a list of instructions to follow before the scan, including what medications to avoid. Before you leave, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and… kind. I feel a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect. Thank you again. I suppose I should go and get some clear broth, then. And perhaps brew a cup of tea… without milk, of course. .
DOCTOR: Excellent. That sounds like a good plan. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns that arise before your appointment. We're here to help. Get well soon, Ms. Glymph. And please, take care.
