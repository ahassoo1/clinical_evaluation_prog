DOCTOR: Hi Tarin, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Maskal. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s become… persistent enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It’s mostly in my right leg, though sometimes it feels a little… off in the left too.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent numbness, that's good you came in to get it checked out. Mostly in the right leg, but sometimes in the left… Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not a complete loss of feeling, more like… pins and needles, or when your foot falls asleep. It comes and goes, but it’s been happening more frequently over the last few weeks. I'd say it started maybe a month ago, but it was very mild at first. I didn’t really think much of it until it started interfering with some of my work. I do a lot of detailed animation, and… well, precise movements are rather important.
DOCTOR: Animation, that is precise work! Okay, so it started about a month ago, mild at first, now interfering with your animation. And it feels like pins and needles, or a foot falling asleep. Does anything specifically trigger it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… not consistently, no. Sometimes it happens when I've been sitting for a long time, working at my desk. But other times, it seems to come on even when I’m walking around. I think it’s worse after I’ve been physically active, like after a hike. But honestly, I haven’t kept a strict log or anything. It's been… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable is a good way to put it. Okay, so it seems to be aggravated by both prolonged sitting and physical activity. Any pain associated with the numbness?
PATIENT: Not really, no. It's not painful, exactly. Sometimes there’s a slight ache, but it’s very mild. More… uncomfortable than anything. Like a dull pressure, if that makes sense. It’s hard to describe. And the ache doesn’t always accompany the numbness, either. Sometimes it’s just the pins and needles sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no real pain, just discomfort – a dull pressure sometimes, and the numbness itself. That's helpful. Now, is the numbness constant when it’s happening, or does it come and go in waves?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes in waves. It’s not a constant feeling. It'll be present for a while – maybe an hour or so – and then subside completely. Then it’ll return later in the day, or the next day. The length of each episode varies. Sometimes it’s just a few minutes, other times it lasts for several hours. It's been fairly sporadic, but as I mentioned, it's become more frequent recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent, coming and going in waves, lasting anywhere from minutes to hours. More frequent recently. Let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. I generally consider myself to be quite healthy. I eat a fairly balanced diet – lots of fish, as you might expect living in Alaska – and I try to stay active. I haven't had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything serious. I do occasionally get headaches, but nothing debilitating. Just typical stress headaches, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, no major medical history, occasional stress headaches. That's good to know. Have you ever injured your back, neck, or right leg?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I sprained my ankle – my left ankle, actually – a few years ago while hiking, but that healed completely. As for my back or right leg… I don't recall any significant injuries. I might have pulled a muscle here and there over the years, but nothing that required a doctor's visit or physical therapy. I’m pretty careful with my movements, given the nature of my work. I can’t afford to be reckless.
DOCTOR: Okay, sprained left ankle a few years ago, but no significant injuries to your back or right leg. Let's talk about family history. Do any of your family members have any neurological conditions, like multiple sclerosis, neuropathy, or anything similar?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit complicated. My mother’s side of the family isn't very forthcoming with medical information. It’s… a cultural thing. They’re not big on discussing illness. However, I do know my grandfather, on my father’s side, had some issues with his balance as he got older, but I don’t know the specifics. It wasn’t a clear diagnosis of anything, just… general unsteadiness. And my aunt on my mother’s side mentioned something about tingling in her hands a few years back, but again, I don’t have any details. It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. Vague family history of some balance issues in a grandfather and tingling in an aunt. We can work with that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to get all the nutrients I need from my diet. I do occasionally take Vitamin D during the winter months, just because of the limited sunlight, but that’s it. Nothing regularly. I prefer to avoid medication if possible, unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, just Vitamin D occasionally during the winter. And no allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods without issue, and I haven’t had any problems with insect bites or anything like that either. I’m pretty lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position at any point. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Just relax, and let your legs go limp when I tap them with this little hammer. First, let's check your right leg... Okay, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Strength is 5/5 in both legs, meaning full strength. Now, I'm going to test sensation in your legs. Can you tell me when you can feel me touching your leg?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I’ll let you know as soon as I feel something. Please proceed at your own pace. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, closing my eyes... can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel it. Right there, on the outer side of my shin.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now, upper shin... Sensation appears intact in both legs. Now, I’m going to check your gait, just to see how you walk. Can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Is this pace alright? Should I walk faster or slower? I’m happy to adjust as needed. I'm just trying to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: Everything looks fairly normal so far. Now, could you walk heel-to-toe for me, just a few steps?
PATIENT: Certainly. Like this? I'm a bit unsteady, I must admit. It's not something I do often. I’m trying to be precise, but it feels a little awkward.
DOCTOR: Okay, thanks. Now, can you squat down and stand back up?
PATIENT: Certainly. There we go. It feels a bit stiff in my right knee, but I managed it. Is that alright? I’m just letting you know what I’m feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, thanks. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything appears normal neurologically, although there is some slight unsteadiness with the heel-to-toe walk and a report of stiffness in your right knee. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you may have some mild peripheral neuropathy, possibly related to a slight compression of a nerve in your lower back or leg. However, to be certain, I'd like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to have some bloodwork done to check for vitamin deficiencies and other potential causes of neuropathy?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. Neuropathy, you say? And bloodwork to rule things out. Yes, absolutely. I'm happy to have whatever tests you deem necessary to get to the bottom of this. I’d prefer to understand what’s going on, and bloodwork seems like a sensible place to start. What specifically will the bloodwork be testing for? And will there be any other tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The bloodwork will check for vitamin B12 deficiency, folate levels, thyroid function, and glucose levels, as those can all contribute to neuropathy. We'll also check for inflammation markers. And I'd like to order an MRI of your lower back to rule out any nerve compression. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, that sounds… thorough. Nerve compression in my lower back. So that explains the potential stiffness. Yes, I am alright with an MRI. It’s a bit daunting, but if it helps determine the cause, then it's worth it. What is the process for scheduling both the bloodwork and the MRI? And is there anything I should do to prepare for either test?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The MRI will give us a better look at the nerves in your lower back. For the bloodwork, you don’t need to do any special preparation – just don’t eat anything for 8 hours before the test. For the MRI, you’ll need to remove any metal objects, like jewelry or piercings. I’ll have my nurse schedule both tests for you now. She’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend avoiding any activities that aggravate your symptoms. Are you experiencing any pain currently?
PATIENT: Thank you, that’s very helpful. Eight hours fasting for the bloodwork, and removing metal for the MRI. I can certainly manage that. As for pain… no, not really. It’s more of a persistent discomfort, a sort of… tingling sensation, and occasional stiffness, as I mentioned. Nothing that requires medication, thankfully. I’ll be sure to follow your recommendations and avoid anything that makes it worse. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel much more informed now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, no pain, just discomfort and stiffness. My nurse will get you scheduled for the bloodwork and MRI. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and explanation. You’ve put my mind at ease, and I feel confident that we’re taking the right steps to address this. Thank you again, Dr. Maskal. I will certainly contact the office if anything changes.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Tarin. .
