DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor… Osterholm, is it? Honestly, it’s a bit of a nuisance coming all the way out here. But my wife – God rest her soul – always insisted on a good doctor, and she picked you. Anyway, it’s the bruising. I’ve been getting bruises… easily. A little bump here, a little scrape there, and suddenly I look like I’ve been in a fight. And I’m on that blood thinner, you see. Makes sense, I suppose, but it’s… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Right, blood thinner. Yes, I see that here… Warfarin, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s the one. Warfa… whatever it is. Sounds like a terrible poison, frankly. They just told me to take the little pills every day and get my blood checked regularly. Which I do. Mostly regularly, anyway. But these bruises… they’re different than before. Bigger, more frequent. It’s worrying, isn't it? A man doesn’t want to look like he’s falling apart.
DOCTOR: Well, bruising can be a side effect of Warfarin, naturally. And it’s good you’re getting your blood checks. Let’s talk about these bruises… where are you noticing them most often?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, Doctor. Really. Arms, mostly. Bumped into the doorframe yesterday – a perfectly normal little bump, I assure you – and now I’ve got a purple mess. And my legs, too. Just from… wearing pants, sometimes. It’s getting ridiculous. I haven't fallen, haven't done anything stupid. It's just… appearing. You'd think with all the money I pay for that medication, it’d prevent this, not cause it.
DOCTOR: Right. Bruising with minimal trauma… and on the legs as well. How long has this been going on, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It's hard to say exactly. It started subtly, you know? A little discoloration here and there. But in the last month, maybe six weeks, it's gotten noticeably worse. Like I said, it’s different now. More than just a little bump. And… well, my wife always kept an eye on these things. I’m not as good at noticing these slow changes, I suppose. I just wish it’d stop. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you noticing any other symptoms alongside the bruising?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmmm… Not really. I’m a bit tired, perhaps. But then, who isn’t? I’m an older man, Doctor. I get tired. No fever, no pain, no… bleeding from anywhere else. Just the bruises. And the unsettling feeling that something isn't right. I’m a pathologist, you see. I’m used to finding things that aren’t right. Being on the receiving end of it is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to confirm, you said you’re on Warfarin for…?
PATIENT: Atrial fibrillation, I believe it was. That's what the cardiologist said. Irregular heartbeat. Something about clots, you see. Preventative measure. A perfectly reasonable one, I suppose, but it's always the side effects that get you, isn't it? A perfectly good medication causing all sorts of new problems. It’s the story of modern medicine, really.
DOCTOR: Right, atrial fibrillation. Okay. Well, bruising can be a sign of a number of things. It could be related to the Warfarin, as we’ve discussed. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well, I suppose so. Though I've spent my life giving physical exams, not receiving them. Honestly, I doubt you’ll find anything. It’s just the bruising, Doctor. I can feel it. Still, if it's necessary… fine. But I expect a thorough explanation afterward. I'm not one for unnecessary poking and prodding, you understand. Time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. A thorough exam is always standard. And I assure you, I’ll explain everything. Please, if you’ll just lie down on the table, we'll start with your extremities. I’ll just take a look at those bruises and check for any other abnormalities.
PATIENT: Honestly. Extremities. As if I haven’t felt my own extremities for the last fifty years. Very well. Get on with it. But be gentle, Doctor. I bruise easily, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright. I see the discoloration here… and it does appear quite extensive. No palpable masses, no signs of infection… Skin temperature is normal. Let's take a look at your legs now. And here… similar findings. No swelling, no warmth. No obvious signs of trauma beyond the bruising itself. I'm also noting some petechiae on your lower legs… small, pinpoint red spots. Have you noticed those before?
PATIENT: Petechiae? Good heavens. No, I hadn’t noticed any… pinpoint red spots. I suppose I don’t spend much time examining my legs. What does that even mean? Is that serious? My wife… she always said I should pay more attention to such things. But I'm a pathologist, Doctor, not a dermatologist! Are you telling me something is terribly wrong? This is what I feared. This is just getting worse and worse.
DOCTOR: Now, let’s not jump to conclusions, Mr. Farson. Petechiae can be caused by a number of things, including minor trauma, straining… or, yes, sometimes it’s a sign of something more significant. It’s important to investigate, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything terribly wrong. We need to do some blood work. A complete blood count, a coagulation panel… and I think we should also check your platelet count. I'll send the orders to the lab now. It will likely be a few hours before we have the results.
PATIENT: Platelet count? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Blood work, coagulation panels, platelet counts… it’s a cascade of tests! All because I have a few bruises and some… pinpoint red spots? Is this standard procedure for a man my age? My wife would have been furious. She always insisted on a pragmatic approach. This feels… excessive. Look, Doctor, are you absolutely certain this is necessary? Perhaps a second opinion? I have colleagues, you see. Very capable pathologists.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I understand your concerns. And believe me, I don’t order unnecessary tests. But given the new onset of petechiae alongside the bruising, and given that you’re on Warfarin, it’s prudent to rule out any underlying issues that could be affecting your blood. It’s a standard precaution. I am not dismissing your concerns, I am being thorough. A second opinion is, of course, always an option, but I assure you, I am qualified to handle this. The blood work will give us a clearer picture, and from there, we can decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause further trauma, and if you notice any new symptoms – such as bleeding from your gums, nosebleeds, or blood in your stool – please come to the emergency room immediately.
PATIENT: Fine. Do your tests. But I expect a full explanation of the results. Not just a list of numbers and medical jargon. I'm a pathologist, remember? I understand these things. And I will be seeking a second opinion, regardless. My wife… she’d want me to be certain. And frankly, Doctor, I find your dismissive attitude rather… unsettling. Just get it over with. The sooner I have some answers, the better. And the sooner I can leave this… rural clinic. All this fuss over a few bruises. Really.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Farson. I'll have the lab draw the blood now. The results should be available by this afternoon. A nurse will contact you when they are ready. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: .
