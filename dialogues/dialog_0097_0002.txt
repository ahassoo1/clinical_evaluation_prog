DOCTOR: “Good afternoon, Zoie. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I have trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s hard to… push it out, you know? It just doesn't come easy anymore. It's been happening for a little while now, I think. Not sure how long, exactly. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: “Oh, no embarrassment at all, Zoie. This is a very common concern, especially as we get older. It takes courage to talk about these things, so I appreciate you bringing it up. It’s good you’re addressing it. When you say ‘a little while,’ could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… a rough estimate… let me think. Maybe… six months? Or was it a year? It all kinda blurs together after a while, you know? My husband, he probably remembers better. He always keeps track of things. But I’d say… around six months, maybe a little longer. It hasn't been too bad, just… annoying, mostly. And I have to go more often now, too.
DOCTOR: “That’s perfectly alright, Zoie. It's very common for time to feel a bit blurred. Six months is helpful. And you’re noticing you need to go more frequently as well?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. More often. Especially at night! I wake up a couple of times… sometimes three! It’s getting old, I tell ya. It’s not a pain, exactly… more like… a straining feeling? And sometimes it just… drips a little when I'm done. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: “Okay, so more frequent urination, particularly at night – we call that nocturia – and a feeling of straining, along with some dripping afterwards. That gives me a little more information. The dripping afterwards is something we want to talk about. It’s not necessarily ‘normal,’ but it's also not always a cause for major concern. Let's explore this a bit more. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Blood? No, not that I've seen. No burning either. It's just… hard to get it all out, like somethin's blockin' it. And then, like I said, a little dribble afterwards. It doesn’t hurt, just… inconvenient. My husband keeps telling me to drink less before bed, but… I like my tea, you know? It’s hard to give that up!
DOCTOR: “I understand completely, Zoie. It’s wonderful you have your husband looking out for you, and I appreciate you telling me about your tea. It's good to know your habits. The feeling of incomplete emptying, like something’s blocking it, is important. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Oh dear… you mean… do I go regular? Um… mostly, yes. I try to eat my fruits and veggies, you know? Keeps things movin'. But sometimes… sometimes I get a little… backed up. Not too bad, usually just a little straining, like with the… other thing. Is that important? It seems like everything is straining these days!
DOCTOR: “Yes, Zoie, it is important. Constipation and difficulty with urination can often be connected. It helps me understand what’s going on overall. And you’re right to point out the similarity in symptoms – that’s good observation. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past, or any major medical conditions like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh my… surgeries… let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… a hysterectomy a long, long time ago. That was… goodness, maybe fifty years ago? As for medical conditions… the doctor said I had high blood pressure for a while, but they gave me pills for that. I take those every day. And… I think that’s it. My husband does most of the rememberin’ when it comes to doctor stuff. I'm sorry I can’t be more help.
DOCTOR: “That’s perfectly alright, Zoie. You’re doing wonderfully. Tonsils out, hysterectomy fifty years ago, and high blood pressure managed with medication – that’s very helpful information. And no diabetes or heart problems – good to know. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. Not that I know of. I haven't had any problems with the blood pressure pills. I used to get a little itchy sometimes with certain soaps, but that was a long time ago. Nothing serious, never had to go to the hospital or anything. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, really. My husband always says I'm too tough to be allergic to anything!
DOCTOR: “That’s wonderful, Zoie! Okay, so no known allergies. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’d also like to do a gentle pelvic exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a pelvic exam? Well… I haven’t had one of those in… a very long time. Is it… necessary? I don’t want to be a bother. If it won’t change anything… I don’t know… It just… sounds a little scary. I'm an old lady, you know? Everything's a little… sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: “I understand your hesitation completely, Zoie. It’s perfectly alright to feel that way. A pelvic exam will allow me to check your pelvic muscles and the bladder to see if there’s anything obvious contributing to your symptoms. It helps me rule things out and get a clearer picture. It's not required, but it does provide valuable information. We can absolutely skip it if you're not comfortable. However, with the straining and the incomplete emptying, I do think it would be helpful. We will be as gentle and respectful as possible, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Well… if you really think it would help… and if you promise to be gentle… alright. But please, stop if it gets too… much. And you’ll tell me what you’re doing first, right? I don’t like surprises. My husband always says I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat. But… alright. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: “Thank you for trusting me, Zoie. I appreciate your willingness to go through with it. And absolutely, I’ll explain everything before I do it and stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. We’ll take it at your pace. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This will help me assess your bladder and bowels. Just lie back and relax, and take deep breaths. Okay, that was good. Now, I'm going to perform a gentle pelvic exam. I'll be using a lubricated speculum and a gloved finger. It may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Please let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort. Okay, that’s all done. Everything went very well. I didn’t find any signs of infection or anything alarming. Your pelvic muscles are a bit weak, which is common with age, and there’s a slight bulging of the rectum – we call that a rectocele. That can sometimes contribute to incomplete emptying. It's not dangerous, but it could be a factor in your symptoms. We can discuss options for that later if you’re interested.
PATIENT: Oh… that wasn't as bad as I thought. Still not my favorite thing, but you were right, it wasn't too terrible. Weak muscles… a recto… what did you call it? Well, no wonder I have trouble! So, what does that mean? What do we do now? Is it going to get worse? I don’t want to end up… well, you know. Stuck.
DOCTOR: “I’m glad it wasn’t too bad, Zoie. You were very brave. And yes, weak pelvic muscles can definitely contribute to these symptoms. A rectocele means there’s a slight bulging of the rectum into the vagina, which can make it harder to fully empty your bladder and bowels. It doesn’t necessarily mean it will get worse, but it can progress over time if left unaddressed. It’s good you’re addressing it now. We have several options. One is pelvic floor exercises – also known as Kegel exercises – to strengthen those muscles. They can be very effective, but they do require consistency. Another option is a pessary – a small device that you insert into the vagina to support the pelvic organs. And in some cases, surgery is an option, but we would only consider that if other options aren't successful. First, I recommend we start with the pelvic floor exercises. I can give you some instructions and refer you to a physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor rehabilitation. They can provide personalized guidance and make sure you're doing them correctly. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Pelvic floor exercises… Kegel exercises? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. I’m not sure I can even find those muscles! And a physical therapist? I haven’t been to a therapist since… well, a very long time. I just want it to be easy. Is there a pill I can take? My husband always says a pill fixes everything. Maybe a little something to just… help things along?
DOCTOR: “I understand your hesitation, Zoie. It can seem daunting, but pelvic floor exercises are surprisingly simple once you get the hang of them, and they don't require any special equipment. We can start very slowly and I’ll provide you with clear instructions and diagrams. Unfortunately, there isn’t a pill that will directly fix this issue. Medications can help with symptoms like frequent urination, but they won’t address the underlying muscle weakness. However, I can prescribe a medication called oxybutynin, which can help reduce bladder spasms and frequency. It might make things more comfortable while we work on strengthening your muscles. But it does have some side effects, like dry mouth and constipation, so we'll need to weigh the risks and benefits. Before we decide on medication, let’s talk about the pelvic floor exercises again. I can refer you to a wonderful physical therapist who is very patient and experienced. They can teach you the proper technique and make sure you’re comfortable. Would you be open to trying that?
PATIENT: Oh… side effects? Dry mouth and constipation? That doesn't sound very appealing, dear. I already have trouble with… regularity, as we said. And dry mouth… oh, I hate that. Alright… alright, maybe the physical therapist. But… are they nice? I don’t want someone… poking and prodding. And I don't want to have to go a lot. My husband drives me everywhere, and I don't want to bother him too much. Can you recommend someone who is… gentle? And doesn't require a lot of appointments?
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Zoie. I understand your concerns completely. I can recommend Sarah Miller – she's excellent. She has a very gentle and compassionate approach, and she specializes in working with older adults. She’s very good at explaining everything and making you feel comfortable. She typically recommends a series of six sessions, but we can discuss adjusting that based on your progress and preferences. And she’s very flexible with scheduling. I’ll give you her number and you can call her office to set up an appointment. You can tell her I referred you, and she’ll be happy to answer any questions you have before you commit. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a handout with instructions for pelvic floor exercises. Start with five squeezes, three times a day, and gradually increase as you get stronger. Does that sound like a good plan, Zoie?
PATIENT: Five squeezes, three times a day… I think I can manage that. Sarah Miller… gentle and compassionate… that sounds good. Very good. Alright, yes. That sounds like a good plan. A handout… and her number. Thank you, dear. You've been very patient with me. I was worried it was something awful. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… am I all set for now?
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Zoie. I’m glad I could ease your worries. You're all set for now. We’ll start with the exercises and see how you’re doing. I’ll give you a follow-up appointment in six weeks to see if they’re helping. If you have any concerns or questions before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here are the handouts and Sarah Miller’s contact information. And remember, start slowly and listen to your body. I’m confident you’ll see improvement with consistent exercise. Take care, Zoie, and please come back and see me if anything changes.”
PATIENT: Thank you again, dear. You're a very kind doctor. I'll try my best. And I will call if anything… well, you know. Goodbye now. .
