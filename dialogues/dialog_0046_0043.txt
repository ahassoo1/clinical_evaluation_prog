DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it's this headache I've been getting. Right in the back of my head. It's been bothering me for a little while now, on and off. Not terrible, but enough to make me notice, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Percell. A headache that’s been coming and going. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It doesn't throb, exactly. More of a… a pressure, like a tight band around my head. It usually starts in the afternoon, and it's worse when I've been looking at the computer for a long time. I do a lot of work with numbers, financial stuff, so I'm on the computer quite a bit. It doesn't really come with nausea or anything, just… uncomfortable. And sometimes my neck feels a little stiff too, on the same side as the headache. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Percell. A pressure-like headache, worse with computer use, and associated with some neck stiffness. That’s helpful. When you say “a little while now,” roughly how long have you been experiencing these headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I’d say maybe… three, four months now? It started gradually, just a little bit of discomfort after a long day. Didn’t think much of it at first, figured it was just from being old, ha! But it hasn’t really gone away completely, and it’s been bothering me more lately. I try to take breaks, but sometimes I get caught up in things. It's hard to stop when you're trying to help people with their money, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Percell. It’s good that you’ve been trying to take breaks, even if it’s difficult. Three to four months of this discomfort is certainly worth investigating. I’m just going to take a quick look at your chart here. I see you’ve had a few visits in the past for… high blood pressure, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Years ago, though. I used to take medicine for it, but the doctor said I could stop a while back. Said my numbers were looking good. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. And I walk when I can, but the weather hasn't been the best lately. It’s been so humid! Does that matter with the headache? I always forget what everything is connected.
DOCTOR: It absolutely can matter, Percell. Both the high blood pressure history and the humidity. We'll definitely take both of those into consideration. It’s good you were able to get off the medication, and walking is excellent. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately – blurry vision, seeing spots, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, go ahead. Let me think about my vision… hmm. Not really blurry, no. And no spots, either. Sometimes my eyes feel a little tired at the end of the day, especially after staring at the computer screen for hours. But that's just from being tired, I think. I wear glasses, you know, for reading and such. I got them checked last year, I believe. Everything was fine then. I'm pretty sure. My memory isn't what it used to be! Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Percell. It’s good to know you had your vision checked recently and that it was normal then. The eye fatigue is certainly something to consider, especially with the computer work. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And definitely no weight loss! If anything, I could use to lose a little weight, ha! I eat pretty well, maybe a little too well sometimes. My wife used to be a fantastic cook, but… well, that was a long time ago. No night sweats either. I sleep pretty soundly, actually. Sometimes too soundly, my daughter says. She worries about me. Is that all?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Percell. No fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats is reassuring. And sleeping soundly is a positive thing. Alright. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a tough one. My parents both lived to a good age, but I don't really remember them having many health problems. My mother had some arthritis when she got older, but that's about it. My father was a strong man, worked hard all his life. I have a sister, she’s doing okay, I think. We don’t talk much anymore. No history of really serious illnesses, like cancer or heart disease, that I know of. It's a big family, scattered all over, so it's hard to keep track. Does that help? I'm probably forgetting something.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Percell. It's very common to forget details about family history. What you’ve told me is helpful. No major history of serious illness is good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I just want to ask about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements. And are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Oh, that's easy. I don't take anything regularly. I tried some vitamins a while back, but I forgot to take them, ha! So no vitamins, no supplements, no prescriptions. And allergies… hmm. No known allergies, no. I get mosquito bites like everyone else, but that's not an allergy, is it? I've never had a bad reaction to anything, that I remember. My wife used to say I was too stubborn to be allergic to anything, ha! She had a few allergies, though. Dust, pollen… But I'm fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Percell. No medications or allergies is very straightforward. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, ha! I used to worry about it, but now I figure they know what they’re doing. Just let me know if anything hurts. I’m a bit of a wimp when it comes to needles, though, just so you know. But I’ll try to be brave!
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Percell! No needles today, I promise. Just a routine exam. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me… Alright, that’s 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear on both sides. Reflexes are normal. Coordination is good. I’m going to gently check your range of motion in your neck now… …and there’s some mild stiffness on the right side, as you mentioned. Not severe, but present.
PATIENT: Hmm, that doesn't surprise me. My neck has been feeling a little tight lately. Probably from sleeping in a funny position, or looking at the computer too long. You know, I used to be very active. Played a lot of pao qaib – that’s a Hmong ball toss game – when I was younger. Good exercise, that was. But I haven’t done that in years. My bones aren't what they used to be. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it serious? I'm a bit of a worrier, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you were active in the past, Percell. That’s always helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam – the elevated blood pressure, the mild neck stiffness, and the headache that’s worse with computer use – it could be a few things. It’s likely a tension headache, possibly related to muscle strain in your neck and shoulders from prolonged computer work. The elevated blood pressure could be contributing, and we’ll want to keep an eye on that. Given your age and history, I don’t think anything serious is going on, but I would like to order a few tests just to be sure. I’m going to order a complete blood count to rule out any infection, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes. I also want to get a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, just to rule out any thyroid issues. And finally, I think it would be beneficial to get a Vitamin D level checked, as deficiency can sometimes contribute to headaches and muscle pain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate you taking it seriously. Tests are good. Better to be safe than sorry, right? Vitamin D… I don't think I've ever had that checked. I spend most of my time inside, working. Not much sunshine. Yes, go ahead and order the tests. When will I get the results? And will I need to come back to see you again? I hope it’s nothing too serious. I’ve got a granddaughter’s birthday coming up, and I don’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Percell. Better to be thorough. And you're right, spending a lot of time indoors can contribute to Vitamin D deficiency. The lab work should be available in about 3-5 business days. The lab will contact you when the results are ready, and you can access them through the patient portal on our website. I will also review the results and contact you directly to discuss them. Yes, I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment for about two weeks from today to discuss the results and create a plan. We can talk about strategies to manage your blood pressure, address any potential Vitamin D deficiency, and discuss ways to prevent future headaches. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated, getting regular, gentle exercise when you can, and taking frequent breaks when working on the computer. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with the headache, but don’t take them for more than a few days without talking to me. Would you like me to write down these recommendations for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. Breaks, hydration, gentle exercise… and the pain relievers. Ibuprofen, you said? Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I feel a little better just knowing what we're going to do. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. My granddaughter… she's turning five. Big day. I wouldn't want to miss it. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. It was my pleasure. And I understand how important your granddaughter’s birthday is. We’ll do everything we can to get you feeling your best. Here are the recommendations: Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Gentle Exercise: When you can, try to get some light exercise, like walking. Take Frequent Breaks: When working on the computer, take breaks every 20-30 minutes to stretch and move around. Over-the-Counter Pain Relievers: Ibuprofen or Acetaminophen can help with the headache. Do not take for more than a few days without talking to me. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Percell. And enjoy your granddaughter's birthday!
