DOCTOR: Alright, Gedalya, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. It’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker lately, and it’s been getting worse. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a bit. It's just… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids... that is concerning, and good you came in to get it checked out. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. First, when you say weaker, can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It’s… all over, I think. Not like a sudden thing, more like… everything takes more effort. Lifting things, even just… holding my head up sometimes. It’s hard to describe. It started maybe a month or two ago, gradually. I used to be able to… well, I work in facilities management, so there’s a lot of physical work, and I've been finding it harder and harder to keep up. I get tired very quickly.
DOCTOR: Right, so a gradual onset of weakness over a month or two, affecting you at work and generally, with increasing fatigue. That's helpful. And you mentioned your eyelids feeling heavy – is that worse at certain times of day, or is it pretty constant?
PATIENT: It's… worse in the afternoon, I think. In the mornings, it's not so bad. But as the day goes on, they just… feel heavier and heavier. And it’s not just the weight, it’s like… harder to keep them open. I find myself squinting a lot. It doesn't really hurt, just… uncomfortable and makes it difficult to see clearly sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the eyelid drooping, or ptosis, is worse as the day goes on. That’s a key piece of information. Have you noticed any double vision or blurry vision at all, besides the difficulty keeping your eyes open?
PATIENT: Hmm… blurry vision, yes, sometimes. But I wear glasses, so I always assumed it was just… my prescription needing updating. It’s not constant, and it's not really double vision, just… things aren't as sharp as they should be, especially later in the day. I haven’t gotten my eyes checked in… well, it’s been a while, I suppose. A year, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, so blurry vision that you’ve attributed to needing a new glasses prescription, but it seems to be getting worse alongside the other symptoms. That’s good to know. Let's move on to some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your skin, like rashes or anything unusual?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My skin feels… normal, I think. A bit dry, perhaps, it’s been quite warm lately. But no rashes or anything. And I haven't had any… muscle aches or pains, if that’s what you’re asking. Just the weakness.
DOCTOR: Right, no rashes or muscle aches. Okay. And have you had any difficulty swallowing or speaking, or noticed any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. Swallowing and speaking are… fine. I haven't noticed any changes in my voice either. It’s just… this weakness is really starting to worry me. It feels like something serious is happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Gedalya, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. We’ll try to figure out what’s going on. Let's go over some of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had… the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, but nothing serious. And I broke my arm when I was a boy, but that healed fine. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything ongoing. I… I was divorced a few years ago, if that’s relevant? It was… stressful. But no medical conditions, no.
DOCTOR: Thank you. No, the divorce isn’t directly medically relevant, but chronic stress can impact health, so it’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been quite lucky, really. No surgeries at all. I try to stay healthy, eat well, get enough sleep when I can… it’s just… this weakness is really concerning me. I don't know what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit difficult. My parents… my mother passed away a few years ago, from… old age, I suppose. She was healthy for most of her life, but declined quickly at the end. My father is still alive, but we’re not very close. I don't really know much about his medical history. He never really talked about it. I don’t think there’s any history of… neurological problems or anything like that, as far as I know. But I really couldn’t say for sure. It’s… a bit of a sensitive topic.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Mother passed away from old age, father is alive but you don’t have much information about his medical history. That’s alright, we can work with that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything. I take… occasionally I take ibuprofen for headaches, but nothing else regularly. No food allergies, no skin allergies, nothing like that. I’m pretty good with most things, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, on a regular basis?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, as I said. I really try to avoid taking anything unless I absolutely have to. I prefer to just… rest if I’m feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No regular medications. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I used to drink… occasionally, socially. But I haven’t had a drink in… well, since the divorce, I suppose. And I definitely don't use any recreational drugs. Never have. I try to live a… a clean life, really. It's just… this weakness is so worrying. I don't understand what's happening to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Gedalya. It’s good you’re being open with me. Okay, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then do a neurological exam to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I want to know what’s wrong. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let’s check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Is that… is that enough? It feels… a little weak, actually. It’s harder than it used to be.
DOCTOR: You're right, Gedalya. Your grip strength is slightly reduced on both sides, but more noticeable on your right. Now, let's test your strength in your legs. Can you push your feet against my hands like this?
PATIENT: It's... difficult. It's harder than it should be. I feel… tired already. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, your leg strength is also slightly reduced, more so on your right side than your left. Now, I'm going to check your eye movements. Eye movements are full, but I notice a slight drooping of your right eyelid, which you mentioned earlier. It’s more pronounced when you look upwards. Based on this preliminary exam, Gedalya, the weakness, drooping eyelid, and slightly reduced muscle strength are concerning. There are a few possibilities, and we need to investigate further. I'm going to order some blood tests to check for any underlying inflammation, infection, or vitamin deficiencies. I also want to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any neurological causes. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: An MRI…? Is it… is it serious? What could it be? I mean… what are we looking for? And… how long will it take to get the results? I… I'm quite worried now, Doctor. This is all very frightening. I just want to know what’s wrong with me.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re frightened, Gedalya. It’s always worrying when we’re trying to figure out what’s going on. An MRI is a detailed scan of your brain that will help us rule out any structural problems, like tumors or inflammation, that could be causing your symptoms. It’s a non-invasive procedure, although it does require you to lie still for a while in a scanner. We’re also looking for signs of Myasthenia Gravis, which is a condition that causes weakness in the muscles, often affecting the eyelids and causing fatigue. The blood tests will help us determine if that’s a possibility. The results of the blood tests usually take a few days to come back, and the MRI results can take a little longer, maybe a week or so, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. I know it’s a wait, and it’s frustrating, but it’s important to get a clear diagnosis before we start any treatment. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, try not to worry too much, and if your symptoms worsen, or you experience any difficulty breathing or swallowing, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… I've never heard of it. And… an emergency room? That sounds… serious. So, it could be something really bad? Okay. Okay, I understand. Blood tests and an MRI. And call you when the results are back. I… I think so. It’s a lot to take in. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. Should I… should I avoid any activities in the meantime? Like, at work? I do facilities management, it’s quite physical…
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Gedalya. It could be something serious, but it’s important to remember that it could also be something less concerning. We need to get the tests done to find out for sure. Regarding your activities, yes, I would strongly advise you to avoid any strenuous physical activity at work until we have a diagnosis. Facilities management sounds quite demanding, and we don’t want to exacerbate your symptoms. Explain to your employer that you’re undergoing medical investigation and need to reduce your workload. I can write you a note for work explaining that you need to avoid strenuous activity for a week while we investigate your symptoms. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. That would take a lot of pressure off me. I… I was worried about explaining it to them. It's a bit difficult sometimes. So… blood tests and the MRI. And I’ll avoid strenuous activity. And you’ll call me with the results. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Apart from worsening symptoms, I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, so blood tests and the MRI, avoid strenuous activity, and I’ll call you with the results. In the meantime, pay attention to your breathing and swallowing. If you notice any difficulty with either of those, go to the emergency room immediately. Also, if your vision changes significantly – double vision, blurry vision that doesn’t improve with glasses – that’s another reason to seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, just try to rest and avoid stressing yourself out. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before I call with the results. Here's the note for work, and the lab order for your blood tests. The MRI center will call you to schedule an appointment once I send the order. Do you have any other questions for me today, Gedalya?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for explaining everything so clearly. I… I really appreciate it. I’m quite anxious, but I feel… a little bit better knowing we’re doing something to find out what’s wrong. Thank you. I’ll… I’ll try to rest. And I’ll call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Gedalya. You’re very welcome. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
