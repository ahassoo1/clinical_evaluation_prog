DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I am Dr. Hembrey. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get right to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um... it is... difficult to explain, really. I have trouble... finding the right words. It is very frustrating. I know it is a strange thing to come to a doctor about, but it is happening more and more.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, you say. I understand. Many conditions can present with vague symptoms. Let’s try to be as precise as possible. When did you first begin noticing this difficulty with… finding words?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That is a good question. Time... it slips away, you know? I think... maybe six months ago? Or was it longer? It started slowly, just forgetting a word here and there. Now... it feels like it happens several times a day. I apologize, Doctor. I am not very good at remembering details. It is why I am here, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Six months, approximately. And can you describe how you're forgetting words?
PATIENT: Hmm... It is not like I do not know the word. It is... on the tip of my tongue. But I cannot... pull it out. Or sometimes, I know what I want to say, but the right word... it is just gone. Like a blank space in my head. Does that make sense, Doctor? I worry I am not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: It's... imprecise, certainly. But I understand the general idea. "Tip of the tongue" phenomena. It happens. Now, does this difficulty extend to understanding what others say, or is it primarily with your own speech?
PATIENT: No, no. I understand people just fine. My wife… my late wife, she talked very fast sometimes, and I always understood her. This is only with me speaking. I can hear everything, read everything… it is just… putting the words together when I want to talk. It is… unsettling. It makes me feel… foolish, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. Alright. Let's move on to a more thorough assessment. Have you experienced any other neurological symptoms alongside this – any weakness, numbness, vision changes, headaches, dizziness?
PATIENT: Weakness… no, I don’t think so. Numbness… no. My vision is not so good, but that is just age, I believe. I have had headaches, but everyone has headaches, no? And dizziness… occasionally, when I stand up too fast. But that is… nothing serious, I do not think. It happens from time to time. My wife used to say I stood up too quickly!
DOCTOR: Occasional dizziness. We will note that. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Do you have any prior medical conditions – hypertension, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… my wife, she always handled the doctor appointments. I was… never very good with remembering those things. I believe… I had my blood pressure checked a few times. It was a little high, I think, but they said it was not too bad. Nothing… serious. I do not have… diabetes. I do not think. And no, no stroke or heart disease. I used to be very active, you know. Walked every day with my wife. But after… after she passed… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgical procedures in the past?
PATIENT: Hm… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A very long time ago. And… oh! I had a small operation on my knee, many years later. Something with a torn cartilage, I think. But that was… quite some time ago now. I am not very good at remembering dates, Doctor. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Appendix and knee surgery. Noted. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take a small pill for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it after my wife passed, just to be safe. And… sometimes, a pill for my arthritis. It helps with the pain in my hands. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I always thought… too many pills are not good for you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don’t think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to eat all sorts of things… my wife, she was a wonderful cook! No, no allergies that I am aware of. I am very lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Are there any instances of neurological disorders—dementia, stroke, Alzheimer's—in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hm. My mother… she had some trouble with her memory towards the end, I believe. It was a long time ago, and I was not very close to her. My wife’s mother… she had a stroke, I think. Yes, she had a stroke. But that was… many years ago. I am not sure about anything else. My family… we did not talk about those things much. It was… not something we discussed.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, could you briefly describe your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Oh. Well… I used to work. I was… a compensation specialist. Benefits, job analysis… things like that. It was… a good job. After my wife passed… I retired. I don’t… see many people now. I live alone. I used to go to church, but… not so much anymore. It is difficult… without my wife. I mostly… stay at home. Read. Watch television. It is a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Gyamfi, I am going to conduct a brief neurological exam to assess your cognitive function and reflexes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to… find out what is happening. I apologize if I am not very helpful. I am not very good with these things. But I will… do my best.
DOCTOR: Please sit. I am going to start with some simple memory tests. I will ask you three unrelated words. Please repeat them back to me, and then I will ask you to recall them again later. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Ready. I will… try my best. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. The first word is… “apple”. The second word is… “table”. And the third word is… “pencil”. Please repeat those back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… pencil. Is that… correct, Doctor? I hope I said them right. They are… simple words, but my mind feels… a little slow today.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, we will move on to some other tests. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Oh dear. Let me see… it is… August…? Yes, it is August. The second… is it the second? August second…? I believe so. Yes, August second. 2025. Is that correct, Doctor? I hope I am right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, I am going to ask you to spell the word "world" backwards.
PATIENT: Spell “world” backwards…? Oh dear. That is… difficult. Let me see… d-l-r-o-w…? No… w-o-r-l-d…? No… Oh dear, I am not very good at this, Doctor. I apologize. My mind is… blanking.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I will assess your reflexes. Please extend your arms. Biceps reflex 2+ bilaterally. Triceps reflex 2+ bilaterally. Patellar reflex 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflex 2+ bilaterally. Sensation intact to light touch in all extremities. No signs of focal weakness or asymmetry. Plantar response flexor bilaterally. Based on my initial assessment, Mr. Gyamfi, your cognitive function appears somewhat impaired. The difficulty recalling words, the struggle with spelling, and your hesitation with the date are concerning. However, the physical exam does not reveal any immediate neurological abnormalities. Given your symptoms and medical history, I suspect this may be early-stage cognitive decline, potentially mild cognitive impairment or early dementia. However, further investigation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
PATIENT: Cognitive decline…? Dementia…? Oh dear… My wife… she… she had something similar, didn't she? Is that… is that what is happening to me…? I… I don’t want to… I don't want to forget. I just want to… know what is happening. What… what does this mean, Doctor? What can we do…?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gyamfi, please try to remain calm. It is important to remember that this is a suspected diagnosis at this point. Many conditions can mimic these symptoms. We need to conduct further testing to determine the underlying cause and rule out other possibilities, such as vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects, or thyroid problems. I am going to order a comprehensive blood panel, including thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 levels, and a complete metabolic panel. I will also order a structural brain MRI to rule out any underlying structural abnormalities. Additionally, I recommend a neuropsychological evaluation to assess your cognitive function in more detail. In the meantime, there are several things you can do to help maintain your cognitive health. Engaging in mentally stimulating activities, such as reading, puzzles, and social interaction, can help slow down cognitive decline. Maintaining a healthy diet and regular exercise routine is also important. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the testing. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns or questions. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: MRI…? Tests…? I… I don't know, Doctor. It is all… so much. My wife… she didn’t want to know. She said… knowing would make it worse. I… I don’t want to be like her. I just want… I just want my mind back. I… I don’t know what to ask. Just… what happens if it is… what you think it is? What will happen to me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gyamfi, it is understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed and frightened. Receiving news like this is never easy. If the testing confirms a diagnosis of cognitive decline, there are several treatment options available to help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. These include medications, therapy, and lifestyle modifications. It is important to remember that you are not alone. We will work together to develop a personalized treatment plan that meets your individual needs and goals. We will also connect you with resources and support groups to help you cope with the emotional challenges of this condition. Regarding what will happen to you, it is difficult to predict the exact course of the disease. The progression varies from person to person. However, with appropriate treatment and support, you can continue to live a fulfilling life. I understand your wife’s concerns about knowing the diagnosis. However, early detection and intervention can help you maintain your cognitive function for as long as possible. It also allows you to make informed decisions about your future care and plan for any potential challenges. I strongly recommend that you consider pursuing further testing. I will also schedule a meeting with a social worker who can provide you with additional support and resources. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: No… no, Doctor. I think… I think I’ve heard enough for today. Tests… social worker… I need… I need to think. Just… please send me the information about the tests. I’ll… I’ll let you know. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Gyamfi. My staff will schedule the tests and provide you with the necessary information. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. .
