DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s about my bruising. It's…excessive, frankly. I'm on that blood thinner, you see, and normally a little bump here or there is no big deal. But lately, it's like I'm turning into a plum. And it worries me. It just doesn't seem right.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Excessive bruising… and you're on a blood thinner, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Warfarin, I believe. Started it about six months ago after…well, after my wife passed. The cardiologist thought it best, preventative measures, you understand. Though, frankly, I was perfectly healthy before that. But he insisted. Now this is happening. It’s probably a side effect, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It could be related to the Warfarin, yes. Though, it’s not always straightforward. Six months is a bit of time to be just starting to notice this, but it's possible the dosage needs adjusting, or there could be another factor at play. Let me pull up your records to see what the cardiologist prescribed…and if there's anything else documented. Do you remember the dosage you're on?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I leave all that to the professionals. Numbers and milligrams…it all goes over my head. I just take the pills like they tell me. I assumed they’d have it all written down. It's 5 milligrams, perhaps? Or was it 7? I really couldn’t say. They send me for blood tests regularly, that’s what matters, isn’t it? And those always come back…acceptable.
DOCTOR: Right, right. The records do indicate 7 milligrams daily, and your INR has been consistently within the therapeutic range according to the lab reports. But even with a stable INR, unexplained bruising can happen. Now, where are you bruising most often?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor, really. My arms, mostly. I bump into furniture, things I wouldn’t even notice before, and bam, a bruise the size of a silver dollar. Yesterday, I just brushed against the rose bushes in the garden and my forearm looked like I’d been in a fight. It's ridiculous. And, well…it's not very dignified, is it? A man shouldn’t be bruising like an old woman.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this bruising been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…well, no, not really. I've been a bit…tired, perhaps. But that could be anything, Doctor. I am getting on in years. And honestly, the whole thing has been rather upsetting. Worrying about my health, you know? It's a constant state of anxiety, if I'm being frank. But no, no bleeding gums or nosebleeds, no unusual pain, just…the bruises. They’re the problem. A very unsightly problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: My diet? Doctor, I haven't changed my diet in fifty years. Steak and potatoes, mostly. A glass of red wine with dinner. And perhaps a small dessert. I’m Guatemalan, you know. We enjoy good food. It's not like I've suddenly started eating kale and spinach. Honestly, I suspect it’s this medication. It just feels…wrong. It's interfering with my life.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need to rule out other possibilities, even if it seems unlikely. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to check for anything unusual. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look at the bruising. Can you roll up your sleeves, please?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But I assure you, this has been going on for weeks. And as I said, I’ve been perfectly healthy my entire life. This medication…it’s the obvious culprit. I’m a physician myself, you know. I understand how these things work. It's probably just a matter of finding the right dosage.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not concerningly so for your age. The bruising appears to be mostly superficial, no signs of any deeper hematomas. Are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Other medications? Doctor, I told you. Just the Warfarin. And a multivitamin, of course. Every man of my age should take a multivitamin. But nothing else. I don’t go in for all those trendy supplements. I trust proper medicine, not herbal remedies or…whatever else they’re peddling these days. I assure you, it’s the Warfarin. It’s disrupting my normal clotting process, that's all. A simple adjustment should fix it. It's really quite straightforward.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Doctor, I mentioned a glass of red wine with dinner. It's a custom, a tradition! A small glass, mind you. I don't go on benders or anything ridiculous. I am a civilized man. And, frankly, I find your line of questioning a bit…patronizing. I'm a physician. I understand the effects of alcohol. It’s not like I’m consuming a bottle of whiskey every night. It’s a small indulgence, and I hardly believe it’s contributing to this…situation.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. While your lifestyle doesn’t immediately jump out as a major cause, we still need to investigate thoroughly. I'm going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a coagulation panel to double-check your INR, and a metabolic panel just to get a baseline. We should also test your vitamin K levels, as that can affect clotting. I want to rule out anything else that could be contributing to this excessive bruising.
PATIENT: More blood tests? Doctor, I’ve had a dozen blood tests in the last six months! It's rather…inconvenient, you know. I have commitments. But…very well. If you insist. Though I still maintain it’s the Warfarin. A simple adjustment is all that's needed. I trust you'll expedite the results. I don't want to spend the next month going back and forth for more tests. A physician's time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. I’m expediting the order, and the lab results should be back within 48 hours. In the meantime, please continue taking your Warfarin as prescribed. I'll call you as soon as I have the results. And please, if you notice any new symptoms—any bleeding, unusual pain, dizziness—call my office immediately. It's always best to err on the side of caution.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall. Though I doubt anything will change. I’ll be in touch. And please, do try to expedite those results. I have a life to live, you know. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. We'll do our best. Please don't hesitate to call if anything changes.
