DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Chayer, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor Billman. It's… it's my breathing. It’s been kinda hard lately. Like, I get really short of breath just doing normal stuff. It’s… frustrating, honestly. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. Just… gradually, I guess.
DOCTOR: "Gradually." Right. Well, “gradually” doesn’t tell me much. Let's try to pinpoint it a little more. Has this been happening for days, weeks, months?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that's what I mean. Months, I think? Maybe a couple of months? It’s hard to say. Things have been… a little hectic, you know? Work's been busy, and… honestly, my memory hasn’t been the best lately. Sorry. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm not being very good at this.
DOCTOR: “Not very good at this?
PATIENT: No, no, it's just… I get flustered easily, and I don't remember things like dates very well. It’s not that I’m trying to be difficult, Doctor. Just… things are a bit foggy, you know? Work keeps me pretty tired too. I operate water treatment plants... it's a lot of responsibility. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Water treatment, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. It’s… a lot of making sure things are running right, checking levels, fixing problems. It can be stressful. And dirty sometimes. Not that that’s related to my breathing, probably. Look, is this going to take long? My wife is covering my shift and I don't want to make her stay too late.
DOCTOR: Well, if you want a proper answer, it will take some time. We need to figure out why you're short of breath before I can just wave my hand and make it go away. It’s not always about the stress, even if that plays a part. Let’s start with the basics. Do you cough with this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes. Not a lot, though. It's usually just a little tickle in my throat. Like I need to clear it. Not a big, hacking cough. More like… a polite cough, if that makes sense? And it doesn't happen every time I get short of breath. Sorry, I’m probably just rambling.
DOCTOR: A “polite cough.” Right. And is there anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Ugh, good question. Hmm… Stairs, definitely stairs. Walking uphill is bad. And sometimes… if it's really humid outside. Like, really sticky air. It feels like I can't get enough air, you know? Like my lungs are full of cotton. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke, Mr. Chayer?
PATIENT: No! No, never. Not even tried. My… my parents were pretty strict about that, and honestly, it just never appealed to me. My wife doesn't smoke either. We both try to stay healthy. Mostly. Work's kinda rough on that, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about any past medical problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, this is where my memory gets really bad. I… I had pneumonia a long time ago. When I was a kid, I think? And I broke my arm once, but that's not… relevant, right? Honestly, I can't really remember much else. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a while. Probably a bad thing, I know. I just try to tough things out. It's… a Venezuelan thing, maybe? We're pretty stubborn.
DOCTOR: “A Venezuelan thing”?
PATIENT: Yeah, well, it’s hard to explain. It’s just… we don't really go to the doctor unless it's really bad. It’s a pride thing, I guess. And, honestly, things are… expensive. And I don’t have insurance. So… it’s just… easier to try and deal with things myself. Sorry. I'm not making this easy, am I? I really appreciate you seeing me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Let's talk about the fact that you have no insurance. Before we go any further, because frankly, this is important. And don’t apologize for not making it “easy.” I’m trying to get a history here, and a full history is difficult when you're… selective with your memory. But we need to be realistic about what we can do without a way to pay for tests. Do you have any family history of lung problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, my abuela... my grandmother… she had something with her lungs, I think. Like, she always coughed a lot, and she had trouble breathing when she got older. But I don't know what it was. It was… a long time ago, and my Spanish isn’t great, and my parents didn’t really talk about it much. And I don’t really have anyone to ask anymore. Look, I’m really sorry. I’m just trying to be honest. I really don’t know much. And I really don’t want to waste your time. Is this even worth pursuing if I can’t afford anything?
DOCTOR: “Worth pursuing”?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like, if I can’t afford tests, or treatments, or… whatever it takes to figure out what’s wrong, is it even worth you spending time on me? I don’t want to be a burden. My wife is already stressed about covering my shift, and… I just don't want to add to it. I feel bad even being here. I should just try to tough it out, right? That's what we do. .
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “toughing it out” isn’t always the best strategy, Mr. Chayer. It can lead to bigger problems down the line. But, you’re right. We need to be realistic. Before we proceed with anything further, let’s do a basic physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs. It won’t cost you anything, and it might give us a starting point. But don’t get your hopes up. It's just a basic assessment. Okay?
