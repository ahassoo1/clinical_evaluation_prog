DOCTOR: Hi Murry, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just…pain. When I breathe deep. It’s hard to explain, it just hurts when I take a big breath. It’s been…a little while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long, things kinda blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain when you breathe deep… I understand. It's alright if it’s hard to explain, we’ll figure it out together. “A little while now” is helpful, but do you have any sense if it’s been more like a few days, a few weeks, or longer?
PATIENT: Weeks, I think. Maybe longer? It's… difficult to remember exactly. I was working, you know, construction… lots of lifting and bending. Maybe it started then? It’s not…sharp pain, more like a dull ache. It bothers me when I try to do things.
DOCTOR: Okay, weeks or longer, and you think it might have started with the construction work, with lifting and bending. A dull ache that worsens with activity. That gives me a little something to work with. And it’s good you mentioned it bothers you when you try to do things – does it stop you from doing things, or is it just uncomfortable?
PATIENT: It…stops me. I try to lift something, even just a bag of groceries, and I have to put it down. It's not worth the pain. My son keeps telling me to slow down, but…you know. Gotta keep busy. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand that's frustrating, especially when you’re used to keeping busy. Alright, so pain that limits your ability to lift things, even groceries. Let's try to pinpoint the location a bit more. Can you show me exactly where it hurts when you take a deep breath?
PATIENT: It’s… here, mostly. And a little bit here. Sometimes it feels like it goes all the way around. It’s hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly in your chest and ribs, with some radiating pain to your lower back sometimes. That's helpful. Now, when you breathe deep, does the pain get worse with a cough or sneeze?
PATIENT: A cough…yes. Definitely worse. Sneezing…not so much. Not usually, anyway. Sometimes a little, but not like the cough. It’s a bad cough, usually. I've had it for a bit too, but…old man cough, you know?
DOCTOR: "Old man cough," alright. Cough makes it significantly worse, sneezing sometimes. And it's been going on for a bit as well. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain and cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… I get…tired. More tired than usual, I guess. And maybe a little short of breath, but that could just be the coughing. I haven't really paid much attention. It’s just…getting old, I figure.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and some shortness of breath alongside the pain and cough. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, and I’ll gently feel around your chest to check for any tenderness. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds fine. Get it over with, eh? Don’t take too long, though. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, just lie back comfortably. I’ll start by listening to your lungs… take a nice, deep breath in… and out… okay. I’m hearing some decreased breath sounds on both lower lobes, and a few scattered wheezes. Now, I’m going to gently feel around your chest… any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, right there. And a little bit here, too. Not terrible, just…sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in those areas. Alright, one more thing – I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. …92%... That's a little on the lower side, but not critically low. So, to summarize: decreased breath sounds, wheezing, tenderness to palpation, and a slightly lower oxygen saturation. Given your history of construction work, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something like pneumonia, bronchitis, or even a musculoskeletal issue, though the low oxygen is concerning. I want to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would you be able to go to the imaging center down the street?
PATIENT: X-ray? Is it… serious? I don’t like hospitals. And… I don’t have insurance. Can I just…take something for the cough?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Murry. An X-ray isn’t a hospital visit, it’s a quick scan to see what’s going on in your lungs. And I understand your concerns about insurance, we can discuss options for that. The reason I want to do the X-ray is to rule out anything serious, like pneumonia, which needs prompt treatment. We can also explore some options for managing the cough in the meantime. But honestly, with your lower oxygen level and fatigue, I want to be cautious. We need to know what we're dealing with. I'll see if we can get you a reduced cost X-ray at the clinic. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: …Reduced cost… Okay. Fine. Just…get it over with. I gotta know what’s going on. But don’t expect me to understand all that fancy doctor talk. And… how long will it take? I really gotta get back to things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Murry, I understand. We’ll keep it simple, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. The X-ray itself should only take a few minutes, and then the radiologist will need some time to read the results. I expect we’ll have them back within a couple of hours. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a cough suppressant to help manage your symptoms. It won’t fix the underlying problem, but it should make you more comfortable. And I’ll have the nurse check your blood pressure and oxygen levels again before you leave. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Just… hurry, eh? I don't like being stuck inside all day. And… make sure that cough medicine doesn’t make me sleepy. I gotta stay alert.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Murry. I’ll make sure the prescription is for a non-drowsy formula. And I’ll let the nurse know to keep everything quick. I’ll also have her give you a list of warning signs to watch out for – like a high fever, severe shortness of breath, or chest pain – and who to call if you experience them. Let me just finish writing this prescription, and I'll get the nurse in here to take your vitals and go over everything with you. It’ll be just a few minutes. .
