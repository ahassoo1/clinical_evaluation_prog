DOCTOR: Hi Tarin, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. I’m here because I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg. It’s…well, it’s been a bit concerning, so I thought it best to get it checked out. It started a few weeks ago, I believe around July 15th, and it hasn’t gone away completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your leg… starting around July 15th. That’s good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It primarily affects my left leg, though occasionally I feel a slight tingling in my right one. The numbness itself is…difficult to describe. It’s not a complete loss of feeling, more like a…dimming, perhaps? And it tends to be worse after I’ve been standing for a long time, or if I’ve been particularly focused on my work—animating, mostly. I do a fair bit of that from home, so I spend a lot of time seated. It runs from my thigh down to my foot, but the foot is where I notice it most prominently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so left leg primarily, some tingling in the right, a “dimming” sensation, worse with standing and prolonged sitting… and it’s most noticeable in your foot. That’s helpful. And you mentioned you do animation work—so a lot of seated time. Just to clarify, when you say “focused on your work,” does that mean anything specific – like holding a certain position for a long time, or any repetitive movements?
PATIENT: Yes, that's a very good question. It’s often both, actually. When I’m really engrossed, I tend to…well, I get very still. I’ll maintain a posture for quite a while without realizing it. And there is a fair amount of repetitive motion with the drawing tablet—small, precise movements with my wrist and hand, constantly adjusting and refining details. I hadn’t really considered if that might be connected until you mentioned it. I typically work for six to eight hours at a stretch, when I have deadlines.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight hours with deadlines, holding positions and repetitive wrist movements… that definitely gives us some things to consider. Let’s back up a bit. Has anything changed recently that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: That's a good point to ask. Hmm… let me think. Nothing immediately springs to mind, no significant injuries or anything like that. I did help my uncle move some furniture about a month ago, maybe around the first week of July—heavy lifting, that sort of thing. It wasn’t excessive, but it was more physical activity than I typically get. Apart from that, no, not that I recall. I haven't changed my diet or started any new medications. I did start a new project which has been quite demanding, so I suppose that’s led to more prolonged periods of sitting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heavy lifting around the first week of July, and a new, demanding project leading to more sitting. We'll keep those in mind. Now, when you’re experiencing this numbness, do you notice any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Occasionally, I'll feel a slight ache in my lower back, but it's very mild and intermittent. It doesn’t necessarily coincide with the numbness, though. Sometimes, my foot feels a bit colder than usual on the affected side, but again, it's not a consistent symptom. I haven’t noticed any weakness in my leg or foot, and I don’t experience any sharp pain, just the…dimming sensation and occasional tingling. I suppose I have been a bit more fatigued lately, but that could simply be due to the long hours at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild, intermittent lower back ache, occasional coldness in the foot, no weakness or sharp pain, and some fatigue… sounds like we're gathering a good picture. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t been diagnosed with any medical conditions. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I do have a family history of… well, my grandfather on my mother’s side had arthritis, but I haven’t experienced any joint pain or anything similar myself. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses—chickenpox, measles—but nothing major. I do see a dentist regularly, and I had my standard vaccinations as a child. I do not have any known allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medical conditions, family history of arthritis, standard childhood illnesses, no allergies. That’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I am not currently taking any medications, not even over-the-counter drugs or supplements. I try to avoid them whenever possible. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, perhaps once or twice a month, but that’s it. Otherwise, I rely on getting enough sleep and staying hydrated. I do drink coffee, if that’s relevant—usually one or two cups in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen, one or two cups of coffee in the morning. That’s helpful. Alright, Tarin. It sounds like we have a pretty good starting point. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright. I understand that’s a standard part of the process. Please proceed at your convenience. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I'll do my best to remain still and cooperate as needed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit on the table, please. We’ll start with a neurological exam, checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation. Then, I’ll just take a look at your back and legs. Okay. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups. Sensation is slightly diminished on the outer aspect of your left foot and lower leg compared to the right. That correlates with what you've been describing. I am also noting some mild tenderness upon palpation of the lower lumbar spine. Alright, Tarin. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it's possible you're experiencing some nerve compression, likely related to either the lumbar spine or possibly the sciatic nerve. The prolonged sitting and repetitive movements at work, along with the recent heavy lifting, could be contributing factors. It's not an emergency situation, but it’s something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. Nerve compression… that explains the diminished sensation and tenderness. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. The connection to my work and the lifting incident is also… reassuring, in a way. It’s good to know there’s a possible explanation, and that it doesn’t sound immediately serious. What would you recommend as the next step? Would imaging be necessary, such as an X-ray or MRI?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad it feels reassuring to have some potential answers. Imaging is a possibility, but let’s start with a more conservative approach first. An MRI would give us the most detailed view of the spinal nerves and discs, but it’s not always necessary. Given your age and the nature of your symptoms, I think we can try some initial treatments and see how you respond. I’m going to recommend the following: 1. Physical Therapy: A few sessions with a physical therapist to teach you some exercises to strengthen your core and back muscles, improve your posture, and stretch the affected nerves. They can also provide guidance on proper ergonomics for your workstation. 2. Over-the-Counter Pain Relief: Continue taking ibuprofen as needed for pain, but avoid taking it for prolonged periods. 3. Heat or Ice: Apply heat or ice to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. 4. Activity Modification: Take frequent breaks during work to stretch and move around. Avoid prolonged sitting and heavy lifting as much as possible. We can revisit imaging if your symptoms don’t improve after a few weeks of these treatments. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: That sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Physical therapy, pain relief, heat or ice, and activity modification… I can certainly incorporate those into my routine. I have no objections at all. I'm happy to avoid imaging if possible, at least initially. Do you have any recommendations for a physical therapist in the area? And would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss my progress? Perhaps in four to six weeks?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you’re on board with that plan. Yes, I do have a few recommendations for physical therapists in the area. I typically refer patients to Sarah Miller at “Active Motion Physical Therapy” – she’s very experienced with musculoskeletal issues and has a good reputation. Her number is 555-123-4567. Another option is David Chen at “Peak Performance Rehab”, 555-987-6543. Both are excellent. And yes, scheduling a follow-up appointment is a great idea. Four to six weeks sounds perfect. Let’s tentatively book you for six weeks from today – that would be September 9th. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: September 9th works perfectly. Thank you very much for the recommendations for physical therapists, Doctor. I will give Sarah Miller a call tomorrow. I appreciate your thoroughness and clear explanations. You've alleviated a lot of my concerns. I believe I have all the information I need for now. Thank you again for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help alleviate your concerns. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before your follow-up appointment. And remember, consistency with the physical therapy exercises is key. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in six weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will certainly keep that in mind. Have a good day.
