DOCTOR: Hi Christen, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it plainly, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and…hungry, constantly. It’s a bit disruptive, truth be told. I haven't changed anything in my diet, or exercise routine, so I was hoping you could take a look at it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information to start with. Increased thirst and hunger, even with no changes to your routine… that is something we should investigate. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about how thirsty you are?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just a dry mouth, Doctor. I find myself reaching for water constantly – several glasses an hour, easily. Even after drinking a good amount, I still feel… parched. It’s quite bothersome, especially when I'm trying to focus on work. I work in shipping and receiving, so I need to be on my game. It’s not a nice feeling.
DOCTOR: Right, several glasses an hour… that definitely sounds like more than just typical thirst. And needing to stay focused at work makes it even more concerning. Okay. Besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I suppose I've been going to the restroom a bit more frequently as well. Not a drastic amount, but noticeable. And… now that I mention it, I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual, even with a full night’s sleep. It’s hard to say if that’s related, though. I’ve been a bit stressed with… things. Divorce has a way of doing that to a man, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, divorce is incredibly stressful. It absolutely can cause fatigue. But increased urination and fatigue, along with the thirst and hunger… those symptoms together are starting to paint a clearer picture. Just to be thorough, when you say you’re urinating more frequently, is it the amount each time that’s increased, or just how often you’re going?
PATIENT: It's the frequency, Doctor. The amount is… normal, I suppose. It’s just that I find myself needing to go much more often throughout the day. Perhaps every hour or so, where it used to be every few hours. It's not painful, or anything, just… inconvenient. And slightly worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequency without a change in volume. That’s helpful. Now, let’s go back a bit. Have you experienced any weight loss recently, even unintentional?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I believe I have lost a few pounds. Nothing drastic, perhaps five or six. I hadn't really paid much attention, to be frank. I’ve not been eating any less, quite the opposite, with the constant hunger, so it’s a bit puzzling. I work a fairly physical job, so I just assumed it was that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased thirst, increased hunger, increased urination, fatigue, and unintentional weight loss… those are symptoms we need to take seriously. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing of the sort. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. I had a bout of the flu a few years back, but that's about it. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, nothing like that. My father had high blood pressure, I believe, but I haven’t had any issues myself. I get a yearly physical, and everything has always been in order.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything regularly. Occasionally, I’ll take an ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. No vitamins, no prescriptions… nothing at all, truly. I prefer to avoid medication if I can help it. I believe in letting the body heal itself, when possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No medications to consider. Do you have any allergies to anything – food, medications, environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve eaten shellfish my entire life, I’ve never had a reaction to any medications, and I don’t have any known environmental allergies. I occasionally get a bit of hay fever during the spring, but that’s more of an annoyance than a true allergy, if you understand me. Nothing life-threatening, at any rate.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have, never will. I've always avoided smoking. My mother was a smoker, and I saw the toll it took on her health. It’s not something I’ve ever been interested in. I do enjoy a good scotch occasionally, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how often do you drink alcohol – like you said, the scotch?
PATIENT: Perhaps one or two glasses a week, Doctor. Usually on a Friday or Saturday evening. Nothing excessive. I enjoy a good quality scotch, but I wouldn’t consider myself a heavy drinker. More of a social thing, if you understand me. It helps me relax after a long week at work.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s good information. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam. Then I'd like to check your blood sugar, and I'll order some blood work and a urine sample. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgement. Let's get on with it, if you please. I'd like to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible, and get back to work. I have shipments to receive, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could change into this gown, we’ll get started. I’ll step out for a moment so you can have some privacy. I'll be right back.
