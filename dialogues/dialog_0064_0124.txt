DOCTOR: Good morning, Nykisha. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Smetak, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve noticed my skin has been getting darker, and I’ve been really tired lately. It's not like just a little sun tan, it feels...different. And the tiredness is just dragging me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Darkening of the skin and fatigue… that's good information to start with. When you say “different,” can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. It’s… harder to explain. It’s not patchy, it's like… all over, but not a normal tan color. More… brownish, I guess? And it feels… kind of rough, not smooth like when I’ve been in the sun. It's all over my arms and legs mostly, and a little bit on my face. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, thank you. So, a more brownish discoloration, not patchy, and a rough texture, primarily on your arms, legs, and a bit on your face. And you mentioned this has been developing over what period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, um... let me think. It started maybe… three or four months ago, I'd say? At first I didn't really notice it, just thought I was getting a little sun. But then it just kept getting darker, and I started feeling more and more tired, even when I get enough sleep. It's not like a sudden change, it’s been slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over three to four months. And is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty constant, to be honest. Some days are a little better than others, but mostly I just feel… worn out. Like I don’t have much energy for anything. Even things I usually enjoy, like gardening, I just don’t feel up to doing. It's just… draining.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very frustrating. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and skin changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been a little more thirsty than usual, I guess? And… maybe losing a little weight, but I haven't really been trying to. Nothing major, but my clothes feel a little looser. Oh, and sometimes my muscles feel a bit weak, like I can't lift things as easily as I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst, some unintentional weight loss, and muscle weakness. Thank you for sharing all of this. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I don't really have much of a medical history. I've always been pretty healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I've got a little bit of high blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication. And I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for checkups. I don't have any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Controlled hypertension, no known allergies… that’s helpful. And are you currently taking any other medications besides something for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just a vitamin D supplement, really. My doctor said my levels were a little low last year. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but not very often. That’s it, I think. Nothing else regular.
DOCTOR: Alright. Vitamin D and occasional ibuprofen. And do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, or any kind of skin condition?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, I think. Type 2, I believe. And my grandfather on my father's side had heart problems. As for skin conditions… not that I know of. No one really talked much about health stuff when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. That's good to know. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and taking a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Sounds good. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145/90, but that's not unusual given your history. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I see the darkening you mentioned, it’s more pronounced on your arms and legs, and the texture is indeed rougher than normal. There’s no obvious rash or lesions. It seems… diffuse. I also notice some slight swelling in your lower legs. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and this initial exam, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us rule out a few possibilities and get a better understanding of what's going on. We’ll check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, liver function, and thyroid levels, and do a complete blood count. I also want to check your A1C which gives us your average blood sugar over the last few months. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. Blood tests seem like a good idea. I'm happy to do whatever you think will help figure things out. I just want to know what's going on and feel better. Is there anything I should do before the tests? Like, should I fast or anything?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Yes, for the blood sugar tests and some of the other panels, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We’ll give you a detailed instruction sheet at the front desk before you leave. The lab will also confirm this when you go for the tests. While we're waiting for the results, it's important to stay well-hydrated and try to get as much rest as possible. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like extreme fatigue, dizziness, or significant swelling—please call the clinic right away. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s very clear. Fast for 8-12 hours, drink water, and call if things get worse. I can do that. Thank you, Dr. Smetak. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nykisha. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get those tests ordered right away, and we should have the results back within a few days. The nurse will call you with the results and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'm going to write a work/school note for you excusing you from any strenuous activity for the next week, just to be on the safe side. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you to write a note. Thank you! No, I think that’s everything. I really appreciate your help, Dr. Smetak. I’ll go ahead and head to the front desk to get the test paperwork.
DOCTOR: Excellent. You have a good day, Nykisha, and we'll be in touch soon.
