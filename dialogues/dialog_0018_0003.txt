DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Stilaire. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, hi. Look, doc, I don't have all day. It's this hand. Shakes. Been happening for… well, a while now. Not sure how long, exactly. Just…shakes. It's annoying, that's all. Mostly when I try to eat, makes a mess.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I understand your time is valuable, and we will get through this as efficiently as possible. It’s good you’ve brought this to my attention. A tremor can have several causes, so gathering some more information will help us determine the best course of action. When you say “a while now”, could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. Maybe… six months? A year? Look, I'm 80 years old, things go. Don't need a history lesson on every little twitch. It just started bothering me recently, that’s what matters. Is this going to take long? I had a nice lunch planned.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Baide. You are right, focusing on what's bothering you now is most important. Six months to a year is helpful. And I assure you, I’m not trying to give you a history lesson. I simply ask to get a comprehensive picture. To clarify, is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I guess. Mostly when I'm trying to do something. Like… holding a fork, or writing. Though I haven't written anything in years, why would I? It's not like I'm composing symphonies now. When I relax it's usually okay. But try holding something steady? Forget about it. It's a nuisance, really. A big one.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s exacerbated by activity, and lessened at rest. That’s very helpful information. Do you notice anything that specifically triggers the shaking, other than holding objects?
PATIENT: Triggers? Well, stress, maybe? Although, at my age, everything is stressful. The news, the neighbors, the price of tomatoes… Honestly, doc, I’m surprised my hands aren't shaking all the time. And coffee, I suppose. I drink a lot of coffee. Though, I shouldn’t, my daughter keeps telling me. She thinks she knows everything. It's probably the coffee.
DOCTOR: It sounds like stress and caffeine could certainly be contributing factors. And daughters often have good instincts! Now, apart from the shaking, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I'm an old man, everything aches. My knees, my back…you want a list? I get tired easily, I forget things... which I'm sure you've already noticed. Look, is this going to involve a lot of poking and prodding? Because I really don't have the patience for it. Just tell me if it's serious or not. That's all I care about.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Baide, and I will certainly try to be as efficient as possible. I certainly don’t want to cause any unnecessary discomfort. I simply need to perform a brief neurological exam to help assess the tremor and rule out other potential causes. It will involve me observing your hands at rest and asking you to perform a few simple movements. To start, have you noticed any stiffness in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Hmm… not really. They feel old, if that counts. A little creaky, you know? Like an old door. But not stiff. I can move them, can’t I? Look, I used to be a director, I had to wave my hands around all the time, giving directions to actors. They’d have never gotten anything done if I couldn't move my hands. Are we done soon? I promised my friend I'd meet him for a game of cards. And he gets very impatient.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know you have full range of motion, and I appreciate you sharing that information about your previous profession. It's helpful for me to get a complete picture. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to briefly examine your hands. I’ll observe them at rest and ask you to touch your nose with your index finger, then quickly tap your thumb against each of your fingers. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine, get it over with. Just be quick about it. I haven’t got all day. Don't go poking around too much, though. I'm a sensitive man, you know. Used to directing beautiful actresses, I'm not used to being manhandled. waves hand dismissively Get on with it.
DOCTOR: "Okay, Mr. Baide. That was very helpful. I observed a tremor in both hands, more prominent on the right, and a slight slowness in your movements. No other significant neurological deficits were noted at this time. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing the tremor without further investigation, but based on your description and my examination, it is most likely an essential tremor. This is a common condition, particularly in older adults, and is often hereditary, though not always." "However, we should rule out other potential causes, such as medication side effects or other underlying medical conditions. Do you take any medications, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… Oh, for my blood pressure, I think. And something for my cholesterol, maybe? My daughter handles all that. She brings me the pills, tells me what to take, and I take them. I don't bother with labels or anything. Just take what she gives me. Honestly, I’d have to ask her. She’s got a list somewhere, I’m sure. Is this a serious tremor? Is it going to get worse? I don't want to end up needing someone to feed me. That would be humiliating.
DOCTOR: "I understand your concerns, Mr. Baide. It’s good you have your daughter assisting with your medications, and we will certainly get a complete list from her. It is important to rule out any potential medication side effects. Essential tremor is typically not life-threatening, and its progression varies significantly from person to person. Some individuals experience a slow, gradual worsening of symptoms, while others remain relatively stable for many years. It's unlikely it will progress to the point where you require assistance with feeding, but it’s difficult to predict with certainty. To help us determine the best course of action, I’d like to order a few blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions and to assess your medication levels. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Fine, whatever. Just don’t take too much blood. I get faint easily. And try not to poke around too much. Honestly, doc, you’re making me nervous. Is there anything I can do about it right now? Anything at all? This hand is really bothering me when I try to drink my coffee. And I need my coffee. It's the only thing that gets me through the day. A little shot of something wouldn't hurt, would it? Just to calm my nerves, you understand. I used to be a director, I’m used to having a little something to relax me.
DOCTOR: “I understand your anxiety, Mr. Baide. I will ensure the blood draw is as quick and comfortable as possible. And I assure you, we’ll only take the necessary amount of blood. Unfortunately, I’m unable to prescribe anything to calm your nerves at this time. However, there are some lifestyle modifications that may help manage the tremor. Reducing caffeine intake can often lessen symptoms, although I understand that may be difficult for you. Stress management techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation, can also be beneficial. And occupational therapy can provide you with strategies to adapt your daily activities and make them easier. To start, we can focus on identifying and minimizing any potential triggers for your tremor, such as stress or certain medications. We will also get a complete list of your medications from your daughter and review them to see if any are contributing to the problem. Do you have any questions about these options?
PATIENT: Occupational therapy? Sounds like a lot of fuss. And I need my coffee, doc. I've told you that. Look, I'm 80 years old. I don't want to spend the rest of my life doing exercises and breathing deeply. I want a simple solution. Is there a pill I can take? Something to just make it stop? That's all I'm asking. Just a simple pill. Forget the exercises, forget the breathing, forget the occupational therapy. Just a pill. Are there any pills? And if there aren't, just tell me straight. I don't have time for beating around the bush. Is it serious or not? This whole thing is just a nuisance. I need to play cards. .
DOCTOR: “Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration and desire for a quick and simple solution. However, medical conditions rarely have such easy answers. While there are medications available to help manage the symptoms of essential tremor, they are not a cure and often come with potential side effects. I want to be upfront with you: there is no pill that will simply ‘make it stop’ without any potential drawbacks. The medications we can consider may help reduce the severity of your tremor, but they won’t eliminate it entirely. Based on my examination, your tremor does not appear to be caused by a serious underlying medical condition at this time. It is most likely an essential tremor, which is generally not life-threatening. However, it can be disruptive and bothersome, and it's important to manage it effectively. To proceed, I recommend we order the blood tests to rule out any other potential causes and to get a complete medication list. Then, we can discuss the potential benefits and risks of medication, as well as other strategies to help you manage your symptoms. I understand you’re eager to play cards, and I want to help you get back to enjoying your life. But we need to take a methodical approach to ensure we’re making the best decisions for your health. Do you agree to proceed with the blood tests and medication review?
