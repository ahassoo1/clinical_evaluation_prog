DOCTOR: Okay, I think I understand. You need a physical exam for a work fitness assessment, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. For… you know… running around. Basketball, sometimes soccer. Need to be sure I okay. Not too old. Thirty-one. Not too slow.
DOCTOR: Thirty-one is definitely not too old! And basketball and soccer sound good. We'll get you checked out. To start, could you tell me a little more about the job?
PATIENT: Uh… fix… the goal. And the court. Sometimes it break. I make strong again. And… whistle. Tell players, no touch. It hard work, you know? A lot running. That's why I need check. Not want fall down.
DOCTOR: So it's a pretty active job, requiring running and being on your feet a lot. Okay. Have you had any problems with injuries or pain that have stopped you from doing your job, or even just everyday activities, recently?
PATIENT: No. No big injury. Sometimes… knee a little sore. After long day. But I rub it. It okay. Old… you know. But nothing stop me. I work every game. Need money. Widow, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so knee soreness that goes away with rest and rubbing. That's good to know. And you said you’re a widow?
PATIENT: Yes. Wife… gone two years. Car accident. I have to work hard. No time for… sick. That why I here. Just check, okay? Make sure I strong. No problem.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good you're taking care of yourself. Absolutely, we’ll do a quick check-up to make sure everything's in good working order. Let's start with some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergy. I eat everything. Chinese food, American food… all good. No problem with medicine either. Never get sick, so never take much medicine. Maybe just… pain killer, sometimes. For headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Only pain killer, when head hurt. Not every day. Sometimes, after long game. Just… ibuprofen. Small pill. I buy at… store. Regular store.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for headaches. Good to know. And have you had any serious medical conditions in the past, like heart problems, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No. No serious. Just… normal sick. Cold, flu. Wife take care of me. Now… I just try not get sick. No time. So I… eat good, sleep little. Work. That’s it. No heart, no sugar… nothing. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good to hear. And what about past surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgery. Never need. No broken bone. No… cutting. Just… small hurt. Bump knee, sometimes. That's all. Wife fix it. Rub and… tape. She good at that. Now I do it myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no past surgeries. Excellent. Now, just a quick question about your family. Do you have any family history of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Uh… my father… he had… high blood pressure. Wife say. He eat too much salt. And… my mother… she had… nothing. She very healthy. Old lady, but strong. No sickness. I think. Not remember much. Long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your father, and a healthy mother. That’s helpful to know. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knee. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Okay. Quickly, please? I have… game tonight. Need to be ready. Just… listen, check. Fast?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be as quick as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds good, and your lungs sound clear. Now, can you just bend your knee for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Like that? It’s… tight. Not hurt much. Just… old. Feel the… bump. Here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some tenderness on the inside of your knee, and it does seem a little stiff. No significant swelling, though. Reflexes are normal, and you have good range of motion overall. It’s likely just some mild age-related wear and tear in the joint. Okay. So, everything seems pretty good overall. Your heart and lungs sound healthy, and your knee is likely just a bit sore from overuse. But the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Elevated? What that mean? I eat healthy. Mostly. And I run a lot. Shouldn't blood pressure… low? What do I do?
DOCTOR: It just means it's a little higher than the ideal number. Running is great, and eating healthy helps, but things like stress and even just genetics can play a role. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re unhealthy, but it’s good to be aware of it. We could start with some lifestyle changes – try to manage stress, make sure you're getting enough sleep, and we could try reducing your salt intake a little. I’d also like to repeat the blood pressure check in a few weeks to see if it’s come down. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Sleep... yes. I try. Not much sleep. Games every night. And salt... I like Chinese food. A lot of salt. Reduce... difficult. Maybe I can… eat less rice? Rice have salt? I don't know. A few weeks... okay. I have game then. Can I do check after game? So not tired?
DOCTOR: Rice itself doesn't have a lot of salt, but often the sauces and seasonings that go with it do. We can talk about some healthy alternatives for sauces and seasonings later. And yes, checking your blood pressure after a game would be fine. Just try to relax for about 15 minutes beforehand. We want to get a reading when you’re not actively exerting yourself. So, to summarize, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to recheck your blood pressure, and we'll talk about ways to manage your stress and reduce your salt intake. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes. Plan. Good. Less salt… difficult. But I try. And relax… also difficult. But I try. Thank you, Doctor. I need to go now. Game. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Yamir. I understand. I’m glad we talked. Just remember to listen to your body and don't push yourself too hard. We'll get you scheduled for that follow-up. And if you experience any new or worsening pain, please don’t hesitate to come back. Good luck with your game tonight!
