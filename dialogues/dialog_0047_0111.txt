DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest idea why I’m here. My wife insisted. Something about my… complexion. She says it’s gotten “dark.” I feel quite alright, though a bit tired, naturally. At my age. Let’s just get this over with, shall we? I have things to attend to.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s always good to get things checked out, even if you feel generally well. “Dark complexion” can mean a number of things, Mr. Drahota. Is this a new change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I suppose. Everything is gradual at my age, Doctor. I honestly can’t recall specifics. Perhaps a few months? It’s… difficult to say. I work, I eat, I sleep. Not much else to report. Is this going to take long? I really must get back to the yard.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where do you typically work in the yard, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: The yard? I reinforce iron and rebar, Doctor. What does where matter? It’s a construction site, naturally. Outside. Lots of… metal. And sun, I suppose. Though I try to stay in the shade when possible. Is this relevant? My wife always worries unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: It can be relevant. Working with metal and being outdoors…yes, that’s helpful information. Have you noticed any other changes, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Other changes? Goodness, Doctor, what am I, a blooming flower? I’m eighty-five years old! Things change. Joints ache, memory fades… what specifically are you looking for? This is rather tedious, you know. I feel… tired, as I said. And perhaps a bit weaker than I used to be. But that's hardly news.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. We just want to be thorough. When you say weaker, can you describe that?
PATIENT: Describe it? It means I can’t heft the rebar as easily as I once did! I require a bit more… leverage. My wife has been saying I shouldn’t be working so hard, but what is a man to do? It’s a good, honest living. And I refuse to sit idle. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what you expect me to say. It's called getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any skin changes besides the darkening?
PATIENT: Skin changes? Well… it feels a bit rougher, perhaps. And drier. Living in this climate isn’t exactly kind to one’s complexion. I use lotion, when my wife reminds me, but it’s hardly a miracle cure, is it? Is this getting us somewhere, Doctor? Because I have a delivery to oversee this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Mr. Drahota. Now, have you noticed any sores or lesions that aren’t healing?
PATIENT: Sores? Lesions? No, Doctor, nothing of the sort. I’m a construction worker, not some… delicate flower. I get scrapes and bruises, naturally. But nothing that doesn’t heal with a bit of disinfectant and a bandage. Are you suggesting I’m ill? Because frankly, I find that rather insulting. I've worked harder in a week than most people do in a lifetime. .
DOCTOR: Please don’t take offense, Mr. Drahota. I’m simply trying to gather information. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
