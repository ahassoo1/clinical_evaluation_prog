DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… the swelling. After the cancer, you know? It’s in my… leg, mostly. It’s been getting bigger, and it’s not very comfortable. I just want it fixed, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: “After the cancer,” you say. And how long ago was this cancer treatment completed, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it was… about six months ago, I think? Maybe a little more. It was the chemo, I believe. They did surgery too, but the swelling started after the chemo finished. It's hard to remember exactly, everything was a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: A blur, yes. Well, six months is… significant. And where precisely is this swelling located on the leg?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my ankle, I think. And then it goes up my calf a little bit. It’s on my right leg. It feels… tight, you know? Like a big… band around it. Sometimes it’s a little bit painful, but mostly just… uncomfortable. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: “Tightness” and “discomfort” are rather vague terms, Ms. Queener. Has this swelling been constant, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: Oh, it does change. It’s worse at the end of the day, definitely. If I stand for too long, it gets much bigger. And… when it’s hot, like today, it puffs up more. When I sleep, it goes down a little. But it never really goes away completely. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It is… marginally helpful. Now, have you noticed any redness, warmth, or pain to the touch in the affected area?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really redness. It doesn't feel hot, no. It's just… swollen. And sometimes a little bit achy, but not really painful to touch. Like a… a dull ache, if that makes sense. Not a sharp pain. I haven't noticed anything else, honestly. I just want it to stop swelling! It's making it hard to wear my shoes.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination. Please allow me to assess the affected leg. If you could just… position yourself on the examination table, please.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. Just tell me what you need me to do, Doctor. I'm not very flexible, you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Circumference at the ankle is 26 centimeters, calf is 42. There is mild pitting edema present. No visible signs of infection. Capillary refill is… acceptable, though slightly delayed. Range of motion is within normal limits, although slightly uncomfortable upon dorsiflexion. Dorsalis pedis pulse is present, but somewhat diminished. Posterior tibial pulse is also present, but weak. I’m going to listen to the sounds of the leg. No bruits are audible.
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… complicated. What does all that mean, Doctor? Is it bad? Is it the cancer coming back? I just want to know what’s happening. It's making me very nervous.
DOCTOR: Let us not jump to conclusions, Ms. Queener. It is highly improbable that this is a recurrence of the cancer at this juncture. What you are experiencing is likely post-thrombotic syndrome, a common complication following cancer treatment, particularly with chemotherapy. The treatment can damage the valves in the veins, leading to poor circulation and fluid buildup. However, to confirm this diagnosis, we will need to order a Doppler ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your leg. It’s a simple non-invasive test.
PATIENT: Oh… post-thrombotic… what? Is that… serious? And a… Doppler? Will it hurt? I really don't like tests. Is there anything else we can do? Like… maybe just wrap it tightly? I used to do that when I twisted my ankle. Would that help?
DOCTOR: Ms. Queener, wrapping your ankle is… a temporary measure at best, and hardly a solution. Post-thrombotic syndrome isn't immediately life-threatening, but it can cause chronic pain, swelling, and even skin ulcers if left untreated. The Doppler ultrasound is entirely painless; it simply uses sound waves to visualize the blood flow in your veins. It will confirm whether there are any clots present and the extent of the valve damage. I will write the order now. And I strongly advise you to refrain from self-treating with… makeshift bandages. It could exacerbate the condition. We will need to see if compression stockings would be appropriate, but we need the ultrasound first.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If it doesn’t hurt… I suppose I can do a test. But please, Doctor, no more complicated words. Just tell me what it shows, okay? And… are the stockings expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you know. I just want to be able to walk without my leg hurting.
DOCTOR: Very well. The ultrasound facility is located at 123 Main Street. The cost of the ultrasound is… variable, depending on your insurance coverage. Medicare should cover a significant portion of it, but you may have a co-pay. As for the stockings, the price varies depending on the compression level and material. We can discuss options after the ultrasound results are available. I will also write you a prescription for a mild diuretic to help reduce the fluid buildup in the meantime. It's a low dose, and should be sufficient to alleviate some of the discomfort. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, thank you, Doctor. 123 Main Street… I think I know where that is. And a diuretic… will that make me… go to the bathroom a lot? Because that could be… inconvenient. But thank you for the prescription. No, I don't think there's anything else. I just… I hope it's not too bad. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Do not delay scheduling the ultrasound, Ms. Queener. And try to elevate your leg whenever possible. That is all. .
