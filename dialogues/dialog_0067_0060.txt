DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. A lot of…problems. Heart stuff, mostly, but also some other things. It’s probably nothing, but my ex-wife kept on me about getting checked out, and honestly, I’m just…tired of worrying about it. I guess I just want to know I’m not headed for disaster.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you to come in and get things checked out, especially with a family history of heart issues. It’s always better to be proactive. Let's talk about that family history in a little more detail. Could you tell me specifically what heart problems your mother and other family members have experienced?
PATIENT: Okay, um… my mother had… angina, I think that’s what they called it. Chest pain. She was always complaining about it. And my uncle, her brother, he had a…a really bad heart attack, maybe ten years ago? He survived, but he's… not the same. And I think my grandfather on that side… he died pretty young, something to do with his heart, but honestly, my mother didn’t talk about it much. It was… unpleasant. I don't really know the specifics, to be honest. It's all just vague memories of hospital visits and hushed conversations. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Even vague recollections can give us a good starting point. Angina and a heart attack certainly raise some flags, and we’ll definitely want to investigate further. And knowing your grandfather also had heart issues is important. Just to get a clearer picture, have you ever experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or any dizziness or fainting spells?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get tired, obviously. I’m a teacher, so dealing with teenagers all day is exhausting, but that’s just…life. I wouldn't say anything specific to heart problems, no. Maybe sometimes my heart feels like it's beating a little fast when I'm stressed, but that happens to everyone, right? Like, before a big presentation, or if I’m running late for something. Nothing major. I haven’t had any dizziness or fainting spells. I think if something was seriously wrong, I would know, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You’re right, usually you would. But sometimes heart issues can present subtly, which is why we want to do a thorough check-up. Stress can definitely cause palpitations, so that's good to know. Okay, let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I mean, I don’t go out of my way to eat weird things, but I haven’t had to carry an EpiPen or anything. My ex-wife was always very careful about everything, so if I did have an allergy, she would have known about it. But I don't think I do. No allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a multivitamin, sometimes. When I remember. And occasionally ibuprofen for headaches. But that’s it. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. I don’t like feeling…dependent on things, you know? My ex-wife was always trying to get me to take something for everything. It was exhausting. So, no, basically nothing regularly. Just the occasional ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, I see here you're insured through Medicare. Do you have any other health conditions that we should be aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? No. My ex-wife was constantly checking mine, she was convinced I was a ticking time bomb, but it was always perfectly normal. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I eat reasonably well, aside from the occasional…comfort food, but I wouldn’t say I have any health conditions. Look, I’m a relatively young, healthy guy. I just want reassurance, okay? I’m not about to drop dead from a heart attack tomorrow. My ex-wife just…worried a lot. Is that enough? Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your frustration and your desire for reassurance. It’s good you are proactive about your health. It sounds like your ex-wife was very attentive, and perhaps a little overzealous. But it’s always better to be safe than sorry. Okay, to get a better picture of your overall health, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your pulse. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have a stack of papers to grade, and I'm already behind schedule. But please, be quick about it. I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning at this time. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and I don't hear any unusual murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear, and I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Your pulse is 72 and regular in both wrists and ankles. Good strength as well. Now, let’s take a look at your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Seriously? I feel like I’m back in elementary school. Look, is everything alright? You’re making it sound like something is wrong. I just came in here for peace of mind, remember? Are you finding something concerning? Just tell me straight, okay? I don’t need all this…procedure.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. I understand your anxiety. Everything so far is within normal limits, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and your family history warrant a little further investigation, that’s all. Checking your reflexes is just a standard part of the exam, and it helps me assess your nervous system function. It’s quick and painless. However, if you are uncomfortable, we can skip it. But to get a complete picture, I would recommend an EKG and a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: An EKG? Blood work? See? This is exactly what I was afraid of! It started with “peace of mind” and now it’s a whole battery of tests! Look, I appreciate you doing your job, but honestly, I'm starting to regret coming in. I don't want to know everything that could potentially go wrong. Okay, fine. Do the blood work. But no EKG. I’m not plugging myself into a machine. And if everything comes back normal, I want a written statement saying I’m perfectly healthy and can go back to my life without worrying about it. Is that so much to ask? I need to get back to my grading. .
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I will absolutely provide you with a written summary of the results, and a statement if everything is normal. We can skip the EKG for now. We’ll do the blood work and go from there. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw the samples. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on a healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management. We can discuss these further when we review the results. Does that sound good?
