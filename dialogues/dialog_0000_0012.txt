DOCTOR: Right. Velda Squiers, 45 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Batara. Thank you for seeing me. I'm needing some information, if you please. I'm planning a cruise – a rather lovely one, actually – and the cruise line requires a doctor's note confirming I'm fit to travel. Nothing fancy, just a confirmation, really.
DOCTOR: A cruise, you say. Hmm. Fit to travel notes. It's always something with these travel companies. Well, alright. But "fit" is rather subjective, isn't it?
PATIENT: Indeed it is, Doctor. I’m generally quite healthy, I believe. I’ve always been… active, for my age. Though, I do have a slight… well, a bit of a sensitive stomach now and then. Nothing debilitating, mind you. Mostly just requires a bit of care with what I eat. But truthfully, I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time. I tend to avoid them if I can, to be perfectly honest.
DOCTOR: “Avoid them if you can.” Yes, well, that's often the case. It makes my job… more interesting. A “sensitive stomach,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It flares up now and again. Usually with rich foods, or if I eat too quickly. It’s never been anything serious, just… uncomfortable. I manage it with diet, mostly. And peppermint tea. A good strong cup of peppermint tea works wonders. It hasn’t stopped me from enjoying life, you understand. I just… take precautions. Do you need a list of foods I should avoid, perhaps? I could write one down.
DOCTOR: No, no list. Peppermint tea. Right. Let's get a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you require. Do you want to know about any… previous illnesses? Or medications? I don’t currently take any, but I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Measles, mumps… nothing memorable, really. And a bout of tonsillitis when I was a teenager. It was dreadful, but it cleared up completely.
DOCTOR: Childhood illnesses are hardly relevant, are they?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. I apologise for the irrelevant information. Perhaps you'd like to know about my family history? My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… well, he was a very strong man, but he passed away suddenly from a heart condition, many years ago. I don’t recall the specifics. It was quite a shock, of course. Would that be helpful?
DOCTOR: Heart condition… yes, that's marginally more pertinent. Was there any family history of early heart disease?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My father was in his late sixties when he passed, so not particularly early, I suppose. But he did complain of chest pains for a few years beforehand. The doctor put it down to indigestion, mostly. He wasn't one for fussing, my father. Always said a stiff drink and a good lie-down would cure anything. I don’t believe there was any history of heart problems in his family, as far as I know. My mother’s side were mostly farmers, strong and healthy folk. Is that the sort of information you require? Perhaps I'm not being clear enough.
DOCTOR: “Indigestion.” Of course. Men and their "indigestion." And no, you're not being clear enough. Let's move on to something… less anecdotal. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, Doctor. Never. I’ve always thought it a rather dreadful habit. My mother smoked, unfortunately. It certainly didn't do her any favours. I prefer a nice cup of tea, as I mentioned. Or a small glass of sherry, occasionally. But nothing stronger than that, usually. And only with a meal, of course. I'm quite moderate, you see. Would you like me to list my dietary habits in more detail? I can do that, if it would be helpful. Perhaps a typical day's meals?
DOCTOR: No, no dietary habits. Let's skip ahead. Have you had any recent hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Not for many years. I broke my wrist when I was a child, climbing a tree, but that was quite a long time ago. And I had my tonsils removed, as I mentioned earlier. But nothing else. Truly. I’ve been remarkably healthy, all things considered. Do you require a list of all childhood injuries? I could write one down, if you wish. Though, I suspect it would be quite lengthy. I was a very active child, you see. Always exploring.
DOCTOR: Enough about your childhood. And please, let’s focus. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. Not to anything significant, anyway. I get a slight itch sometimes when I handle daffodils, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? And I avoid shellfish, simply because I don’t particularly care for the taste. But I haven’t had any serious allergic reactions. Never. I’ve eaten everything, more or less, without any ill effects. Do you want me to list everything I’ve ever eaten? It would be quite a comprehensive list, I assure you. I enjoy sampling different cuisines, you see. A bit of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick look at your vital signs, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. If you think that would be best. I must admit, I’ve never had my “vital signs” taken before. Is it uncomfortable? I do hope it won’t take too long. I have a rather important appointment later this afternoon, you see. A hat fitting, actually. It's for the cruise, naturally. A very stylish hat. But please, do proceed. I’ll do my best to remain still.
DOCTOR: Just a quick blood pressure and pulse. And I’ll listen to your chest. Please sit here. And try to relax. Though, I suspect that may be difficult. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again. Everything sounds… clear enough. Although your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Now, let's have a look at your throat. Open wide.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I'm trying to relax, truly. It's just… a bit of a strange sensation, having someone listen to one’s chest. Is everything alright? My throat feels perfectly fine, but I'm happy to cooperate. It’s just… a bit drafty in here, isn’t it? And is that a bit of dust on the light fixture? Never mind. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Everything appears normal. Blood pressure is still elevated, but not alarmingly so. You've probably just been anxious. So, you want a note saying you're fit to travel. Despite the slightly elevated blood pressure… and your tendency to avoid doctors. I can write something… general. But I strongly advise you to monitor your blood pressure. And avoid rich foods. And peppermint tea is not a substitute for proper medical care. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, perfectly. I understand completely. I do appreciate you taking the time to see me, despite my… anxieties and avoidance of medical professionals. And I shall certainly monitor my blood pressure, as you suggest. And avoid rich foods, naturally. Though, I must admit, a small slice of sherry trifle now and then is rather tempting. But I shall resist. And I shall endeavor to find a proper blood pressure monitor. So, a note saying I’m fit to travel… that would be wonderful. Is there anything else I should do, or any other advice you might have? Perhaps a list of recommended reading materials about blood pressure? Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful.
DOCTOR: Here. This states you are generally fit for travel, with a recommendation to monitor your blood pressure. It’s not a comprehensive assessment, understand. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. And please, try to find a general practitioner. Before you embark on your… cruise. That will be all.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor Batara. That is most reassuring. I shall certainly heed your advice and monitor my blood pressure diligently. And I shall endeavour to find a general practitioner as soon as possible. Though, I must admit, it's rather difficult to find a doctor who understands one's… anxieties. But I shall try. You have been most kind, Doctor. And I appreciate your patience with my… verbosity. Thank you again. And… have a lovely afternoon. .
