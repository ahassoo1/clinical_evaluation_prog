DOCTOR: Hi Denis, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. Why don’t you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Yoshino. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received a letter regarding the results of a test… a test of my insides, I believe they called it. It indicated something was… not quite right with my stomach and digestive system. That is why I am here, of course. I must confess, I don’t entirely understand the specifics, but I was quite concerned by the wording.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A letter about some testing… that sounds a little worrying. We'll definitely get to the bottom of it. Let me pull up those results here… it looks like you had a stool sample analyzed on July 15th. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. July fifteenth… a rather unpleasant experience, if I am being honest, but necessary, I suppose. I followed all the instructions the laboratory provided. I do hope they were able to obtain a sufficient sample. It’s good to know you have all the details readily available.
DOCTOR: Good, that's helpful. Okay, the report indicates some elevated levels of calprotectin in your stool. Now, calprotectin is a protein released when there’s inflammation in the intestines. That's what the test looks for. It doesn’t tell us why there’s inflammation, just that there is. To get a better idea of what’s going on, can you tell me a little bit about what symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Inflammation… I see. Well, symptoms… that is a good question. I have been feeling… a bit unsettled in my stomach, for some time now. Not constant, but frequent. A sort of… cramping discomfort, particularly after eating. And… a change in my usual bowel habits. Not terribly severe, but noticeable. More frequent trips to the lavatory, shall we say. And… occasionally, a bit of blood. A small amount, but enough to cause concern, naturally. It hasn’t been… a deluge, if you will. Just… spots. Is that… helpful information, Doctor? I apologize for the rather indelicate descriptions.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Denis, thank you for sharing all of that. It's important to be specific, and you're doing a good job explaining everything. The cramping, change in bowel habits, and spotting are all things we need to investigate further. When you say “occasional spotting”, how often would you say that happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It's not a daily occurrence, certainly. Perhaps… once every two or three weeks, on average? Sometimes longer stretches without any at all. It seems to come and go somewhat randomly, though I have noticed it is more likely to occur after a particularly… rich meal, if you will. Something with a lot of spice, perhaps, or a great deal of fat. But not always. It’s… unpredictable, I suppose. I do try to maintain a healthy diet, but… one does enjoy a treat from time to time, doesn’t one? I hope this is providing useful information.
DOCTOR: It is, Denis, it really is. The frequency and connection to richer foods is helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside these?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms. Yes, there has been something else, now that you mention it. A bit of… fatigue, I suppose. Not debilitating, but a general feeling of being… less energetic than usual. I chalked it up to my age, naturally, but perhaps it is connected. And… occasionally, I feel a bit of nausea, particularly in the mornings. It doesn’t usually last long, and I haven’t actually been sick, but it’s… unpleasant. I also find myself losing my appetite somewhat. Not a complete loss, but… less enthusiastic about meals than I once was. Is this… worrisome, Doctor? I apologize for all the details. I am trying to be thorough.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t apologize at all! Thoroughness is exactly what I need. Fatigue, nausea, and decreased appetite – those are all things we need to consider. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Past medical history… let me see. I have been quite fortunate, actually. For the most part, I have enjoyed relatively good health throughout my life. I had a bout of pneumonia many years ago, when I was a younger woman, but I recovered fully. And… I had my gallbladder removed, perhaps fifteen years ago. Otherwise… no, nothing significant. No chronic illnesses, no major surgeries. I do have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it is well-managed with over-the-counter remedies. I do not take any regular medications, apart from occasional pain relievers for the arthritis. I pride myself on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, Doctor, as much as possible. Is there anything specific you are looking for? Perhaps a family history would be more relevant?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No, it's helpful to hear you’ve been generally healthy. The pneumonia and gallbladder removal are noted. And no regular medications, that's good. Let’s talk about family history then. Are there any instances of digestive issues, like Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or colon cancer, in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that is a more difficult question. My family is… rather large, and many of them lived quite far away. I do not have a great deal of detailed information. My mother suffered from… stomach ailments, I believe, but it was never properly diagnosed. She often complained of indigestion and bloating, but it was dismissed as… nerves, perhaps. My grandmother, on my father’s side, had a bout of… something involving the bowels, many years ago. I believe she required surgery, but I do not know the specifics. And… my uncle, on my mother’s side, was diagnosed with colon cancer, many years ago. He did not survive. Beyond that… I am afraid I do not have much information. It is a rather… fragmented family history, Doctor. I apologize for the lack of clarity. I wish I could be more helpful. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful, Denis. A history of stomach ailments in your mother and colon cancer in your uncle are definitely things to keep in mind. It’s not a reason for immediate alarm, but it does increase our level of caution. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I have never smoked a cigarette in my life. And while I occasionally enjoy a small glass of wine with dinner, it is very infrequent – perhaps once a month, on a special occasion. And recreational drugs… the very thought! No, I lead a very… conventional lifestyle, Doctor. I pride myself on it. I believe in moderation and good health. I spend my time gardening, reading, and visiting with my friends. I do not partake in any… unhealthy habits. I hope that is reassuring. Is there anything else you require?
DOCTOR: That is reassuring, thank you. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, I do not believe so. I have never experienced any adverse reactions to medications. I occasionally take over-the-counter pain relievers, as I mentioned, and have never had a problem. And as for foods… no, I am not allergic to anything that I know of. I have a rather… robust constitution, Doctor. I can eat most things without issue. Though I do not particularly care for shellfish, but that is a matter of taste, not allergy. Is there anything specific you are concerned about? I have a rather… straightforward medical history, Doctor, as you have probably gathered.
DOCTOR: You do, thankfully! Okay, last question. Could you tell me about your approximate height and weight?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am approximately one meter, eighty-three centimeters tall. That is, I believe, about six feet. And my weight… I have not weighed myself recently, but I would estimate approximately fifty-eight kilograms. Perhaps one hundred and twenty-eight pounds. I have always been… slender, even as a young woman. I maintain a healthy diet and a moderate level of activity, as I have mentioned. Is that… sufficient information? I hope I am not being too tedious with all the details.
DOCTOR: No, not at all! This is all very helpful. Thank you, Denis. Alright, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your abdomen, feel your belly to check for any tenderness, and a quick check of your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise. I am prepared to cooperate fully. Just… please be gentle. My insides are rather sensitive, you see. And… if you could explain what you are doing as you go, I would appreciate it. I always find it… reassuring to know what is happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will absolutely explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. I’m listening for any unusual sounds – bowel sounds, and whether there’s any sign of fluid or blockage. Just breathe normally. Bowel sounds are present, though a little quiet. Not overly concerning at this point. Now I’m going to gently palpate – that means feel – your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. I’ll start here, on the right side. Let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Very well. It feels… cool. Ooh, that is… a little tender. Right there, yes. Just below my ribs, on the right side. Not excruciating, but… uncomfortable. It feels… a bit like a dull ache. It’s been like that for some time, actually. Perhaps I should have mentioned it earlier. Is that… significant, Doctor? It’s not a constant pain, but it is… persistent. And… I do feel a slight… pressure there, occasionally. A sort of… fullness. It’s difficult to describe. Is that… normal? I apologize for being so… verbose. I am simply trying to be thorough.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Denis. It's good you're telling me all of this. Tenderness in that area, right below your ribs on the right side, is something we need to investigate further. It could be a number of things – inflammation of the gallbladder, liver, or even something muscular. Now, I’m going to check the left side. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, not on the left side. That feels… quite normal, actually. No discomfort, no tenderness. It’s only on the right side that I experience any… unpleasantness. A slight ache, as I mentioned. And a bit of pressure. Perhaps it is my gallbladder, as you suggested. I had it removed many years ago, but… could it be related? Is it possible for something to happen with the area where it was? I apologize for my ignorance, Doctor. I am not a medical professional, as you may have gathered. I simply try to maintain a healthy lifestyle and trust in your expertise.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Denis. It is possible to experience discomfort even after gallbladder removal. Sometimes there’s residual inflammation, or issues with the bile duct. I don’t feel any masses, and there's no significant enlargement. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs briefly, to make sure everything sounds clear. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Okay, that completes the basic physical exam. Based on what you've told me, and the tenderness I felt in your right upper abdomen, I think we need to do some further testing. Specifically, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal ultrasound. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Further testing seems… prudent, given the circumstances. Blood work and an ultrasound… yes, that seems a logical course of action. I trust your judgment implicitly. I am happy to comply with any recommendations you may have. I simply want to understand what is happening and ensure my health. I do hope the ultrasound is not too… uncomfortable. I have heard stories… But I am prepared to do whatever is necessary. When would these tests be scheduled, Doctor? And… will I need to do anything specific beforehand? Fasting, perhaps? I apologize for all the questions. I simply want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not being bothersome at all, Denis. It's good to be informed! The ultrasound itself isn’t usually uncomfortable. You’ll lie on a table and a technician will move a probe over your abdomen. It’s painless, but you might need to drink some water beforehand to help get a better image. We’ll schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning, and the ultrasound for… let’s say Thursday afternoon?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning for the blood work and Thursday afternoon for the ultrasound… that sounds… perfectly manageable. No fasting beforehand, you say? That is… reassuring. I do not enjoy being without sustenance for extended periods. Yes, that works very well. Thank you, Doctor Yoshino. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. I feel… considerably better knowing that we have a plan in place. I will arrive tomorrow morning as scheduled, and I will be prepared for the ultrasound on Thursday. Is there anything else I need to do or be aware of before then? Any specific instructions or precautions? I simply want to ensure everything goes smoothly. And… thank you again for your kindness and your expertise. It is… a comfort to know that I am in capable hands.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. Just try to drink plenty of water between now and tomorrow. And if you experience any sudden worsening of your pain, or develop a fever, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Otherwise, just rest and try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and we’ll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… excellent, Doctor. Drink plenty of water, rest, and try not to worry… I shall endeavour to do so. And I will certainly contact the office if my condition worsens. I appreciate your reassurance, Doctor Yoshino. It is… a comfort to know that you are monitoring my situation. Thank you again for your kindness and your expertise. I shall see you at my follow-up appointment, then. Have a pleasant day, Doctor. And thank you once more for your assistance. .
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Denis. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up before your appointment. .
