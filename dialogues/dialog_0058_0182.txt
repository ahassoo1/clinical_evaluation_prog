DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Todoro-vich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about this…procedure. The one my daughter scheduled. Honestly, a lot of fuss over nothing, but she insisted. Said I needed a “clearance.” Whatever that means. I’m here to get it over with so I can get home.
DOCTOR: A “clearance,” right. And what procedure is your daughter referring to, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: It’s…a face lift. Don’t look at me like that, young lady. It's not like I wanted one. Apparently, I look “tired.” She said it was a good price. Honestly, at my age, what’s the point? But she’s paying, so…here I am.
DOCTOR: A face lift. I see. And your daughter arranged this consultation as part of the pre-operative assessment, to ensure you’re healthy enough for the procedure. That’s…responsible of her. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe, years ago. The doctor put me on a pill, I took it for a bit. Didn’t really feel any different, so I stopped. My daughter will be furious if she hears that, but what’s the point of pills if they don’t do anything? Aside from that, no. Just old age, I suppose. And a bad back from all that terrazzo work. That’s the real problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, high blood pressure in the past, and a history of back pain from your work. And you discontinued the medication for your blood pressure…When was the last time you had your blood pressure checked, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years. Probably…before my wife passed. So, 2018, maybe? It’s not something I dwell on. I feel fine, generally. A little stiff in the mornings, but that's to be expected. Look, can we just get this over with? I have a bird feeder to refill.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, a pre-operative assessment is important. It’s not about whether you “feel” fine, it's about making sure you’re a safe candidate for surgery. We need to get some current information. Let's at least run through a quick review of systems. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? What are those, some kind of fancy heart thing? No, no chest pain. Breath’s a little short climbing the stairs, but I haven’t been climbing many stairs lately, to be honest. And dizziness…occasionally. When I stand up too fast. But that’s just old age again, isn’t it? Honestly, this is a waste of my time. I could be home, puttering around. Are you sure you can’t just sign off on this?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, but I'm not comfortable signing off on anything without a basic assessment. We need to be certain this procedure won’t put you at risk. Let’s just do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. It won't take long. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But don't expect a lot of cooperation. And if it takes too long, I’m leaving. I haven’t got all day. Just…get on with it. But be gentle, alright? My back isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit back and relax as much as possible…I'll start with your blood pressure. And then we'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please try to remain still and quiet during the exam. Your blood pressure is…elevated. 160 over 95. That’s quite high, Mr. Orwin. Breathing is a little labored, and I can hear some mild crackles in your lower lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly weakened. Now, let's check your pulse… Pulse is a little rapid and irregular.
PATIENT: See? Nothing wrong. A little fast, maybe, from the excitement of all this fuss. Crackles? That's probably just dust. I've been working with stone all my life, haven't I? And don't tell me about irregular pulses. I'm eighty-one years old, not a racehorse. Can we be done now? I'm starting to get a headache. And frankly, I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, these aren't things I can dismiss. Elevated blood pressure, labored breathing, and an irregular pulse are all concerning findings. And while I appreciate your…resilience, simply being eighty-one years old doesn’t negate these issues. I am not comfortable proceeding with this elective surgery until we investigate these findings further. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac or pulmonary issues. I recommend an EKG and a chest X-ray. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: An EKG? A chest X-ray? Now you’re just trying to scare me. Look, young lady, I came here for a simple clearance. My daughter said it was routine. I don’t need a battery of tests! I'm perfectly fine! This is ridiculous. I'm leaving. You've wasted enough of my time. Tell my daughter I said hello, and that she's a worrywart. .
