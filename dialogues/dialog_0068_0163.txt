DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Vantine. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Quite a pleasant clinic you have here, very… serene. As for why I’m here, well, it’s about a rather foolish experiment I’ve undertaken with my diet. A friend – a young man, really, full of energy – convinced me to try one of these… extreme regimes. I’m hoping you can tell me if I’ve done anything terribly wrong.
DOCTOR: An… extreme regime, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. It involves… well, primarily grapefruit, and a very limited protein source. I believe he called it the “Hollywood Reset.” Sounds rather glamorous, doesn't it? Though, in practice, it’s proving rather less so. I’ve been at it for nearly two weeks now, and I'm beginning to feel… a bit peculiar. Not unwell, precisely, but… lacking. Lacking in something. I can’t quite put my finger on it. Perhaps you’ll be able to diagnose it with your medical expertise.
DOCTOR: Grapefruit and limited protein… for two weeks. I see. And what specifically do you mean by "lacking"?
PATIENT: Hmm. A difficult thing to articulate, Doctor. It’s not a hunger, not precisely. More… a sort of mental fogginess. And a rather persistent fatigue. I used to be able to work for hours on end, sketching and animating, without a second thought. Now, I find myself needing to rest quite frequently. And my hands… they tremble a bit when I try particularly intricate work. It’s rather concerning, as my latest commission is quite demanding. A rather large project, involving a miniature dragon, meticulously animated. It requires a steady hand, you see.
DOCTOR: Mental fogginess, fatigue, tremors… Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Ah. Now that's a question. Yes, actually. Rather… irregular, shall we say. A bit too… forceful at times, and then rather… absent at others. It’s not terribly comfortable, I must admit. Though I’m a bit old-fashioned, you see, and don’t readily discuss such… personal matters. But you asked, and I pride myself on being truthful. It’s certainly not a comfortable experience, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Irregular bowel habits... Alright. And have you experienced any dizziness, lightheadedness, or changes in your thirst levels?
PATIENT: Yes, as a matter of fact. I have been feeling a touch lightheaded on occasion, particularly when I stand up quickly. And my thirst… well, it’s increased considerably. I find myself constantly reaching for water, which is rather unusual for me. I’ve always been a rather moderate drinker, preferring a nice cup of Earl Grey, actually. But now, it's water, water, water. It’s rather… disruptive to my tea schedule, you see. A small inconvenience, perhaps, but a noticeable one nonetheless.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of heart problems, diabetes, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. Perfectly healthy, as far as I'm aware. My father lived to be ninety-two, and my mother… well, she was quite sprightly until the very end. A bit of arthritis, naturally, but otherwise remarkably robust. We’ve always been a hardy bunch, my family. I’ve had the usual ailments, a cold here and there, the occasional bout of influenza, but nothing serious. I have private insurance, you see, and I’ve always been careful to maintain my health. Regular check-ups, a good diet – normally, at least. Though I seem to have abandoned that principle rather recently. Foolish, I know. Very foolish.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, based on what you’ve told me – the grapefruit diet, the fatigue, the mental fogginess, tremors, lightheadedness, increased thirst, and irregular bowel habits – it sounds like you may be experiencing some electrolyte imbalances due to the restrictive nature of this diet. Grapefruit can interact with certain medications, and the limited protein intake is also concerning. It's difficult to say definitively without some tests, but it's a likely possibility. We’ll need to do some blood work to check your potassium, sodium, and magnesium levels. Do you consent to a blood draw?
PATIENT: Electrolyte imbalances, you say? It does sound rather alarming when you put it that way. I hadn’t considered the potential for such complications. I suppose I was rather naive, trusting a young man with… enthusiasm, shall we say, over sound medical advice. Yes, Doctor, absolutely. Please, do whatever tests you deem necessary. Blood work sounds perfectly sensible. I consent, of course. I rather suspect you’re correct. A silly old fool, letting myself be persuaded by a fad diet. But do tell me, how serious are these imbalances? And will I be able to finish my dragon? That’s rather important, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. The severity can vary, Mr. Vantine. Mild imbalances can cause fatigue and muscle weakness, like you're experiencing. More severe imbalances can lead to heart rhythm problems and even seizures, but we’ll know more once we get the results. And we'll address it promptly. As for your dragon… it's difficult to say definitively until we know the extent of the imbalances. We need to restore your electrolytes first. I recommend stopping this diet immediately. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water, but avoid excessive amounts. And avoid strenuous activity, especially anything involving fine motor skills. I'll also want to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. We'll run a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Stopping the diet is… rather obvious, I suppose. A regrettable experiment, indeed. And yes, the additional tests are perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary to restore my health, and, if possible, my ability to complete this commission. A miniature dragon, you see. A rather intricate design, requiring a steady hand. It's for a private collector, a rather discerning gentleman with… substantial resources. I rather dread having to explain my predicament to him. A half-finished dragon is hardly an ideal presentation. So, the blood work… where will that be done? And how long will it take to get the results? I do have a rather busy schedule, you see. Though, naturally, my health takes precedence. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. The blood work can be done right here in the clinic. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly. It should only take about fifteen minutes. The results typically come back within 24-48 hours, but I'll have the nurse contact you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. While we’re waiting, let's quickly go over your current medications and allergies. Are you taking anything regularly, even over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: Medications, you say? Hmm. Not regularly, no. I take a small dose of aspirin occasionally, for a twinge in my knee, but nothing consistent. And allergies… I have a mild sensitivity to pollen, particularly in the spring, but nothing severe. A bit of a sniffle, a slight watering of the eyes, but nothing that requires medication. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. A robust constitution, you see. Though, perhaps not as robust as I believed. And a rather foolish penchant for trying fad diets. But, no, Doctor. Nothing regular. No allergies to speak of. Just this… regrettable experiment. Hopefully, a temporary setback.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications or known allergies. Good. We'll note that in your chart. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, if you start experiencing any chest pain, dizziness, or muscle weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Chest pain, dizziness, or muscle weakness… yes, perfectly. I understand. And I shall, of course, heed your advice, Doctor. Safety first, as they say. Though, I must confess, the thought of an emergency room visit is… rather unsettling. A bit too dramatic for my taste. But I shall remain vigilant. And I appreciate your caution. I believe I am prepared for this… blood work. A small price to pay for my folly, perhaps. Though I do hope it doesn't involve too many needles. I've never been terribly fond of those.
DOCTOR: We'll make it as quick and painless as possible, Mr. Vantine. The nurse is very skilled. She should be with you any moment now. Is there anything else I can address before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You've been most thorough, and I appreciate your patience with my… rather foolish experiment. I suppose I’ve learned a valuable lesson. Stick to Earl Grey and miniature dragons, and avoid the allure of restrictive diets. Though, perhaps, a small biscuit wouldn’t go amiss. But no grapefruits. Definitely no grapefruits. I shall await the arrival of the nurse, and the results of these tests. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Vantine. We’ll get those results back to you as soon as possible. Please let us know if anything changes before then. I’ll leave you to it. .
