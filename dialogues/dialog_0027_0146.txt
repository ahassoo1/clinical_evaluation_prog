DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… muscle weakness, really. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s starting to get annoying. I figured I should get it checked out before it gets worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, muscle weakness. And how long is “a bit now,” exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… three, maybe four months? It started pretty gradually, so it’s hard to pinpoint. At first, I just thought I was getting old, honestly. But it's definitely not getting better on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months. And can you tell me where you’re noticing the weakness?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my legs, I think. And my arms are starting to feel it too, but not as bad. Like, getting up from a chair takes more effort than it used to. And carrying groceries… forget about it. I used to be able to haul a lot more. It feels like… they just don't have the strength they used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, legs and arms… and it’s a gradual weakening, not a sudden thing. Do you notice it being worse at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah, actually. It feels worse in the evenings, definitely. After I’ve been on my feet all day, that’s when it really starts to bother me. And sometimes after I’ve been sitting for a while, like a long car ride, it takes a minute to get going. Not terrible, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really. No pain, no numbness, no tingling. I haven’t been feeling sick or anything like that. Just… tired, maybe? But I always figured that was from working too much. I haven’t really connected it to the weakness until recently.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, numbness, or tingling. Just fatigue. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. I eat pretty much the same stuff I always do. Lots of rice and lamb, you know, Yemeni food. Nothing fancy. I haven't been trying any new diets or anything like that. To be honest, I probably should eat more vegetables, but that's a different conversation.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Okay, let's see… Not really. Nothing major, anyway. I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone else. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. No serious illnesses or anything. Oh, and I have high blood pressure, I found out a couple of years ago. I’m supposed to be taking medication for it, but… I don't always remember.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, and you don't always take your medication?
PATIENT: Yeah, it’s embarrassing, I know. It's just... a lot of pills to keep track of, and sometimes I forget. I try to remember, but work gets busy, and… well, it slips my mind. Is that bad? Should I be more careful about that?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, Mr. McKinnon, but it's very common. It's important to manage your blood pressure, and consistent medication can make a big difference. We can work on finding a system to help you remember. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Not a fan, honestly. I avoid hospitals if I can. I always figured I'd just get better on my own if something was wrong. Maybe that was foolish, looking back.
DOCTOR: That's alright. A lot of people feel that way. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my dad, he had diabetes. And his heart wasn’t the best, either. He passed away a few years back. My mom, she's still alive, thankfully, but she’s got arthritis, so she’s always complaining about her joints. Nothing else really stands out, I don’t think. My siblings are all pretty healthy, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, none of the above. Never been a smoker. I don't really drink, maybe a sip of juice at a wedding or something. And definitely no drugs. I stay pretty clean, honestly. My mom would kill me if I did any of that.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. As far as I know, anyway. I can take most medications without any problems. I haven’t had any bad reactions or anything. Does that cover everything, Doctor? I'm kind of hoping we can get to figuring out what’s going on with my legs now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that covers everything. Thank you. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. That will help me get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. …160 over 90. A bit elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes and muscle strength. Please relax your legs… I'm going to test how strong your muscles are in your legs and arms. Alright. Your reflexes are normal, but your muscle strength is somewhat diminished in both your legs and arms, particularly in your legs. It’s not a severe weakness, but it is noticeable. I'd also like to check your feet… No swelling, no redness, sensation is intact. Okay. That gives me a bit more information.
PATIENT: So… what does all that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m starting to get a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. McKinnon, it's good you're asking. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings – your slightly elevated blood pressure, the diminished muscle strength, but normal reflexes – it could be a few things. The diminished muscle strength could be related to your blood pressure, as uncontrolled hypertension can sometimes cause muscle weakness. However, it’s not definitive. We need to rule out other potential causes. I’m going to order some blood tests. They will check your electrolytes, kidney function, thyroid levels, and vitamin D levels. These tests can help us identify any underlying medical conditions that might be causing your weakness. I'm also going to order a complete blood count to check for anemia. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever it takes to figure it out. Blood tests are fine. So… when will I get the results? And will I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the results back. The results will be sent to me, and then I will give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We'll probably need to review them together, and depending on what they show, we might need to order additional tests or consider a referral to a specialist. In the meantime, it's very important to get your blood pressure under control. You mentioned you don't always take your medication. Let's try to come up with a plan to help you remember. Perhaps setting an alarm on your phone, or linking it to something you do every day. We can also discuss lifestyle modifications, such as reducing your salt intake and getting regular exercise. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. An alarm on my phone might work, I guess. I'm just… forgetful, you know? And less salt… that's going to be hard. I like my food. But I'll try. I'll try to do better. Is there anything else I should be doing, Doctor? Like, anything I should avoid doing?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. McKinnon. And don’t worry, small changes can make a big difference. For now, I would recommend avoiding strenuous activity until we get the test results back. It's better to err on the side of caution. Also, if you notice any new or worsening symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe weakness, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’m also going to give you a handout with information about managing hypertension and some exercises you can do when you are feeling up to it. Here you go. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for listening. I really appreciate you taking the time to figure this out. I hope it’s not anything too serious. I'll try to remember to take my medication, and I'll call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I understand your concerns, and we will work together to get to the bottom of this. I’m here to help. Just call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you again. You too.
