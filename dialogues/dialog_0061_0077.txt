DOCTOR: "Bula vinaka, Mr. Bigger! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Doctor Kim, you say? Yes, yes. My people send me. Something about… the dust. From the mine. They want to make sure I no get sick, even if I feel fine. Been working there a long time, you know. Long, long time.
DOCTOR: "Okay, that's good they're being cautious. It's smart to check things out, especially with long-term exposure like that. So, you've been working at the mine for quite a while… and they’re concerned about dust exposure. Even though you feel fine right now, they want me to take a look?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. They pay good money for this check-up. Waste of money if I tell them I feel strong like bull, but… they insist. Better safe than sorry, I suppose. Not like I got anything better to do today, anyway. Old man needs to keep busy, you know?
DOCTOR: “I understand completely, Mr. Bigger. It’s always better to be safe, and it’s good of them to offer this check-up. And keeping busy is important! Let's go through some questions, and then I'll do a quick exam, okay?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmph. What kind of questions? Not about my family, I hope. Private matter, that is. And don't be asking me about politics either. Too much trouble. Just tell me what you need to know about the… the dust. That's what they paid for, right?
DOCTOR: "Of course, Mr. Bigger. Completely understandable. We'll focus on the dust exposure, and I won’t pry into anything personal. Mostly, I want to know about any symptoms you have been experiencing – even if they seem small. Have you noticed any coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, or any changes in your breathing at all?
PATIENT: Coughing? Sometimes. Old man cough, you know? Happens. Shortness of breath… well, I climb stairs, it get hard. But I always get hard climbing stairs! Not just from the dust. Wheezing… I don't know what that even is. Changes in breathing? No. I breathe. Always have. What kind of changes you expect? Like I start breathing upside down?
DOCTOR: "Okay, that's helpful. So, the coughing is occasional, and you notice some difficulty with stairs – which you've always experienced. And you haven’t noticed anything different about your breathing pattern itself. That’s good to know. When did you first start noticing the coughing?
PATIENT: First noticing? Eh… long time ago. Maybe… ten years? Fifteen? Hard to say. I work in the dust every day. Always dust. Comes with the job. It's not like it just started yesterday. It’s just… sometimes it’s more. Sometimes less. Depends on the day, depends on the wind.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so the coughing has been present for at least 10-15 years, and it fluctuates. That’s important information. Has the coughing gotten worse recently, or stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Worse? No. Not really. Maybe a little more when the weather is bad. Makes the old bones ache, you know? But the cough itself… no. Same old cough. Annoying, but not… frightening. I've coughed up worse things in my life. Not that I want to talk about those things.
DOCTOR: "I understand, Mr. Bigger. No need to share anything you're not comfortable with. So, the cough hasn't significantly worsened, even with changes in the weather. Do you notice any chest pain when you cough, or at any other time?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Sometimes my chest feels… tight. But that's just old age, I think. And maybe from lifting heavy things all these years. Not a sharp pain, just… heavy. Like someone is sitting on my chest. But it goes away. Happens mostly when I lie down.
DOCTOR: “Okay, tightness in your chest, especially when lying down. And it doesn't feel like a sharp pain, more like pressure. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No. Never. Strong heart, I tell you! Always been strong. High… what you call it? Pressure? Doctor checked me years ago, said I was okay. Maybe a little high, but nothing to worry about. Just told me to… what you call it… relax. Easier said than done when you gotta work! They always say "relax".
DOCTOR: "Okay, so no prior diagnosis of heart problems, and your blood pressure was checked years ago and was slightly elevated, but not concerning enough for treatment at that time. Now, let's talk about anything you might be exposed to besides the dust at the mine. Any pets at home?
PATIENT: Pets? No. Animals are trouble. Messy, smelly… no thank you. I got enough trouble with my bones, don't need animals adding to it. Just me, myself, and the television. And the dust, of course. Always the dust.
DOCTOR: “Alright, no pets. And you don’t smoke, correct?
PATIENT: Smoke? Me? No! Never touched the stuff. Bad for the lungs, you know. I need my lungs for working! And for… well, for breathing. You think I spend all day in dust just to ruin them with smoke? That's foolishness.
DOCTOR: "Good to hear. Okay, Mr. Bigger, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and check your heart rate and blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Exam, eh? Fine. Get it over with. But don't poke around too much. Old man bones are fragile. And don't take too long, I got things to do.
DOCTOR: "Of course, I’ll be gentle. Okay, Mr. Bigger, breathing deeply for me, please… and again… Your heart rate is a little elevated, but regular. I'm hearing some wheezing in your lungs, and your breath sounds are a little quieter than they should be. I'm also noting that your chest is a bit wider than average. Now, I'm just going to listen to your back…"
PATIENT: Hmph. Wheezing? What does that mean? Is that bad? I told you, I work in dust! It's supposed to be dusty! And what do you mean, “wider?” I just got a strong chest. From all the lifting, you know. Don't be telling me I'm getting… skinny. Is this going to cost extra?
DOCTOR: “I understand your concern, Mr. Bigger. The wheezing indicates some narrowing of your airways, which can be caused by inflammation or irritation – and dust exposure can certainly contribute to that. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious right away, but it's something we need to investigate further. And you're right, a strong chest is good! But the shape can also indicate changes in lung function over time. As for the cost, no, this is all covered under your check-up. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs. We should also do a spirometry test – that’s a simple breathing test to measure how much air you can inhale and exhale. And just to be safe, I’d like to check your oxygen saturation levels with a pulse oximeter, right here in the office. How does that sound?
PATIENT: X-ray? Breathing test? More poking and prodding? Hmph. You doctors always want to do something. Is it really necessary? I feel fine! But… ... my people paid for it, I suppose. Fine. Do your tests. But make it quick. And tell me what all this means. Don't be using fancy doctor words, understand? Just plain English. And… what if it is something bad?
DOCTOR: "I understand your hesitation, Mr. Bigger, and I promise to explain everything in plain English. The tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on in your lungs and help us determine the best course of action. The X-ray will show us if there are any abnormalities, and the spirometry test will measure how well your lungs are functioning. If something is detected, it doesn’t necessarily mean it's something serious, and we’ll discuss all your options. Right now, let's focus on getting the tests done. I’ll have the nurse start with your oxygen saturation levels, then we'll move on to the spirometry test. It involves breathing into a tube for a few minutes, and then we’ll get the X-ray ordered. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Oxygen first, you say? Then the tube… and the picture. Just get it over with. But no poking! And explain everything, understand? Plain English. I'm an old man, not a scientist. Just hurry up. I got a television waiting for me.
DOCTOR: “Absolutely, Mr. Bigger. No poking, I promise. And I’ll explain everything in plain English, step by step. Let me call the nurse in to get your oxygen saturation checked first. It's just a clip on your finger, it won't hurt at all.” “We’ll take things one step at a time. And yes, the television is a very good reason to hurry!”
PATIENT: .
