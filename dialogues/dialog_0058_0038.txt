DOCTOR: Alright, Evann Buoniconte, 35 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Todoro-vich, is it? Yes, that is correct. It’s… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I was hoping to discuss… planning for the future, I suppose. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… well, should something happen. I believe it has a formal name, a document? I was told this is the place to get it done. I’m terribly sorry, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you want to discuss…advance care planning?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Advance care planning… yes. Or perhaps a POLST form? A friend mentioned that, and I recall it being… more immediate, if that makes sense. I truly don’t know which is best, or even if I need both. I just… want to be prepared. I apologize for being so unclear; I wish I could articulate this better. Is a POLST form for when you’re already unwell?
DOCTOR: A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is for serious illness or frailty, yes. It clarifies current wishes for medical care, particularly if you’re unable to speak for yourself. Advance care planning is… broader. It's thinking about your overall values and what matters to you, ideally before a crisis. It can lead to a POLST, or a more general living will. So, you're relatively young and healthy… why are you thinking about this now?
PATIENT: That… is a very good question. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure. It’s… a feeling, I suppose. A sense of needing to have things in order. I recently divorced, and… well, it made me realize how alone I am, and how important it is to have a voice, even when I can’t physically use it. It sounds dramatic, I know. And I confess, the details surrounding why it feels so pressing are… hazy. My friend, she had a bad experience with her mother's care, and that definitely influenced me. Perhaps I’m being preemptive. Is it unusual to think about this at my age?
DOCTOR: <stage>I raise an eyebrow slightly, scribbling a quick note: "Recent divorce - anxiety/emotional distress?
PATIENT: No, it’s not unusual, but it’s certainly less common. Recent life changes can absolutely bring these thoughts forward. It’s good you’re thinking about this, regardless. So, let’s start with the broader picture. When you imagine a situation where you couldn’t tell doctors what you want, what are the most important things you’d want them to know? Forget specific treatments for now – just what values are most important to you in your care?
DOCTOR: Values… okay. Well, I… I value my independence, above all else. I’ve always been very self-sufficient. And… comfort. I don't want to be kept alive if there’s no quality of life. I… I don't want to be a burden. Is that… sufficient?
PATIENT: That’s a very good start. Independence and comfort are important values. “Not wanting to be a burden” is also something we can definitely address. It sounds like you prioritize quality of life. To clarify, when you say “quality of life,” what does that look like for you? What would be unacceptable? What things would make life not worth living, in your opinion? It’s a difficult question, I know, but the more specific we are, the better we can document your wishes. For instance, would being unable to engage in hobbies be unacceptable? Or needing constant assistance with daily activities?
DOCTOR: Well… I enjoy my art. Painting, sculpting… creating. If I couldn't do that… that would be devastating. And… I value my cognitive function. I don't want to be… lost, or unable to recognize my loved ones. Constant pain, of course, is unacceptable. And… if I required round-the-clock care… if I couldn’t even feed myself… then, no. I don't want to be kept alive artificially in that state. Is that… clear enough?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s much clearer. So, loss of cognitive function, inability to engage in artistic pursuits, constant pain, and requiring constant, total care are all things that would significantly diminish your quality of life. Okay. We’re building a good picture. Now, let’s talk about how you want these wishes documented. Would you prefer a more general advance directive, outlining your values as we’ve discussed? Or would you like to create a POLST form now, specifying treatments you would or would not want in certain medical scenarios? To be clear, a POLST is a medical order—it tells doctors what to do in a crisis. An advance directive is more about guiding principles. Does that distinction make sense?
DOCTOR: I think… a POLST form feels… overwhelming right now. Too specific. I think I’d prefer the advance directive. Something that outlines my values, and maybe names a healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Good. An advance directive is a good starting point. And yes, naming a healthcare proxy – someone to make decisions for you if you’re unable to – is crucial. Do you have someone in mind? Someone you trust implicitly to understand and honor your wishes? And would you like me to explain the process of choosing a proxy and what their responsibilities would entail? It’s important to choose someone who can handle difficult conversations and advocate for your best interests.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. My sister, Anya. She’s… very level-headed and understands me better than anyone. And yes, please. Explain the process. I’ve… vaguely heard things, but I want to be sure I understand what I’m asking of her. I wouldn’t want to put her in a difficult position without her fully knowing what it entails.
PATIENT: Excellent. Anya sounds like a good choice. Okay, so, a healthcare proxy is legally authorized to make medical decisions on your behalf when you’re unable to do so yourself. This would happen if you were unconscious, severely ill, or otherwise incapacitated. They are required to make decisions based on your known wishes – that’s why documenting your values, as we’ve been doing, is so important. They have a legal and ethical obligation to act in your best interest, even if they don't personally agree with your choices. It’s vital that you have a frank conversation with Anya about your wishes – what kind of care you want, what you want to avoid, and how far she should go to extend your life. It’s also helpful to provide her with a copy of your advance directive and any other relevant medical information. I have forms that outline the legal requirements and responsibilities of a healthcare proxy. We can go through them together. And I strongly recommend having a witness present when you sign the document, to ensure it’s legally valid. Do you have any questions so far?
DOCTOR: That… sounds like a lot. A witness?
PATIENT: It does sound like a lot, I understand. It's important to ensure your wishes are legally respected, which is why the witness is required. It just needs to be an adult, someone who isn't directly benefiting from your will or involved in your medical care. A friend, a neighbor, a colleague – anyone like that. It’s to prevent any potential conflicts of interest or claims of coercion. We can discuss this in more detail, if you'd like. The document itself is fairly straightforward. It mainly confirms that Anya is your chosen proxy, outlines your known wishes – which we’ve already started documenting – and includes a space for her signature acknowledging her acceptance of the role. Do you have a witness in mind already? Or would you like me to provide you with a list of resources in the area? We can also pause here and allow you time to consider everything. There's no rush.
DOCTOR: No, I don't have anyone immediately available. Perhaps… a colleague. I'll need to arrange something. This is… more complicated than I anticipated. I suppose it’s good to be thorough, but it’s rather… daunting.
PATIENT: It is a lot to consider, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. You’re doing the right thing by planning ahead, even if it feels daunting. We can take it one step at a time. For now, let’s focus on completing the advance directive form itself. We’ve already covered the most important points – your values, your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment, and your preference for comfort and quality of life. We can refine those points and ensure they’re clearly documented. Once the form is complete, you can focus on finding a witness and arranging a time to sign it. Do you have any questions about the specific wording on the form? Or would you like me to walk you through each section again? We can also take a break if you’d prefer.
DOCTOR: Can you… just walk me through it again?
PATIENT: Of course. Let’s start with the first section, “Personal Information.” This is just basic information – your name, date of birth, address, and contact details. It’s also where you’ll list your primary care physician, which is me. The next section is “Healthcare Proxy.” This is where you formally designate Anya as your proxy. You’ll need to include her full name, address, and contact information. There’s also a section where you can list an alternate proxy, in case Anya is unable to fulfill her role. Do you have an alternate proxy in mind? Then we’ll move onto the “Statement of Wishes” section, which is the most important part. This is where you’ll outline your values, your preferences for life-sustaining treatment, and any specific instructions you have regarding your care. We’ve already discussed those points in detail, so we can simply transcribe them onto the form. Finally, there’s a section for signatures and witness information. You’ll need to sign the form in the presence of a witness, and the witness will also need to sign it. Does that sound manageable? We can go through each section step-by-step, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have along the way.
DOCTOR: Okay. Step-by-step. That sounds… better. I don't have an alternate proxy immediately, but I can add someone later, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. You can add an alternate proxy at any time. It's not required, but it's a good idea to have one in case your primary proxy is unavailable or unable to fulfill their role. You can simply write "To be added later" in that section for now, and add someone's information when you're ready. Alright, let's start with your personal information. Can you please verify your date of birth for me?
DOCTOR: August 12th, 1990. Wait… is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. August 12th, 1990. It's easy to lose track of the years! Okay, so, next is your address and contact information.
DOCTOR: I… I don’t recall ever having updated my emergency contact information. Is that important?
PATIENT: It is good to have current emergency contact information, yes. It’s primarily for situations where we need to reach a loved one quickly, or if you’re unable to provide information yourself. Do you have a phone number or email address for a family member or friend we could add? It's perfectly okay if you don't have one readily available; we can leave it blank for now and you can update it later.
DOCTOR: My sister, Anya… yes. I’ll put her number. It’s… 555-123-4567. And her email is anya.smith@email.com.
PATIENT: Excellent. Anya's information is now recorded. Okay, we've completed the personal information section. Now we’ll move onto the Healthcare Proxy section. This is where you formally designate Anya as your proxy. Are you comfortable proceeding with that, or would you like to pause for a moment?
DOCTOR: Yes. Let's proceed. Anya is… she’s the best choice. I trust her completely.
PATIENT: Very good. This section simply requires you to write Anya’s full name, address, and contact information. We’ve already recorded that, so you can simply copy it over. There’s also a section where you need to write a statement confirming that you are of sound mind and freely choosing Anya as your healthcare proxy. It just needs to be a short sentence, such as “I, Evann Buoniconte, designate Anya Smith as my healthcare proxy, and I am of sound mind to make this decision.” Would you like me to write that sentence for you, or would you prefer to write it yourself?
DOCTOR: I… I’ll try to write it myself. Is it… is it “designate” or “designate” with an “s”?
PATIENT: Good catch! It’s “designate” – with an “s”. You're absolutely right to double-check. It’s easy to make those little errors.
DOCTOR: Okay. I think… I think that’s correct. Is that… is that enough for this section?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfect. That’s exactly what we need for this section. You’ve successfully designated Anya as your healthcare proxy. Now, we'll move on to the most important part – the Statement of Wishes. This is where you’ll outline your values, your preferences for life-sustaining treatment, and any specific instructions you have regarding your care. We've already discussed those points in detail, so we can simply transcribe them onto the form. Do you feel comfortable doing that now, or would you like a brief pause before we start?
DOCTOR: Let’s… let’s do it now. I want to get this finished. I don’t want to… put it off any longer.
PATIENT: Excellent. As we discussed, we'll start by outlining your values. You mentioned that independence and comfort are very important to you, and that you don't want to be a burden. We can start by writing something like: "I value my independence and comfort, and I do not want to be a burden to others." Does that sound accurate?
DOCTOR: Yes. That… that sounds right. But maybe… add something about my art?
PATIENT: Of course. How about: “I value my independence and comfort, and I do not want to be a burden to others. I also greatly value my artistic pursuits, and maintaining my ability to create is very important to me." Does that capture your wishes accurately?
DOCTOR: Yes. That… that’s perfect. That’s exactly how I feel.
PATIENT: Excellent. Now, let's move onto your preferences for life-sustaining treatment. You mentioned that you don't want to be kept alive if there's no quality of life, and that you wouldn't want to be artificially sustained if you were unable to engage in your hobbies or recognize your loved ones. We can write something like: "I do not want to be kept alive if there is no reasonable hope of recovery, or if my quality of life is significantly diminished. Specifically, I would not want to be artificially sustained if I am unable to engage in my artistic pursuits, or if I no longer recognize my loved ones.” Does that sound accurate?
DOCTOR: Maybe… add something about constant pain?
PATIENT: Of course. How about: "I do not want to be kept alive if there is no reasonable hope of recovery, or if my quality of life is significantly diminished. Specifically, I would not want to be artificially sustained if I am unable to engage in my artistic pursuits, or if I no longer recognize my loved ones, or if I am experiencing constant and unmanageable pain." Does that capture your wishes accurately?
DOCTOR: Yes. That’s… that’s perfect. That’s exactly how I feel. Thank you.
PATIENT: You're very welcome. Now, let’s add a final sentence confirming that you understand these wishes and that you’ve had the opportunity to discuss them with your healthcare proxy, Anya. We can write something like: “I understand these wishes and have discussed them with my healthcare proxy, Anya Smith. I am of sound mind to make this decision.” Does that sound accurate?
DOCTOR: Yes. That… that sounds perfect. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you. This… this feels good.
PATIENT: Excellent. That is everything. You’ve successfully completed your advance directive, outlining your values, your preferences for life-sustaining treatment, and your wishes regarding your care. Now, all that remains is to sign the form in the presence of a witness, and for the witness to sign as well. Do you have a witness available now, or will you need to arrange for one later?
DOCTOR: No, I don’t have a witness available now. I’ll need to arrange for one later. My neighbor, perhaps.
PATIENT: That’s perfectly alright. Just make sure the witness is an adult who isn't directly benefiting from your will or involved in your medical care. And it’s important to sign the form in their presence, so they can witness your signature. I have a separate sheet outlining the requirements for witnesses, just in case. Once you've signed the form with a witness, be sure to keep it in a safe place and inform your healthcare provider – and, of course, Anya – that it exists and where to find it. Do you have any other questions for me today?
DOCTOR: No. I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Todoro-vich. You’ve been… very helpful.
PATIENT: You’re very welcome, Evann. I’m glad I could help. Remember, this document is a testament to your wishes and values, and it’s important to keep it updated as your circumstances change. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a good day, Evann.
