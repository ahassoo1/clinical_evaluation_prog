DOCTOR: Hi Marija, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure. I received a… a suggestion, let’s call it, from a colleague to come and discuss… plans for the future. Rather… sensitive plans. It concerns what happens if… well, if I become unable to make decisions for myself. I believe you have forms for this? An Advance Directive, perhaps? I'd like to get that sorted, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. That’s very responsible of you to think ahead. An Advance Directive is a great way to ensure your wishes are known. We absolutely have the forms here, and I’m happy to guide you through them. Before we dive into the paperwork, could you tell me a little bit about what prompted this conversation now?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, frankly, it’s the younger generation. They simply lack foresight. My sister, bless her heart, was telling me about a friend who… had an incident. A rather unpleasant fall, and no one knew what she wanted. Absolute chaos, I assure you. It’s simply dreadful to think about leaving such matters to chance, or worse, to the… opinions of others. My husband, of course, is perfectly capable, but it’s best to be thorough, don’t you agree? A detailed plan leaves no room for…misunderstanding.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. You're very wise to be proactive, and I completely agree – a detailed plan offers peace of mind for everyone involved. It’s far better to have these conversations before a crisis happens. Let's start with the basics. Do you have any specific wishes regarding medical treatment in the event you are unable to communicate?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I believe in letting nature take its course. I am not one for… prolonging the inevitable with machines and… interventions. I’ve seen too much of that in hospitals. If there is no reasonable hope of recovery, I would prefer…comfort care. And, naturally, I trust my husband implicitly to make sound judgements. Though, I suppose it’s helpful to have it documented, to avoid any… disagreements with other family members. They can be… quite insistent, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. That’s a very thoughtful approach. Comfort care is an important consideration, and documenting your wishes is a wonderful way to ensure they're respected. This first section deals with your healthcare proxy – the person you designate to make decisions on your behalf when you can’t. You mentioned your husband – is he who you'd like to name as your proxy?
PATIENT: Naturally. My husband, Jean-Pierre, is a very sensible man. He has excellent judgement, and he knows my wishes perfectly. He’s a retired professor, you see, very logical. Although… he does have a tendency to overthink things. But on the whole, he is more than capable. Yes, Jean-Pierre is my healthcare proxy. Do I simply write his name here? It seems… rather simplistic, doesn’t it, for such an important decision?
DOCTOR: It does seem simple, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: It is rather alarming how little formality there is surrounding such… weighty matters. Still, if that is the procedure, I suppose I must comply. I will write his name, then. And… is there a place to indicate an alternate proxy? One never knows. My sister, perhaps? Though she can be… emotional. A rather unreliable choice, really. But better to have someone than nothing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's a very good point, Marija – having an alternate is always a wise idea. The form does have a section for that. It’s good you’re thinking through these details. Right here. You can list your sister, and it’s helpful to include her contact information as well. We also have a form for a living will, where you can outline specific treatments you would or would not want. Would you be interested in going over that as well?
PATIENT: A “living will”? Is that not… rather morbid? I mean, dwelling on the specifics of one’s demise… I suppose if it provides clarity, it is worthwhile. But I do find the whole concept… distasteful. I prefer to focus on enjoying the present, not anticipating unpleasantries. However… if it’s a short form, and doesn't require excessive detail, I suppose I can consider it. Jean-Pierre has always been rather meticulous about paperwork; perhaps he can assist. What sort of specifics does it require? I certainly don't want to enumerate every possible… procedure. That sounds utterly exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Marija. It can feel morbid, and it’s perfectly reasonable to focus on the present. The living will is really about ensuring your values are known, not detailing every possible scenario. It asks about things like life-sustaining treatment – would you want a ventilator if you couldn’t breathe on your own?
PATIENT: A ventilator? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I would never want to be kept alive artificially, a mere… shell of my former self. The indignity of it! No, Doctor, emphatically no. I believe in a natural progression, not… prolonged suffering with machines. That is… barbaric. Write that down, please. "No life-sustaining treatment." And… what else? Is there a section regarding… resuscitation? I certainly don't wish to be… jolted back to life after a… natural decline. A peaceful passing is far preferable. Don’t you agree? It’s a matter of dignity, Doctor. Dignity.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. I completely agree. It's about respecting your wishes and ensuring a peaceful end of life. There’s also a section about pain management. It asks if you’d like to receive medication to relieve pain, even if it might hasten your death.
PATIENT: Hasten my death? Honestly, Doctor, that’s a rather… blunt way of phrasing it. Of course, I would want pain relief! What kind of question is that? If I am suffering, I expect to be made comfortable. I am not one for… stoicism. And frankly, if a little medication hastens the inevitable, so be it. I certainly wouldn't want to linger in agony. Write that down as well, please. "Aggressive pain management." Though, I trust my doctors to use their… discretion. I don't want to be… overmedicated, either. A balance, Doctor, a balance. Is that clear? It seems a great deal of explaining is required for something so…self-evident.
DOCTOR: It does seem like a lot, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: "A lot" is a rather…understatement, Doctor. It's frankly, exhausting. All this… dwelling on unpleasant possibilities. I came here for a simple Advance Directive, and now I'm composing a treatise on my own demise. I trust Jean-Pierre can review this and ensure everything is… adequately documented. He's far more detail-oriented than I am. Is there anything else? Anything at all? Because frankly, I am beginning to feel quite… drained.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Marija. It is a lot, and you’ve been very thorough in expressing your wishes. The only other thing is signing and witnessing. You’ll need to sign it in the presence of two witnesses who are not your family members or healthcare proxies. Once that’s done, it’s legally binding. And I’ll make a copy for your records, of course. Is there anything I can clarify before you get started?
PATIENT: Witnesses… of course. More complications. Well, I suppose I can ask my colleagues at the university. I have a… rather gossipy friend, Madame Dubois, who would be delighted to participate, purely for the… drama of it all. Though I doubt she’d be a reliable source of anything. And Monsieur LeFevre, the librarian, is a quiet sort; he wouldn’t say a word to anyone. Yes, those two will do nicely. No, I don’t think I require any further clarification. You’ve explained everything… adequately. Though I still maintain that this entire process is… unduly cumbersome. But thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… patient. Now, let us get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marija. It was my pleasure to help. Just sign and date it here, and then I can explain the witnessing requirements. It’s a simple procedure, really. And then we’ll be all finished.
PATIENT: There. Done. Now, tell me about these… witnesses. Do they need to understand French? Madame Dubois is rather fluent, but Monsieur LeFevre… well, his linguistic skills are… limited. And do they need to be present at the same time? Because arranging a meeting with those two… is a prospect I find rather… daunting.
DOCTOR: No, they don't need to understand French, and they absolutely do need to be present at the same time. They need to witness you signing the document, and they’ll need to sign it themselves as confirmation. There are lines for their signatures and addresses. It’s really just a formality to ensure it’s a valid legal document. Don’t worry, it doesn’t have to be a complicated process. I’m sure you can manage it. And if you run into any difficulties, feel free to call the office, and we can try to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Marija?
PATIENT: "Manage it," you say. Well, I suppose I have faced more challenging tasks in my life. Though arranging a meeting between Madame Dubois and Monsieur LeFevre… is a challenge of a different order entirely. No, I believe that is all. You have been… thorough, Doctor. And I am, if I may say so, relieved to have this… matter concluded. I shall endeavor to find suitable witnesses. Thank you again for your… patience. And I trust this document will be kept securely in your records? I wouldn’t want it falling into the wrong hands. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. It will be kept securely in your confidential medical record, accessible only to authorized personnel. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best.
