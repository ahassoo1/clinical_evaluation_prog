DOCTOR: Good morning, Terasa. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… well, it’s this hearing, you see. It comes and goes. And makes me feel… wobbly sometimes. It's hard to explain. My daughter, she said I should come see someone about it, and something about my family… she mentioned that too. Honestly, I don't quite recall all the details. It's been a bit of a blur lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like you've been dealing with some fluctuating hearing issues and some dizziness – feeling wobbly, as you put it. And your daughter mentioned family history might be relevant. We'll definitely look into all of that. Let's start with the hearing. When did you first notice this coming and going?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I first notice it? That’s… a good question. It feels like a long time ago now. Maybe… a few months? Or was it last year? It’s hard to be sure. It comes on suddenly, and then it fades away. It's not always there, which is what’s so confusing. I can’t pinpoint a specific date, I’m afraid. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, don’t worry about being precise – it’s very common for things to be a little hazy when you’re trying to remember when symptoms started. “A few months” is a good starting point. And when it does happen, can you describe what the hearing loss is like?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I go completely deaf, you know? It’s more… muffled. Like someone turned the volume down really low, or put something in my ear. And sometimes it’s just in one ear, sometimes both. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. Especially when people are talking! I have to ask them to repeat things all the time. My daughter gets a bit annoyed, but she’s a good girl. She tries to be patient.
DOCTOR: I understand. Muffled hearing that comes and goes, and sometimes affects one ear more than the other – that gives us some good information to work with. And it's good your daughter is supportive. Now, you mentioned feeling wobbly. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the wobbliness. It's not like I fall over or anything, Doctor. It's more… a feeling of being off-balance. Like the room is spinning, just a little bit. It doesn't last long, usually just a few seconds. But it's enough to make me grab onto something for support. It usually happens with the hearing going funny, but not always. Sometimes it just happens on its own. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a brief feeling of imbalance, sometimes coinciding with the muffled hearing, but not always. That's helpful. Does anything specific seem to trigger either the hearing changes or the dizziness?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's a tricky one. I haven't really noticed anything that always sets it off. I mean, I've tried to think, you know? Loud noises don't seem to do it. Stress, maybe? But I'm always a little bit stressed these days, so it’s hard to tell. It just… happens. Randomly, it feels like. I haven't changed anything in my life recently, no new medications or anything like that. I just wake up one day and… there it is. I really wish I knew what caused it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It sounds like it's quite unpredictable. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history, then. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. And my knees are a bit bad, arthritis, the doctor said. But nothing… serious, not recently. I see my regular doctor for check-ups, but everything has always been… okay. I've never had anything like this hearing thing before. And my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I probably forget half of what he tells me anyway. Medicare covers everything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and arthritis. And regular check-ups with your doctor. That’s good to know. Do you take any medications regularly for those conditions, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just these, really. For my knees. They’re called… uh… Celecoxib, that’s it. One twice a day. And sometimes I take a little something for when the knees are really bad, but that's just when I need it. Nothing else, I promise. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Celecoxib twice a day for the arthritis. And a pain reliever as needed. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. I've never had trouble with bee stings or anything like that. My daughter always asks me if I'm allergic to anything before she cooks for me, but I always tell her, “No, dear, I’m fine.” I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But then again, my memory… you know. It’s hard to be certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, final question for the history part. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. That's what my daughter was on about, wasn’t it? Let me see… my mother, she had problems with her balance when she got older. Similar to this, I think, but worse. And my brother, he had some trouble with his hearing later in life, too. The doctor told him it was… something to do with the ear. Meniere's disease, I think it was called? Something like that. It made him very dizzy. It's a bit of a blur now, to be honest. It was a long time ago. And my father… he had high blood pressure, but that's about it. I wish I could remember more details. My daughter keeps telling me I need to write all this down.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. History of balance problems in your mother and hearing issues potentially related to Meniere's disease in your brother. That definitely gives us some things to consider. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your ears, and do a few simple balance tests. Will that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Anything to figure out what’s going on. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to doctors, you know. But I'm trying to be brave. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Terasa. I’ll be gentle. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Everything sounds good there. Now, let's take a look at your ears. Your ears look clear. Now, I'm going to do a few simple balance tests. I'll have you stand with your feet together, close your eyes, and see if you can maintain your balance. Okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Close my eyes, you say? That sounds… tricky. I’m not very good at balancing, you know. But I'll try. Just promise you'll hold onto me if I fall. Here goes nothing…
DOCTOR: Okay, Terasa, that’s good. Just try to stand as still as you can. I’m right here. Okay, you can open your eyes now. That’s good. You were a little unsteady, but you didn't fall. That’s perfectly alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for a few steps. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear… walking a straight line? That’s… not my forte, Doctor. I always stumble about a bit. But I’ll try my best. Oops. See? I told you I was clumsy. I think I need a chair.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Terasa. No worries at all. It’s good you’re being careful. It’s what I’m here for. Based on the exam, and the history you’ve given me, it seems like you’re experiencing some inner ear issues affecting your balance. The positive Romberg’s test and mild ataxia suggest a problem with your vestibular system. Given your family history of balance problems and potential Meniere’s disease, that is a possibility. However, it’s important to rule out other causes. I’d like to order a few tests, if you’re agreeable. An audiogram to assess your hearing, and a vestibular function test to evaluate your balance system more thoroughly. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests? More tests? Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? My daughter will be pleased I'm getting it checked out properly, she’s been telling me for ages. So yes, alright. Do whatever you think is best. An audiogram and a… vestibular function test? What does that involve, exactly? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: That’s good, Terasa. It's best to get a clearer picture. The audiogram is a simple hearing test – you’ll just wear headphones and listen for sounds. It doesn't involve anything painful at all. The vestibular function test is a little more involved, but still not painful. We'll assess how your eyes move while you focus on a target, and then we'll have you lie down and gently turn your head from side to side. It's to see how your inner ear responds to movement. It may cause some dizziness, but it should be mild and temporary. We'll have a nurse monitor you closely throughout the test. I’ll write you a referral for both tests. They can schedule you at the clinic, and the results will be sent back to me. Once I have those results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding driving or operating heavy machinery if you're experiencing significant dizziness. Do you have any questions about the tests, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… a bit complicated, but alright. No driving, you say? That's probably wise, I suppose. I don't drive very much anyway. My daughter does most of the driving. Um… no, I think that's everything for now. Just the tests, and no driving. And I'll let my daughter know. She'll be glad I'm finally getting it sorted out. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I think I'll just go and sit down for a bit. All this talking has tired me out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your tests. And please, take it easy. It was nice meeting you. I’ll see you when the test results come in.
