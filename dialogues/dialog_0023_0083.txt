DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Kammer is the name. Yes. Well, it’s… a little thing. Not a real problem, you understand. Just… I was hoping you could write me one of those cards. A “Get Well” card, or maybe one with some… encouragement. You know? My daughter, she thinks I need… cheering up. It’s silly, really. But she’s insistent.
DOCTOR: A card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a card. Like you give people when they’re sick. Or… feeling down. It’s not that I feel sick, Doctor. I’m perfectly fine. Just… a little lonely, I suppose. My daughter, she worries too much. She says I need a note from you to make it official. A doctor’s note for… spirits. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, my purpose here is to address medical concerns. While I appreciate your daughter's concern, providing a note simply to validate… emotional well-being isn’t within the scope of a standard medical practice. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms that are contributing to these feelings?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? No, no. Nothing like that. I told you, I’m fine. Perfectly fine. It’s just… well, my wife, she left, you see. A few years back now. And the daughter… she means well. But she treats me like I’m… fragile. A little note from a doctor, she thinks that’ll fix everything. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. But she’s paying for the visit, so…
DOCTOR: I understand your daughter is concerned and is footing the bill for this visit, Mr. Kammer. However, a medical evaluation requires a legitimate health concern to address. While grief is certainly a challenging experience, and I acknowledge your loss, simply stating you’re “lonely” doesn’t warrant a medical note. Have you considered speaking with a therapist or grief counselor?
PATIENT: Therapist? Grief counselor? Doctor, with all respect, what good would that do? I’ve lived a long life. I've seen things. I built things, I fixed things. Talking about feelings… that’s not going to bring my wife back, is it? I just thought… a little note. A simple “Get Well Soon” or “Hang in There” from a professional. It’s not hurting anyone. And it would make my daughter happy. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I’m a physician, not a… dispenser of emotional reassurance. Utilizing medical resources for non-medical purposes is… inappropriate. I can certainly document your stated feelings of loneliness during this visit, but I will not fabricate a medical justification for a “Get Well” card. Now, are you experiencing any changes in your appetite, sleep patterns, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, it comes and goes. Sometimes I eat like a horse, sometimes I don’t eat at all. Sleep… I sleep alright, I guess. I wake up a lot, thinking. And energy… I get tired easier now. I used to be able to work all day, building things. Now… now I mostly sit. It’s just… old age, I suppose. But a card wouldn’t hurt, would it? Just a small one. To show my daughter I’m… trying.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, you're describing symptoms – fluctuating appetite, disrupted sleep, and fatigue – that could indicate underlying issues, such as depression or anxiety, secondary to your grief. While I still maintain that a “Get Well” card is not a medically appropriate request, I can document these symptoms and recommend a brief screening for mood disorders. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A screening? What does that mean? More tests? I don’t like tests. I just want a card. Look, Doctor, my daughter is a good girl, but she worries too much. She thinks a note from you will solve everything. She’s got it in her head. I don’t want to waste your time with tests and screenings. Just… a card. A small card. Is that really so difficult?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your reluctance. However, dismissing these symptoms as simply “worrying” could be detrimental to your overall well-being. A brief screening – a few simple questions – can help determine if further evaluation is necessary. It’s not about “solving” anything with a card; it’s about ensuring you’re receiving appropriate care. I will document your current state, but I will not be providing a note for a "Get Well" card. Are you willing to answer a few questions about your mood and energy levels?
PATIENT: Fine. Ask your questions. But don’t expect me to tell you anything you don't already know. I'm a lonely old man. That's it. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with this brief questionnaire. It’s a standard screening tool. Over the past two weeks, have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Hopeless… sometimes. Especially at night. It’s quiet then. Too quiet. Reminds me… never mind. Yes. I’ve felt… down. More than usual, I suppose. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… everything feels… gray.
DOCTOR: And have you experienced a loss of interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Used to enjoy… I used to build things. Boats, mostly. Small ones. But… I haven’t touched a tool in years. Can't seem to get motivated. It's just… sitting feels easier. Less… effort. So, yes. I guess I’ve lost interest in things. Everything feels… pointless now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, based on your responses, it appears you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with mild depression. I recommend a referral to a mental health specialist for a more comprehensive evaluation and potential treatment. We can also discuss some lifestyle modifications, such as increasing social activity and exploring new hobbies. Would you be open to these suggestions?
PATIENT: Hobbies? Social activity? Doctor, I’m an old man. I don’t do hobbies. And I don’t have a social life. I have my daughter, and she worries too much. Look, I appreciate you listening to me, but I don’t need a specialist. I just wanted a card. A simple card. Is that really too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, continuing to dismiss your emotional well-being as simply "loneliness" is not a sustainable solution. I understand your reluctance, but denying these feelings will only exacerbate the issue. I am recommending a referral to a mental health specialist, not because I believe you're "broken," but because they are equipped to provide the support and guidance you deserve. I will document your current symptoms and will offer a prescription for a mild sleep aid to address the disrupted sleep you've described. However, I will not be providing a note for a “Get Well” card. I believe focusing on addressing the underlying issues, rather than seeking a symbolic reassurance, is the most appropriate course of action. Do you understand?
PATIENT: …Fine. Do what you think is best. Specialist… whatever. Just… don’t expect miracles. And I still think a card would have been easier. But… alright. Specialist.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will prepare a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly-regarded psychiatrist in the area. She specializes in geriatric mental health and has a compassionate approach. I'll also write a prescription for Trazodone, 50mg, to be taken as needed for sleep. Here is the referral information and a pamphlet about managing grief and depression. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss your progress and address any concerns. Do you have any questions about the medication or the referral process?
PATIENT: Trazodone… sleep aid. Alright. No, I don't think so. No questions. Just… thank you, Doctor. I guess. And… maybe tell my daughter I said hello? And that I’m… trying. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I will be sure to relay your message to your daughter. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Take care of yourself, and I wish you all the best. .
PATIENT: …You too, Doctor. Thank you. .
