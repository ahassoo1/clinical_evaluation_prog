DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Espinueva, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side again, mostly. And… well, I seem to be getting a lot of water infections lately. It's been happening quite a bit, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, side pain and frequent urinary infections. Let’s start with the side pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… well, it’s usually on my right side, a bit towards my back. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, but it's been happening more often these last few months. Sometimes it’s just a little niggle, other times it’s… quite uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache, right side, more frequent in the last few months. Does anything specific make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don't think anything specifically makes it worse, not that I've noticed, anyway. Drinking plenty of water seems to help a little, but honestly, it just feels random. And nothing really makes it better quickly, it just… fades on its own, eventually.
DOCTOR: Alright, fades on its own. And you mentioned frequent water infections – how often would you say you're getting those?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I’d say maybe once every month or six weeks, on average. It’s… it's become a bit of a worry, to be honest. I keep thinking it’s something I’m doing wrong, but I try to drink plenty, as I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly once a month or six weeks. That is frequent. Do you notice any symptoms with these infections – like burning when you pee, or needing to go all the time, or pain in your lower abdomen?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, you're right on the mark. Definitely burning when I go to the toilet. And I have to go very often, even if there's not much there. Sometimes a little ache in my lower stomach too, but the burning is the worst of it. It makes it… unpleasant, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination, frequency, and some lower abdominal discomfort. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was diagnosed with… polycystic kidney disease a few years back now. That's what the specialist told me, anyway. I don't know too much about it, if I’m honest. They told me it runs in the family, and to keep an eye on things. I’ve seen a specialist about it before, but it was some time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, polycystic kidney disease. That's important to know. And have you had any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't had any surgeries or been in hospital for anything. Thankfully, nothing like that. Just the usual check-ups with my regular doctor, and the appointment with the specialist about the kidneys, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospital stays. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had problems with her kidneys, that's how we found out about the polycystic kidney disease. She didn’t get a proper diagnosis until quite late in life, though. My brother has it as well, so it definitely runs in the family. Other than that, nothing that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of polycystic kidney disease. And just to get a complete picture, do you have any allergies to medications, or any current medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. And I don't take any regular medication at the moment. Sometimes a painkiller for a headache, but that's it. Nothing prescribed, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, no regular medications. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your abdomen, and check for any tenderness. Could you lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That’s no trouble at all.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just feeling around and listening. Do you feel any pain when I press here, on your right side?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's a bit tender, actually. Not terribly painful, but… a bit uncomfortable. It’s right about… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the right side. I'm also hearing some slightly diminished bowel sounds in that area. Now, given your history of polycystic kidney disease, the frequent UTIs, and the tenderness on your right side, I'm concerned about a possible kidney infection. It's also possible this could be related to your PKD. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a urine analysis and a blood test to check your kidney function and look for signs of infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Whatever you think is best. A urine analysis and blood test… yes, that sounds perfectly alright to me. I just want to know what’s going on, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll get the lab order sent over right away. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. In the meantime, I'd like to recommend you drink plenty of fluids – water is best. Avoid caffeine and alcohol. And if you develop a fever, or if the pain gets significantly worse, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. We'll get the results back as soon as possible, usually within a day or two, and we can discuss them then. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Drinking plenty of water, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and watch out for fever… yes, I understand. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Thank you very much for your time and attention. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. The nurse will be with you shortly. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
