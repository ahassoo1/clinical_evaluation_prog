DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mastrantonio. So, you’re here today… tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Batara. Well, for the past few weeks, I've been experiencing a… a popping or clicking sensation in my back. It’s not constant, but it happens frequently enough that it’s become a bit concerning. It doesn’t seem to be painful, exactly, more… noticeable. And sometimes a little unsettling.
DOCTOR: Popping and clicking, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It seems to occur mostly when I’m moving, like when I’m bending over or twisting. I work with transportation equipment – electrical systems mostly – so there’s a fair amount of reaching and bending involved in my day. I hadn’t thought much of it at first, figured it was just getting older, but it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: “Getting older,” right. And how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began, I'd say, around the middle of June. So, roughly six to seven weeks now. At first, it was just occasionally, maybe once or twice a week. But it’s become almost daily in the last couple of weeks. I haven't noticed anything that makes it worse specifically, just… present. Is that helpful? I apologize if I’m being vague.
DOCTOR: “Present.” Vague is… common. Have you experienced any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. As I said before, it’s not painful. It’s more of a sensation, a feeling of something… shifting, perhaps? It doesn’t radiate or anything, it’s localized right in the middle of my back, upper lumbar region I believe. And it doesn't stop me from doing anything, I just… notice it. It's just worrying me a bit, to be honest. I don't want it to become something serious.
DOCTOR: Right. Upper lumbar, you say. And you’re actively working. Any history of injuries to your back?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I recall. I've always been quite careful with my back at work. We have a lot of safety protocols in place, and I always make sure to lift properly. I've had the usual muscle strains here and there, but nothing serious enough to require a visit to a doctor, or any sort of physiotherapy. I’ve always been… quite resilient, I suppose. My wife might disagree, but that’s beside the point.
DOCTOR: Resilient. Alright. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’m generally quite healthy, I believe. I have private insurance, and I make sure to go for my annual check-ups. My blood pressure is usually good, cholesterol is within range, and I don't have any allergies. My wife does worry about me working too hard, but she's always been that way. I haven't had any surgeries or been hospitalized in… well, decades. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I apologize if I'm rambling again.
DOCTOR: No, you're… efficient. Alright. Let’s have you lie down on the examination table. I’ll just take a quick look, and we’ll see what's going on.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Thank you. I'll lie face down, if that's alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, face down is fine. And please, just relax. Hmm… tenderness is… minimal. I’m not detecting any muscle spasms. Range of motion…appears normal. Do you feel any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn't hurt at all. Just the usual sensation, the popping, perhaps a little more pronounced now that you're pressing there, but no actual pain. It's…difficult to describe. It’s more of a feeling of something moving inside, not an ache or sharp discomfort. Is that making sense? I apologize if I'm not being very clear.
DOCTOR: “Something moving.” Right. It’s likely just… minor joint dysfunction. Very common, especially with your line of work. Honestly, it sounds like you’re worrying about nothing. We can do some imaging if you insist, but it's unlikely to show anything significant.
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Well, if you genuinely believe imaging isn’t necessary, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. I wouldn’t want to put you to any unnecessary trouble, or incur any costs if it’s truly not needed. If it's a minor joint dysfunction as you say, and it's not causing any real harm, then I’m happy to just… monitor it and see how it goes. Perhaps some stretching exercises would be helpful? Do you have any recommendations?
DOCTOR: Stretching. Fine. There are plenty of resources online for lower back stretches. Here. This is a basic routine. Do this daily, and if it doesn't improve after a month… then, and only then, we'll consider imaging. Don't overdo it. And try not to worry so much. Next patient.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Batara. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me and offer your advice. I will certainly follow the routine and monitor my progress. And I will try not to worry, as you suggest. Have a good day, Doctor.
