DOCTOR: Hello, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin. It’s been looking rather… off, lately. Not a good off, you understand. More of a… mottled off. I noticed it about a month ago, I’d say. It’s just… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, “mottled off” is a good way to describe it. And you’ve noticed this for about a month now. Can you tell me a little more about where on your skin you're seeing this, and what it looks like exactly?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly on my arms, and a bit on my chest. It’s… patches, really. Not raised, thankfully. Just… different colors. Like someone took a paintbrush to me with shades of… peach and sort of a brownish-grey. It’s not a rash, it doesn’t feel like anything, it just… looks dreadful. And it’s spreading, I think. Slowly, but definitely spreading. It's very distracting when I'm cataloging, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, patches of differing colors – peach and brownish-grey – on your arms and chest, not raised, and you feel it’s spreading over the past month. You mentioned cataloging – is that your profession?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm an archivist. At the historical society, downtown. Very important work, really. Preserving the past, you know? It requires a great deal of… precision. Which is difficult when one is preoccupied with unsightly skin discolorations. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s stress related. All those fragile documents... and people not properly handling them. It’s enough to give anyone a complex, let alone change the color of their skin.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you’re an archivist, and you suspect stress may be a factor. Let's get a bit more detail. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the skin changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… no, not really. I haven't felt ill, no fever or aches. I’m a bit… tired, perhaps. But honestly, who isn’t tired these days? And my husband keeps telling me I’m always complaining about being tired. He doesn't understand the demands of meticulous record-keeping, naturally. I haven’t noticed any itching, or pain, or anything like that. Just… the patches. And the spreading. It’s rather upsetting, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms like fever, aches, itching, or pain, just the skin changes and tiredness. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. And I broke my wrist once, skiing. But nothing serious. No chronic illnesses, no major surgeries. I’ve always been rather… robust, actually. My mother always said I had a good constitution. She was Ukrainian, you know. Very strong people, Ukrainians. I do have… well, I have some mild arthritis in my hands, but it’s nothing debilitating. Mostly just stiff in the mornings. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it a few years back. Other than that… I’m quite healthy, really. It’s probably just stress. It has to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, broken wrist, mild arthritis in your hands, and a vitamin D supplement. No other major medical issues. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none whatsoever. I eat everything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. My husband is the one with allergies, constantly sneezing and wheezing. He's allergic to dust mites, pollen, cats... the list goes on. But me? I’m perfectly fine. I suspect it’s because I spend so much time indoors, surrounded by old documents. Very clean environment, you know. No allergens to speak of. It’s a very sensible life, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. And you're currently taking just the vitamin D supplement. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any skin conditions or other medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Well, my mother had… she had some sort of… rash, when she was younger. Not like this, mind you. It was more… scaly. She went to a dermatologist, and they gave her some cream. Seemed to clear it up. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And his brother had something with his heart. But nothing that I’m particularly concerned about. We’re not really a family prone to… ailments, you know? It’s mostly just… sensible people, living sensible lives. Though my aunt did have a rather unfortunate incident with poison ivy, but that hardly counts. It was entirely her own fault, wandering around in the woods like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of a scaly rash in your mother, high blood pressure in your father, and a heart condition in an uncle. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Absolutely not. I find the very idea… distasteful. My husband has a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s the extent of it. We lead a very quiet life, you understand? We don’t go to parties, we don’t socialize much. We prefer to read, and listen to classical music. And, of course, I spend most of my time at the historical society. Very respectable pursuits, you see. No unhealthy habits whatsoever. It’s all quite… orderly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Very orderly lifestyle. Okay, Ms. Bartock, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. I'll need to take a look at the skin on your arms and chest. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Though I do hope it isn’t anything serious. I have a rather important cataloging project due next month, and I simply must be up to the task. All those fragile documents… it would be dreadful to fall behind. And really, I suspect it’s just stress. Though you are, of course, the expert. Just… be gentle, please. My skin is rather delicate.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be as gentle as possible. I'm noting some areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation on your arms and chest, as you described. The patches are irregularly shaped, and the borders aren’t sharply defined. There's no noticeable scaling, redness, or warmth to the skin. Palpation is normal - no raised areas or induration. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Okay, Ms. Bartock, based on the physical exam, the skin changes don’t appear to be caused by an infection or inflammation. However, it is difficult to determine the exact cause without further investigation. I suspect this could be a pigmentary condition like pityriasis alba or even tinea versicolor, though the lack of scaling makes that less likely. To rule out other possibilities and get a definitive diagnosis, I'd like to order a skin scraping to check for fungal infection and potentially a skin biopsy, if the scraping is negative. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A skin scraping? And a biopsy? Goodness. That sounds rather… invasive. Are you certain it’s necessary? I mean, couldn’t it just be stress? I’ve been feeling rather overwhelmed at work, you know. All those fragile documents… and the responsibility! Perhaps some time off, a nice long vacation… wouldn't that be a simpler solution? I really don’t want to undergo any… procedures if it can be avoided. And what if it's something… unpleasant? I've heard stories… really, I think a second opinion might be prudent before resorting to such drastic measures. It just seems a bit much, don’t you think? For a few patches of discoloration?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Bartock. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about undergoing unnecessary procedures. A skin scraping is a very minor procedure – we gently collect a small sample of skin cells to examine under a microscope. It’s not painful, and rarely leaves any lasting mark. A biopsy is a bit more involved, but also relatively quick and usually well-tolerated with local anesthesia. However, I agree that we can explore other options first. Given your strong suspicion of stress, and the fact that you have no other symptoms, we could try a course of topical corticosteroids to see if the discoloration improves. We'd start with a mild strength cream and monitor your skin for any changes. If that doesn’t show improvement within a few weeks, or if the discoloration worsens, then we can revisit the possibility of a skin scraping and biopsy. Would you be comfortable trying the topical corticosteroids first?
PATIENT: Topical… corticosteroids. That sounds… better. Less invasive, certainly. And if it’s simply stress, then perhaps that will be enough to clear it up. Yes, I think I would be comfortable trying that. Though, if it doesn't work, I’m still rather hesitant about the scraping and biopsy. Perhaps a referral to a dermatologist then? Someone specializing in skin conditions? I just feel more comfortable getting a second opinion from an expert before undergoing anything… drastic. Really, I just want this to go away. It’s distracting, and it’s affecting my work. And, frankly, it’s rather unsightly. But the corticosteroids sound like a reasonable starting point. So yes, let’s try that. What strength cream are we talking about? And how long should I use it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock, we will start with a mild potency topical corticosteroid – hydrocortisone 1% cream. You'll apply a thin layer to the affected areas on your arms and chest twice daily for two weeks. It’s important to only apply it to the discolored patches, and avoid using it on your face or in skin folds. After two weeks, if you don’t see any improvement, or if the discoloration worsens, we can discuss a referral to a dermatologist. And of course, if you develop any side effects, such as redness, itching, or burning, stop using the cream immediately and contact me. I’ll also write a note for your employer explaining the situation, so they are aware you are being treated for a skin condition. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… quite acceptable. A note for my employer is thoughtful, actually. They can be rather… particular about appearances. And I will be very careful to only apply it to the affected areas, and for the prescribed time. Hydrocortisone 1%, twice daily for two weeks. I’ll make a note of that. Really, I appreciate you being so understanding, Doctor. It’s reassuring to know you’re taking my concerns seriously. Perhaps this will be all it takes. A little bit of cream, and a bit of rest… and I’ll be back to cataloging in no time. Are there any other precautions I should take? Any foods I should avoid? Any activities I should refrain from? I just want to be sure I’m doing everything right.
DOCTOR: No, there are no specific dietary restrictions or activities you need to avoid while using the hydrocortisone cream. Just continue your normal routine, and avoid excessive sun exposure to the treated areas. Sunscreen is always a good idea, even on cloudy days. I'll write you a prescription for the cream, and I’ll also provide you with some written instructions outlining how to apply it and what to watch out for. I’d like to see you back in two weeks to assess your progress. If you don’t see any improvement by then, or if you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and you've addressed all of my concerns. I’ll follow your instructions carefully, and I’ll see you in two weeks. Hopefully, the cream will do the trick. I really do appreciate your patience and understanding. It's a relief to have a plan. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bartock. I hope the cream works for you as well. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
