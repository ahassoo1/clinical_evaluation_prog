DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have time for this, but my…ex-husband keeps hinting. He thinks it would be “nice”. I want to make sure, you know, if I decided to…try again, that everything works. I don’t want any unpleasant surprises. I’m 51, not 21.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s always prudent to ensure good health, regardless of…life choices. So, to be clear, you’re concerned about your overall health and ability to…start a family, is that correct?
PATIENT: “Start a family” is a bit much, don’t you think? I just want to know if my insides are still…functional. And quickly, if possible. I have a bicycle to fix this afternoon. A very expensive one.
DOCTOR: “Functional” is…adequate terminology, I suppose. Alright. Let’s start with a general history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, the usual. A cold here, a bad back from bending over bicycles all day. Nothing serious. I had my gallbladder out…oh, goodness, 20 years ago? And a hysterectomy. That was…before the divorce. Does that matter? It feels relevant. It is relevant, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, a hysterectomy is…quite relevant. And when, approximately, was that performed?
PATIENT: Let me see… 2008, I believe. October. Yes, October 2008. Dr. Ferencz did it. Very good doctor, but retired now. I remember because the weather was dreadful. Constant rain. And it was right after…never mind. Point is, 2008. Does that mean…is it even possible?
DOCTOR: That was…some time ago. A hysterectomy, of course, means you no longer have a uterus. Therefore, becoming pregnant is not possible. However, depending on whether your ovaries were removed during the procedure, you may still be producing hormones. Let's clarify: Do you know if your ovaries were removed during the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Well, obviously I didn’t go in there and watch, did I? I assume they did. Why would you only take part of it? That sounds… inefficient. Everything was quite uncomfortable afterward, if that helps. I just wanted it gone. The whole thing. Honestly, doctors never explain things properly.
DOCTOR: Assuming both ovaries were removed, you are likely experiencing surgical menopause. This affects hormone levels, which can impact…various bodily functions. Now, aside from the potential for hormonal changes, are you experiencing any specific symptoms that are concerning you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. I mean, I get hot flashes sometimes, but that’s from bending over hot metal all day. And I'm… forgetful. But that's always been the case. Honestly, I have a very busy mind. I'm perfectly capable. I don't need a list of ailments. I just want to know if there's a reason I shouldn't…consider it. If it’s even feasible, which, frankly, I doubt.
DOCTOR: “Consider what,” exactly?
PATIENT: Honestly, are we still on this? My ex-husband wants a child. I’m assessing the…practicalities. I thought I explained it already. If it's even remotely possible to…carry a child, given my situation, that's what I want to know. I haven't decided anything! Don't make assumptions. It's…inconvenient to discuss, frankly. And I have a very important repair waiting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, it is…unusual to discuss potential pregnancy after a hysterectomy. It is not possible to carry a child without a uterus. However, there are…assisted reproductive technologies, such as IVF with a surrogate, that could be considered. But before discussing that, let's determine your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I take ibuprofen for my back, occasionally. And I had a reaction to penicillin as a child, but that was decades ago. Honestly, I don't even remember what it felt like. Look, I'm perfectly healthy, for my age. I can lift heavy things, I work with my hands all day, I don’t smoke, I rarely drink. Are we going to talk about the surrogate now, or are you going to ask me about my childhood dietary habits? Because I assure you, it's a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical exam to assess your overall health. It is important to ensure you are physically capable of…the stresses associated with hormone therapy, should you choose to pursue assisted reproductive technologies. Can you stand for me for a moment?
