DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 38 years of age. Welcome to the clinic. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 38. It's… muscle weakness, mostly. It's been getting worse for a few weeks now, and honestly, it’s starting to worry me. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Muscle weakness, you say. And it’s been progressively worsening over several weeks. I see. To help me understand this better, could you be more specific about where you’re experiencing this weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it started in my legs, mostly my thighs. Felt like they were just… heavier than usual, you know? Now it's kinda creeping up into my arms too, but it's not as bad. It’s harder to lift things, even stuff that used to be no problem. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. And you said “creeping up”?
PATIENT: Yeah, like it started really noticeable in my legs, and now when I wake up some mornings, my arms feel… tired. Not necessarily painful, just… weak. It's not constant, though. It comes and goes. It's just… concerning. It feels like it's spreading, is what I mean.
DOCTOR: Intermittent weakness, progressing from thighs to arms… I see. And when you say it comes and goes, can you describe when it’s worse?
PATIENT: Well, it's definitely worse after I've been on my feet for a long time. My job… I'm an auto damage appraiser, so I'm walking around looking at cars all day. It gets really bad by the end of the day. And… sometimes in the mornings, like I said. But not every morning. It's hard to pinpoint, honestly. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: So, exertion exacerbates it, and there's some variability in the morning. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I don't think so. I've been a bit more tired than usual, maybe? But honestly, who isn't tired these days? Nothing else jumps out, no pain, no numbness, no dizziness… just the weakness. I did notice my hands have been shaking a little bit, but I thought that was just from the caffeine, I drink a lot of coffee to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Caffeine intake could certainly contribute to tremors. However, it’s important to consider all possibilities. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing diagnosed. Never really been sick, to be honest. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, measles, but that's about it. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, nothing like that. I haven’t really had much reason to see a doctor before now.
DOCTOR: No prior medical diagnoses or surgeries… That's good to know. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mom had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather on my father's side, he had… something with his nerves, I think? But honestly, I don't know much about it. We weren’t really close. He lived back in Yemen. It was a long time ago. I don't really have a lot of details. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Limited family medical history… Understandable. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, none of the above. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but that's about it. And definitely no drugs. I try to stay pretty healthy, all things considered. I just wish I knew what was causing this weakness. It’s starting to freak me out.
DOCTOR: Very well. And regarding medications?
PATIENT: Just… over-the-counter stuff. Pain relievers for headaches sometimes, that’s about it. Nothing regular. Like I said, I don't take much medication. I try to avoid it if I can. I haven’t even needed anything besides that until recently, when I was thinking about getting something for the weakness, but figured I should see a doctor first.
DOCTOR: No regular medications. Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Now, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination. We’ll start with your reflexes, then assess your muscle strength. Please let me know if anything is painful. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that sounds good. Just… try to be gentle, alright? I'm not a fan of doctors, if you couldn't tell. I’m just hoping you can figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie back on the examination table. First, let’s check your reflexes. 2+ reflexes bilaterally in both knees and ankles. That’s within normal limits. Now, let’s move on to muscle strength. Please resist as I apply pressure. 5/5 strength in bilateral biceps and triceps. Grip strength is also 5/5 bilaterally. Now, leg strength. 4/5 strength in bilateral quadriceps and hamstrings. Some mild weakness noted in both legs. Gait appears slightly unsteady. I also note some mild fasciculations in your calves. Do you notice any twitching in your legs?
PATIENT: Fasciculations? I… I think so, now that you mention it. It’s like… little jumps, sometimes. I just thought it was my nerves or something. It doesn’t hurt, it just… feels weird. So, my legs are weaker and they twitch? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Those findings are… concerning. The weakness, the fasciculations… these could be indicative of several possibilities, ranging from relatively benign to more serious. It's too early to say definitively without further investigation. To rule out some potential causes, I'm going to order some blood work: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, Vitamin D level, and creatine kinase. I will also order an electromyography, or EMG, to assess the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves. This is to ensure we don’t miss anything, and to get a more accurate diagnosis. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an EMG? That sounds… complicated. And scary. What are you thinking it could be, Doctor? Is it… something with my nerves? Like you said something about that. And what if it is serious? Honestly, you’re freaking me out a little bit.
DOCTOR: It's important not to jump to conclusions, Mr. McKinnon. Many conditions can present with similar symptoms. An EMG will help us determine if there’s nerve damage and pinpoint the source of the problem. The blood work will rule out any underlying systemic conditions or vitamin deficiencies. As for your question… possible causes include, but are not limited to, motor neuron disease, neuropathies, myopathies, or even certain electrolyte imbalances. However, I must emphasize—these are possibilities. We need to gather more information before we can arrive at a diagnosis. I understand your anxiety. I am going to schedule you for the blood work today, and the EMG next week. I will review the results as soon as they are available and we will discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and ensuring you maintain adequate hydration. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Motor neuron disease… You said that. That sounds… really bad. I don’t… I don’t want that. No, I think I need to think about all of that. Just… schedule the tests. And… maybe call me if the results come back quickly? I… I just want to know what’s going on. That’s all.
