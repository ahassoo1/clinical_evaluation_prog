DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… about the cancer. It’s been a little while since I saw someone about it, and I wanted to get another check-up. I lost my husband last year, and… things got a bit lost in all that.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. It’s completely understandable that things would get overlooked during such a difficult time. We'll get everything checked up. When were you originally diagnosed with cancer, and what kind was it?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It was… about three years ago, I believe. They said it was… something to do with my blood? I don’t really remember the full name. It was leukemia, I think? Or maybe lymphoma? It was a long time ago, and all the words… they kind of blended together. Sorry, I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Chellsea. Medical terms can be very confusing, and it's perfectly normal to not remember everything. Leukemia and lymphoma are both blood cancers, so that narrows it down. Do you recall what stage it was diagnosed as, or what type of treatment you received?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Stage… I honestly don’t remember the stage. They did a lot of… poking and prodding, and then they started me on… pills. And then I had to go in for… drips, sometimes. It was all very fast. I just… followed what the doctors told me to do at the time. It was before my husband got sick, so… it feels like a different life. I didn't really ask a lot of questions, I guess. I just wanted to get better.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how have you been feeling since treatment ended?
PATIENT: Well… for a long time, I felt okay. Really okay, actually. I was able to do things, you know? Work, spend time with my husband… But then, a few months ago, I started getting… tired again. More tired than usual. And I’ve been bruising really easily. Just little bumps will leave a big mark. And… sometimes I feel a little short of breath, even when I haven't been doing anything. That’s why I thought I should come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, easy bruising, and shortness of breath. That’s good information. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then we can talk about some possible next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I'm a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea. If you could sit up here for me. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your lymph nodes. Let’s begin. First, can you tell me if you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not really. Not any sharp pain, anyway. Sometimes my bones feel a little… achy. Like a really deep tiredness in my bones, if that makes sense? It comes and goes, and it’s not too bad, but I've noticed it more lately. Mostly in my hips and legs.
DOCTOR: Bone aches in your hips and legs… okay. Let’s get your blood pressure and pulse first. Your blood pressure is 118 over 76, which is normal. Your pulse is 88 and regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. That could be related to a number of things, we’ll need to investigate further. Now I'm going to gently feel your lymph nodes. I do feel some mild swelling in your lymph nodes in your neck and armpits. They’re not alarmingly large, but it’s something we need to keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Oh. Swelling… That doesn’t sound good, does it? Is that… is that bad? I haven’t noticed it myself, I don’t think. I haven’t really been paying attention to things like that. It’s all just been a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Is there anything we can… do about it? I mean, about the swelling?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re here, Chellsea. The swelling isn’t necessarily bad, but it does warrant further investigation. It could be a number of things, and we need to rule out anything serious. We’ll do some blood work to get a better picture of what’s going on. We'll be checking your complete blood count, liver and kidney function, and some markers that can help us understand if your previous cancer is active again, or if there's something new going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work is good. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. When will I get the results? And… will it hurt? I don’t do well with needles. It’s silly, I know, but I always get really lightheaded.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, many people feel anxious about needles. The blood draw itself will be a quick pinch, and we’ll have you lie down for a few minutes afterward to make sure you’re feeling okay. We usually get the results back within a few days, but it can sometimes take a little longer depending on the lab. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you start feeling any new or worsening symptoms – like fever, severe fatigue, or unexplained bleeding – please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I’m just… a little worried, but I appreciate you taking the time to listen. And thank you for being so kind. It’s been a long time since I felt… listened to. Could the nurse just… tell me where to go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. I'm glad I could help. The nurse’s station is right outside the door, and they’ll be happy to direct you to the lab. They're very efficient, and will take good care of you. Here’s a requisition form for the lab technician. Please just bring this with you. And remember, if you feel lightheaded at any point, let them know immediately. Don’t hesitate to ask for help. We’ll be in touch soon. It was nice meeting you, Chellsea.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again. I think I’ll just go find the nurse now.
