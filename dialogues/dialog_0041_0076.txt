DOCTOR: Hi Clarke, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. My shins, mostly. They’re… painful. Red, you know? Been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, painful, red bumps on your shins. And how long have they been bothering you, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… a couple of months now? It started with just one, I think, and now there’s… quite a few. Not all at once, though. They come and go, kinda.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple of months, starting with one and gradually more appearing. They flare up and subside, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. They don't all hurt at the same time. Sometimes one will be really sore, then it calms down, and another one starts acting up. It’s kinda annoying, to be honest. Especially when I'm working.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they're intermittent, flaring up and calming down. And it bothers you particularly when you're working… what kind of work do you do, Clarke?
PATIENT: Oh, I do… well, I move freight, mostly. Stock and materials, you know? Hand work. Lots of walking and standing. It’s not fancy work, but it pays the bills. And I think… maybe that has something to do with these bumps? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright, freight work, lots of walking and standing. That’s helpful to know. It could be related. Let's take a look at these bumps, if that’s alright with you. I'll need to examine your legs. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead, Doctor. Be careful, they’re a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm seeing some reddish, slightly raised areas on your shins, varying in size. They do seem tender to the touch. No warmth or swelling beyond the bumps themselves, and no broken skin at this time. Do you notice anything that specifically triggers them?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggers? Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes after a long shift, they're worse. But I always thought that was just from being on my feet all day. And… maybe if I bump them against something? But honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at remembering. It could be anything.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Clarke, it's perfectly fine. It can be difficult to pinpoint triggers. Given what you've described—the location, the intermittent nature, and association with physical activity—it could be shin splints, or more accurately, chronic exertional compartment syndrome, or possibly even stasis dermatitis given your age. But we should rule out other possibilities. Do you have any history of diabetes, or problems with circulation in your legs?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, not that I know of. The doctor always checks when I go for my yearly check-up, and he hasn't said anything. And circulation… well, sometimes my feet get a little cold, but I always thought that was just because I’m old. No big problems, though. Nothing that’s ever needed treatment. I have Medicare, so they check things pretty regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known diabetes, no significant circulation issues. And regular check-ups with Medicare, that’s good. Let's just quickly go over your medications, if you have any, and any allergies you might have. Then, I think we should do a quick exam of your feet to check the pulses and sensation. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Medications… just a little something for my blood pressure, that's all. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And allergies… not really. I get a little itchy sometimes with certain soaps, but that's about it. No serious allergies, no. You can check my feet, Doctor. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for blood pressure, no serious allergies. Good to know. Pulses are present, though a little diminished in the right foot compared to the left. Sensation is generally intact, but slightly reduced in the toes of both feet. No obvious signs of ulceration or infection. This suggests some mild peripheral artery disease, but it’s not severe. Given everything, I think we should start with a conservative approach. I'm going to recommend some compression socks to improve circulation, elevate your legs when possible, and avoid prolonged standing when you can. We can also try some topical steroid cream to help with the inflammation. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Compression socks, elevate my legs… I can try that. Topical cream… that doesn’t sound bad either. Is that something I can get at the drugstore? And how long should I try this before I see you again? I don't want to bother you if it doesn't help, Doctor. I know you’re busy.
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Clarke. Yes, you can get a mild hydrocortisone cream—1%—over the counter at most drugstores. Use it twice a day on the affected areas for two weeks. If you don't see any improvement after two weeks, or if the bumps worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. We might need to consider further testing—like a vascular ultrasound—to rule out other possibilities. And don’t hesitate to come in sooner if you experience any pain, redness, or swelling that’s significantly worse. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Compression socks, cream for two weeks, then come back if it doesn't get better. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to look at these legs of mine. They've been bothering me for a while now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Clarke. I'm glad I could help. Just remember to elevate your legs whenever you can, and try to avoid prolonged standing if possible. And please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I'll make a note in your chart about our conversation today. Have a good day, and take care of yourself. .
