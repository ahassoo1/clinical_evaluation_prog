DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. My name is Dr. Mutnick. I see you’re here today. Perhaps you could tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, yes. My… how you say… the place for old people? My husband and I, we are thinking maybe it is time. They need… a paper from the doctor, yes? To say I am okay to go there. My son, he found the place. It is nice, he says.
DOCTOR: A “paper,” yes. A medical assessment, to determine your suitability for assisted living. And your son prompted this visit, I understand?
PATIENT: Yes, my son, Carlos. He worries too much, maybe. But he is good boy. He says I… sometimes forget things. Not big things, you understand? Like… where I put my glasses. Or what I eat for breakfast. Small things. He think… the place can help with that.
DOCTOR: Right. Memory concerns. And how long has Carlos observed these… instances of forgetfulness, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: Oh… maybe six months? A little longer, maybe. It comes and goes, you see. Some days I am very good, remember everything. Other days… not so good. It is not every day, Doctor. I still cook, I still clean. I just… sometimes need a little help remembering. My husband, he helps too, of course.
DOCTOR: I see. And are there any other changes you've noticed, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… I get tired easier, maybe. Not sick tired, just… worn out. Like after I weed the garden, I need to sit for a long time. And… sometimes I feel a little sad. Not all the time, but… just a little bit down. It is hard to explain. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Fatigue and… emotional fluctuations. Not uncommon at your age, Ms. Abdollahi. Now, let’s run through some basic questions to get a clearer picture. Have you experienced any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No, not really. Maybe a little, but I think my clothes just… shrink in the wash! No, I eat good. My husband, he makes sure of that. Lots of rice and beans, and chicken. I like to cook, you see, so I always eat good food.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any difficulties with sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Sometimes. I wake up in the middle of the night. Not every night, but… sometimes. I think about things. Old things. My mother, my children when they were little. It is not a bad thing, just… my mind wakes up. Then I get a glass of water and go back to sleep. Usually. Sometimes I take a little… how you say… a pill. Just a little one, to help me sleep. But not every night.
DOCTOR: A sleep aid. And what is the name of this… “little pill,” Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: Oh… Carlos, he gets it for me. It is… a small white pill. I don’t remember the name. He says it is okay, safe. He checks everything. I just know it helps me sleep when I can’t. It is not every night, Doctor. Really. I don’t want to take pills if I don’t need them.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I will check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we'll do a few simple cognitive tests. It will only take a few moments. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. I will sit. Is it going to… hurt?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Abdollahi, it will not hurt. Just standard procedures. First, let me check your blood pressure. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not concerning. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing is clear, heart sounds normal. All within acceptable parameters. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions to assess your memory. Can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: Hmm… The date… let me think. Is it still July? No… Carlos said… Oh! It is August the… the second? Yes, August the second, 2025. I think. Is that right?
DOCTOR: August 2nd, 2025, correct. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? You want me to… say three words? What words? You didn’t tell me the words.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Abdollahi. I will state the words. Please listen carefully, and repeat them back to me after I finish. The words are… apple, table, penny. Now, repeat them for me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. I think I remember. Is that right? Am I doing it good?
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple calculations. Can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Count backwards… by sevens? That sounds… hard. I am not good at math. I never was. I don’t think I can do that, Doctor. I am sorry.
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on this brief assessment, and considering your son’s concerns, it appears further evaluation is warranted. I recommend a comprehensive neurological workup, including an MRI of the brain to rule out any underlying structural issues. I will also order blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and thyroid abnormalities. I’m referring you to Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist at St. Jude’s Hospital. I will have my secretary schedule an appointment for you. In the meantime, I advise against any major life changes until we have a definitive diagnosis.
PATIENT: Oh… An MRI? And blood tests? And… a different doctor? This is a lot, Doctor. Is something… bad wrong? I just wanted a paper for the old people’s place. I don’t want too many tests. Can’t you just… write the paper?
