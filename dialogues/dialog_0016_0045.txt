DOCTOR: Hi Enrique, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... I keep getting… red. My face, mostly. It just… flushes. It happens sometimes, not all the time. It’s a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds frustrating and a bit worrying when something like that happens unexpectedly. “Flushing,” you said – can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That's a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Not when I’m working, not usually. Sometimes after I eat… spicy food, maybe? And… once, I was talking to a friend, just a normal chat, and it happened then. Not when I’m upset, though. I don't think so. It just… comes and goes. It doesn’t hurt or anything, just… warm. And red.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn't seem directly linked to exertion or strong emotions, and spicy food can be a trigger for some people. It sounds like it's fairly unpredictable, which can be unsettling. Does it happen at a specific time of day, or is it completely random?
PATIENT: Random, I think. Yes, completely random. Could be morning, could be evening. Doesn’t seem to matter. And it doesn't last long, maybe five, ten minutes? Then it goes away. It’s just… I worry something is wrong. I haven't had this happen before, not like this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially since it’s new for you. Five to ten minutes is relatively brief, which is good. And the fact that it resolves on its own is also reassuring. Before we go further, just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any other symptoms when your face flushes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think... Sometimes, my heart feels a little fast, maybe. But I’m not sure if that’s just me being a little nervous. And… once, my hands felt a little shaky, but that was also when I was talking to my friend. It’s hard to say if they’re connected, or if I was just… excited. No sweating, no dizziness, nothing like that. Just the red face, sometimes a fast heart, and maybe shaky hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A racing heart and shaky hands could be associated with the flushing, or they could be separate. Since you mention it happens even during a normal conversation, let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… the usual things when I was a boy. Chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time, to be honest. I mostly stay healthy. I eat good food, I walk a bit… I’m not a big drinker, don’t smoke. My wife… she always took care of the doctor’s appointments. It’s been two years since she passed, and I… well, I haven't been as good at keeping up with things.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Enrique. It's completely understandable that things have slipped a bit. It takes time to adjust to such a loss. And it’s great that you generally stay healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital. My wife… she had her gallbladder out, years ago, but that was it. I've always been lucky, I guess. Just… this flushing thing is worrying me. It feels… strange. I don't like feeling like something is wrong, even if it's not serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No previous surgeries or hospitalizations is helpful. Let’s talk about your family history. Do you know of anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – who has had similar episodes of flushing, or any conditions like high blood pressure, heart problems, or skin conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. Yes, she took pills for it. And my father… he always complained about his heart, but he never went to the doctor. He just… toughed it out. No one else, that I know of, had this flushing thing. My sister… she’s very healthy, always been. And I don’t know much about my grandparents, to be honest. They lived in India. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your mother is worth noting. And it's good to know there's no family history of flushing. Now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. Just… a multivitamin sometimes, but I haven't taken it in a while. I mostly try to get everything I need from my food. I drink a lot of water, though. My wife always said it was good for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know. No current medications or regular supplements. Alright, Enrique, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. It's good to finally get this checked out, even if it's nothing serious. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit back and relax. I'm going to start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. We’ll need to keep an eye on that. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or anything concerning. Lungs are clear. I don’t see any rashes or any other obvious skin abnormalities. Your skin looks generally healthy. No visible signs of rosacea or anything like that. So, based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, the flushing episodes, along with the slightly elevated blood pressure, could be a few different things. It could be related to something called rosacea, though it doesn't quite fit the typical picture. It could also be a sign of something called vasomotor instability, which sometimes happens with stress or anxiety. And because your blood pressure is a little high, it’s important to rule out any underlying cardiovascular issues.
PATIENT: Vasomotor… what was that? And rosacea? I don't even know what that is. Stress? I don’t feel stressed. I’m retired, I have plenty of time. Anxiety… no, not really. I just want to know what’s going on. Is it serious, Doctor? Do I need… tests? Pills? I don’t want a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and wanting to avoid pills is perfectly reasonable. Let me explain those terms a bit. Rosacea is a common skin condition that causes redness, flushing, and sometimes small bumps on the face. It often comes and goes. Vasomotor instability basically means that your blood vessels are having trouble regulating their temperature, which can cause flushing, sweating, and changes in heart rate. And you're right to ask about tests. I think it would be prudent to run a few. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. We should also check your thyroid levels. Those tests will help rule out some of the more serious possibilities. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s always best to be thorough. The EKG and blood tests will give us a clearer picture. We can discuss the results when they come back. In the meantime, I'd recommend keeping a log of your flushing episodes - when they happen, what you were doing, and any other symptoms you experience. That might help us identify any triggers. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Tests are fine. I’ll try to write down when it happens. It’s hard to remember everything, but I’ll try. What about the log? What should I write down, exactly? And how long will the tests take? I don't want to wait too long for the results. And… will I need a referral? I don't have insurance, you know. It's expensive.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s talk about the log. Just write down the date and time of each episode. Then, note what you were doing immediately before it happened – were you eating, talking, exercising, resting?
PATIENT: Also, note any other symptoms you experienced – did your heart race, were your hands shaky, did you feel warm or cold, did you feel anxious or stressed? And, just a general note of how you were feeling emotionally at the time. Even if you don't think you were stressed, just write down what was going through your mind. As for the tests, they shouldn’t take too long. The blood work will take about fifteen minutes, and the EKG is even faster, maybe five minutes. The lab is right across the hall, and they’ll let me know when the results are ready. Usually, it’s within a few days, but I’ll call you as soon as I have them. And yes, you're right to be concerned about the cost. You don’t need a referral. And I can absolutely work with you on the pricing. We have a cash price option for the lab work, and I'll see if we can get a discount. I understand that not having insurance makes things more difficult, and I’ll do my best to make sure this is affordable for you. Does that sound better?
