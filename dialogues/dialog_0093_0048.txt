DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lason is fine. Well, it’s this… fuzziness, I suppose you’d call it. My wife, Srey, she keeps saying I’m getting… lost in my head. It’s not all the time, thankfully. Just… episodes, like she says. I remember everything just fine after it happens, but during… it’s like a dream, a confusing one. And it worries her, so here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It sounds unsettling for both you and Srey. “Fuzziness” is a good way to describe it. These “episodes,” as you call them… could you tell me a little more about what they feel like when they’re happening?
PATIENT: Feel like? Hmph. Difficult to explain. It’s not pain, not dizziness exactly. More… disconnected. Like I’m watching myself do things, but not being myself, you understand? I’ll be setting tile, perfectly capable, I’ve been doing it for forty years, and then… I might not know where I am for a moment. Or what I was doing. Then it passes. Quickly, usually. But it's enough to make Srey fret. She says I ask the same questions repeatedly, too. Though I don’t recall doing that... often.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Lason. “Disconnected” is a good way to put it. And the brief periods of not knowing where you are or what you were doing… and Srey’s observation about repeating questions… those are important details. To get a clearer picture, let's talk about when these episodes started, and how often they're happening now. Approximately, of course. Have they been gradually increasing in frequency, or did they begin suddenly?
PATIENT: Suddenly, I'd say. Maybe six months ago? It wasn’t a slow build-up. One day I was fine, the next… well, the next I was asking Srey what we were having for dinner twice in the same hour. She was not pleased. And they haven't gotten more frequent, thankfully. Maybe… two or three times a week? Sometimes less. It's hard to say. I don’t feel like I’m forgetting things, you see. It’s just… these moments. And Srey, she exaggerates, always has. Though, I admit, she does worry. A good woman, Srey. But a worrier.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Lason, and it’s good to know they haven't increased in frequency. It's also helpful to understand Srey's concern. Now, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. My hands… they tremble a little now, more than they used to. But I’ve been setting tile for a long time, it’s hard work, naturally my hands would shake a bit. Nothing crippling. And… I suppose I get tired more easily. But I'm 66 years old, Doctor. What do you expect? I used to work all day without a problem. Now, I need a bit of a rest in the afternoon. That's all. Nothing major. No headaches, no dizziness, no… falling or anything like that. And I haven’t changed any medications. Just the usual blood pressure pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, trembling hands and increased fatigue… those are things we should note. And it’s good to know you haven’t experienced headaches, dizziness, or falls. You mentioned blood pressure pills – could you tell me the name of the medication and the dosage?
PATIENT: Lisininopril. Twenty milligrams, once a day. Been on it for… oh, ten years now, maybe more. Doctor Heng prescribed it, he retired last year. Good doctor, Heng. Kept me ticking along nicely. Srey manages the refills, mostly. I just swallow the pills when she tells me to. Not much of a head for remembering numbers, you see. Though I can still tile a bathroom floor perfectly straight. That part of my brain still works, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Lisinopril, 20mg daily. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High blood pressure and… well, arthritis, I suppose. In my knees, mostly. Makes getting up in the morning a bit of a chore. And… oh, back problems, from all the bending and lifting over the years. Nothing serious, the kind you get from hard work. Never been hospitalized for anything, never had any major surgeries. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, Doctor. I'm a pretty healthy man, all things considered. I still walk to the market every day. Srey says I worry too much about the price of fish, but that's neither here nor there.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Arthritis and back problems are common, and it's reassuring to hear you're still active. And no hospitalizations or major surgeries—that’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Significant medical conditions? Hmm. That's a difficult one. My mother… she had something with her memory, towards the end. The doctors called it… dementia, I think. Not Alzheimer's, but something similar. She was in Cambodia, though, so the care wasn't… what it is here. And my father… he had heart trouble, but he smoked like a chimney, so that wasn't a surprise. That's about all I know. My siblings… well, we haven’t seen each other in years. Lost touch after the… troubles. Not much family history to speak of, I'm afraid. Mostly just aches and pains, like me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Lason. Your mother’s dementia and your father’s heart trouble are important details to note. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you currently smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. Disgusting habit. Srey’s brother used to smoke, smelled awful. And I drink… occasionally. A small glass of rice wine with dinner, maybe a few times a week. Nothing excessive. Mostly just to help the food go down. Srey doesn't approve, says it raises my blood pressure. She worries about everything, you see. But I’m a simple man, Doctor. I work hard, I eat good food, and I have a loving wife. That’s all I need. No need for fancy habits.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Occasional rice wine is unlikely to be a significant factor. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have. To medications, foods, or anything else.
PATIENT: Allergies? No, nothing. Never had a reaction to anything in my life. I eat all sorts of things. Cambodian food can be… spicy, you know? If I was allergic to something, I’d know about it. Srey always checks the labels, though. She's very careful. But no, Doctor. No allergies. I'm a pretty simple man, remember? Don’t need many things to bother me. Just a good day's work and a loving wife. Though, I am allergic to laziness. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Mr. Lason, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Physical examination? Oh. Well... I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have to get back and help Srey with the garden. The tomatoes are getting overgrown. And... I don't like doctors poking and prodding too much. But if it will help, I suppose I can endure a few minutes. Just be gentle, please. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly check your neurological function – reflexes and coordination. It shouldn’t take long. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetrical. Coordination appears intact. I ask Mr. Lason to follow my finger with his eyes and perform a simple heel-to-shin test. "Your eye movements are normal, and your coordination appears good. You did very well on the heel-to-shin test. No obvious deficits detected." Okay, Mr. Lason, that's all for the physical exam. Everything appears within normal limits for your age, but the elevated blood pressure and your description of these "episodes" warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation? What kind of investigation? I don't like the sound of that. Is it something serious? I just thought it was… old age. Srey, she worries too much. Is it going to cost a lot of money? We’re on Medicare, you know. I don't want any fancy tests. Just tell me what’s wrong and how to fix it. I have tomatoes to tend to, Doctor. And Srey will be expecting me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. It's good you're proactive about your health, and I assure you, we'll proceed cautiously. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I suspect a few possibilities. It could be related to fluctuations in your blood pressure, though it doesn't fully explain the feeling of disconnection. Another possibility is a transient ischemic attack, or TIA – sometimes called a "mini-stroke." It can cause temporary neurological symptoms like you've described. It’s important to rule that out. To do so, I recommend a few tests. We’ll need a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to assess your overall health. An EKG to check your heart rhythm is also prudent. And, most importantly, I’d like to order an MRI of your brain to look for any evidence of prior strokes or other abnormalities. These tests are covered by Medicare, so cost shouldn’t be a significant issue. They’re standard procedures for evaluating these types of symptoms. I also want to consult with a neurologist. They’re specialists in brain and nerve disorders and can provide a more definitive assessment and treatment plan. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh dear. Now you’re talking about brain specialists. That sounds… serious. Mini-stroke? Is that what you think it is? I haven't had a stroke! I feel perfectly fine, most of the time. Just a bit… fuzzy sometimes. And an MRI? Is that the one where they put you in that loud machine? Srey’s cousin had one, said it was terrifying. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you trying to help, but I don't want a lot of fancy tests. I just want to know if it’s safe to keep working. Can't you just… give me something for my blood pressure and see if that helps? I’ve been setting tile for forty years, I know my body. I haven’t fallen or anything. This is just old age, I tell you. Srey worries too much. And I have tomatoes to tend to, Doctor. Very important tomatoes. Is there anything simpler we can do?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Lason, and I want to assure you I’m not trying to alarm you. However, minimizing the possibility of a TIA without proper investigation could be detrimental. A TIA can be a warning sign of a more serious stroke, and early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent future complications. While I respect your experience with your body, these “episodes” warrant a thorough evaluation. We are not necessarily looking for a "cure," but rather trying to understand the cause of these symptoms and determine the best course of action to protect your health. An MRI, while it can be unsettling, is the most sensitive way to assess the brain. We can provide earplugs and a calming medication if you’re anxious. Given your concerns, I can offer a compromise. We can start with a closer monitoring of your blood pressure at home, along with a referral to a neurologist for a consultation. The neurologist can then determine if an MRI is truly necessary based on their assessment of your symptoms and medical history. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A compromise… Monitoring my blood pressure at home and then seeing the neurologist… That sounds… more reasonable. I can do that. Srey has one of those blood pressure cuffs, she’s always checking it. And I suppose seeing the neurologist couldn't hurt, as long as they don't immediately want to put me in that loud machine. But if the neurologist insists on the MRI, I want a clear explanation. Why it’s necessary, what they’re looking for, and what the risks are. And I want Srey to be there with me. She can ask questions I might forget. She worries too much, but she’s good at that sort of thing. So, blood pressure monitoring at home and a consultation with the neurologist… with a clear understanding about the MRI. That’s my condition. Do we have a deal? And can we get this scheduled quickly? I really need to get back to my tomatoes. They’re very particular about their watering schedule.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Lason. That sounds like a very reasonable plan. We’ll arrange for a blood pressure monitor if Srey’s isn’t sufficient, and I'll write a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly respected neurologist. I’ll include your concerns about the MRI in the referral, and Dr. Sharma will undoubtedly address them thoroughly during your consultation. I’ll also ensure Srey is welcome to attend the appointment with you. It’s always helpful to have a second set of ears and someone to ask questions. I'll have my assistant schedule both the blood pressure monitoring setup and the neurologist appointment for you before you leave. We’ll aim for the earliest availability. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms and keep track of any changes. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… please make sure the neurologist understands I don’t want any unnecessary tests. And I need to get back to my tomatoes. They’re very particular about their watering schedule, you see. And Srey gets upset if they don’t get enough sun. She worries too much, but she’s a good woman. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to me, even if you think I’m just an old man worrying about tomatoes. Hopefully, this won’t be too much trouble. And please, tell your assistant to schedule it quickly. I have a garden to tend to. .
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure meeting you, Mr. Lason. And please, don't think you're just an old man worrying about tomatoes. Your concerns are valid, and we're here to help. We will do everything we can to ensure you receive the best possible care. I’ll have my assistant contact you shortly to schedule the appointments. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your tomatoes.
