DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. TodoroVICH. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's kinda strange, really. I just… get full awful quick when I eat. Doesn’t matter what it is, much. A few bites and I feel like I could burst. It’s been happening for a month or so, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so of early fullness… and it’s not tied to a specific food?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had salmon and rice the other night, usually love that, but same thing. Felt stuffed after just a little bit. My wife makes a good stew, too, and I couldn’t finish my bowl. Used to be able to polish off two! It’s just… everything.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And has your weight changed at all during this month?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… I think I’ve lost a bit. Not a lot, but my pants feel a little looser. My wife says I haven’t been eating as much, which is true, I suppose. It’s hard to eat when you fill up so fast! I haven't been trying to lose weight, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the early fullness and some weight loss, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, sometimes I get a little heartburn, but I’m an old man, I get heartburn now and then. Nothing too bad. And maybe a little tired, but honestly, at my age, who isn’t? I don’t know if that’s connected, though. Nothing else comes to mind, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any pain in your abdomen, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. Maybe a bit of discomfort sometimes, like a full feeling even when I haven’t eaten much. But not pain, no. It’s more… unsettling, I guess. Like something’s not quite right.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And the doctor told me years back I had high blood pressure, but I don’t take anything for it. He said to watch my salt, so I try. Other than that… nothin’ much. Just the usual old man aches and pains, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother lived to be 92, healthy as a horse, mostly. My father died young, heart trouble. And my brother, he had… I think it was diabetes, years back. But other than that, not a lot of serious illness on either side. We’re a pretty hardy bunch, generally. Though, come to think of it, my aunt Bessie had some stomach trouble when she was older. I don't know what exactly, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. Alcohol, I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, but I haven’t had one in… oh, maybe five years now. Doctor said it might help my blood pressure. And no, no recreational drugs, never been interested in that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. Just try to stay active, eat what my wife cooks, and hope for the best. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Makes me feel worse than whatever I’m trying to fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Obarr. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. That's just routine, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Good. Now another one. Heart sounds are regular, maybe a little faint, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Just relax, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, relaxing… It's a little tender, right under my ribs, on the left side, maybe? Not painful, just… sensitive. I’ve noticed that a few times. It's probably just old age.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I do feel some tenderness there, just under your ribs on the left side. Not a sharp pain, but definitely sensitive to the touch. No masses that I can feel. Your spleen is a little bit enlarged, I think. It’s not dramatic, but it’s worth investigating. I’m going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen to get a better look. The CT scan will let us see your spleen, liver, and other organs more clearly.
PATIENT: CT scan… sounds serious. Is it… bad? What could be wrong? I just thought it was my old stomach acting up. Is it something I ate?
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. An enlarged spleen can be caused by a lot of things – some serious, some not. It could be an infection, a problem with your liver, or even something less concerning. The CT scan will help us figure out exactly what’s going on. It's not necessarily bad, it's just… we need more information. We’ll get the results as quickly as possible, usually within a day or two, and then we’ll talk about the next steps. I'm also going to order a complete blood count to look at your white blood cells and other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright… if you think it's best. I trust you, Doctor. A CT scan and blood work… sounds like a lot, but if that's what it takes to figure it out, then so be it. Complete blood count… yes, that's fine. Just… tell me straight, okay? No sugarcoating. I'm an old man, I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Obarr. I will be honest with you every step of the way. I’ll explain everything as clearly as I can, and we’ll make a plan together. Now, I'm going to give you a requisition for the blood work. You can get that done at the lab just down the hall. They’re open until 5 PM today. Then, we’ll schedule the CT scan for tomorrow morning. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, by chance?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh, goodness… I don't think so. Never had anything like that before. I'm not allergic to penicillin, if that matters. And I don't have any trouble with iodine, my wife uses it in her cooking. But that's about all I know. I haven’t really had many allergies in my life, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We’ll proceed assuming you don't have a contrast allergy, but the technician will ask you again before the scan. Here's the requisition for the blood work, and here's some information about preparing for the CT scan. It just says to avoid eating or drinking anything for four hours before the appointment. The receptionist will schedule that for you on your way out. I’ll have the lab results back tomorrow afternoon, and we can discuss them then. Do you have any questions for me right now, before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. It's a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. Just… try not to worry too much, right? I'll get the blood work done, and I'll see the receptionist. Thank you, Doctor TodoroVICH.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. And you're right, let's not jump to conclusions. We'll take things one step at a time. The receptionist is right over there if you need any assistance scheduling the CT scan. I’ll see you tomorrow. Please, call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. .
