DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a situation. I’m dating someone, and I want to be certain everything is as it should be before things progress any further, you understand. It’s important to be… thorough.
DOCTOR: Thorough, yes. I understand. And what specifically are you concerned about, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: Honestly? His… lifestyle. He keeps very late hours, and he’s not forthcoming about where he’s been. It just doesn’t strike me as… respectable. And I want to know if I should be worried about… things. You know, health-wise. I wouldn’t want to catch anything unpleasant.
DOCTOR: So, you're concerned about potential sexually transmitted infections, given his less-than-transparent lifestyle and late hours?
PATIENT: Precisely. It’s not about trust, Doctor, it’s about… prudence. One must protect oneself. And frankly, his profession doesn’t inspire confidence either. It's… entertainment. Not the sort one discusses at a garden party, let me assure you.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, prudence is always advisable. Have you had any symptoms that are concerning you, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. I pride myself on maintaining a… certain standard of hygiene and awareness. It’s more about being proactive, preventing a potential issue, rather than reacting to one. It would be simply awful to have to explain such a thing to my book club.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. In that case, we can certainly proceed with testing to give you peace of mind. We'll need to discuss a full STI panel. Before we do that, though, let’s get a more comprehensive medical history. Have you had any previous sexually transmitted infections diagnosed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. As I said, I am very careful. And I’ve been with my husband for… a considerable time, before this gentleman, naturally. This is a… recent development, and a rather unsettling one, if I’m being honest. I would never have thought I’d be in this position.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently sexually active with anyone other than this gentleman?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Doctor, you wound me. I assure you, I am a woman of… principle. I am only seeing this individual, and I wish I weren’t, but one makes allowances, I suppose. It’s just… a temporary situation. Though it does require a degree of… vetting, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Yes, vetting is certainly prudent. Let's move on to other aspects of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Penicillin, of course. Gives me a dreadful rash. And dust mites, though one can hardly avoid those, can't one? Also, I’m terribly sensitive to strong perfumes. They trigger my migraines. I take a preventative for those, but it's best to avoid them whenever possible. Really, the world is full of irritants these days. It’s quite exhausting.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted, as well as sensitivities to dust mites and strong perfumes. Are you currently taking any medications for your migraines, or for any other condition?
PATIENT: Yes, as I mentioned, I take Topiramate for the migraines. It's… helpful, mostly. Though it does make me a little forgetful, sometimes. Not that it's a problem, really, I just have to keep very detailed lists. And a small dose of Vitamin D, the doctor suggested it. Something about the lack of sunlight. I do try to spend time outdoors, but the humidity is simply dreadful this time of year.
DOCTOR: Topiramate and Vitamin D. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I was diagnosed with hypertension several years ago, but it’s well-controlled with Lisinopril. And I have a touch of arthritis in my knees, nothing debilitating, but it flares up in the damp weather. I take Ibuprofen as needed. Honestly, I seem to be accumulating ailments with age. It's quite disheartening.
DOCTOR: Hypertension controlled with Lisinopril, arthritis with Ibuprofen as needed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes, I had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago. And I had my gallbladder removed shortly after that. Perfectly routine, the doctor assured me. Though I do find I have to be rather careful with rich foods these days. It's a nuisance, really. One used to be able to enjoy a nice cream sauce without a second thought.
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy and cholecystectomy. Do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions – heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother had heart disease, unfortunately. And my aunt passed away from breast cancer. My father had type 2 diabetes, though he wasn't very diligent about managing it. It's… unsettling, to think about these things. One feels rather vulnerable, doesn't one? It underscores the importance of being proactive, as we discussed. Although, honestly, all this talk of ailments is rather depressing. Perhaps we could move on to the testing now?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We can certainly proceed with testing. Before we do, just a few final questions regarding your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Doctor, you wound me again. I am a respectable woman. I enjoy a small glass of sherry with dinner occasionally, that's hardly excessive, but smoking and drugs are quite out of the question. I attend book club, you know. And volunteer at the historical society. One must maintain a certain decorum. It’s simply unthinkable. Now, let's get this over with, shall we? I’m rather anxious to have some answers.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol. Given your concerns, I recommend a comprehensive STI panel. This will include testing for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and herpes. We'll also do a wet mount to check for bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis. Would you like to proceed with drawing blood and collecting a sample?
PATIENT: Yes, please. The sooner this is done, the better. I confess, the thought of all this… close examination is rather unpleasant, but one must do what one must. And do be sure to use a clean gown, Doctor. I simply cannot abide a lack of hygiene. Perhaps you could tell me a bit about the procedure while you prepare? It might… alleviate my anxiety somewhat.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll start with a blood draw – just a standard venipuncture. Then I’ll need to collect a urine sample and a pelvic exam to obtain the necessary swabs. The pelvic exam is fairly routine; you’ll lie on an exam table, and I’ll use a speculum to visualize your cervix. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should be brief. We’ll send the samples to the lab, and the results should be available within a few days. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A few, actually. Will the blood draw be… painful? I faint easily, you see. And regarding the pelvic exam… will I need to disrobe completely? I confess, I am rather self-conscious, and the thought is… distressing. And finally, what if… what if something is found? What is the typical course of action? I suppose one doesn't want to dwell on unpleasant possibilities, but it’s best to be prepared, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Let’s address your concerns one at a time. The blood draw is typically not painful, although you may feel a brief sting when the needle enters. I’ll have you lie down during the procedure to minimize the risk of fainting. We can take it very slowly. Regarding the pelvic exam, you'll undress from the waist down, and we'll provide a gown and a sheet for privacy. You won't be exposed unnecessarily. As for what if something is found, that depends on the specific infection. Most STIs are treatable with antibiotics. We’ll discuss the treatment options in detail, and I’ll provide any necessary referrals. The important thing is to get tested and address any potential issues promptly. Now, if you're ready, we can proceed with the blood draw. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol swabs?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to latex or alcohol swabs. Very well. Let’s… get it over with. Please do be gentle, Doctor. And perhaps you could distract me? Tell me about… your book club? What sort of novels do you discuss? Anything to take my mind off things, really. I find historical fiction quite soothing, myself. Though I confess, modern novels often lack… substance. And please, do let me know when you’re about to insert the needle. I prefer to be prepared, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll let you know every step of the way. I'm happy to discuss book club – it’s actually quite lively. We’ve been reading a lot of contemporary novels lately, much to my initial dismay, but we had a particularly engaging discussion about "Where the Crawdads Sing" last month. It's a coming-of-age story set in the marshes of North Carolina. It’s beautifully written. Now, I'm going to clean your arm with an alcohol swab… just a little cool sensation. Alright. And now, I’m going to insert the needle… you’ll feel a brief pinch. Just relax your arm… Excellent. You’re doing wonderfully.
