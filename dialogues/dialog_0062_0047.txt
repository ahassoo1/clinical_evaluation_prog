DOCTOR: Hi Cleo, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… long-term care, I think? My… someone told me I needed to get checked out for that. It was about… making sure things are okay for later on, you know? My head's not so good these days, so I forget a lot. It’s hard to remember why I’m here sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, long-term care check-up, and you're experiencing some memory concerns. That’s perfectly alright – it's good you're getting it checked out. It's very common, and we can definitely work through this together. To start, when you say "not so good," can you tell me a little more about what's been going on with your memory?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not like I forget everything. I remember… fishing. Always liked fishing. And… my wife, Sarah. I remember her smile. But… little things. Like what I had for breakfast this morning. Or why I walked into a room. It just… slips away. It’s been getting worse, I think. Not fast, but… steady. It worries me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're remembering significant things – fishing, your wife Sarah – which is great. It’s more the recent memory, everyday things, that are becoming difficult. And you’ve noticed a gradual worsening over time. That's helpful to know. To get a better picture, have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or focus?
PATIENT: Concentrate… focus… That’s a tough one. I used to be able to fix anything. Boats, engines, you name it. Now… sometimes I start something and… my mind wanders. I get distracted easy. Sarah used to say I was always a daydreamer, but this feels different. It’s like… the thought just disappears before I finish it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with sustained attention, and that thoughts can feel fragmented. That's important information. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or personality lately?
PATIENT: Mood… I get… frustrated, I guess. Especially when I can't remember something. Sarah always kept me calm. I miss her a lot. I don’t… I don’t get angry, not really. Just… sad, sometimes. And… worried. About… well, about forgetting things even more. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel frustrated and worried, especially with these changes, and to miss your wife, Sarah. It sounds like you're very self-aware and concerned about maintaining your independence. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor told me I had that, a few years back. I take pills for it. I think so, anyway. I forget to refill them sometimes. And… my knees. They bother me, especially when the weather changes. Old fishing injury. Nothing serious, just aches. I don’t really see a doctor much otherwise.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you manage high blood pressure with medication, and you experience some knee pain. That’s good to know. And you said you don’t see a doctor often otherwise. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a tree. That needed a cast. And… Sarah had surgery once, her gallbladder, I think. I stayed with her in the hospital for that. I don’t think I’ve been in the hospital for anything myself, not since I was a little boy. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken arm as a child, but no recent surgeries or hospitalizations for you. Now, just to get a complete picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Sarah always did the remembering for things like that. I eat everything. Fish, mostly. Never had a problem. I’ve never had a rash or anything like that. I think I’m okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and check some basic things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need. Just… try not to make it too complicated, okay? My head ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll keep it simple. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look at your reflexes and do a quick neurological assessment – just some simple tests to check your balance and coordination. Would you mind sitting up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Sitting up… yeah, okay. Go ahead. I’ll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Okay, take some nice, deep breaths for me, if you can. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from a little anxiety, or just getting up on the table. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you please let your arms hang relaxed at your sides?
PATIENT: Arms… relaxed. Like this? I hope I’m doing it right. It’s been a long time since I had a proper check-up.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not necessarily cause for concern, especially given your age and potentially some nerve issues from fishing injuries. Now, I’m going to ask you to do a few simple things. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Follow your finger… Like this? Is that okay? It's kinda hard.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good, keep going. Okay, good. Now, could you please tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Uh… 20…23? No, wait… Is it 2024? I always get the years mixed up. It’s… it’s been a while since I paid attention to dates.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it happens. It's perfectly normal to have trouble with dates sometimes. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words after me, and I'll ask you to remember them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Three words… yeah, okay. I’ll try my best. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, and penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Did I… did I get them right? My head feels a little foggy.
DOCTOR: Yes, you got them perfectly. Now, let’s move on to a quick balance test. Could you please stand up slowly and try to stand on one leg for as long as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Woah… okay. This is… tricky. I don’t think I can hold it for very long.
DOCTOR: That's alright, don't push yourself. That's perfectly fine. It's good to know your limits. Now, please sit back down. Okay, that completes the basic physical exam. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings – some memory concerns, diminished reflexes, some difficulty with balance and some trouble recalling the year – I think it would be beneficial to order some blood work and possibly a brain scan, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work… and a scan? Is… is something wrong? Is it serious? I don't like hospitals or tests… Sarah always took care of all that. I just want to make sure I’m okay… and not a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Cleo. It’s completely normal to feel anxious about tests, especially if you haven’t had them in a while. The tests aren’t to confirm anything is wrong, but to get a clearer picture of what’s going on and rule out any potential causes for your memory concerns. We're just being thorough. The blood work will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and other basic markers. The brain scan – it’s a simple MRI – will allow us to see if there are any structural issues. I’ll also order a cognitive assessment, a series of simple questions and tasks, to further evaluate your memory and thinking skills. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… if you think it’s best. I trust you, Doctor. Sarah always said I worry too much. Vitamin levels… and a scan… and questions. Just… please don’t make it too complicated. And… let me know what it all means, okay? I don’t want to be left in the dark.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Cleo. I will explain everything in detail, and we’ll take it one step at a time. We won’t do anything without discussing it with you first. I’ll have my nurse draw up the lab orders and schedule the MRI and cognitive assessment for you. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a simple multivitamin to help ensure you're getting all the nutrients you need. I'd also recommend keeping a daily calendar and writing down important appointments and events to help with your memory. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think you’ve explained everything pretty well. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. And for not making me feel like… like an old fool. I guess… I’ll just wait to hear about the tests.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Cleo. It was my pleasure. And you're absolutely not an old fool. It takes courage to come in and address these concerns, and I commend you for that. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule your appointments. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here’s the prescription for the multivitamin. I’ll see you back here after the tests, and we’ll discuss the results. Have a good day, Cleo.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You too.
