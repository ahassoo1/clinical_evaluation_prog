DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Smetak, you say? A rather… unusual name. But never mind that. I’m here because… well, it’s a delicate matter, really. A most unpleasant one. Something of a… leakage, if you will. It’s been occurring for a few days now, and my wife insisted I come. She’s quite insistent, that woman.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds… distressing. And it's good of your wife to encourage you to seek attention. “Leakage,” you say… could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Distressing is… a fair word. It’s not something a gentleman discusses easily, you understand. But… it’s a discharge, really. From… down there. It's not painful, thankfully, just… bothersome. And a bit embarrassing, naturally. I haven’t noticed any… swelling, or redness, if that’s of interest. Though, my eyesight isn’t what it once was. It's clear, mostly. Or perhaps a little cloudy. Oh dear, this is awkward. I feel like a schoolboy.
DOCTOR: It is a little awkward, I agree, but you’ve come to the right place. It's perfectly alright to discuss these things with me, Mr. Krok. It’s my job. “Clear, mostly, or a little cloudy…” that’s helpful. And you said it’s been going on for a few days?
PATIENT: Yes, a few days. Perhaps… four or five? It’s difficult to be precise. Time seems to slip away these days, you know. I’ve been tending to the equipment, mostly. The combine needs a new belt, and young Thomas keeps misplacing the wrenches. Distractions, you see. That's likely why I didn't notice it immediately. My wife, bless her, noticed it during… well, during our evening routine. She has a keen eye for these things, that woman. A very keen eye.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s easy for things to get overlooked with other responsibilities. So, this discharge… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go, I believe. Not a steady stream, thankfully. It’s most noticeable… after I’ve relieved myself, if you follow. And sometimes, just… when I'm resting. It's not a large amount, mind you. A few drops, perhaps. Nothing dramatic. I certainly haven't needed to change my undergarments due to it. Though, my wife did suggest I use a… a more absorbent pair. She thinks of everything, that woman. Though, frankly, I find the suggestion… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent, related to urination and rest, and a small amount. That's good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No… no fever, as far as I can tell. No pain, as I mentioned. No… burning sensation. Nothing like that. I've been a bit… fatigued lately, perhaps. But I attribute that to the heat, and the long hours. Farming is hard work, you know. And I'm not getting any younger. My bones ache sometimes, but that’s just… old age. I suppose. And… now that you mention it, I may have felt a little… itchy, around the area. But it could just be the fabric of my trousers. A rather rough material, they are. Do you think that’s possible?
DOCTOR: That’s all helpful information, Mr. Krok. The fatigue and itching could certainly be related to other factors. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your urination – any difficulty starting or stopping, or a more frequent urge to go?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. Perhaps a little difficulty starting sometimes. A bit of a… hesitation, if you will. Nothing severe, mind you. Just a moment or two before it… flows. And I have been going to the bathroom a bit more frequently, yes. Especially at night. My wife has been complaining about the light, you see. She says I wake her up. Though, frankly, she's a light sleeper. Always has been. Do you think that’s a cause for concern, Doctor? Is this… serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re telling me all of this, Mr. Krok. It could be a number of things. These symptoms, taken together, suggest we should investigate a little further. I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. It's mostly just an external examination, and I will explain everything as I go. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An examination… yes. Well, I suppose it's necessary. I’m not particularly fond of doctors, you understand. Always poking and prodding. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Explain everything, you say? Yes, please do. I’d prefer not to be… surprised. And be gentle, if you would. My bones aren’t what they used to be. Though, I suppose a quick poke won’t cause any harm. Proceed when you’re ready. And please, do try to be swift. I have equipment to repair, you know.
DOCTOR: <stage>I smile reassuringly. “Of course, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go. It will only take a few moments.” I gesture towards the examination table. “If you could just lie down on your back, that would be great. I’ll need to take a look at the area, and perhaps palpate your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Abdomen… yes. Well, I suppose so. Lie down, you say? Be gentle, Doctor. I haven't been laid flat in… well, decades. And I do have a rather sensitive lower back. Just… proceed with caution. And please, tell me what you’re looking for. I like to be informed. It helps to calm my nerves, you see. Though I suspect nothing will calm my nerves entirely. This is all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, I’m just going to take a look and feel around. I’m checking for any tenderness, swelling, or masses. I’m not finding any obvious swelling or redness at the moment. There is a small amount of…discharge present, as you described. And your abdomen feels…slightly tender to the touch, on the lower left side, but nothing overly concerning. Do you feel any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes, a little. Not a sharp pain, mind you. Just… a discomfort. A dull ache, really. It's been like that for a few days now, I believe. I thought it was just… muscle strain. From lifting the combine parts, you see. But perhaps it’s something more. Is that bad, Doctor? Is it serious? Don’t tell me I need an operation. I’m too old for operations. And please, do hurry. This is rather… humiliating.
DOCTOR: Alright, no need to worry about operations at this stage, Mr. Krok. The tenderness is something we need to investigate, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. It could be a number of things – muscle strain as you suggested, or something a little more going on. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Bowel sounds are normal. I'd also like to check your prostate with a digital rectal exam, if you're comfortable with that. It's important to rule out any issues there, given your symptoms. It's a standard procedure, and it will only take a moment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Good heavens, Doctor! Is that absolutely necessary? I… I've never had one of those before. And frankly, the thought of it is… deeply unpleasant. Isn’t there anything else you can do? Perhaps a blood test? Or a… a scan? Anything to avoid that. My wife always warned me about these doctors… poking and prodding everywhere. I understand it's standard, but… it still seems rather intrusive. I’m an old man, Doctor. Do you really think it's necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel uncomfortable with that. And you are right, there are other tests we can do. However, a digital rectal exam is often the quickest and most reliable way to assess the prostate, and it can give us valuable information about your symptoms. It’s a standard part of a urological exam for men of your age, and it helps us to rule out potentially serious conditions like an enlarged prostate or, less commonly, prostate cancer. If you are absolutely opposed to it at this time, we can proceed with a blood test, specifically a PSA test, which measures prostate-specific antigen. However, a PSA test isn’t always accurate, and it can sometimes lead to unnecessary further investigations. Ultimately, the decision is yours. But I strongly recommend the exam, if you are able, to help me make an accurate diagnosis and ensure your health. I will be as gentle and discreet as possible. We can stop at any time if you are uncomfortable. What would you prefer to do, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is all so… unpleasant. Very well. If you insist, Doctor. But be quick about it, please. And gentle, as you promised. I’m not a young man anymore. And if you find anything… alarming, please, just tell me straight. No beating around the bush. I’ve lived a long life. I can handle the truth. But… be quick. And gentle. And discreet. This is… mortifying. Proceed when you are ready. I’m… not looking forward to this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I’m just going to check now. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but otherwise feels relatively smooth and symmetrical. There are no obvious nodules or areas of significant tenderness. It is a little firm, which isn't unusual for a man of your age. The examination wasn't particularly painful, was it?
PATIENT: No… not painful, exactly. Just… unpleasant. Very unpleasant. A most undignified experience, Doctor. I'd rather not repeat it, if you don't mind. So, what does it mean? Enlarged, you say? Is that bad? Is it cancer? Don’t tell me I need… treatment. I'm too old for treatment. What’s the prognosis, Doctor? And can we please, please move on? I’m ready to go home now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. It’s perfectly understandable that you’d like to move on. The enlargement is a common finding in men your age, and it doesn't necessarily mean it’s anything serious. It could be benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate that can cause urinary symptoms. However, to be certain, I would like to order a PSA blood test and a urine analysis to rule out any infection. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I’m not immediately concerned about cancer, but these tests will help us to be more certain. So, to summarize, I’ll order the PSA test and urine analysis. We can discuss the results when they come back, and then decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Very well, Doctor. If you insist. A PSA test and a urine analysis. Fine. But please, no more… poking and prodding, if you don’t mind. I’ve had enough of that for one day. And if everything is… normal, can I finally go home? I have equipment to repair, you know. The combine won’t fix itself. And my wife will be wondering where I am. So, yes. Tests. Fine. But no more… indignities, please. Let’s get this over with. I'm a very old man, Doctor. I'm tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. No more poking and prodding, I promise. I’ll have the lab technician draw blood for the PSA test, and you can provide a urine sample before you leave. It's a simple procedure, and it won’t take long. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they are available, and I’ll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or significant changes in your urinary symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: No… no, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For… everything. It wasn’t a pleasant experience, but I appreciate your… professionalism. And please, tell your technician to be gentle with the needle. My veins aren't what they used to be. And… if you don't mind, I'd prefer not to discuss this with my wife. She worries too much, that woman. She’ll just… fuss. So, just… send the results to me directly. That will be fine. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’d like to go home. Thank you again, Doctor. And good day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I understand completely. I’ll make a note to send the results directly to you and to advise the technician to be gentle. I’ll also make a note of your preference not to discuss this with your wife. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
