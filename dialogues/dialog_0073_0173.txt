DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor! Well, I've been getting chills, and it’s a little weird. Not like a cold coming on, just… chills. It's been happening for a couple of days now.
DOCTOR: Chills, you say. And you don’t feel like you’re fighting off a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, that’s right. No sore throat, no cough, no stuffy nose... nothing like that. Just… cold. And a bit tired, I guess, but I usually am a bit tired, to be honest. It’s just these chills are different, you know? Like they come and go.
DOCTOR: “Different” how?
PATIENT: Hmm… Okay, let me try to explain. They're not with anything else, like fever or aches. They just… happen. I'll be perfectly fine, then suddenly I feel cold, like I need a sweater, even if it’s warm in here. Then it’ll pass in a few minutes. It's just… unsettling. It's hard to describe!
DOCTOR: I see. And how frequently would you say this is happening throughout the day?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Yesterday, it was probably… four or five times? Today, maybe three so far. It's not constant, definitely not. It just… pops up randomly. It doesn’t seem to be related to anything I’m doing, like being in a cold room or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not that I’ve noticed, no. I mean, I’ve been a little more thirsty than usual, maybe? But I live in the desert, so that's not that unusual. And maybe a tiny bit of a headache now and then, but nothing major. Really, it's just these chills. That's what's worrying me.
DOCTOR: Do you have any significant medical history, Ms. Aslan?
PATIENT: Oh, not really. I had chickenpox when I was a kid, like everyone else, and I broke my arm once. But nothing serious, nothing chronic. I'm generally pretty healthy, to be honest. I try to eat well, and I walk a lot. Mostly healthy, anyway! What about family history? Is that important?
DOCTOR: Family history can be important, yes. Are there any illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, right, sorry! Okay, um… My dad had high blood pressure, and my grandma on my mother’s side had diabetes. And I think my aunt had some kind of cancer, but I don’t remember what kind. It was a long time ago. Is that helpful? It's just… my family isn’t really big on talking about health stuff, you know? It's a bit taboo.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications or have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, no. And allergies… hmm… no known allergies, not that I’ve ever noticed. I can eat everything, wear everything, touch everything. Unless… I get a little itchy sometimes after being in the desert, but I think that's just the dry air. Definitely no serious allergies.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick physical exam, Ms. Aslan. I’d like to check your temperature, listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a general look.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your temperature. 98.6. Normal. Now, if you'll just breathe deeply for me… Heart rate is regular, lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything appears normal thus far, Ms. Aslan.
PATIENT: That’s… good, right? I mean, everything being normal is good. But that doesn’t explain the chills, does it? I'm just… worried something is being missed.
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say at this point. Your vitals are stable, and the physical exam hasn’t revealed anything obvious. It could be a mild viral infection that hasn’t fully manifested, or simply stress. We could order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues, though I suspect it will come back normal. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Hmm… Yes, I think that would be a good idea. If it rules things out, that would put my mind at ease. It’s just… I don’t want to ignore something if it is something. Yes, please. Blood work sounds good. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Aslan. I will order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. That should give us a good baseline. The lab is just down the hall, and they will need a sample from you. After that, we will wait for the results. It typically takes 24 to 48 hours. I’ll give you a call if anything concerning comes up. Do you have any questions for me while we wait?
PATIENT: Okay, great. Thank you. 24 to 48 hours… I can definitely wait that long. Um… yes, actually, one question. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, should I be resting more? Avoiding anything specific? Just… anything I can do to help my body, you know?
DOCTOR: Given your stable vitals and normal physical exam, there isn't any need for specific restrictions. However, ensure you're getting adequate rest and staying hydrated. It's basic health maintenance, Ms. Aslan. Unless your symptoms worsen drastically – high fever, severe headache, difficulty breathing – there’s no cause for alarm. I will also provide a referral to a specialist in case the results come back inconclusive. It's always best to have a second opinion, even if it turns out to be nothing.
PATIENT: Okay, adequate rest and hydration… got it. And a referral, just in case. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and running the tests. I feel a little better just knowing we're looking into it. Is there anything else I need to do before I go get the blood work done? Like, do I need to fast or anything?
DOCTOR: Yes. You will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. No food or drink, except water. The lab will give you specific instructions, but it's best to be prepared. And please, try not to overthink it. It’s most likely nothing serious, Ms. Aslan. Here is the lab order and referral information. The lab is right down the hall, room 102. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Fasting… eight hours… okay. Thank you again, Doctor Korrell. I appreciate your help. I’ll go get the blood work done now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. You too. .
