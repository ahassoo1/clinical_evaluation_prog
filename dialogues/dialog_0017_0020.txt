DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I am Dr. Blim. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… nice to meet you. My… how you say… my regular doctor, he… passed away last month. This is for… the check-up, yes? The one they told me about on the phone? For Medicare.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, the annual wellness visit. Though, frankly, I have the schedule here and it doesn’t specify a replacement physician prompted this visit. Regardless. It’s good you’re proactive. Now, let's not dwell on the… circumstances. A standard check-up involves a review of your medical history, a physical examination, and some routine screenings. To begin, can you tell me about any significant medical issues you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh. I… see. I thought… never mind. Medical issues… hmm. Well, I have… my knees. They bother me sometimes. Especially when it is cold. And… I had a small surgery on my hand, many years ago. A long time ago. Working on cars, you know? It was… a cut. Deep cut. They fixed it. Is that… significant? I don't know what is "significant".
DOCTOR: The knees, alright. And a hand surgery... many years ago. Vague descriptions aren’t terribly helpful, Ms. Benites, but we’ll proceed. When you say your knees bother you, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… yes. They… ache. A dull ache. Mostly when I stand for too long. Or… when I climb stairs. Not all the time, you understand. Some days are better than others. And… they feel… stiff in the morning. Like they need to… work out. Is that… how you say? I am not a doctor, you see. I fix cars. Not people.
DOCTOR: “Work out,” alright. And the hand surgery… Do you recall when this surgery was performed, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That is… a long time ago. Maybe… twenty years ago? More than twenty, maybe. It was… before my husband… passed away. Yes, before. He helped me with everything then. I remember… it was winter. Very cold winter. And the doctor… he was younger then. I think. Everything feels so long ago, you see? It was just a cut, though. Nothing… serious.
DOCTOR: Twenty years ago. A cut. We'll note that. Now, Ms. Benites, let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Medications. Just… one. For my… blood pressure. The little white pill. My other doctor… he gave it to me. I take it every morning. And… sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. The over-the-counter one. For the pain. That is all. I do not take vitamins. I eat good food. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed. Fine. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, latex… anything at all?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I… I do not think so. I have eaten everything. Many things. I have never… reacted. Not to food. Not to… anything. I have a very strong stomach, you see. I eat a lot of… sausages. And pickles. That is good for you, yes? Pickles?
DOCTOR: Sausages and pickles notwithstanding, no known allergies. Good. Now, Ms. Benites, a brief family history, if you would. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No. My parents… they passed away. Long ago. Both of them. My mother… she had… problems with her heart, I think. They said it was the heart. And my father… he worked very hard. In the fields. He… he just got old, I think. He was very tired. It was a long time ago, you see. I do not remember much. It was before… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Both deceased. Mother with heart issues, father… general decline with age. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. No smoking. Never. My husband… he smoked, but I told him no. It is bad for you. And… no drinking. Just… a little wine sometimes. With dinner. Very little. And… no drugs. Never. I am a mechanic, you see. I work with cars. Not… those things. A very honest living.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, no drug use. Let’s move on to a brief physical exam. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Yes. Of course. I am… tall, you know. I always was. It makes… working on cars… difficult sometimes. But I manage. Is that… okay? The scale? Is it working?
DOCTOR: Yes, the scale is working fine. 80 kilograms. Now, please step back. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and bra.
PATIENT: Oh. Remove my… shirt? But… I am cold! And… is that necessary? I just came in for a check-up, you see. I do not understand. Is there… a gown? I am not… comfortable.
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, it is a standard component of a physical exam. It allows me to properly auscultate your heart and lungs. There is a gown in the corner. Please, it is simply for medical assessment. It is not… a personal matter. I need to hear your breathing and heartbeat to determine if there are any abnormalities. I assure you, I am a professional. Please.
PATIENT: Very well… I… I do not like this. But… if you say it is necessary. It is… very cold in here. And… where is the gown, exactly? Please… hurry.
DOCTOR: It’s right there. I will step outside to allow you privacy while you change. Please call when you are ready.
PATIENT: .
