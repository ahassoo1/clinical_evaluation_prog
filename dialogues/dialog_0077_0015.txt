DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. It’s Dr. Pirl. Welcome. I see you’re here today… could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, hello. Um… it’s my… my nose, I think. It’s been… not good. A little… stuffed up, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. It feels… bad, but not really bad, you know? I just… wanted to check it. It’s been this way for… some time now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. “Not good” and “some time now” are… rather vague, I’m afraid. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, sorry. It’s just… things are a little fuzzy sometimes, you know? Let me think… I think it started… maybe in the spring? Or was it summer? It’s hard to remember. It feels like… pressure, mostly. Behind my nose and… in my cheeks. And… sometimes it hurts a little when I bend over. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Pressure behind the nose and cheeks, pain with bending over… and when you say “spring or summer,” roughly how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I… I really don’t know, Doctor. Maybe… three months? Four? It’s hard to say. I work, you see… out at the oil fields. It’s… busy work. A lot of noise and… dust. Maybe it started then? I don't really keep track of time when I'm working. I just... feel it. It bothers me sometimes, but not all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, pressure and pain in your face, potentially for three or four months, and you work in an environment with dust and noise. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think… I… sometimes I feel tired. But I always feel tired, you know? From the work. I don't know if it's… related. Oh! And… sometimes my nose feels… blocked. Like I can't breathe good through it. Just… one side, mostly. Not always though. It comes and goes. I don’t have a fever, I don’t think. I haven’t checked.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue and nasal blockage, more on one side. And you haven’t noticed any fever. Do you have any… discharge from your nose?
PATIENT: Discharge… Um. I… I think so? Sometimes. It's… clear, mostly. Or maybe a little… yellow? Not much though. Just a little bit when I… blow my nose. It doesn't smell, I don’t think. I try to keep it clean. I really do. But… it's dusty where I work, you know? Everything gets dusty. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining. It’s hard to remember the details.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Ms. Boham. It’s alright. Clear or slightly yellow discharge, associated with working in a dusty environment. Now, have you had any changes in your sense of smell or taste recently?
PATIENT: Smell or taste… Oh! Yes, now that you mention it. Things don't smell as strong as they used to, I think. Like… my husband makes coffee, and I can smell it, but it’s… fainter. And food… doesn’t taste as good, maybe? I thought I was just getting old! But… maybe it’s that? I don’t know. It’s hard to tell. I don’t pay attention to those things much. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for sharing all of this, Ms. Boham. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to take a quick look at your nose and ears, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I… I don't have good ears anyway. Too much noise at work, you see. I mostly just feel tired, but I’m happy to let you look.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your ears appear a bit congested, but nothing alarming. Your nasal passages are… somewhat inflamed, and I can see some discharge on the inner walls. There doesn’t appear to be any significant structural abnormality. I'm going to palpate your sinuses now, just to check for tenderness. It might be a little uncomfortable, so please let me know if it hurts.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That’s… fine. I’m used to a little discomfort, you see. Working with the drills… it’s rough work. I’ll let you know if it hurts. Please, don’t worry about being gentle. I can handle it. Just… tell me what you find. I don't really understand much of this medical talk.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm touching here… and here… and here. There’s some tenderness in your maxillary sinuses, which are located in your cheeks. It’s not severe, but it’s present. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing sinusitis—an inflammation of the sinuses. The noise and dust at your workplace could certainly be contributing factors. Do you have any allergies that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Sinusitis… That sounds… bad. But I'm glad we know what it is. Allergies… Um. I don't think so. Not really. I mean, I sometimes sneeze, but everyone sneezes, right? I’ve never been to a doctor about allergies. My husband sneezes more than me. I don't know if that matters. I just… feel tired, mostly. Is there something I can do about it? I can't really stop working, you see. We need the money.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. It’s not usually something to be overly worried about, but it can be uncomfortable. Since you don't believe you have allergies, and given your work environment, we'll proceed assuming this is a non-allergic sinusitis. We'll focus on managing your symptoms. I recommend a saline nasal rinse twice a day to help clear congestion and reduce inflammation. You can find these over-the-counter at most pharmacies. Also, I'm going to prescribe a short course of a decongestant, which can help relieve some of the pressure and blockage. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Saline rinse and… a decongestant. I can try that. I've never used either one before. Can you… write it down for me? I sometimes forget things, you see. And… how long should I use them? I don't want to get sick. And… how much do they cost? I only have a little money. I’m sorry to ask so many questions. I just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Boham. No need to apologize for asking questions. That’s what I’m here for. The saline rinse—use twice a day, morning and evening. And the decongestant—take one tablet every 12 hours, for five days. It's important to only use it for that short period, as prolonged use can sometimes have side effects. The saline rinse is very inexpensive, only a few dollars. The decongestant… let me check. It's usually around $10-$15, depending on the pharmacy. If cost is a concern, there are generic versions available that are cheaper. And I will write a note for a potential specialist referral, if your symptoms don’t improve after five days. Do you have any questions about those instructions?
PATIENT: Five days… $10-$15… Okay, I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. A specialist… I don't want to bother them if it gets better on its own. I mostly just want to feel better. I just… feel tired all the time. Should I be worried about that? Is that from the sinusitis too? Or is it just… my job? I don't want to lose my job.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned about that, Ms. Boham. The fatigue could be related to the sinusitis, as infections can often make you feel tired. However, given your demanding work schedule, it's also possible that it's related to that. Let's focus on managing the sinusitis first. If the fatigue persists even after your symptoms improve, we can discuss further evaluation to rule out any other underlying causes. I will also write a note for a blood test to check your iron levels, just in case, as low iron can also cause fatigue. I recommend you follow up with me in one week to see how you are doing. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if your symptoms worsen or if you have any concerns. Do you have any other questions for me today?
