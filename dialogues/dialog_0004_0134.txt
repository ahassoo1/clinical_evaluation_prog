DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Oh, goodness. Well, it's this stomach, you see. It's been… unsettled. I don't seem to be able to eat much at all these days, and when I do eat, I feel full awful quick. It just… sits there. I don't know if that makes sense. It’s been going on for a little while now, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Unsettled” and feeling full quickly… Yes, that gives me something to work with. And how long is “a little while now,” Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Dates… they slip my mind so easily. Let me think… It started… maybe a couple of months ago? Around springtime, I suppose. It's hard to say for certain. Everything feels a bit blurry these days, you know? It's not a sharp pain, just… discomfort. And that feeling of being full after just a few bites. It's just… not right. I used to have a much better appetite.
DOCTOR: A couple of months… alright. And is this discomfort constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, mostly. It's worse after I try to eat, naturally. Then it sort of… settles down a bit, but it's always there, in the background, you know? Like a dull ache. Not terrible, but… noticeable. It doesn't keep me up at night or anything, but it's definitely changed things. I used to enjoy my meals so much more. I don’t know… it just feels different than when I had the… the sickness before.
DOCTOR: “The sickness before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, the cancer. They… did a lot to fix it, years ago now. It was a long time ago. I've been mostly okay since then, but… I worry it might be coming back, or something like it. It’s just… this doesn’t feel like a normal stomach upset, if that makes sense. I don't want to bother you if it's nothing, but it's been nagging at me.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to review your records regarding the cancer treatment, of course. And to get a clearer picture of what's going on now, let's go through a bit of a checklist. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with this discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, there's been some nausea. Not every day, but… several times a week, at least. And no, I haven’t actually thrown up. It just… feels like I might, you know? A queasy feeling. It comes and goes, like the discomfort. It’s worst after eating, but sometimes it just happens out of nowhere. And no weight loss that I've noticed… my clothes still fit. Though, I haven't been eating much to lose weight, either!
DOCTOR: Okay. No vomiting, just nausea… associated with eating. And no noted weight loss. Ms. Kelder, have you noticed any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… goodness. That’s a personal question! Well… they’ve been a little…irregular. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… not. It's hard to explain. It’s not a big change, just… not as regular as they used to be. I used to be like clockwork, you know? But everything seems to be off these days. I don’t know if that’s related to the stomach, or just getting older.
DOCTOR: It could be related, Ms. Kelder, or it could be something else entirely. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Do you have any heartburn or indigestion?
PATIENT: Heartburn… sometimes, yes. Not terrible, but… a bit of burning in my chest after eating, occasionally. It's not every meal, mind you. And I usually take those little… antacids. They help a little, but not always. Indigestion… yes, that too. Just a general feeling of fullness and discomfort. It’s all just… jumbled together, really. I feel like something’s just… not working right. I used to love my food. It makes me sad, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, nausea, irregular bowel habits, occasional heartburn… you’ve been managing it with antacids. Now, let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the antacids?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, there's the blood pressure medicine, the doctor prescribed it a few years back. And… something for my arthritis, the pain in my hands. That’s all I can think of right now. I take them regularly, I believe. My daughter helps me with keeping track of things, sometimes. I forget these things so easily! I don't know the names of them, I'm afraid. Just little pills.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication and arthritis medication… Alright. Do you recall the dosages of either of those?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, I don't. I've never been good with remembering numbers. It’s all a blur. I just take them like the doctor told me to, you know? A little blue pill in the morning, and a white one at night, I think. I really couldn’t tell you the exact amount. My daughter probably knows, if you need to know. She helps me order the refills.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. We'll get that information from your daughter's contact information then. Now, before we move on, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. No allergies to food, no allergies to… anything. I used to be around a lot of plants when I was younger, learning from my grandmother, but I never had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I think I'm pretty lucky, in that regard.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. Now, Ms. Kelder, I'm going to need to conduct a brief physical exam. That will involve listening to your abdomen, and gently pressing on it to check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That’s alright. Whatever you need to do. I’m not afraid. I’ve had doctors poke and prod me before. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my stomach. It’s just… unsettling, you know? It feels like something isn’t right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. And now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: A little… yes. There’s a bit of tenderness there, on my left side, I think. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And a little lower down, too. It feels… full, almost. Like something’s pressing on me. It’s not terrible, but I can definitely feel it when you press. It’s better when you’re not touching me, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m noting some tenderness in the left lower quadrant and lower abdomen. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. I’m also going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. I'm noting a BMI of 20.4. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings of the physical exam, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing your symptoms. It could be a number of things, ranging from a simple case of indigestion to something more serious. Given your history of cancer, we need to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. More serious? You think it could be… that again? I was hoping it wasn’t… I just feel so tired all the time. And this stomach… it’s just not right. What do we do now, Doctor? Do we need to do… tests? I don’t mind tests, if it helps figure things out. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, it’s too early to jump to conclusions. However, given your history, a cautious approach is warranted. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool test to rule out any infection. Additionally, I'm ordering an abdominal CT scan to get a clearer picture of your internal organs. This will allow us to assess your overall health and identify any potential issues. We'll need to schedule these tests as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… a CT scan? That sounds… serious. I haven't had one of those in years. And blood tests… I don’t like needles. But… if it helps, I guess. I just… I get so worried. It’s just… everything feels so uncertain. Will the tests take long? And… will they hurt? I hope not. And who will tell me the results? Is it going to be… bad news?
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, try not to worry unnecessarily. The tests are routine procedures and will provide us with valuable information. The CT scan is painless, although you will need to lie still for a short period of time. The blood tests will involve a brief pinch, but it’s hardly noticeable. I will personally review the results and discuss them with you at your follow-up appointment, which I’m scheduling for one week from today. As for “bad news,” it’s impossible to say at this point. We need to gather more information before we can make any definitive conclusions. I will have the lab draw blood immediately. Please take this requisition slip to the radiology department for your CT scan. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. A week from today. That seems… far away. I understand. But… what if something is… wrong? I don't have anyone to go with me to the radiology department. My daughter is at work, and… I get nervous going to these things alone. Could the nurse… maybe explain it to me a little before I go? Just so I know what to expect? I just… don’t like being alone when I’m worried.
DOCTOR: The nurse can certainly provide you with some basic information regarding the CT scan procedure. However, please understand that the procedure itself is straightforward and generally well-tolerated. I suggest you focus on staying calm and follow the instructions provided by the radiology staff. Nurse, could you please spend a few minutes explaining the CT scan procedure to Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Nurse. That would be very kind. I just... I get anxious easily, and I don't want to be surprised. This whole thing has me rattled. I appreciate you taking the time. It’s just… all of this feels a bit overwhelming. And I keep thinking about… the cancer. I’m probably just being silly, but… it’s hard not to worry.
