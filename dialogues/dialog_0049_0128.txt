DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my joints, you see. They just… ache a bit in the mornings. Mostly my hands and knees. It takes a while to get going, you know? Not terrible, just… stiff. It’s been like this for a while now, I think. A long while. I forget exactly how long.
DOCTOR: A long while… alright. And when you say "a while", are we talking weeks, months, or even longer than that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… months, I think. Definitely months. Maybe even longer? It's hard to say. Things kinda blur together, you know? My husband… well, he used to help me remember things. It's been a bit since… since he passed. So things are… fuzzy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. Fuzzy is understandable. Months… okay. And is the pain constant throughout the day, or is it worse at certain times?
PATIENT: No, no, it's not all day. Just… mornings, like I said. It eases up once I get moving, you know? After a bit of work, it's alright. But first thing… oof. It’s hard to even open jars sometimes. Nothing awful, just… annoying. And a little bit painful. I just thought maybe… maybe you could do something about it?
DOCTOR: Alright. So primarily morning stiffness, improves with activity… And you mentioned difficulty with opening jars. Any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don’t think so. Maybe a little puffy sometimes, but not red, no. It doesn't look bad, if that makes sense. I haven’t noticed any redness, anyway. I just feel it, you know? The ache and the stiffness. I don’t really look at my hands much, to be honest. Too busy with the little ones.
DOCTOR: The little ones, yes. And do you have any pain in any other joints – ankles, wrists, elbows, shoulders?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes my shoulders ache, now that you mention it. Especially if I've been lifting things, you know, helping the children. But it doesn't bother me as much as my hands and knees. Not usually, anyway. It comes and goes. Mostly, it’s just these mornings that are hard. It makes getting everything done a bit… slow.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything to relieve the pain at home – over-the-counter medications, heat, ice, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes I take… well, I think it’s ibuprofen? The white pills. They help a little. And sometimes I soak my hands in warm water. That feels nice. But it doesn't last very long, you know? It’s just… a temporary fix. I don’t really want to take too many pills, if I can avoid it. They never seem to really fix anything, just take the edge off.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ibuprofen… helpful to a degree, warm water as well. Let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any history of arthritis in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… I think she had something in her hands. Real bad. She couldn't knit anymore. Something with the joints, I think. My aunt, too. On my father's side. They both complained a lot. But I don’t know what it was, exactly. They didn’t really talk about it much. Just… aches and pains, you know? Old age, they said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of joint issues… that’s useful to know. And what about other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not much. I had the flu a few years back, real bad. But I got over it. My blood pressure was a little high once, the doctor said, but it’s usually okay now. I try to eat healthy, you know? Mostly. I don’t really go to the doctor much, if I can help it. It’s… expensive. And I don’t like being fussed over.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of flu, slightly elevated blood pressure in the past… Are you currently taking any other medications besides the ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. No, not really. Just the ibuprofen when I need it. Sometimes I take a little something for sleeping, if I can't get to sleep. But it's just when I have trouble, you know? A small pill. I can’t remember the name, though. I get them at the drugstore. It's a little blue one, I think. But I don't take it very often. Honestly, I forget most of the names.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll try to sort all of this out. Now, Ms. Voner, I'm going to ask you a few questions about other parts of your body, just to get a more complete picture. Have you experienced any fever, fatigue, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no fever. I always feel a little tired, you know, with the children and everything. But nothing more than usual. And no, I haven’t lost any weight. If anything, I probably gained a little! I love to cook, and the little ones are always wanting snacks. So no, no weight loss. Just… a little bit more around the middle, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, fatigue is consistent with activity level, no recent weight loss. Okay, Ms. Voner. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you please sit up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, I can do that. Oof. A little stiff getting up, you know. But yes, here I am. Do you need me to roll up my sleeves?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. And just relax. I’m going to gently examine your joints – feel for swelling, tenderness, and check your range of motion. I’ll start with your hands. Okay, just tell me if anything feels particularly painful. I'm pressing here... and here... Any tenderness?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, that one. That one feels a little tender. And that one too. Not awful, just… a little bit achy when you push. The rest… not so much. Mostly just stiff, you know? Not really pain. Unless you press on it. Then it's a little sore. It’s funny, I hadn’t really noticed it until you touched it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness noted in the MCP joints of the index and middle fingers. And how about this hand?
PATIENT: It's the same, I think. Yes, this knuckle here. And this one too. They both feel pretty much the same, you know? A little bit achy when you push. I do a lot of kneading dough for the children, maybe that's it? I just don't really think about it, unless someone touches it.
DOCTOR: Bilateral MCP joint tenderness. Now let’s examine your knees. Could you please extend your legs straight out for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Oof, that's a bit uncomfortable, you know? They're a little stiff. And it’s not easy keeping them straight. I haven’t been doing much walking lately, mostly just chasing after the little ones.
DOCTOR: Any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, that one. Just a little bit of pain, when you press there. And this one, too. Not awful, just… achy. And a little bit of a grinding sound when I bend it. Do you hear that? It doesn’t bother me much, but it’s there.
DOCTOR: Bilateral medial knee tenderness with crepitus. Alright. Now, just to complete the exam, I'm going to check your reflexes and listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds normal there. Okay, Ms. Voner, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, it sounds like you may have osteoarthritis. It's a common condition, especially as we get older, and it's caused by the breakdown of cartilage in the joints. The pain and stiffness you're experiencing, particularly in the mornings and after activity, along with the tenderness and crepitus I felt in your knees and hands, are consistent with that diagnosis. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood tests – a complete blood count and a rheumatoid factor test – just to make sure there’s nothing else going on. We will also get X-rays of your hands and knees to assess the joint damage. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Osteo… arthritis? Is that serious? My mother had something in her hands, like you said… Was that the same thing? And blood tests and… X-rays? That sounds… complicated. Will it hurt? And… what can we do about it? I don't want to be like my mother, not being able to knit anymore. I just want to be able to keep up with the little ones, you know? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ms. Voner. Let’s address your concerns one by one. Yes, it’s very possible your mother had osteoarthritis. It's a common condition that often runs in families. The blood tests and X-rays are just to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis, which is a different type of arthritis that requires different treatment. The blood tests are just a simple draw, and the X-rays are painless – you just stand or sit still for a few moments while the machine takes pictures. As for what we can do about it, there are several options. We can start with conservative treatments – things like over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, which you’re already taking, and physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion. We can also discuss weight management, as excess weight puts extra stress on your joints. If those measures aren't enough, we can consider other options, like injections to lubricate the joints or, in more severe cases, surgery. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’ll start with the tests and see what they show. The goal is to manage your pain, improve your function, and allow you to continue doing the things you enjoy, like keeping up with the little ones. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… that sounds better. Less scary. Physical therapy, I could try that. I just don't want to be stuck, you know? Not being able to move. And I don't want to take a lot of pills. So… the blood tests and X-rays first, then we see? And you'll tell me what they mean? Can I still cook for the children? That's… important to me. And will the therapy be expensive? I don't have a lot of money, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Blood tests and X-rays first, then we'll discuss the results and create a plan. And yes, I'll explain everything clearly. Of course you can still cook for the children! We’re not trying to stop you from doing anything you enjoy, just manage the pain so you can continue doing it comfortably. As for the therapy, the cost will depend on the number of sessions you need and the facility you choose. I can provide you with a list of affordable physical therapy options in the area, and we can discuss ways to make it more accessible, such as payment plans or sliding scale fees. We can also explore some exercises you can do at home to supplement the therapy. It's important to be proactive and find a solution that works for you. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work and X-rays. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray facility is across the street. Once you have those results, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… calmed me down a lot. I was very worried. A list of affordable therapy places would be wonderful. And the exercises you mentioned… that sounds good too. I can try those at home. I’ll go get the blood work done now. Thank you again. It was nice to meet you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Voner. And remember, we’re here to help you every step of the way. I'll have the nurse print out that list of therapy places for you. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day.
