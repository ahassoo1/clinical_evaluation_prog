DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic, good to see you. Or… good to meet you. Ninety years young, that’s fantastic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello doctor. Yes, ninety… feels like yesterday and a long time ago, both. This cough… it just won’t go away. Been bothering me for… well, a long time now. I can't rightly say how long. Seems like forever.
DOCTOR: A long time, huh?
PATIENT: Yes… a long time. Not a bad cough at first, just a tickle. But it’s gotten… scratchier. And drier. Doesn’t bring anything up, you know? Just… air. Makes my throat feel raw. It's especially bad at night, keeps my wife… kept my wife up. She’s… gone now. But it still bothers me when I lie down.
DOCTOR: I see. Keeps you up at night, scratchy, dry… and it hasn't produced any… mucus, you said?
PATIENT: No, doctor. Not a drop. Just… nothing. Like sandpaper, that’s what it feels like. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little short of breath, but it passes. Maybe it’s just my age, you know? Old lungs… getting tired. I don't know. Things don't work like they used to.
DOCTOR: Right, sandpaper… and the shortness of breath is occasional?
PATIENT: Yes, occasional. Not all the time. When I walk up the stairs, maybe. Or if I… if I’m doing something around the house. Nothing major, doctor. I used to be strong, you know. Worked on cars for… for years and years. But that was a long time ago. Now… now I mostly sit. It's just the cough that’s the bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or weight loss along with the cough?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I know of. My wife used to take my temperature, but… well, she’s not here anymore. And weight loss… maybe a little? The clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t weighed myself in ages. Honestly, I just… eat what I can. Don’t have much of an appetite these days. Mostly soup. I don’t keep track of things like that anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s just listen to your lungs and heart, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good, doctor. Whatever you think best. I always liked doctors. My wife… she always said I was too trusting. But what else can you do? You have to trust someone.
DOCTOR: Okay… take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly… good. There's some mild wheezing… and the breath sounds are a little diminished, especially at the bases. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Not terrible, but worth taking a closer look. I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger.
PATIENT: Oxygen… saturation? Is that bad? I don’t remember ever having that checked before. My wife always said… well, never mind. Just do what you need to do, doctor. I trust you. It's just… everything feels so different these days. I barely remember what it felt like to feel good.
DOCTOR: It's just a quick check, Mr. Pavlovic. And your oxygen saturation is a little low… 90%. It should be above 95. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s worth investigating. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Asthma… no, I don’t think so. Not that I remember. When I was a boy, we didn’t go to doctors much. Just… home remedies. My mother knew all sorts of things about herbs and teas. And COPD… is that something bad? I’ve heard a lot of things about sickness, but I can’t keep track of it all. Everything just blurs together after a while. I worked with a lot of car fumes, though… all those years. Is that what that is?
DOCTOR: COPD… Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease… it's a lung condition that can be caused by things like smoking or long-term exposure to fumes. The fumes from working on cars could certainly contribute. I’m going to order a chest x-ray just to get a better look at your lungs. And I want you to do a simple breathing test… spirometry. That will tell us how well your lungs are functioning. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An x-ray… and a breathing test… Sounds… complicated. But alright, doctor. If you think it’s best. I just want to… breathe easier. It's hard to do anything when you’re always coughing and short of breath. My wife used to say I was a stubborn old man. Maybe that’s why I waited so long to come in. Didn't want to bother anyone. But she’s gone now, so… Yes, alright. Do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll get the orders sent to the radiology department. They’ll call you to schedule the x-ray. And the nurse will explain how to do the breathing test. It just involves blowing into a tube. Simple, I promise. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an inhaler. It will help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It won't cure anything, but it should give you some relief.
PATIENT: An inhaler… That sounds… good, actually. Something to help me breathe. I haven't used one of those before. Is it hard to use? I don’t want to do it wrong and make things worse. And the nurse will explain everything? She’s nice, isn’t she? My wife always liked the nurses… they were so kind.
DOCTOR: It’s very easy, Mr. Pavlovic. The nurse will show you exactly how to use it. It’s just a puff of medication, and she'll make sure you get it right. And yes, she's wonderful. She'll take good care of you. While we’re waiting for the nurse, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. My wife always asked me that, but I never had any trouble with anything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the winter, but that’s just the cold, I think. Never had a bad reaction to any pills or anything. I used to take something for my arthritis, years ago, but I don’t remember what it was called. Honestly, doctor, I barely remember what I had for breakfast. It's all a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, that's good. The nurse will be in shortly to go over everything with you. And don’t hesitate to ask her any questions you have. I'll leave you in her capable hands. We'll get those tests scheduled and get you feeling a bit better soon.
PATIENT: Alright, doctor. Thank you. You've been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man like me. It's… comforting, knowing someone cares. Yes, thank you. I'll wait for the nurse. I think… I think I can manage that.
DOCTOR: .
