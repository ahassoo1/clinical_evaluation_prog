DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly? I don’t have a lot of time for this. My throat… it hurts. Has been for a few days, I think. It’s just… a pain. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Ottaviani. We’ll certainly get to the bottom of it. A sore throat can be quite bothersome. Just a few days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. A few. Maybe more. It’s hard to remember, really. Things… blur. It’s not that bad, Doctor. I just need to know if I need… something strong for it? So I can get back to work. Time is money, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about getting back to work, Ms. Ottaviani. We want to address this efficiently, of course. To help me determine the best course of action, could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It hurts. Like… swallowing glass, maybe? Or a very dry… scratch. It’s just unpleasant. I don’t… I don’t do descriptions, Doctor. Is there a pill for it? A strong one?
DOCTOR: I understand it’s difficult to pinpoint, Ms. Ottaviani. “Swallowing glass” gives me a good idea, thank you. Does the pain radiate anywhere – to your ears, perhaps, or down your neck?
PATIENT: Radiate? I don’t know what that means. It just… is in my throat. Look, I work with machines all day. Loud machines. Lots of dust. It’s probably just that. I really don’t think it's anything serious. Can we just skip to the medicine part, please? I have shifts to cover.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. Before we discuss medication, I do need to ask a few more questions to ensure we’re proceeding safely. It’s standard procedure, and it helps me to rule out anything more serious. Have you noticed a fever, chills, or body aches accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? I haven’t taken my temperature. Chills? It gets cold sometimes, doesn’t it? Body aches… I’m always a little achy from the work. It's a physical job! Honestly, Doctor, are you always this… thorough? I’m a grown woman. I know my own body. It’s just a sore throat. Can we please move on? I don’t have time for all of this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. You are right to trust your instincts. Just a few more quick questions, then we can discuss options. Have you noticed any difficulty breathing, or any swelling in your neck?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? No! If I couldn't breathe, wouldn't I be… not here? And swelling? Look at my neck! Do I look swollen? This is ridiculous. I tell you, Doctor, I need something for the pain. Something that will let me get back to work. I haven’t got insurance, so don’t be offering me anything fancy. Just… a simple pill. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to speak your mind, Ms. Ottaviani. I apologize if my questions feel excessive; I simply want to ensure we address this appropriately. Given your work environment with machinery and dust, and the lack of other concerning symptoms as you've described, it is likely a mild irritation. However, without a proper examination, I cannot definitively say what is causing the pain. Would you permit me to quickly look in your throat and listen to your breathing?
PATIENT: Look in my throat? Really? Is that necessary? I don't like people poking around… I suppose… quickly. But quickly, Doctor. And no touching! Just… look. If you must. But I’m telling you now, it’s probably just dust. I need a pill. A simple, quick solution. Then I can go.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. A quick look is all it will be. Just open wide and say "Ah." I'll be as gentle as possible. Alright. It does appear a bit irritated, as you suspected. Your tonsils are slightly swollen, but there’s no sign of anything alarming. I’m also listening to your breathing now. Everything sounds clear. Given the findings, and your lack of fever or other symptoms, it's likely a viral pharyngitis, aggravated by the dust from your work environment.
PATIENT: Viral… what? Dust… I knew it was the dust! So… a pill? Finally? I don’t need a lecture on viruses, Doctor. I just need something to take the pain away so I can go back to work. Is that too much to ask? Honestly, my shifts are depending on me. A simple pill. That’s all I’m asking for.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Ottaviani, that’s not too much to ask at all. Since it appears to be a mild viral irritation, antibiotics aren’t necessary – they wouldn't be effective against a virus. However, we can certainly address the pain. I can recommend an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. They should help with the soreness and inflammation. I also recommend drinking plenty of fluids and resting your voice as much as possible. Given you do not have insurance, I can also suggest some simple home remedies, like gargling with warm salt water, which can provide some relief. Would you like me to write down the dosage for the over-the-counter medication?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter? Salt water? I… I suppose. As long as it gets rid of the pain. I don’t want to waste any more time on this. Just write it down. And keep it simple, Doctor. I don't need complicated instructions. Just the dosage. That’s it. Then I can go. Really, my shifts… they're counting on me. I don't have time for a prolonged illness.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. Here you are. Ibuprofen 200-400 milligrams every 4-6 hours as needed for pain. Do not exceed 1200 milligrams in 24 hours. And remember, plenty of fluids and rest. If the pain worsens, or you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or any other concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention immediately. I understand your concern about your shifts, and I want you to feel better as quickly as possible. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. This… this is enough. I appreciate… I suppose… you not wasting my time. I really must get going. My shifts… Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Ottaviani. I wish you a speedy recovery, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
