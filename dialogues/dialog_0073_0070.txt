DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Korrell, you say? Hmm. Yes. Well, I… moved here. New place. Need… doctor, yes? Medicare, they send me. Just… checking. Old one, very far away. Not good.
DOCTOR: Right. Establishing care. That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Szmyd. So, are you experiencing any particular health concerns now that prompted you to schedule this appointment, or is this primarily a “get-to-know-you” visit?
PATIENT: Concerns? Hmm. Not really. Just… old. Everything is old. Back hurts a little. Always hurts a little. Not new. I work with… faces. Makeup. For the theater. Lots of bending. You know. It’s a job. Is that a concern? Should it be?
DOCTOR: Well, “old” is relative, Mr. Szmyd. And back pain with a job like yours is… not entirely unexpected. It can be a concern, depending on the nature of the pain. Could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Describe…? Like… what color is it? It just… aches. Dull ache. Not sharp. Not… exciting. Like carrying heavy things, maybe? Or sitting too long. It's… there. Always. Not getting worse, I don't think. Hard to say, really. Is this important?
DOCTOR: <stage>I sigh softly, resisting the urge to roll my eyes. Really?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Important. Of course. You are the doctor. I used to… stand more. Now I bend more. They want me to fill out so many papers. Everything is… papers these days. Used to be simpler. You know? Less… bending.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Let’s try this differently. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your back pain right now?
PATIENT: Zero to… ten? Hmm. Ten is… bad, yes? Like broken? I haven’t broken anything. Zero is… nothing? I always feel something. Maybe… three? No, two. Two is good, yes? Not exciting. Just… there. Like a little weight. Is that right? Am I doing this right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine, Mr. Szmyd. Two is… acceptable. Now, does anything specifically make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Worse…? Sitting for long time. Bending… obviously. And… when it is cold. Damp cold. Like today, almost. Makes everything ache more. Old bones, you know. That is what my mother used to say. Everything is bones.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Relieve…? Hmm. Moving. Not sitting. Walking around. A little. And… hot water. Hot shower. Makes it… less. For a little while. Then it comes back. It always comes back. Like everything else.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… What does that mean? I feel… old. Like I said. Maybe a little tired sometimes. But who isn't? Mother had… something with her heart. Very old, she was. I don’t remember what the doctor said. Lots of doctors. Lots of papers. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Let me rephrase. Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have a specific illness, like a problem with your heart, lungs, kidneys, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… Not that I remember. They gave me… pills, sometimes. For my… nerves. The theater is stressful, you know. And… something for my stomach. But not for any… illness. Just… pills. Lots of pills. And papers. My mother… she had the pills too. Everything is pills.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what medications are you currently taking, if you remember?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me see. The little blue ones. For my… worrying. And the white ones. For the… burning. In my stomach. I take them… with water. Every day. I think. Sometimes I forget. Old brain, you know. They come in bottles. Lots of bottles. Is that enough? Is that what you need? I don't remember the names. They change them all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Let’s see if we can find a list of your medications in our system. Do you happen to know the pharmacy you use?
PATIENT: Pharmacy…? Hmm. Down the street, I think. The one with… the green sign. Yes, the green sign. It's… new. Everything is new. I used to go to the other one. Before. Lots of changes. Is that enough? I don't really… pay attention to those things. They give me the pills. That is all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Szmyd. I see you're taking Lorazepam for anxiety and Omeprazole for acid reflux. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? I don't think so. Maybe… dust? Sometimes I sneeze. But that is not an allergy, is it? I'm not… itchy. I used to eat shellfish, but… I don't remember. Is that enough? Everything makes me… stuffy. The air. The dust. The new place. I don't think I have any… real allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll just take your blood pressure, okay?
PATIENT: Listen…? To my heart? Is it… loud? Is something wrong? I just want to make sure everything is… okay. You said you would check. But listening… sounds… serious. Is it bad? Be gentle, please. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Szmyd, it’s just a routine part of the exam. It doesn’t mean anything is wrong. I'm just checking everything is working as it should. I’ll be very gentle. Your heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. I detect a mild murmur, but it’s not concerning at this time. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but with slightly diminished breath sounds. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated. Alright. I've listened to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds… acceptable. Your blood pressure is a little high, which we can monitor.
PATIENT: Elevated…? Murmur…? Diminished…? What does that mean? Is it serious? Is everything… broken? I just moved here. I don't want anything to be broken. I need… quiet. And maybe some tea. Is it bad? Tell me the truth, please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, please try to remain calm. "Elevated" blood pressure simply means it's a little higher than the ideal range. We can manage that with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. The murmur is a common finding, often harmless, particularly with age. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem. And diminished breath sounds just mean your lungs aren’t as strong as they once were, which is also common with age. It doesn’t mean anything is broken, I assure you. However, I would like to order some basic blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health, including your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. I also recommend an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… EKG…? More tests…? It sounds… serious. Is something wrong? Is my heart… bad? I don’t want to be poked and prodded. I just want to be… quiet. Can’t you just tell me if everything is okay? Without all the tests? It’s all so… complicated. I need tea. Definitely tea.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I understand your concerns. The tests are not because I think something is definitely wrong, but to get a baseline understanding of your health. Think of it as preventative care – a way to catch any potential problems early, before they become serious. I wouldn’t order these tests if I believed there was an immediate cause for alarm. We can discuss the results together, and I'll explain everything in detail. In the meantime, I recommend taking things slow, staying hydrated, and avoiding strenuous activity. Would you like me to provide a referral to a cardiologist for a second opinion, just to ease your mind?
PATIENT: Cardiologist…? Another doctor…? More poking and prodding…? It sounds… overwhelming. I just moved here. I don’t even know where to find a grocery store, let alone a cardiologist. Maybe… maybe I just need some time. Some quiet time. And definitely tea. Can’t I just… go home? And think about it? Is that okay? .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. You are absolutely right. You need some time to settle in. We can postpone the further testing. I’ll give you a list of local grocery stores and a referral to a cardiologist if you decide you’d like it later. Here’s a summary of our conversation and the recommendations: basic lifestyle modifications – staying hydrated and resting. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
