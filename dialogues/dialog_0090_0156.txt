DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Kur. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not good. Really runny, you know? Like, diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… annoying, honestly. I think it's been a few weeks, maybe? It's hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Okay. And is it happening constantly throughout the day, or is it more intermittent?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not constantly, no. It comes and goes. Usually it’s worse in the morning, after I eat something… but sometimes it happens other times too. It's just… unpredictable, I guess. I haven’t really been able to figure out what sets it off. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Unpredictable, alright. And what have you been eating?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard question! I eat… normal stuff, I think? My husband does most of the cooking, so I don’t always know exactly what’s in things. Rice, chicken, vegetables… sometimes spicy food. I like samosas, when he makes them. I don't think I've eaten anything really different lately, though. It's just… this keeps happening, even with regular food. It's frustrating. I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: It's alright. It's not always easy to pinpoint these things. “Normal stuff” isn’t terribly specific, unfortunately. And spicy food can be a culprit, though not necessarily the only one. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… um. I don’t think so. I haven’t really… looked, to be honest. I know it sounds awful, but I just… rush to the bathroom, you know? I haven’t been paying attention to… details. Sorry. Is that bad? I mean, should I be looking?
DOCTOR: It’s… advisable to be aware of what's going on. It's important for diagnosis. But no, don’t panic. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything terrible. Alright. And what about fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And I haven’t thrown up. Sometimes I feel a little… queasy, like I might, but it never actually happens. Just kind of a sick feeling in my stomach, along with… everything else. It's mostly just the diarrhea, really. And being really tired. I've been sleeping a lot more lately. Is that… connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: Fatigue along with prolonged diarrhea… alright. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just to the grocery store, and… my sister’s house last month. But that was just a day trip, nothing far. We didn’t go anywhere special. I haven’t left the state in… a long time, actually. So, no, no recent travel. I'm starting to feel a bit silly, just rambling about this. It's probably just something I ate. But it’s been so long… it's worrying me a bit.
DOCTOR: "Just something you ate" after several weeks is… concerning enough to investigate. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to stop, you know? It’s… uncomfortable, and I’m tired of being tired. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: If you could lie down on the table, please. I'll listen to your abdomen first, then I’ll palpate it. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go… Just tell me if I need to do anything special? I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Just relax. I'm going to listen with this stethoscope. Normal bowel sounds… a little hyperactive, perhaps, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to press gently on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Starting here, on the right side… Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, a little. Not bad bad, but… yeah, that feels a bit… sensitive. Like a dull ache, almost. It’s not constant, though. Just when you press there. Is that normal? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Slight tenderness in the lower left quadrant… alright. And what about here, on the left side?
PATIENT: That's… a little more uncomfortable, actually. Not sharp, just… a pressure. It feels kind of… bloated there too, if that makes sense. Like, full of gas, even though I haven’t eaten much. It’s weird. I’m really sorry, I'm not explaining this well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to rule things out. Heart sounds normal. Lungs are clear. Alright. I think we’ll need to run some tests. A stool sample to check for any infection, and some bloodwork to check for inflammation and dehydration. It's likely something bacterial or parasitic, but we need to confirm. And honestly, you really should be more aware of your body. Knowing what’s normal for you is half the battle.
PATIENT: Yeah, you're right. I know, I should be. I just… I don’t really pay attention, I guess. It's embarrassing. A stool sample… okay. And bloodwork… is that going to be a lot? I don't really like needles. I can do it, I just… get nervous. I’m sorry for being difficult.
DOCTOR: It's a standard blood draw, nothing extensive. A few vials. The lab technician is very good; they’re used to nervous patients. I’ll write the orders now. The lab is just down the hall. They'll give you instructions for the stool sample – it needs to be collected in a specific container. Take this to the lab. And try to drink plenty of fluids. Dehydration will only worsen things. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, plenty of fluids. I can do that. No, I don't think so… just… how long will it take to get the results? And… will I need to come back again? I just want to feel normal again, soon.
DOCTOR: The results usually take 2-3 business days. Yes, you’ll need to come back for a follow-up appointment once the results are in. We’ll discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. I'll have the receptionist schedule that for you before you leave. Honestly, these delays are frustrating for everyone. If you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool before your follow-up appointment, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Fever, pain, blood… emergency room. Okay. 2-3 days… I guess I’ll just try to drink a lot of water and… not think about it too much. Thank you, Dr. Kur. I really appreciate it. I think that’s everything?
DOCTOR: Yes. The receptionist will handle the scheduling. Try to rest. And please, pay more attention to your body in the future. Next patient. .
