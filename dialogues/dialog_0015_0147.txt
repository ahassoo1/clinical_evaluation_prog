DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been feeling… a lump, I guess you could call it, low down in my stomach. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A lump, you say. And how long is "a little while," exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably around six weeks, maybe a little longer. At first, I didn’t really notice it, just a bit of discomfort. But it’s gotten… more noticeable, if that makes sense. Not painful, exactly, just… present.
DOCTOR: Present. Alright. And has the size changed at all in those six weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, I think it has. It’s hard to say for sure, but I feel like it’s gotten a bit bigger. Not dramatically, but enough that I’m aware of it more often. It used to just be something I’d notice when I was lying down, and now I can feel it even when I’m moving around.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is this discomfort constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, definitely. It’s not a constant pain. Usually it’s just a dull ache, and it seems to be worse after I’ve been on my feet a lot. Or if I’ve been lifting something. It’s not debilitating or anything, but it’s enough to be… worrying, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you describe the lump itself?
PATIENT: That’s a bit hard to do, honestly. It’s… firm, I think. Not like a fluid-filled bubble, more solid. And it's sort of… roundish, but not perfectly round. Maybe the size of a plum? Though I haven’t actually measured it. I'm not sure if that helps.
DOCTOR: It does, somewhat. Plum-sized, firm, and located low in the abdomen. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in… my bowels? Let me think. No, not really. Everything’s been pretty regular, if you don’t mind me being blunt. No constipation, no diarrhea, nothing like that. Same as always, really.
DOCTOR: Good. And any recent weight loss or fever?
PATIENT: No weight loss, Doctor. If anything, I've maybe gained a little, but that’s probably just from… well, life. And no fever, no chills, nothing like that. I feel generally healthy, aside from this lump, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you sexually active, Mr. Raghunathan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. My wife and I are married. Is that… relevant? I apologize if that’s a personal question.
DOCTOR: It is relevant, as we need a complete medical history. Any new partners recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no new partners. I’ve been married for ten years, and we haven't… well, we haven’t been with anyone else. I hope that answers your question. Is this about… something sexually transmitted? I wasn’t expecting that.
DOCTOR: It’s simply a standard part of the examination process, Mr. Raghunathan. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve taken antibiotics before, pain relievers, and haven’t had any reactions. Nothing keeps me from taking standard medications, thankfully. Is there anything else you need to know about my medical history?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at the moment. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s about it. I generally try to manage things without medication, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see. When I was a child, I had a bad case of pneumonia, so I was in the hospital for a week or so. But aside from that, no, Doctor. No major surgeries, no serious illnesses, nothing like that. I’ve been quite lucky, I think. I haven't really had to deal with much in the way of health problems until this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: That’s… complicated. My parents both passed away a few years ago. My mother died of heart disease, and my father… he had some kind of cancer, but I don’t remember the specifics. It was a long time ago, and I was quite young. I don’t know much about either of their family histories, honestly. Things weren’t always… well, easy. Is that enough information? I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: It is what it is, Mr. Raghunathan. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to palpate your abdomen to get a better feel for this lump. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. No problem. Just let me know if there’s anything I should be aware of. I'll tell you if anything hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m starting on the left side… Now moving to the right… Hmm. Yes, I feel a distinct mass, approximately… two centimeters in diameter. It's firm, slightly irregular in shape, and located in the lower abdomen, midline. It doesn't seem to be particularly tender to the touch, but there is a degree of… resistance. It’s not freely mobile, which is… noteworthy. I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds now. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, though slightly diminished. Not concerning, but something to note.
PATIENT: Okay. That doesn't sound good, does it? Not freely mobile… What does that mean, exactly? And diminished bowel sounds… Is that serious? I'm starting to get a little worried, Doctor. I apologize if I'm being difficult.
DOCTOR: It’s reasonable to be concerned, Mr. Raghunathan. "Not freely mobile" simply means the mass doesn't easily move when I try to feel around it. That can be indicative of several things, and doesn’t necessarily point to anything serious, but it requires further investigation. Diminished bowel sounds can be a sign of a blockage or inflammation, but they can also be caused by something as simple as dehydration. Given the characteristics of this mass – firm, irregular, not mobile, and the slightly diminished bowel sounds – I’m going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The blood work will give us a general overview of your health, and the CT scan will allow us to get a clearer picture of what’s going on inside. It’s too early to make a diagnosis, but these tests are necessary to rule out anything serious. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… invasive. And expensive. What exactly are we looking for with these tests? Is it… could it be cancer? I'm sorry, I know you said it's too early to say, but my mind is racing. And Medicare… will that cover all of this? I don’t want to get a huge bill.
DOCTOR: A CT scan is non-invasive, Mr. Raghunathan. It uses X-rays, but it doesn't require any incisions or injections. As for what we're looking for, we're trying to determine the exact size and location of the mass, and whether it's affecting any surrounding organs. We’ll be looking for any signs of inflammation, infection, or, yes, the possibility of a tumor. You're right to be concerned about costs, and Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, provided they are deemed medically necessary, which, given your symptoms and my findings, they are. However, there may be co-pays or deductibles, so it’s best to check with your Medicare plan for specific coverage details. I have a referral specialist who handles the billing, and they can work with you to understand any out-of-pocket expenses. I understand your anxiety, and it's good that you're asking questions. But again, it’s too early to jump to conclusions. These tests will provide us with more information, and then we can discuss a proper course of action. I’ll need to get the orders for the blood work and CT scan completed. I will also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist. A second opinion is always wise.
PATIENT: Okay. That… that does make me feel a little better. A second opinion is a good idea. And the referral specialist… that’s helpful. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I’m still worried, but I feel… less lost, if that makes sense. When should I expect to hear about scheduling these tests? And is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any specific foods to avoid, or… anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. It’s my job to ensure you feel informed and comfortable. The referral specialist will contact you within 24-48 hours to schedule the CT scan and arrange your appointment with the gastroenterologist. They’ll likely need your insurance information and preferred dates/times. In the meantime, there’s no need to restrict your diet or avoid any specific foods. Continue to eat a normal, healthy diet. Stay hydrated, and if you experience any significant changes in your symptoms – such as severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or inability to pass stool – please contact my office immediately. Otherwise, just try to relax and avoid unnecessary stress. I’ll be available to discuss the results of the tests once they’re completed. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you again for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. I’ll wait for the referral specialist to contact me. I hope everything turns out alright. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. I understand your anxiety, and I want to reassure you that we’re taking this seriously. We’ll work through this together. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
