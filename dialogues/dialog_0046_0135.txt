DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is Glowka, yes? Very pleased to meet you too. I am Gerhard Radillo. I have… a problem with my ear. There is… liquid coming from it. It started, hmm, maybe one week ago. Not a lot, but it is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Yes, Glowka is correct, and it's a pleasure to meet you as well, Gerhard. Thank you for coming in. Okay, liquid coming from your ear for about a week. That is concerning, and good you came to get it checked out. Could you describe the liquid a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm. Describe… yes. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit… yellow, but not much. Not thick. Very watery. And… there is no pain. No fever. Just… the liquid. It makes… a small smell. Not a bad smell, but… a smell. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Clear or slightly yellow, watery discharge with a smell… and no pain or fever. That helps me start to narrow things down. Do you feel any fullness or pressure in your ear, or any difficulty hearing?
PATIENT: Difficulty hearing… yes, a little. Not much, but… when people speak softly, I must ask them to repeat. It is… better when I turn my head. And no… no pressure. Not feeling full, no. It is just… quiet. Like… a cloth is over the ear, sometimes. Very small, though. Not often.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent muffled hearing that's better when you turn your head. That’s good information. Have you noticed any dizziness or ringing in your ears at all?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no. No dizziness. I am… steady. And ringing… hmm. Sometimes, yes. Very quiet ringing. Like… a small insect buzzing. Not always. Comes and goes. Mostly at night, I think. I do not… pay much attention to it. It is… small.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent, quiet ringing, mostly at night. And no dizziness. Have you had any ear infections in the past, or any previous problems with your ears that you can remember?
PATIENT: Ear infections… yes, when I was a young boy. Many years ago. In Somalia. Very painful, I remember. But… not since. No problems… until this liquid started. I have… had the usual colds, of course. But nothing… serious with the ears. Doctor… is this… bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's good to know you had ear infections as a child. It’s not uncommon to have recurring issues if you’ve had them before. Let’s take a look at your ear. It's good you're asking if it's serious – it’s always best to be cautious. I'm going to use an otoscope to examine your ear canal. It may feel a little cool, but it shouldn't be painful. Would you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will sit. An otoscope… is that the thing you look in the ear with? Very good. I am ready. Please be gentle. And… if it is painful, I will tell you immediately. I do not… like pain. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, and I will absolutely be gentle. I'll let you know what I'm seeing as I go. Okay… I see some redness in your ear canal, and there is some fluid present. The eardrum itself appears intact, which is good, but it does look slightly… cloudy. It's difficult to get a really clear view with the fluid. I don’t see any signs of a ruptured eardrum, thankfully. Based on what I’m seeing, it looks like you likely have otitis externa, also known as swimmer's ear, or an infection of the outer ear canal. The fluid discharge, redness, and cloudiness of the eardrum are consistent with that. The slight hearing difficulty also fits. However, to be certain, I'd like to collect a sample of the discharge to send to the lab for testing. It will help us confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific type of bacteria causing the infection, so we can choose the most effective treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Otitis externa… swimmer's ear? I do not swim. But… I wash my face every day. Is that… related? And a sample of the liquid… yes. That sounds… sensible. If it helps you know exactly what is wrong, then yes. I will do whatever you think is best. Will it be… uncomfortable? I am… a little nervous about having things taken from my ear. I do not… like things in my ear.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, and it’s good you’re asking. Washing your face isn’t likely the direct cause, but sometimes moisture in the ear canal can create a favorable environment for bacteria to grow. Taking the sample shouldn’t be painful, but it might be a little uncomfortable, like a quick, gentle swabbing. I’ll use a sterile swab to collect a small amount of the discharge. It will only take a moment. I’ll be very careful. Would you like me to explain the procedure step-by-step as I do it, so you know exactly what to expect?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain. Very slowly. And… if it hurts, I will tell you immediately. I promise. I do not want to… be surprised. Just… tell me everything you are doing. That would be… very good. I am… ready when you are. But slowly, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. Slowly is absolutely fine. Okay, so what I’m going to do is gently pull your ear slightly up and back – this helps straighten the ear canal so I can see a little better. Then, I’ll insert a very thin, sterile swab into your ear canal, just enough to collect a small sample of the liquid. It shouldn’t go very far at all. It may feel a little cool or slightly strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. If you feel any discomfort at any point, please let me know immediately, and I'll stop. I’ll then gently remove the swab and send it to the lab for analysis. The whole process will only take a minute or two. Are you comfortable with me proceeding?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. Slowly, you said. And… tell me when you are pulling. I do not… like surprises. I am… trying to be brave. Pulling now, you said? Very good. Do it… slowly. I am… ready. But tell me first. Always tell me first.
DOCTOR: You are being very brave, thank you. I will absolutely tell you everything before I do it. Okay, I’m going to gently pull your ear up and back… now. Just a little bit… is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… alright. A little… strange. But not painful. Just… different. Is that the right word? Different. Please… continue. But slowly. And keep telling me. I… appreciate you telling me. Very good. You are… very careful. Continue.
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully. And you’re right, “different” is a perfect word. Okay, now I’m going to gently insert the swab into your ear canal… just a little bit. This may feel a little cool… just a tiny bit further… I'm collecting a sample now… Just a moment… almost finished…
PATIENT: A little… tickly. But not… bad. Just tickly. Very small tickle. Please… hurry. I do not… like things in my ear. But… I am being brave. Almost finished, you said? Is it… over soon? Very good. Please… hurry. Just… tickly. And… small. Very small.
DOCTOR: You are doing so well, and it is almost over. Just a moment more… Okay, all done! That was very good, Gerhard. You handled that perfectly. I'll now send this sample to the lab, and the results should be back in about 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you some ear drops to help with the infection. They’re a topical antibiotic and will help clear up the bacteria.
PATIENT: Ear drops… good. Anything to get it… better. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours… alright. I will wait. Antibiotic… yes. Good. Thank you, Doctor. You were… very gentle. And you… told me everything. That was… very kind. What… what do I do with the ear drops? How… how much? And… for how long? I must… know. Is there anything… else I should do? Keep it dry? Do not… swim? I must… know everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gerhard. I'm glad I could help put you at ease. Okay, so the ear drops are called Ciprofloxacin Otic. You'll want to tilt your head to the side, so the affected ear is facing upwards. Then, gently squeeze 4 drops into your ear canal. After you’ve put the drops in, gently pull on your earlobe a few times to help distribute them. You should do this twice a day for 7 days, even if your symptoms start to improve before then. It’s important to complete the full course of treatment to ensure the infection is completely cleared. As for other things you should do: yes, keep your ear as dry as possible. Avoid swimming, getting water in your ear when you shower, and try not to use cotton swabs inside your ear canal, as these can push bacteria further in. You can gently dry the outer ear with a towel after showering or swimming, but don’t insert anything into the ear canal. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Seven days… twice a day. Four drops. Keep it dry. No… cotton swabs. Yes. I understand. No swimming. Seven days. Four drops. Twice a day. No cotton swabs. Keep it dry. But… what if it… doesn’t get better? What if… it gets worse? Should I… come back? And… is it contagious? Could I… give this to someone else? My daughter… she visits next week. I must… know. I worry. Is it… a serious problem? Or… just annoying? I am… a little scared.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good and important questions, Gerhard. It's perfectly understandable to be worried. If your symptoms don't start to improve within 3-5 days, or if they get worse at any point – if you experience increased pain, fever, or any new symptoms – please come back immediately. Otitis externa is not highly contagious, but it is possible to spread it through sharing towels or getting water contaminated with bacteria in someone else’s ear. So, just be mindful of sharing towels, and make sure your daughter knows to avoid getting water in your ear if she’s helping you shower. In most cases, otitis externa isn't a serious problem, especially if it’s treated promptly. However, if left untreated, it can lead to more serious complications, like a more severe infection or even hearing loss, which is why it's so important to follow the treatment plan and come back if your symptoms don’t improve. Do you feel a little better now that we've discussed it all?
PATIENT: Yes. A little. Seven days… four drops. No swimming. Avoid sharing… towels. Come back if… worse. Not… serious, if treated. Yes. That… is good to know. Thank you, Doctor. You have… been very helpful. And very… patient. I ask many questions, I know. But… I worry. Is there… anything else I need to remember? Anything at all? I want to… be sure. And… how much do I owe? I have… my insurance card.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gerhard. Please, don’t apologize for asking questions – it’s my job to make sure you feel informed and comfortable. It's much better to ask than to worry in silence. Let's see… I think we've covered everything. Just remember to complete the full 7-day course of ear drops, even if you start to feel better, and keep your ear dry. Now, let me take a look at your insurance information… It looks like your insurance will cover most of the cost. Your copay today will be $35. I’m glad I could help, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any further questions or concerns.
