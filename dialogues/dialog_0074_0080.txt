DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Reisig. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's not really a visit visit, if you know what I mean. Just need some forms filled out, that's all. Medicare sent me over.
DOCTOR: I see. Medicare sometimes requires updated forms, yes. I’m happy to help with that. Just to be thorough, even with paperwork, I like to get a little background. It helps me understand your overall health picture, should any questions arise. Would you mind if I ask a few quick questions about your medical history, just to ensure everything is accurate when I complete the forms?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, that's fine. No problem at all. Ask away. I don't have a lot of complicated history, thankfully. Mostly just the usual bumps and bruises from work, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. To start, could you tell me about any current medications you are taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's about it. And maybe ibuprofen for a sore back after a long day, but nothing regularly. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, like latex or bee stings?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My mom always said I had a cast-iron stomach!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Now, have you had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant in the past?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that's about it. Nothing since then. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, my grandpa on my mom’s side had diabetes, I think. And her sister had some heart trouble when she got older. But other than that, not really. Most of my family lived pretty long lives, all things considered. We're Blackfeet, you know, and we're pretty resilient folks.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am aware of the strong traditions and health practices within the Blackfeet Tribe. Thank you for sharing that. And to complete the history, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I work as a control and valve installer – it's pretty physical work, lots of bending and lifting. So I'm on my feet a lot. I try to eat healthy, mostly, but it’s hard when you’re traveling for work sometimes. And I don't really have a lot of time for hobbies these days, to be honest. Just trying to keep up with everything. I'm married, though, and we enjoy spending time with family when we can. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you have a physically demanding job. Do you experience any pain or discomfort related to your work, or any issues with your energy levels?
PATIENT: Sometimes my back aches, like I said. Especially after a long day. And, honestly, I get pretty tired at the end of the week. But I just figured it was from working so hard. It's not anything serious, I don't think. I've just gotten used to it, you know? I’m not one to complain.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your resilience, Ms. Fabing. Even if you’re used to it, it's still worth noting. To get a better understanding, could you describe the back pain a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly in my lower back. It kind of feels like a dull ache, and it gets worse when I bend over or lift something heavy. Sometimes it shoots down my leg a little, but not often. And like I said, it's better after I rest for a bit. It hasn’t kept me from working, but it’s definitely there. I try to stretch when I can, but it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Just to be thorough, and since you mentioned pain radiating down your leg, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. It will just involve checking your reflexes, strength, and range of motion in your back and legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, that's fine. If you think it's a good idea. I trust your judgment. Don't want to ignore anything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie down on the examination table, we’ll get started. Could you please bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little tight. There we go. How's that?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, could you please lie on your back?
PATIENT: Alright, all set. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, just squeeze my hand as tight as you can… good. And now push your heel down against my hand… excellent. Now, can you lift your leg up while I hold it down?
PATIENT: There. It feels a little weak, doesn’t it? Especially that leg.
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed a slight weakness on your right leg compared to your left, and some discomfort with the range of motion in your lower back. I also noted tenderness upon palpation of the lumbar spine. Based on what you've told me and the results of the exam, it sounds like you may have a lumbar strain, possibly with some nerve irritation. However, to rule out anything more serious, such as a disc issue, I would like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… hmm. Well, if you think it’s necessary. I’m not a big fan of radiation, but I trust your judgment. Better to be safe than sorry, I guess. When can we do that?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about radiation exposure, and we will use the lowest dose possible. The radiology department is just down the hall, and we can usually get it done within the hour. While we wait for the results, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and applying ice to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. I’ll also have the nurse bring in a form for a physical therapy referral. Physical therapy can be very helpful in strengthening your back muscles and improving your range of motion. Would you like me to explain that in more detail?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Dr. Reisig. Yes, please. I don't know much about physical therapy. Is it... painful? And how often would I have to go?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Physical therapy involves exercises and stretches designed to strengthen your back muscles, improve your flexibility, and reduce your pain. It’s usually not painful, but you may experience some mild discomfort as you start to work those muscles. The therapist will tailor the exercises to your specific needs and pain level. Typically, you would start with 2-3 sessions per week for a few weeks, and then gradually decrease the frequency as you improve. The therapist will teach you exercises you can do at home to maintain your progress. They’ll also provide guidance on proper posture and body mechanics to prevent future injuries. Would you like me to have the nurse explain the details of the referral process and schedule your first appointment?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be great. Scheduling it would be a big help. I don't really have the energy to make a lot of phone calls right now. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Reisig. It makes me feel a lot better knowing what’s going on and what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fabing. I’m glad I could help. I’ll let the nurse know to come in and discuss the referral and schedule your appointment. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions or concerns. We'll get those X-ray results back as quickly as possible, and then we can discuss the next steps in your treatment plan. I’ll also have her bring in the forms for Medicare completion. Just to reiterate, we’ve discussed your history, a physical exam has been performed, and we’re ordering an X-ray to rule out any serious issues. We’ll proceed with a physical therapy referral and complete the necessary paperwork. Do you have any questions before I have the nurse come in?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. I really appreciate your patience and thoroughness, Dr. Reisig. This has been a lot more helpful than I expected, to be honest. Just getting some answers is a relief. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fabing. My pleasure entirely. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. .
