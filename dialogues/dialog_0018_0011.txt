DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too. Look, I ain't got all day. Just need a paper signed, that's all. Something about… getting somethin' done. A procedure. My… someone told me I needed clearance before I could do it. That's it. Don’t need a life story, just the signin'.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you need a form signed for a procedure. To ensure I can complete this accurately and responsibly, could you tell me a little more about what procedure you are needing clearance for?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don’t remember all the details! It’s… for my face. That’s all you need to know. Some kinda… fixin'. A young fella at the shop told me about it. Said I needed to see a doctor first. Honestly, it’s probably not important. Just sign the paper, please. I got appointments.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. However, even if it seems minor to you, it's my professional responsibility to gather some basic information before signing any medical documentation. It helps ensure your safety and that the procedure is appropriate for you. Could you perhaps recall the name of the "young fella" at the shop, or the name of the shop itself?
PATIENT: Shop? Boy? What difference does that make? It was… down by the highway. Big sign. Lots of antennas. I fix towers, lady. Radio stuff. Cellular. Don't have time to remember names and places. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I just need a signature. You makin' this hard.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me about your work, Mr. Honcoop. That does help me understand a little more about your situation. Since you work with towers and radio equipment, is it possible this procedure has something to do with any work-related injuries or exposures?
PATIENT: Injuries? Lady, I been climbin' towers since before you were born! A few scrapes, maybe. A pulled muscle now and then. But no, this ain’t about work. It’s… personal. Just wanna look a little better, alright? I ain’t about to tell you my life story. This is gettin' outta hand. Are you gonna sign the paper or not? I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for privacy, Mr. Honcoop. However, signing a medical clearance form without knowing what procedure it's for would be irresponsible on my part. It's important to ensure the procedure is safe and won't interact with any existing medical conditions you may have. Perhaps we can approach this differently. Could you tell me what specifically you are hoping to address with this procedure?
PATIENT: Look, I told you! It’s my FACE. What more do you need to know? Some wrinkles, some saggin'. Old age, alright? I want it tightened up. Smoothed out. That’s it! A facelift, maybe? I don't know the fancy names! Just… fix my face so I don’t look like a prune. Now can we PLEASE get this over with? I got things to do. .
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Honcoop. So you are considering a facelift to address wrinkles and sagging skin on your face. That’s very helpful. Before I can sign anything, I do need to ask a few brief questions, just to ensure this is appropriate for you. Have you had any prior surgeries of any kind?
