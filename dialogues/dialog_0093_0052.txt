DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Bakan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye as well, Doctor. Right then, well, it's this nausea I've been havin' o' a mornin'. It's been goin' on for... oh, a good couple o' weeks now, I'd say. And it's not like a proper sick feelin', more like just a queasy stomach that won't settle. It's a bit bothersome, ye ken? Especially since the nurse told me it might be somethin' to do with my heart.
DOCTOR: I understand. Nausea for a couple of weeks, primarily in the mornings, and it's more of a queasy feeling than outright sickness. And you mentioned the nurse alluded to a possible cardiac connection, is that correct?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. She said somethin' about my heart not pumpin' as well as it should be, and that can sometimes cause it. I’ve been diagnosed with heart failure, ye see. Not a new thing, been keepin' an eye on it for years now. But this nausea... it's different. Usually, I just feel tired or a bit breathless, but this is... unsettling. I'm hopin' it's not somethin' serious on top o' everything else.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying that, Mr. Benic. Established heart failure, being monitored for years – that’s important information. And you're right to bring up the difference in symptoms. It's always best to investigate a new development. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the timing of this nausea a bit more precisely?
PATIENT: Aye, of course. Well, it usually starts not long after I wake up. I try to get up around seven, and by half past, I'm beginnin' to feel it. It's not constant, mind ye, it comes in waves. Like a wee bit o' seasickness, but not as strong. It usually lasts for... oh, maybe an hour or two, then fades away. I've noticed it's worse if I lie flat for too long, and a bit better if I sit up. Does that make sense? I'm no' good at explainin' these things, sometimes.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Benic. Mornings, onset around 7:30 am, lasting an hour or two, worsened by lying flat, improved by sitting up. Very helpful. Now, have you noticed anything else accompanying this nausea?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I've been a wee bit more tired than usual, but that could just be the heart, aye? I’ve been gettin’ a good night's sleep, though, so that’s somethin’. And… I’ve been feelin’ a bit more breathless than usual when I walk up the stairs, but again, that’s been happenin’ on and off for a while now. Oh! And I've lost a wee bit o' appetite, but nothin' major. I just don't fancy a big breakfast like I used to. Is that important? It's hard tellin' what's connected to what, with this heart o' mine.
DOCTOR: Everything you’ve described is important, Mr. Benic. Increased fatigue, slight worsening of breathlessness with exertion, and a decreased appetite – those are all things we need to consider. And you are right, with established heart failure, it can be difficult to differentiate new symptoms from existing ones. Now, let's talk about your medications. Could you please tell me what medications you are currently taking for your heart, and for any other conditions you might have?
PATIENT: Aye, of course. Right then, let me see... I’ve got... Lisinopril, that's for my blood pressure and heart. I take 20 milligrams o' that every mornin'. And then there’s Bisoprolol, that slows my heart down a bit, 5 milligrams o' that, also every mornin’. Oh, and I take Furosemide, that's a water tablet, 40 milligrams, once a day. Sometimes I take a wee bit o' potassium, when my levels are low, but the doctor doesn't prescribe it regular like. That’s it, I think. Not much else. I take a bit o' paracetamol now and then for aches and pains, but that’s all. I keep a list at home, but my memory’s not what it used to be, so I'm hopin' I haven't forgotten anythin'.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Benic. Lisinopril 20mg, Bisoprolol 5mg, Furosemide 40mg, and PRN potassium. Very good. And no known allergies to any medications, correct?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. No allergies that I'm aware o'. I've been takin' these pills for years now, as ye know, and I've never had a reaction to any o' them. My skin doesn't get itchy, no trouble breathin', nothin' like that. I'm generally a pretty sturdy fellow, though I suppose this heart failure is makin' me a bit more cautious these days. I try to be mindful o' what I eat and how much I exert myself.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Benic. And being mindful of your body is certainly wise. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Aye, well, I used to smoke, years ago. Back in my younger days, when it was considered… fashionable, ye could say. I gave it up around… oh, twenty years ago now, give or take. Haven’t touched a cigarette since. It wasn't easy, mind ye, but I knew it was best for my health, especially with my heart condition. I'm glad I made that decision. It's a habit I'm pleased to have left behind.
DOCTOR: Very good. That’s excellent. And how about alcohol, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Aye, I enjoy a wee dram now and then. Mostly just with me supper, a small glass o' whisky. Not every day, mind ye. Maybe two or three times a week, if that. I don't drink to excess, never have. Just a little somethin' to relax with after a long day. It doesn’t bother my heart, or at least, it hasn’t so far. I'm careful not to overdo it. Do ye think that’s alright? I always worry about these things, ye ken.
DOCTOR: Occasional alcohol consumption, such as a small glass of whisky a few times a week, is generally acceptable, provided it doesn’t interfere with your medications or exacerbate your heart condition. As you said, moderation is key. Now, finally, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of heart disease, or other significant medical conditions, in your family?
PATIENT: Aye, there are, sadly. My father had a bad heart. He had angina for years, and eventually, he succumbed to a heart attack when I was still a young man. My mother, she had high blood pressure, and she had a stroke towards the end o’ her life. And my sister, she’s havin’ trouble with her blood pressure as well, but she's still keepin' on. So, aye, there's a bit of a family history o' heart trouble, I’m afraid. Which is why I'm always a bit worried about mine, ye see. It runs in the family, I suppose. Do ye think that makes it more likely I'm experiencin’ this nausea?
DOCTOR: It certainly contributes to the overall picture, Mr. Benic. A family history of heart disease and stroke does increase your risk. Now, given your history of heart failure, your current symptoms of nausea, fatigue, and decreased appetite, and your family history, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I trust yer judgement. Aye, go ahead and listen to me heart and lungs. I’ll do me best to lie still, though I’m a big fella, so it might be a bit o’ a squeeze! Palpate me abdomen, ye say? Aye, go right ahead. I'm used to doctor's visits, sadly enough. I just hope ye can find out what's causin' all this bother. Do ye think it could be somethin' serious? I'm tryin' not to worry, but it's hard, ye ken.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Benic, and I’ll do my best to get to the bottom of this. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please lie back and relax. Alright, I’m listening now. Your heart rate is a little elevated, at 82 beats per minute, and your rhythm is regular. I’m detecting a faint S3 gallop, which can indicate heart failure, and I’m hearing some mild crackles in your lower lungs, which suggests some fluid retention. Now, I’m palpating your abdomen. There’s some mild tenderness in your upper right quadrant, but no significant distension or masses. Your liver feels slightly enlarged. Your blood pressure is 140/90 in your right arm and 142/92 in your left arm. Based on the physical exam, I’m noting an elevated heart rate, an S3 gallop, mild crackles in the lungs, tenderness in the upper right quadrant, and slightly enlarged liver. All this, combined with your symptoms and history, suggests your heart failure may be worsening and could be contributing to the nausea and decreased appetite. The liver tenderness warrants further investigation as well.
PATIENT: Och, that doesn’t sound too good, does it? A worsenin’ o’ the heart failure… that’s what I was feared. And me liver bein’ tender… what could that be, Doctor? Is it somethin’ to do with the heart? Or is it somethin’ else entirely? I’m beginnin’ to worry more and more. What do ye think we should do next? Do ye think I need to be admitted to hospital? I’d rather not, if I’m honest. I've got me wee bit o' a garden to tend to… and I don’t want to be stuck in a bed all day. Is there anythin’ I can do at home to help? Anythin’ I should be avoidin’? Please, Doctor, tell me what's happenin’.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Benic, and I'll do my best to explain everything clearly. The findings do suggest your heart failure may be progressing, and the liver tenderness is concerning. It could be related to the heart failure—congestion can cause liver engorgement—but it’s also important to rule out other possibilities, such as a gallbladder issue or early signs of liver disease. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, a kidney function panel, and a BNP level, which measures the level of a hormone released by the heart in response to strain. We will also need an electrocardiogram to assess your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to evaluate for fluid in your lungs. Regarding admission to the hospital, I don’t think that’s necessary at this moment. However, we need to act promptly to investigate the cause of these symptoms and determine the best course of treatment. I'm going to prescribe you a low-sodium diet, and I recommend you strictly limit your fluid intake to 2 liters per day. I’d also like you to monitor your weight daily. Any sudden weight gain, more than 2 pounds in a day, should be reported to me immediately. Do you have any questions about that, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Aye, that's... a fair bit to take in. Low sodium, limit fluids, monitor me weight… I can manage that, I think. I'm not much of a cook anyway, so the low sodium won't be too difficult. And I've got a wee bit o' a scale in the bathroom, so I can keep track o' the weight. But what about the blood tests and the ECG and the chest X-ray? Where will I have those done? And how long will it take to get the results? I'm worried about waitin' around, ye ken, and the symptoms gettin' worse while we're waitin'. And... what if it is somethin' serious? What if it's me liver? I'm hopin' it's not too bad. Och, I'm gettin' all worked up now. Please, Doctor, tell me what to expect. And how long will I need to wait for an appointment? I don't want to be left in the dark.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Benic. It's natural to be anxious when facing uncertainty. I'm going to write you a referral to the lab for the blood tests. They’re located just across the street here at the medical center. They’ll need a fasting blood sample, so please don’t eat or drink anything after midnight tonight. The lab can schedule the ECG at the same time. I'm also writing an order for a chest X-ray, which you can have done at the imaging center down the hall. They usually can fit you in within 24 hours. Typically, the lab results come back within 24 to 48 hours. Once I have those, along with the X-ray results, I will review them thoroughly and contact you immediately to discuss the findings and the next steps. I will personally call you, Mr. Benic, I won’t leave you waiting. I want to assure you, we're taking this seriously. If your symptoms worsen significantly—such as increased shortness of breath, swelling in your ankles, or chest pain—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate. As for what if it is something serious with your liver… we will cross that bridge when we come to it. It's important to get a definitive diagnosis before jumping to conclusions. There are many potential causes of liver issues, and not all of them are life-threatening. I have an opening on Monday afternoon, August 5th, to review the results with you. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Aye, Monday afternoon sounds good. August 5th, I’ll mark it in me calendar. Thank ye for callin' me personally, Doctor, that does ease me mind a wee bit. And I'll be sure to get these tests done as soon as possible. Fastin’ after midnight… I can manage that. And I'll remember to go to the emergency room if things get worse. I appreciate ye explainin' everything so clearly, and for bein' so patient with me. I'm an old man, and I worry easily, ye ken. I think… I think that's all me questions for now. I’m just hopin’ it’s not too bad. Thank ye again, Doctor Bakan. I'll see ye on Monday, then. Is there anythin’ else I should be doin’ between now and then? Anythin’ I should be avoidin’? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. And please don't apologize for being an “old man”—age comes with wisdom, and it's perfectly natural to worry. Between now and Monday, continue to follow the low-sodium diet, limit your fluids to 2 liters a day, and monitor your weight daily. Avoid strenuous activity, and get plenty of rest. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, especially shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your ankles, please don't hesitate to contact me or go to the emergency room. I have given the nurse your medication list, and she will provide you with a pamphlet on heart failure management. I will see you on Monday, August 5th, and we will discuss the results together. In the meantime, try to relax and take care of yourself. If anything comes up before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good weekend, Mr. Benic.
PATIENT: .
