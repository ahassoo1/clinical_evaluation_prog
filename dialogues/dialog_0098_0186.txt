DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lamark’s the name. Just here for a check-up, team tryouts, you know? Gotta make sure I’m still good to go. Don’t wanna fall apart on ‘em.
DOCTOR: Team tryouts, alright. Good idea to get checked out beforehand. It's always best to be sure. Just a routine check-up, or are you experiencing any particular symptoms or concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing special. Just… getting older, I guess. No aches, pains, or anything like that. Feeling alright, really. Just want to be cleared, if you know what I mean. Don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's wise to be proactive. Getting a baseline assessment is a good idea. Alright, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Back home, things are… different. Didn't have much need for doctors, to be honest. Worked outside, mostly. Kept me pretty healthy, actually. Haven’t been to one in… oh, must be ten years or more. Maybe longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, ten years or more since your last check-up. In that time, have you been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital. Knock on wood. Broken a bone or two working, but never needed to go anywhere for it. Just wrapped it up and kept going.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to hear. And have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. No surgeries. Never needed ‘em. I’m a pretty simple guy, Doctor. Never had much trouble with my insides.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, sometimes family history can be important. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. Family’s… far away. Haven’t seen most of ‘em in years. I know my father, he was strong. Worked hard his whole life. My mother, she… she wasn’t as lucky. Got sick when I was young. Something with her lungs, I think. But I don’t really know the details. Everything was… quiet back then, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not always easy to have those details readily available. Something with the lungs… alright. And how about any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing. Can eat anything, take anything. Never had a reaction to anything in my life. I’m pretty lucky, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. Just… water, mostly. And sometimes tea. Old habits, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, that simplifies things nicely. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Uh… well, I work. A lot. Mostly outside, like I said. And I try to stay active. Walk, lift things… keep the body moving. Don’t smoke, don’t drink much. Pretty simple life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, just one last question for the history. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. You’re the doctor. You’re askin’ all the right questions. Just wanna get this over with so I can get back to work, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam then. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just take a look around. It won’t take long. Could you please sit up and lean forward?
PATIENT: Sounds good. Let's get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Lungs sound clear, a little bit of normal breath sounds. Now I’ll listen to your heart. Heart rate is regular, a little bit elevated perhaps, but that could be from talking. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little bit on the higher side, but we’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are good, normal response. Overall, everything seems alright so far. Now, let’s take a look at your throat, ears and eyes.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just tell me if anything feels weird. Don’t want to be surprised, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, just open your mouth for me… good. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Now, let's take a look in your ears… Ears look clear as well, no signs of infection. And finally, I'll just check your eyes… Eyes look good, normal response. Everything seems to be within normal limits, Mr. Kingan. However, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and considering your family history, I think it would be wise to do some blood work to get a better picture of your overall health. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood work… uh. That sounds… complicated. Is it necessary? I just need to be cleared for the tryouts, you know? Don’t wanna get bogged down in stuff if it’s not needed. How much would it cost?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It is a bit more involved, but it’s a good preventative measure. The blood work would help us check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and overall health. It’s not a requirement for the tryouts, but it would give us a baseline reading and help rule out any potential issues. As for the cost, since you’re not insured, it would be around $150-$200 for the basic panel. We can discuss payment options if needed. Alternatively, there are some community clinics that offer free or reduced-cost blood work. We could look into those as well. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: $200… that’s… a lot. I didn’t expect it to be so expensive. Hmm. Look, is there anything immediately wrong? You said my blood pressure was a little high, but is that something I need to worry about right now? I just wanna make sure I’m good to go for the tryouts, and I don't want to spend a lot of money if it's not necessary.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but it's not dangerously high. It could be a temporary spike due to stress or anxiety, or it could be something we need to monitor more closely. Without the blood work, it's difficult to say for sure. For the tryouts, you are likely physically able to participate. However, I would recommend being mindful of your blood pressure. Avoid excessive exertion, stay hydrated, and listen to your body. If you experience any dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath, stop immediately. I can clear you for the tryouts with the caveat that you monitor your blood pressure and follow up with me if you experience any concerning symptoms. We can also discuss lifestyle modifications – like diet and exercise – to help lower your blood pressure naturally. What do you think about that approach?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds reasonable. I can do that. Monitor it, take it easy, and come back if something feels wrong. No need for the blood work right now, then. Just… tell me what I should look for, if that makes sense. What exactly should I worry about? And what kind of diet and exercise are we talkin’ about? I’m used to hard work, but… fancy diets ain’t really my thing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a perfectly reasonable plan. As for what to look for, pay attention to any symptoms like severe headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or vision changes. If you experience any of those, stop immediately and seek medical attention. As for diet and exercise, it doesn’t have to be fancy! Focus on eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Reduce your intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive salt. And for exercise, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days of the week. Walking, jogging, swimming – anything that gets your heart rate up a bit. We can also discuss reducing caffeine intake, as that can sometimes elevate blood pressure. I'll write down a summary of these recommendations for you. I also have some pamphlets on healthy eating and exercise that you can take with you. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, that sounds pretty straightforward. Walking, eat better, watch for headaches… I can do that. The pamphlets would be good, thanks. Alright. I think that’s everything then. I appreciate you not makin’ me jump through too many hoops. Gotta get back to work, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. Here's a note clearing you for tryouts with the recommendations we discussed. Please don't hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if you have any concerns. I’m glad I could help. And good luck with the tryouts, Mr. Kingan!
PATIENT: Thanks, Doctor. Appreciate it.
