DOCTOR: Good morning, Chelise. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. Hyperlipidemia, it called it. I don't really understand all that fancy writing, but it seemed important enough to come in and get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, hyperlipidemia… high cholesterol. Yes, it is good you came in to get that looked at. It’s very common, and we can definitely figure out what’s going on and how to manage it. Do you recall when the lab work was done, or who ordered it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… July 18th, I believe. My regular doctor, Doctor Van Derlyn, ordered it. Just part of my yearly check-up, I think. He always does a big panel of tests. He’s a good doctor, but… doesn’t always explain things very well. That's why I'm here, really. To understand what it means.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 18th with Dr. Van Derlyn… yes, I see the results here. It does show your cholesterol is a little elevated. And you’re right, it’s important to understand what that means. To start, do you have any family history of high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father… he had a heart attack when he was 68. And my mother's brother… he had a stroke. So, yes, it runs in the family, I suppose. They were both Dutch, like me. Not the healthiest eaters, either, if I'm being honest. Lots of fried food, and cheese… and not much exercise.
DOCTOR: Okay, that family history is definitely important to know. So, a heart attack in your father and a stroke in your uncle… that does increase your risk. And you're right to mention lifestyle factors. Now, thinking about your lifestyle… do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Well… not as much as I should, I suppose. I used to walk a lot more, but my knees aren't what they used to be. I try to do some gardening, that's good exercise, I think. And I walk around the house, of course. But a dedicated exercise routine? No, not really. I prefer a nice cup of tea and a good book, if I'm being honest. Is that terrible?
DOCTOR: Not terrible at all! Everyone has their preferences. And gardening is good activity. We just need to see how much that’s contributing to your overall health. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… breakfast is usually toast with a little jam and coffee. Lunch is often a sandwich – turkey or ham, nothing fancy. And dinner… well, that varies. Sometimes I cook a nice piece of fish with vegetables. Other times… it’s easier to just have a frozen meal. I try to have fruit, but I do have a sweet tooth. Chocolate, mostly. And cheese. I do like my cheese. Sorry. I feel like I'm just listing all my bad habits.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize! It's helpful for me to get a realistic picture. It sounds like a fairly typical diet. We can definitely look at making some small changes, if you’re open to that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Never had one. I can take most things, which is good. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I take a vitamin D supplement, that's all. Doctor Van Derlyn said my levels were a little low last year.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and just the vitamin D supplement. Good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general health. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I don’t mind at all. I haven't had a full check-up in a while, so it's probably a good idea. Just let me know if anything feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, if you could just sit back and relax. Blood pressure is 142/88, a little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally. I’ll just take a quick listen to your back as well. Lungs clear to auscultation. Okay, everything sounds pretty good. Your weight is 124 pounds and your height is 199 centimeters, confirming what we have on record. All good. Now, before we talk about a plan, let's take a look at those lab results again.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. I appreciate you being so thorough. I always worry about my knees, but it sounds like everything else is holding up okay. And yes, 199 centimeters is correct. I'm rather tall, you see. What do the lab results actually mean? Just the numbers, if you don’t mind. I can try to wrap my head around it better that way. I'm not good at medical explanations, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's break it down. Your total cholesterol is 245 mg/dL. We generally want that under 200. Your LDL cholesterol – that's the "bad" cholesterol – is 160 mg/dL. Ideally, that should be under 100. Your HDL cholesterol – the "good" cholesterol – is 45 mg/dL. We want that above 60 if possible. And your triglycerides are 180 mg/dL; ideally below 150. So, your LDL is a bit high, and your HDL could be higher. The triglycerides are on the borderline. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… numbers, numbers. Okay, so the LDL is the one I need to worry about most? And I need to increase the HDL? It's all a bit confusing. Is that why Doctor Van Derlyn mentioned something about lifestyle changes? Diet and exercise? Is that what brings those numbers down? I think I remember him saying something about that. But he didn't really explain how. It's nice you are explaining it slowly.
DOCTOR: You've got it exactly right. LDL is the main one we want to lower to reduce your risk of heart disease. And increasing HDL can help protect you. And yes, lifestyle changes are often the first step. Diet and exercise absolutely play a role. Reducing saturated and trans fats in your diet can help lower LDL. Think less red meat, fried foods, and processed snacks. Increasing soluble fiber – things like oats, fruits, and vegetables – can also help. And regular exercise can lower LDL and raise HDL. Even 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week can make a big difference. We could start with some dietary adjustments and see if that helps lower your numbers. Would you be open to working with a registered dietitian?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I do eat a lot of processed snacks, I must admit. And not enough vegetables. A registered dietitian might be helpful. I'm not very good at planning meals, and I always seem to choose the wrong things at the grocery store. Would they come up with a specific plan for me? And would that be expensive? I'm on Medicare, so I'm not sure what it covers.
DOCTOR: Yes, a registered dietitian can absolutely create a personalized meal plan for you, taking into account your preferences and dietary needs. And thankfully, Medicare does cover medical nutrition therapy for certain conditions, including high cholesterol. There might be a copay or deductible depending on your plan, but it’s usually quite reasonable. Let me see… it looks like you’ve met the requirements for referral. I can provide you with a referral to a registered dietitian who works closely with our clinic. They’ll work with you to develop a plan that's both effective and sustainable. In the meantime, I'll also give you a handout with some general guidelines for a heart-healthy diet. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule a consultation for you?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful about Medicare covering it! Yes, please, if you wouldn't mind scheduling a consultation for me. That would be very helpful. And the handout sounds good too. I like having something to read. I’m glad you explained everything so clearly. Doctor Van Derlyn… well, he just doesn’t take the time. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any specific exercises I should try, despite my knees? Or supplements?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve scheduled you for a consultation with Sarah Miller, the registered dietitian, on August 12th at 2:00 PM. Her office is just down the hall. As for exercises, given your knees, we want to focus on low-impact activities. Swimming or water aerobics are excellent choices, as they’re gentle on your joints. Walking is also good, but start slowly and gradually increase your distance and pace. There are also specific exercises you can do to strengthen the muscles around your knees, which can help improve stability and reduce pain. I can give you a handout with some of those as well. Regarding supplements, there’s some evidence that omega-3 fatty acids can help lower triglycerides, but the evidence is mixed. And there’s no strong evidence to support the use of other supplements for lowering cholesterol. I generally recommend focusing on a healthy diet and exercise first. We can reassess later if needed. So, to summarize: we’re referring you to a registered dietitian, I’ll give you handouts on heart-healthy eating and knee-strengthening exercises, and we'll follow up in about three months to see how you're doing. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Three months is good. That gives me time to work with the dietitian and get some things sorted out. And yes, please, the handouts would be wonderful. Thank you so much, Doctor Beinborn. You've really put my mind at ease. I feel much more confident now, knowing what to do. Doctor Van Derlyn… well, he just sends me for tests and tells me the numbers. You’ve actually explained everything. I think that's all my questions for today. Unless… is there anything I should be asking you? Anything I've forgotten? It’s just that I always worry I'm missing something important.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help. It’s completely understandable to worry about missing something. Honestly, you’ve asked all the right questions. You've been very proactive, which is excellent. One thing I might add, just for general health, is to make sure you're getting regular check-ups with your primary care physician. They can monitor your blood pressure and other vital signs and ensure you're up-to-date on your vaccinations. But other than that, I think we’ve covered everything for today. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns after you’ve seen the dietitian. Here are those handouts. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to seeing you again in three months.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Beinborn. You’ve been very kind. I will definitely call if I have any questions. And yes, I will schedule another appointment for three months. Have a lovely day to you too!
