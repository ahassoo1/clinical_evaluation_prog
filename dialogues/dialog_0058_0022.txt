DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good morning to you too. Hmm… what brings me in? It’s… my tummy. It feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. It’s just… not feeling right. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Things get… fuzzy, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, “tummy feels big” and loss of appetite. And you said it’s been going on for a while, but you’re not sure exactly how long?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A while. Maybe… a few weeks? Or longer? It’s hard to say. Time… it goes so fast when you’re old. I just noticed it’s getting harder to button my dress. And the food… it doesn’t taste as good anymore. Not like my granddaughter makes, anyway. She makes a lovely borscht.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything changed with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… movements? Oh dear. Now you’re asking about things I don’t think about much! Let me see… hmm… I go to the bathroom, yes. Everything feels… normal there, I think. Maybe a little slower sometimes. But I don’t know if that’s… new. Old age, probably. Everything slows down, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. And besides your appetite and feeling…fuller, any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… … I get tired easily. More easily than before, I mean. And sometimes… sometimes my ankles swell up a bit. Not always, just at the end of the day. It's nothing terrible, just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain all these little things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and some ankle swelling. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Not a sharp pain, no. Sometimes a little ache in my back, but I think that’s just from… bending over, you know? Old age again. I don’t feel sick, if that makes sense. No headaches, no chest pain, nothing like that. Just… not feeling strong like I used to. And the tummy… still feels big.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll feel your abdomen, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. My heart? Is something wrong with my heart? I haven’t been feeling any… fluttering, or anything. But, yes, you listen, please. Whatever helps. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are… regular, but a little diminished. Lungs are clear. Okay, and your abdomen… yes, it is quite distended. Feels a bit firm, but no tenderness to the touch. No masses that I can feel at the moment. Alright. Your blood pressure is a bit low, 100/60, and your pulse is 72. I’m going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. It's just to rule things out, understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan? Is that… is that safe? All those… rays, you know? And blood work… I don’t like needles. But… if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then I suppose I’ll do it. Just… be gentle? And what are you looking for? Is it something serious? I just want to feel better. The tummy… it's just so uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: The CT scan is quite safe, Soila. The benefits far outweigh the risks in this case. We need to see what’s going on inside. As for the blood work, it's routine. We’re looking for signs of infection, anemia… things like that. It’ll help us narrow down the possibilities. The nurse will draw your blood now. Then we’ll get you scheduled for the CT scan. We need to rule out things like bowel obstruction, ascites… potentially even something more serious. Don't worry, we'll take it one step at a time. At your age, these things are not uncommon.
PATIENT: Oh… “not uncommon,” you say? Well, that doesn’t make me feel much better, dear. But… if you think it's best. The nurse, you say? Alright. I suppose I’ll go with the nurse. Just… please, be quick with the needle? And… explain everything to me. I get confused easily these days. My granddaughter always explains things so nicely. She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: Of course, the nurse will explain everything. And we’ll discuss the results as soon as we have them. For now, let’s just get the tests done, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Tests, yes. I… I think I need a little help getting to the nurse. My legs are a bit wobbly today. Could you… perhaps point me in the right direction? It's a long walk, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Down the hall, first door on the left. The nurse, Maria, is very good. She’ll take care of you. Honestly, you're slowing things down. Just go.
PATIENT: Oh… …Right. Down the hall. Thank you… I think. Such a long hallway…and my legs… so wobbly…
