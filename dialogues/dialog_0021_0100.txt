DOCTOR: Alright, Lytisha, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Um… well, it’s this test, isn’t it? For… things. My lawyer said I needed to come. Something about proving I’m… alright, I guess. It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. I don’t really remember all the details. It's the 2nd of August, is it? Time just… slips away these days.
DOCTOR: Right, the 2nd of August it is. And it is a bit odd to be referred by a lawyer for a medical exam. So, just to clarify… you’re not experiencing any specific symptoms or health concerns that you are aware of?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms, not that I know of. I feel… okay. Tired, maybe? Old. But that's just… being me, you know? It's not like anything's wrong, wrong. It's more like… they want to check if something's wrong. Which is… confusing. I haven’t been feeling unwell, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll do a basic exam just to get a baseline, if that's alright with you. It’s standard procedure. We'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and a quick neurological check. Just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… fine. Yes, alright. Allergies… Hmm… not that I know of, no. I don't take much, if anything. Just a little something for my knees sometimes, but it was ages ago. I think. Honestly, I can’t really recall what it was called. It didn’t bother me, though. No reaction. Just… old knees. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, let's start with your height and weight. I see here you're listed as 197 centimeters and 138 pounds. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, goodness. That sounds… tall. And light. I mean, I am tall, I suppose. People always say so. But… 197? Hmm. And 138… I haven’t weighed myself in ages, honestly. Could be right, I don’t know. It all feels a bit… off. But if that’s what’s on the paper, it must be. It’s me, I guess. I don’t really keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, well, we’ll just confirm those numbers quickly. If you don’t mind stepping on the scale and standing against the wall for a height check?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. No trouble at all. Just tell me where to stand, and I’ll do my best. It’s been a while since I’ve had someone measure me! I used to be quite good at standing up straight, you know. Back when I was working… paving, it was. Lots of standing then.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. Just stand on the scale there, and then back up against the wall for the height. No need to worry about it being perfect. I’ll do the measuring.
PATIENT: There we go. It’s… a bit strange being measured like this. It reminds me of school, somehow. Oh, and be careful, my back isn't what it used to be. I do get a little twinge now and then. Is that alright? Am I doing it right?
DOCTOR: Alright, just stay right there for a moment. That's perfect. And no, you’re doing just fine. Your height is 178 centimeters, and your weight is 68 kilograms. Does that sound more accurate to you?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, now… 178… that sounds… better, yes. More like it, definitely. 68… hmm. I still don't really know what that means, but if that's what it is, then… alright. The other numbers seemed… off. Tall and light, they said. I’m not that tall, and I don’t feel that light. Paperwork, eh? Always gets things mixed up. So, what happens next?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Just breathe normally, if you could.
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Sounds… sensible. Heart and lungs, yes. Important things, those. My father always said… well, never mind. Just tell me if I need to do anything special. I get a little nervous with these things, you know? Not scared, just… fidgety. Just breathe normally, you say? I can do that.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds good so far. Regular heartbeat, and your lungs are clear. Now, if you could just open your mouth and say "Ahhh" for me. Just a quick look at your throat.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. "Ahhh…" Is that good? I haven't had anyone look at my throat in ages. Not since… well, never mind. It feels a bit strange. Is everything alright? I tend to get dry mouth, you know.
DOCTOR: Everything looks fine. Your throat is a little dry, but no signs of any infection or anything concerning. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Reflexes, yes. I used to be quite good at those, you know. When I was younger, of course. Not so sure anymore. What do I need to do? Just sit still? I don’t want to mess anything up. Are you sure I don’t need to… I don’t know… concentrate or something?
DOCTOR: No need to worry about messing anything up. Just relax your arm, and I’ll gently tap it with this hammer. It’s just to see how your nerves are responding.
PATIENT: Oh! That was… surprising. It didn't… do much, did it? Not like it used to. Diminished response, you said? Is that… bad? I used to have quite strong reflexes, you know. Lots of physical work, that was. Paving, mostly. Lots of bending and lifting. Maybe it’s just old age? What happens next?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, but it’s something we should note. Now, I’m just going to ask you a few simple questions, and ask you to do a few simple movements. It’s just to check your coordination and strength. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Questions and movements, yes. Hmm… the year… let me see. It’s… it’s… Oh dear. Is it still August? It feels like time just… slips away. I think… I think it's 2025? Yes, 2025. I think so. But I wouldn’t swear to it. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me your name?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, that’s an easy one. My name is… Lytisha. Lytisha Hughston. Yes. That’s right. Lytisha. But sometimes… sometimes it feels a bit… distant, you know? Like a name someone else used to use. But it's me, definitely. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lytisha. I’ve completed the physical exam. Based on what we’ve discussed and the findings from the exam, it appears you’re experiencing some cognitive difficulties, specifically with memory recall and orientation. It’s difficult to determine the exact cause without further investigation. Given your history and these findings, I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. They can conduct more detailed testing to determine the underlying cause and recommend the appropriate treatment plan. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Cognitive difficulties… A neurologist? Is that… serious? I just came for a test, you know? My lawyer said… It feels like everything is getting very complicated. I don't know. I just… I feel a bit overwhelmed. Maybe it's just old age? What kind of testing? Will it hurt? And what if… what if it is something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed, Lytisha. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s important to rule out any underlying causes. A neurologist is a specialist in brain and nerve health. They'll conduct tests like cognitive assessments—basically, problem-solving tasks and memory exercises—and potentially imaging scans like an MRI to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The tests themselves aren't painful, although the MRI machine can be a bit noisy. We'll start with the cognitive assessment. If that reveals anything concerning, we can discuss the possibility of an MRI. Before we proceed, do you have any family history of memory loss or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Cognitive assessments… not painful, you said. That’s good. Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My mother… she always said she had a bad memory, but everyone did, didn’t they? And my father… he was always very quiet. Didn’t talk much about anything. I don’t think he had any… problems, not that I know of. My brother… oh, he had a little trouble remembering names, but he always blamed it on drinking too much coffee. It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. We weren't very close, my family. Not much talking. It doesn’t sound like anyone had anything… serious, no. But I could be wrong. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given the lack of clear family history, and the uncertainty surrounding your symptoms, I still strongly recommend a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. I’ll write a referral order and provide you with the contact information for a few neurologists in the area. In the meantime, it's important to stay mentally active. Things like reading, puzzles, and social interaction can help maintain cognitive function. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today’s consultation?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A referral… Puzzles and reading… yes, I used to enjoy those. Um… Yes, I do have a question. Will this affect my… my driving? I still like to get out and about, you know. And what about… What if… what if it's something I can't fix?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Lytisha. Let's address them one at a time. Regarding driving, a diagnosis doesn’t automatically mean you’ll lose your driving privileges. The neurologist will assess your cognitive abilities, and if they have any concerns about your safety behind the wheel, they’ll discuss it with you and may recommend a driving assessment. As for whether it’s fixable… it’s too early to say. There are many possible causes of cognitive difficulties, and some are more treatable than others. The neurologist will conduct thorough testing to determine the underlying cause and recommend the appropriate treatment plan, which could include medication, therapy, or lifestyle changes. It's important to remember that even if a cure isn’t possible, there are ways to manage symptoms and maintain a good quality of life. I'll also provide you with information about local support groups for individuals with cognitive impairment and their families. Here is the referral order and the list of neurologists. Do you have any other questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Support groups… yes, that might be… helpful. No, I don’t think so. Not at the moment. You’ve answered all my questions, I think. Thank you… thank you very much. It’s been… a lot to take in. I guess… I'll see what the neurologist says. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lytisha. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to support you. I wish you all the best with your evaluation. Have a good day. .
