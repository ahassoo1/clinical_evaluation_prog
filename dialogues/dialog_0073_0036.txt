DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a check-up, yes? For the insurance. I need to have this done before it starts, so everything is correct. It is… important.
DOCTOR: A check-up for insurance purposes, alright. Though, typically these still involve some reason for seeking medical attention, even if it’s just preventative care. But, very well. Let’s start with the basics then. Have you been feeling generally healthy?
PATIENT: Generally… yes. I work, I eat, I sleep. It is… normal. I do not have time to not be healthy. What do you mean, "typically"? Is something wrong with just wanting the insurance to be correct?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, nothing is wrong with ensuring your insurance is in order. It’s just… standard procedure to ascertain why someone is seeking a medical evaluation. It helps me understand your overall health profile, you see. It’s more thorough. But, if you insist it's solely for insurance, we can proceed that way. Are there any specific concerns at all you'd like me to address while I'm examining you?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. I do not have concerns. I told you, I work. It is a physical job, yes? Lifting boxes, moving things. That is all. Is there… a form I need to sign? To say I do not have concerns? This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: A form isn’t necessary, Mr. Barban. It’s simply that a complete medical history is... advisable, even for routine check-ups. Alright. Let's start with your past medical history then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant…? No. Not that I know of. My mother… she had things, when she was old. But I was a boy then. I do not remember what. And I have not been to a doctor… much. I work. I do not have time for… remembering old things. Is this important? Will it affect the insurance?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have a clear understanding of your family history, Mr. Barban. Knowing what illnesses run in your family can sometimes be… pertinent. But if you genuinely don’t recall, we can move on. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I… I broke my arm when I was a small boy, falling from a tree. But it healed. My mother… she tied it with cloth. It is okay now. Strong. I do not need… cutting. Is this about the insurance again? Are they asking about broken bones?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, this isn't specifically about the insurance, though a complete history does help with their assessments. We are simply trying to get a comprehensive picture of your health. Alright. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I… sometimes drink tea. For… when I am tired. My mother makes it. And sometimes, I take… a pain pill, when my back hurts from lifting the boxes. But it is not… every day. Just when it is very bad. The kind you can buy at the store. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter pain medication, alright. What is the name of the pain medication you are taking, Mr. Barban?
PATIENT: I… I do not remember the name. It is… white. In a bottle. You buy it at the store. The kind for headaches and… back pain. It helps. It is… Ibuprofen, I think? Or… Naproxen? Something like that. They all look the same. It is not important, yes? I just take it when I need it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen or Naproxen. We'll note that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat many things. I have never had… a problem. Dust makes me sneeze sometimes, but that is not… an allergy. And I… I do not believe in allergies. It is just… weak bodies. My mother always said. Is this still about the insurance? I need to get this done.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination then, Mr. Barban. If you'll step over to the examination table. We'll start with your vital signs. Please remove your shirt and shoes.
PATIENT: Remove my shirt? In here? Is that… necessary? I am a respectable man. And my shoes… they are new. This is… unusual. I thought we were just talking. Will you at least tell me why you need me to remove my clothing? Is this what doctors do now?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, a physical examination requires me to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and assess your reflexes. It's standard medical practice. I assure you, this is entirely professional. I can provide a gown if you prefer. It's simply to facilitate a proper examination. If you're uncomfortable, we can certainly reschedule, but I must be able to assess your condition to properly complete the necessary paperwork.
PATIENT: Paperwork…? So, it is about the insurance. Fine. A gown, yes. Give me a gown. But I still do not understand why you need to hear my heart. It beats, I know. I feel it. This is… ridiculous. Just give me the gown, and let us be done with this. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: The changing room is just over there, Mr. Barban. Please change into the gown, and I'll be with you in a moment. Once you're changed, please sit on the examination table. We'll get through this as quickly as possible.
PATIENT: Fine. This is… very inconvenient. And unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. If you could sit up straight on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Your heart sounds regular, but there's a slight… wheezing in your lower lungs. It's subtle. Do you experience any shortness of breath, even with mild exertion?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. I lift boxes all day. It is hard work. Sometimes I sweat, but… no shortness of breath. Is this wheezing… bad? Will it affect my insurance? I told you, I do not have problems. It is just… lifting boxes. It is a strong body. It is… normal. Perhaps it is the dust from the boxes? It makes me cough sometimes.
DOCTOR: The wheezing could be related to dust or irritation, as you said. It’s mild right now. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Do you have any history of digestive issues?
PATIENT: Digestive issues? No. I eat normal food. Sometimes spicy, sometimes not. My mother makes good food. Everything goes… through. I do not have… problems. Perhaps sometimes a little gas, but that is… normal. Everyone has gas. Is this what you are asking about? Will they deny my insurance because of gas? This is… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, your insurance will not be denied due to occasional gas. I am simply attempting to obtain a thorough medical history. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I’d like to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 138/88. It's not drastically high, but it's something to be aware of.
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? Is that bad? I do not understand these numbers. Is that going to affect the insurance? Will I need… pills? My mother always said to avoid pills. I am a strong man. I do not need pills. I lift boxes.
DOCTOR: Elevated blood pressure means it's a little higher than the ideal range, Mr. Barban. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is severely wrong, but it’s something we should monitor. It could potentially affect your insurance rates, yes, but it’s not a guarantee. We can discuss ways to manage it without resorting to medication immediately. Before we proceed with possible next steps, do you understand that, despite your insistence on being perfectly healthy, several things I’ve observed warrant further attention?
PATIENT: Attention…? You mean… because I lift boxes? Because my blood pressure is a little high? And because of some wheezing? This is… unreasonable. I came here for insurance, not… to be told I am sick. I am a strong man. I do not need your attention. This is a waste of my time. Just… tell me what paperwork I need to sign so I can be done with this. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Barban. I understand you're not interested in pursuing any medical advice. I’ll prepare the necessary paperwork for your insurance claim. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Ignoring these observations could lead to more serious health problems down the line. .
