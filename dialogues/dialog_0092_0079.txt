DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Courtnye is fine. Um, it's my bruising. It's been...worse lately. I’m on a blood thinner, and I keep getting these big bruises, even from just bumping into things. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Courtnye. It’s certainly reasonable to be concerned about increased bruising, especially when you’re taking a blood thinner. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Sure. They show up really easily, like, way easier than they used to. And they’re bigger, and they last longer. Like, I bumped my arm on the table yesterday, and already it’s turning purple and swollen. Usually it wouldn't be this bad. I don’t remember anything specific happening to cause a really big one recently, just little knocks here and there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like a noticeable change from your usual experience. Now, could you tell me which blood thinner you are currently taking, and for what reason were you prescribed it?
PATIENT: Oh, um, let me think… it’s… Warfarin. Yeah, Warfarin. The doctor prescribed it about six months ago when I found out I had a blood clot in my leg. It was pretty scary, honestly. They said I needed to be on it for a while to prevent another one. I get my blood tested regularly to check the levels, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s important information, thank you. Regular blood tests to monitor your Warfarin levels are very good. Let me just pull up your records here… Okay, I see your history of deep vein thrombosis, and your recent INR results. I see they’ve been… somewhat variable over the past few months. Besides the bruising, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Variable? Is that bad? Um, no, not really. Just the bruising. No bleeding gums or anything, and no nosebleeds. I haven't felt dizzy or really tired, and no headaches. Just… the bruises. I'm a little worried it's the Warfarin, but I don't want to stop taking it if it's helping with the clot. It's just… a lot of purple.
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t noticed any significant bleeding or other concerning symptoms. “Variable” just means your INR – that’s the blood test that measures how long it takes your blood to clot – has been fluctuating a bit outside of the ideal range. That can definitely contribute to increased bruising. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll just take a look at the bruises and check for any other signs of bleeding. Then we can discuss some potential causes and what steps to take next. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It’s kind of stressful, always worrying about bruising. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, I see some significant bruising on both arms and legs, as you mentioned. The bruises appear to be in varying stages of healing. No signs of any active bleeding at this time. I don't feel any lumps or masses. Your vital signs are stable: blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72, and temperature is normal. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like the increased bruising is likely related to your Warfarin therapy, and possibly some variability in your INR levels. However, it's always important to rule out other potential causes. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had a bit of trouble with my thyroid a few years back, but that's under control with medication now. Other than that, not really. I’m pretty healthy, honestly. I try to eat well and walk every day. I do take a vitamin D supplement, my levels were low last time I had bloodwork, but that’s it. Oh, and I have mild arthritis in my hands, but it doesn't bother me too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. History of thyroid issues and mild arthritis, both noted. Vitamin D supplementation is good. Given your history and current symptoms, I'd like to order some additional blood tests. We'll check a complete blood count to rule out any other causes of easy bruising, like low platelets. We’ll also repeat your INR to see where it currently stands. In the meantime, it's important to avoid any activities that could lead to injuries. If you do happen to bump yourself, apply ice immediately and monitor the area closely. If you experience any significant bleeding – like prolonged nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your stool – please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. I can definitely be more careful. I’ll try to avoid bumping into things, I guess. And I'll keep an eye out for any of that bleeding you mentioned. When will I get the results back? And do I need to do anything special before the blood tests, like fast or anything? I don’t want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Avoiding injury is key. As for the blood tests, you don’t need to fast, thankfully. You can eat and drink as usual. The results should be back within 2-3 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, are you having any difficulties affording your Warfarin or getting it refilled?
PATIENT: Oh, um... actually, that's a good question. It's been a bit pricey, to be honest. And my insurance ran out a few months ago, so I’ve been paying out of pocket. It's manageable, but it’s definitely adding up. I haven’t had any trouble getting it, but it’s just… expensive. I really don’t have insurance right now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’ve been able to continue getting your medication, but the cost is certainly a concern. There are programs available to help with the cost of medications, and we can explore some options. I’ll have the nurse provide you with information on patient assistance programs and local resources that may be able to assist you. We can also discuss potentially simplifying your medication regimen if appropriate, although that’s something we'd need to carefully consider based on your specific medical needs. Let's get those blood tests ordered first, and then we can focus on addressing the cost issue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that would be great. Anything to help with the cost would be amazing. Okay, let’s do the blood tests. I appreciate you looking into that for me. Hopefully we can figure out what’s going on with the bruising, and I can get some help with the medication. I think that’s all I was worried about, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this and ensure you have access to the care and medication you need. Okay, I’ll write up the lab orders now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and give you information on the patient assistance programs. Do you have any other questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been really helpful, thank you. I just want to feel better, and not bruise all the time. I'm glad I came in. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. I understand your concern, and we'll work together to get you feeling better. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and we’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
