DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s this… unsteadiness. I’ve been feeling rather off balance, lately. It’s difficult to explain. It just… happens. I wouldn’t say it’s constant, but it’s concerning. I… I don't quite remember when it started, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteadiness. I understand. It's helpful you're describing it as "happening" – that gives me a starting point. And no worries at all about not remembering exactly when it began; that’s pretty common. Just to get a bit more specific, can you describe how it feels when you feel unsteady?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s… a good question. It’s not exactly dizziness, not like spinning. More like… my feet aren’t quite under me. Like they don’t want to stay put. Sometimes it feels like I might fall, other times it's just a wobble. It’s… unsettling. And it seems to happen more when I’m walking, I think. Though I… I could be mistaken. It’s all a bit fuzzy, I apologize.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Lilyanna. You're describing it very well, and "fuzzy" is a perfectly valid way to put it. It sounds like it’s affecting your walking, which is important to know. Has this unsteadiness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. I… I’ve been feeling rather tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. But honestly, working my job is quite exhausting, so it’s difficult to say if that's related. I don't recall anything else specifically. No headaches, no blurred vision… nothing like that. It’s mostly just the unsteadiness and the fatigue. Oh! And sometimes a little bit of… well, I wouldn't say nausea, exactly. More like a queasy feeling in my stomach. It doesn't last long.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and occasional queasiness alongside the unsteadiness. That's helpful. Do you notice anything that specifically triggers these episodes – like standing up quickly, turning your head, or certain environments?
PATIENT: Triggers… that’s a difficult one. I don’t think standing up quickly makes it worse, but… I haven't really paid attention, I suppose. Turning my head… no, not that I've noticed. As for environments… I work outside a lot, so sometimes it’s dusty or uneven ground. Perhaps that contributes? I truly don’t know. I’ve been… preoccupied lately. It’s all very confusing. I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. We’ll try to piece things together. Working outside could certainly be a factor with uneven ground and dust. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment. I just… I’d like to get to the bottom of this, if possible. It’s been rather disruptive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilyanna. We'll do our best. First, I'm going to take a look in your ears and do a quick hearing test. Then I’ll check your balance and reflexes. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, ears look clear. Now, I’m going to place this tuning fork on the mastoid bone behind your ear. Just tell me when you can no longer hear the sound.
PATIENT: …I can hear it. It’s… a faint vibration. Yes, I can still hear it… It’s… fading now. Oh, I think… I think it’s gone. Just now. It disappeared. Was that… correct? I apologize if I’m being unhelpful. It’s a strange sensation.
DOCTOR: No, you're being very helpful, Lilyanna. That's perfectly fine. You heard it for a normal amount of time. Now, could you stand with your feet together, close your eyes, and just try to maintain your balance for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Alright… yes, I’m standing… it’s… difficult. I feel… wobbly. Oh dear… I think… I’m going to need to… …excuse me. I’m not very steady. I feel like I might fall.
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy there. That’s alright. It’s good you reached out. Okay, let's sit down for a moment. That test showed some instability. I also noticed some slight swaying when I checked your reflexes. This suggests there might be a problem with your inner ear or your nervous system. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. Tests sound… prudent. Anything that can help determine what’s happening… I agree to it. I just… I’d like to understand why I'm feeling like this. And I would appreciate it if you could explain the results to me, as simply as possible. I apologize if I’m asking too much.
DOCTOR: No, you're not asking too much at all, Lilyanna. Explaining things clearly is part of my job. Okay, I'm going to order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infections or deficiencies, and an MRI of your brain to get a better look at your inner ear and nervous system. We'll also do a Vestibular function test to assess your balance specifically. These tests will help us narrow down the possible causes. Do you have any questions about any of those tests?
PATIENT: MRI… that involves a magnet, doesn't it? I… I believe I had one once, a long time ago. I don't recall any specific contraindications, but I… is there anything I need to be aware of? As for the others… a blood test is straightforward, I suppose. And the vestibular… you said it tests my balance? I’m not sure I understand the purpose of the MRI, specifically. If you could clarify, that would be… helpful. I apologize for my ignorance. I just… I've been rather… preoccupied.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly normal to have questions, and you're right to ask. The MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It’s painless, but you will need to lie very still inside the scanner. It can be a bit noisy, so we'll give you earplugs. We want to rule out any issues with the inner ear structures or the brain itself that might be causing your balance problems. The Vestibular function test will assess how well your inner ear is responding to different movements. It involves a series of tests that measure your eye movements and balance while you’re moving and stationary. It’s a more specific assessment of your balance system. I see in your chart you haven’t had any previous neurological issues. Are there any metal implants or pacemakers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No metal implants or pacemakers. I… I had surgery on my knee a few years back, but it was just… arthroscopic, I believe. No metal was used. Just… sutures. And… yes. I remember now. A small fragment was left, but it’s… non-magnetic, I was assured. It’s in my left knee. It shouldn't interfere, but I wanted to mention it. As for the rest… no, nothing. I apologize for the delay, it's difficult to recall everything. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Lilyanna. It’s important to be thorough. A non-magnetic fragment shouldn’t be an issue, but we'll document it just to be safe. Okay, I'm ordering the CBC, MRI, and Vestibular function test now. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work, and the imaging center will contact you about the MRI. I will also have my assistant schedule you for the vestibular function test here in the clinic next week. In the meantime, please avoid any strenuous activity that might make you feel unsteady. If you experience any new symptoms – like severe headache, vision changes, or weakness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will avoid strenuous activity and heed your warning about new symptoms. I appreciate your thoroughness and patience with me. It’s… reassuring to know we’re taking this seriously. Is there… anything I should be doing in the meantime, to help my memory? It’s been… concerning lately. Not just with this, but… generally. I apologize if this is an inappropriate question.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly appropriate question, Lilyanna. It’s good you're being proactive about it. While we investigate the cause of your unsteadiness, there are a few things you can try to help your memory. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep are all beneficial. Brain-training games or puzzles can also help keep your mind sharp. If your memory issues persist or worsen, we can discuss a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. However, let's focus on addressing the unsteadiness first, as that may be contributing to your memory concerns. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… eminently reasonable. I will focus on the exercise, diet, and sleep, and we’ll see how things progress. Thank you for addressing my concern. It’s… a relief to have a plan. I believe that is all for today? I appreciate your time and attention, Dr. Andraca. And thank you again for your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. It was my pleasure to meet you as well. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and please be careful.
