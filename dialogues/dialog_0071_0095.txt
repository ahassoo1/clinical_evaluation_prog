DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day for pleasantries. I woke up this morning and can’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels… droopy. Is that enough of a reason, or do you need a detailed biography? It's rather obvious, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is enough of a reason. Droopiness and sudden hearing loss… that definitely warrants attention. Hmm. I apologize for asking, it’s just… important to get a full picture, even if it seems obvious. Now, can you tell me which ear is affected?
PATIENT: The left one. Really, Doctor, are you a trained professional? It's quite obvious when you're trying to have a conversation with someone and they can’t hear you. And it's not just a little muffled, it’s gone. Completely. I suppose I should also mention it feels a bit… numb, too. But I haven't bothered with mirrors much today; I simply haven't the patience.
DOCTOR: You're right to be frustrated, Stephane. It is concerning, and I apologize again for the basic questions. It’s protocol, you understand. Numbness is important… and sudden hearing loss always is. Okay. Let’s do a quick exam, if you don't mind. I’m going to check your facial muscles and do a basic hearing test. Just follow my instructions as best you can. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just... try to be quick about it. I have things to do, you know. Important things. This better not take long. And please, don't ask me to repeat myself. It’s rather difficult when I can only hear out of one ear.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s just take a quick look in your ear… just to rule out anything obvious. Can you tell me if you've experienced any dizziness or ringing in your ears recently?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Ringing… sometimes. It comes and goes. I assumed it was just age. Honestly, Doctor, what isn't going wrong when you reach my age? It's hardly a medical emergency, is it? Now, are you going to poke around in my ear, or are we just going to keep talking about trivial matters?
DOCTOR: Okay… I don't see any obvious blockage or infection. The ear canal looks clear. Now, I'm going to ask you to wrinkle your forehead, close your eyes tightly, and smile. Just try your best. This is to check your facial muscle strength. Hmm. Yes… there is some weakness on the left side of your face, as you mentioned. And you're right, it’s quite noticeable. This, combined with the sudden hearing loss… it’s concerning. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, occasionally. The doctor always tells me to watch my salt intake. Diabetes? No. Stroke? Certainly not. I keep myself active, you know. I’m not some frail old woman. And really, weakness? It’s probably just a muscle cramp. I’ve had those before. Are you trying to scare me, Doctor? Because it's not a very good tactic.
DOCTOR: No, Stephane, absolutely not. I'm not trying to scare you. It’s simply… these symptoms, while not necessarily an emergency right this moment, require a prompt investigation to rule out a serious underlying cause. We need to consider things like Bell's Palsy, but also more serious possibilities, such as a stroke or tumor. Now, I'm going to ask a few more questions, and then I'll likely need to order some imaging – probably an MRI – just to be safe. Can you think of anything else that might be relevant?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly. All this fuss over a bit of numbness and a slightly muffled ear. Look, I lost my husband a year ago, alright? Perhaps this is just stress. I've been a bit... distracted, lately. I haven’t been sleeping well. But I assure you, I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself. And frankly, I don’t see the point of poking and prodding when it's likely just grief. Are you insured? Because this sounds expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your husband… that's a profound loss, and stress can absolutely manifest in physical symptoms. But even with the stress, these symptoms warrant investigation. We need to rule out other possibilities to ensure you receive the correct care. I see here you're currently uninsured. That presents a challenge, but we can discuss options for assistance or payment plans with the hospital. Now, let’s focus on the medical aspect. Before we discuss insurance, can you describe the numbness more specifically?
PATIENT: Fine. It’s… all over the left side of my face. My cheek feels… strange. Like it’s going to fall off. And my mouth feels… droopy. As I said before. Is that specific enough for you? Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I'm being interrogated. I'm here because I'm worried, not because I enjoy having my every ache and pain scrutinized. Just… do whatever tests you need to do, and let's get this over with. And tell me how much it's going to cost before you do them. I’m not signing any blank checks.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the cost, and I assure you I will be transparent about that. We'll discuss that in detail with the hospital financial department. Now, the drooping and numbness… that is concerning. Let's get some imaging done. An MRI of the brain is the best way to rule out serious underlying issues. I’m also going to order a blood test to rule out any infection or other underlying causes. While we wait for the results, I’m going to give you a prescription for some antiviral medication, as it can be helpful for Bell’s Palsy. I would also like to refer you to a neurologist for further evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Really? Now it's a whole ordeal. Fine. Do whatever you think is necessary. But if it turns out to be nothing, I expect a full apology. And a detailed explanation of why I was put through all this. And honestly, I haven't had a proper meal since yesterday. I'm going to need some energy for all this poking and prodding. Do you have any recommendations for a good restaurant nearby? Preferably somewhere quiet. I don’t need any loud music exacerbating my… condition. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will arrange the MRI and blood tests, and send the neurology referral. I'll have my assistant give you a list of nearby restaurants, including some quieter options. Here is the paperwork for the tests and referral, and the contact information for the hospital financial department. Please, don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions at all. And Stephane… I understand your frustration, and I assure you, we are taking this very seriously. We’re doing this to ensure your well-being. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
