DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Pitmon, was it? Well, honestly, I'm not entirely sure. My daughter booked this appointment… said I needed a check-up. She worries too much, that girl. I feel fine, mostly. Just…old, I suppose. It’s good to get things looked at, though, I guess. A waste of a perfectly good morning if you ask me, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's always good to be proactive. “Old” isn't a diagnosis, Ms. Calvery. Let's try to be a little more specific. Are you experiencing any changes in your health?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. Everything feels a bit…slower, I suppose? Not a bad slow, just… like wading through water. And my memory isn’t what it used to be, of course. I forget where I put my glasses constantly, even though they're usually on my head. Is that a change? It feels like it’s been happening forever, though. Honestly, Doctor, I probably just need a good nap.
DOCTOR: “Slower,” alright. And the memory issues… how long have you been noticing those specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. Years, I think. Maybe since… well, since my husband passed. Everything got a bit fuzzy then. It’s not like I can’t remember anything, but little things… names, what I had for breakfast… that sort of thing. It's probably just grief, isn't it? It's been a long time, though, so maybe it's just…age. Really, I don't know. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you noticing any difficulties with things like walking, balance, or speech?
PATIENT: Walking? No, I walk just fine. I take a nice stroll every morning, weather permitting, down to the bakery. Though… sometimes I stumble a little. But that’s probably because I’m looking at the flowers! Beautiful flowers, they have. Balance is… fine, I think. I haven’t fallen or anything. Speech… well, I'm talking to you, aren’t I? Though my daughter says I repeat myself sometimes. She's always noticing things, that one. A bit too much, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s move on to other systems. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is…normal, I guess. I like to eat. Always have. My daughter keeps trying to get me to eat more… “healthy” things. Salads, you know? I prefer a nice piece of cake, honestly. As for weight… I don’t really keep track. I'm a bit…sturdy, shall we say? Always have been. It hasn’t bothered me, though. I'm not a tiny woman, never was.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, Doctor. That seems a rather personal question, doesn’t it? Let's just say everything is...regular. I don’t like to dwell on such things. It's not something one discusses with… well, with anyone really. Is that enough information? I mean, I’m not sick, you know? Just…old.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. Just routine. Alright, let's shift gears. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. My knees ache a little sometimes, especially when it's cold. Old injury, from when I was young and foolish, running around. Nothing a little heat can't fix. And my back… stiffens up if I bend over too much. But really, it’s just…old age again. I don’t take anything for it. I don’t like pills. They just make me sleepy. Is that what you wanted to know? I really don’t think I’m much of a case, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any problems with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Oh, I sleep alright. I'm usually in bed by ten. Though...I do wake up a lot during the night. Sometimes I’ll be up for an hour or so. Just…thinking, I suppose. Or needing to use the bathroom. It's not a big deal, really. It’s just…old age, again! I’ve always been a light sleeper. Doesn’t bother me much. I can always read a bit until I get tired again. I have a nice stack of books by my bed.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand you feel you are just experiencing normal changes with age. However, a lot of these symptoms – the memory issues, sleep disturbances, balance concerns – can be signs of something else. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. And I think it would be prudent to run some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work? Doctor, honestly. My daughter’s going to be thrilled. She always wants me poked and prodded. I don't see the point, really. I feel fine. But… I suppose if you think it’s necessary. I don't want to cause a fuss. But I’m telling you, it’s just old age. A little slow, a little forgetful… that’s all. Do what you have to do, I suppose. But don't expect any surprises. And please, no needles bigger than necessary.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam, checking your reflexes and balance. It shouldn’t take long. If you'll just have a seat here…
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But be gentle, Doctor. My bones aren't what they used to be. And please don’t tell me I have to take my shoes off. I just had a pedicure, you know. A nice coral color. It would ruin it. Honestly, all this fuss over nothing. Still, if you insist. Get it over with quickly, please. I have a bakery appointment later.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Not necessarily concerning, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might be a little uncomfortable. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but within normal range for your age. Now, stand up slowly, if you can. We'll check your balance. Hmm. A slight unsteady gait, but nothing drastic. Can you close your eyes and stand on one foot for ten seconds?
PATIENT: A murmur? See! I told you something was wrong! But probably just old age. Honestly, my doctor back home would have just given me a pat on the hand and sent me on my way. Careful now… don’t want to fall. Oh dear! I knew it! See? Balance isn't good. Probably should have just stayed in bed. This is ridiculous. You’re going to tell me I’m falling apart, aren’t you?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the physical exam, there's some instability and diminished reflexes. The murmur requires further investigation. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. I also want to order a CT scan of the brain to rule out any structural issues contributing to the balance problems and memory concerns. I understand you’re concerned, Ms. Calvery, and that you believe these are just changes associated with aging. However, it's important to rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results?
PATIENT: A CT scan?! Honestly, Doctor, that sounds rather… drastic. And more blood work? You're going to drain me dry! Well, I suppose if you insist. But don’t expect me to be thrilled about it. My daughter will be ecstatic, of course. She’s always wanting me to have every test imaginable. A week, you say? Fine. But I expect you to have some answers by then. I don’t want to waste my time. And please, no needles bigger than necessary. Honestly, all this fuss over nothing...probably just old age. But alright, schedule the appointment. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, I have you scheduled for a CT scan next Tuesday at 10:00 AM, and a blood draw tomorrow morning. The lab results typically take 2-3 days to come back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week once the results are available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding driving, and having someone accompany you when you leave the house, just as a precaution. I’m also going to give you a handout with some fall prevention tips. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No driving? Absolutely not! I enjoy my drives to the bakery. Honestly, Doctor, you're starting to make me feel like an invalid. Fall prevention tips? I've been walking for seventy years, I think I know how to avoid falling. No, I think that's all. I'm ready to go now. Honestly, this has been quite an ordeal. Just get me out of here. I'm sure my daughter will be thrilled with all the tests you've ordered. But I still maintain it's just old age.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Calvery. Here’s the paperwork for the CT scan and blood draw. Please let the reception staff know if you have any questions. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Good day? It certainly hasn't been. Honestly, all this fuss over nothing... .
