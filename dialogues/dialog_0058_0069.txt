DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paguiо. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello! Well, it’s about getting some shots, I think. My niece said I should come in for some vaccinations… she worries about me, you see. I don’t really know which ones, exactly, just that I need to be up-to-date. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: "Up-to-date" is… vague. Honestly. Okay. Well, at 47, there are several boosters and vaccinations you should have had. Let's start with the basics. Have you had a tetanus shot within the last ten years?
PATIENT: Hmm… ten years… let me think. I… I honestly can’t recall. I had one somewhere along the line, I’m pretty sure. Maybe when I was still working at the factory? It was a long time ago, though. Do you have a record of it somewhere? I don’t keep very good track of these things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Of course you don't. Let me check your record… Okay, I see a tetanus booster from… 2014. That means you're overdue. We'll need to get that updated today, regardless. And then we need to discuss influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. Do you get the flu shot annually?
PATIENT: Oh, 2014! That’s… a while, isn't it? Yes, you’re right. And the flu shot… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never really been good with remembering those things. Is it very important? I usually just try to avoid people when it’s flu season, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Avoiding people” isn't a preventative measure, Mr. Paguiо. It's… optimistic. The flu shot is highly recommended, especially with your age. And given your weight, you are at increased risk for complications if you do contract it. We'll need to get that done today as well. Do you have any allergies to eggs, or any other vaccines?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Complications… that doesn’t sound good. I suppose you're right, avoiding people isn't very scientific. Allergies… let me see. No, I don't think so. I eat eggs all the time, no problems there. And I haven’t had any trouble with shots in the past, as far as I remember. I had one when I travelled to Portugal a few years ago, and that was fine. Nothing unusual happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known egg allergy, tolerated previous vaccinations. That's… something. Now, the pneumococcal vaccine. There are two types. PCV13 and PPSV23. PCV13 is generally recommended first, followed by PPSV23 at least a year later. Given your age and… general health profile, I recommend we start with PCV13 today. Have you ever had this one before?
PATIENT: PCV13 and PPSV23… Oh my. That’s a lot of letters. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea. I don’t think so. I’ve never heard of those names before, to be perfectly frank. What does it protect against? Is it a bad one? I don’t like needles much, you see.
DOCTOR: It protects against pneumococcal disease – pneumonia, meningitis, bloodstream infections. It’s not a “bad” one, Mr. Paguiо, it’s a necessary one. And you are at increased risk due to… various factors. It's a standard injection. We can talk about pain management if you're truly concerned, but honestly, it's a quick pinch. It’s far worse to get pneumonia. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, pneumonia is bad, I know that much. You’re right, best to avoid that. Medical conditions… hmm. Well, my niece says my blood pressure is a little high sometimes, but I don't take anything for it. And my back aches, but that’s just from being on my feet all day, I think. Nothing serious, really. I generally feel alright, all things considered. Just a bit… tired sometimes.
DOCTOR: "A bit tired" could be indicative of numerous things, Mr. Paguiо. But given your history, let’s proceed with the vaccinations first. We'll discuss further investigation if necessary. So, we’re getting a Tetanus booster, a Flu shot, and the PCV13 pneumococcal vaccine today. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. As long as it keeps me healthy. And you promise it won't be too bad? I trust your professional opinion, of course. When do we get started then? I suppose the sooner the better.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s get started. Please have a seat and roll up your sleeve. I'll need to access your medical history to ensure there are no contraindications. It's a standard procedure, Mr. Paguiо. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright. I'll try my best. Just… let me know when it’s over, please? And thank you, for taking care of me.
DOCTOR: This will sting for a moment. Just breathe deeply. Here we go. Alright, that was the tetanus. You’ll feel a bit sore later, but it’s nothing to be concerned about. Next, the flu shot.
