DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, it's this cough. Been… bad. And there's… stuff. Red stuff. When I cough. Not a lot, but… yeah. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Red stuff, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Blood, I think. I smoke, you know? Been a long time. Maybe it’s that. I don’t… really remember when it started, exactly. Just… happened. A little at a time. Getting worse, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. Smoking, yes. And you’re not certain when this cough with the blood started?
PATIENT: No, not really. Weeks, maybe? Months? Everything feels… fuzzy these days. Look, can we just… figure out what’s wrong? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Well, "fuzzy" isn't particularly helpful, Mr. Reyno. We need some idea of the timeline to determine the severity. But alright. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Significant… Hmm. Not that I recall. Medicare takes care of things, you know? They send bills. I pay 'em. I don't… really keep track of what for. They told me something about my heart once, maybe? A long time ago. But it wasn’t… serious, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: “They told me” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Reyno. Do you recall what they said about your heart?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, it was years ago. Some… fluttering. Palpitations, I think the doctor called it. They gave me some pills. I took 'em for a bit. Then stopped. It didn’t bother me much after that. Honestly, I don't remember much else. Is this important? About the heart? Is it related to the cough?
DOCTOR: Everything is potentially relevant, Mr. Reyno. Palpitations could indicate an underlying cardiac issue. Let’s move on. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Nope. Never had any surgeries. I broke my arm when I was a kid, maybe? But they just put a cast on it. That's it. Nothing… cuttin’ or anything. Why are you askin’ all these questions? It's just a cough!
DOCTOR: A cough that involves blood, Mr. Reyno. We need to rule out serious causes. Now, family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she had… something. Lung trouble, maybe? She smoked too. And my brother… he had… problems with his legs. Diabetes, I think. It was a long time ago. Lots of folks get sick, you know? I don’t… keep up with it. Can we just… check my lungs or something? I feel like I’m explainin’ my whole life story here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please sit up straight and take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breath. This always makes me cough more.
DOCTOR: I do hear some wheezing in both lungs, and your heart rate is slightly elevated. It’s irregular as well. Now, I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. 92%. That’s a little low. I also want to take a look at your throat. Open wide, please.
PATIENT: There. See? Nothin’ special. Just a throat. This is gonna take all day, isn't it? I really gotta get goin’.
DOCTOR: There’s some mild redness in the back of your throat, but nothing overtly concerning. However, given your history of smoking, the coughing up blood, and the low oxygen saturation, I’m concerned about the possibility of a lung infection, or something more serious. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. We need to rule out pneumonia, bronchitis, or, frankly, something like lung cancer. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Lung cancer?! No! No allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with pills before. X-ray… that sounds… serious. How long is this gonna take? And… is it gonna hurt? I don’t like hospitals. Or… anything like that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, it’s important to be thorough. An X-ray is a simple imaging test, it doesn't hurt. It will help us to understand what is causing your symptoms. We need to rule out the serious possibilities before we can determine the best course of action. I will send you to the radiology department immediately. They will provide you with instructions. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a cough suppressant to help manage your symptoms in the meantime, but this won't address the underlying cause. Here are your documents. Do you have any questions before I dismiss you?
PATIENT: Questions… How much is the X-ray gonna cost? Medicare… they don’t always cover everything. And… what if it is somethin’ bad? I… I don’t want to deal with all that. I just want the cough to stop. I guess… just tell me what I need to do. And… how soon do I need to go for this X-ray? .
DOCTOR: The radiology department will bill Medicare directly, Mr. Reyno. I cannot provide you with an exact cost estimate. As for “something bad,” we won't know until we have the results of the X-ray. That’s why we are doing it. The radiology department is located in the medical building across the street. They want you there within the hour. Please go immediately. And, frankly, I expect you to follow through with this. It's in your best interest. .
