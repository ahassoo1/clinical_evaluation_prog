DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you too. Look, I ain't got all day. It's about... well, it's about how I look. Getting old is for the birds, and I want something done about it. Not asking for a miracle, just... fixed. Understand?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. You're concerned about the changes you’re seeing with aging and would like to discuss options. “Fixed” is a broad term, so let's try to get a little more specific. Could you tell me what exactly bothers you about how you look?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmph. Everything! The skin is getting loose, you know? Like an old rubber band. And… and my belly, it’s not what it used to be. Used to be strong, could take a beating. Now… now it just is. I want it tightened. And maybe something for the wrinkles, make me look… less tired. I been working hard all my life, you see. Pile driving ain’t easy. Don't need to explain that to you, do I?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Trendler, I certainly don’t need you to explain the physical demands of pile driving. That’s a very strenuous job. So, you’re concerned about loose skin, changes in your abdominal area, and wrinkles. Those are all common concerns as we age. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, and to discuss the best options for you, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: When I noticed? Hmph. That's a silly question. Slowly, of course! It wasn't one day I woke up lookin' like this. Over the years. Maybe... five years ago I started payin' more attention. Before that, I was too busy workin’. I didn’t have time to look in a mirror. Now I do, and I don’t like what I see. It’s a waste of a good face, I tell you. A waste!
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s been a gradual process over the past five years. That's helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your weight during that time?
PATIENT: Weight? A little. Lost some when my wife passed, didn't have much appetite. Then put a bit back on, comfort eatin’, you know? But mostly... it's not the weight, it’s where it went! All in the wrong places. And the skin, it just won’t snap back. Used to be tough, like leather. Now it’s… floppy. Like an old dog’s ear. You understand? This is important.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Mr. Trendler. You've experienced some weight fluctuations, and are most concerned about the loss of skin elasticity, particularly around your abdomen. That’s a very common concern, and we can definitely discuss options. Before we get into specifics, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Health? Not bad for my age. I got private insurance, so I see the doctor regular. Blood pressure's a little high sometimes, but the pills take care of that. No major illnesses, never been a sickly man. Worked hard, ate mostly good food. Not one of these fellas livin’ on junk. Used to drink a bit, but cut back after... well, after my wife. So, yeah. Pretty good for 76. Not fallin’ apart just yet. But I don’t want to!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Trendler. So, you have private insurance, see a doctor regularly for your blood pressure which is managed with medication, and generally consider yourself to be in good health for your age. Do you currently take any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Just the one. For the blood pressure. And a little something for my knees, they ache sometimes after a long day. But that's just as needed, you know? Nothing fancy. I don't like takin’ pills if I don’t have to. So, no. That's it. I ain’t one for fillin’ my body with things it don't need. Now, are we gonna talk about fixin’ this or what? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Mr. Trendler. We’re getting there. Just want to make sure I have a complete picture. Let's talk about what options might be available to address your concerns about loose skin and abdominal changes. There are several possibilities, ranging from non-invasive procedures to surgery. Before we discuss those, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a better assessment of the skin elasticity and overall condition. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Exam? Hmph. I suppose. As long as it doesn't take long. I ain’t keen on bein’ poked and prodded, but if it's gotta be done... do it quick. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And don’t try and sell me nothin’ fancy. I ain’t made of money. Just want to look… respectable again. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I assure you, I have no intention of selling you anything. My goal is to understand your concerns and discuss the most appropriate options for you. The exam will be quick and focused. If you’ll just have a seat here, I’ll start with a general assessment of your skin and abdominal area. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, let’s start by just looking at the skin on your abdomen. I’m noting some degree of laxity, as you described. And some thinning of the skin as well. Do you experience any pain or discomfort when I do this?
PATIENT: A little pinch. Not bad, but not pleasant either. No pain, just… feels loose. Like tryin' to grab hold of nothin’. And yeah, it’s thinner now, I reckon. Used to be able to take a beating, this skin. Now it feels like paper. Don’t pull too hard! I ain’t made of rubber, you know. Get on with it, will ya? I got things to do. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Trendler. I'm being as gentle as possible. And I apologize for the delay; I just want to ensure I get a thorough assessment. I’m also checking for any firmness or tenderness in your abdomen. I’m not feeling any areas of significant concern there, but there is some… softness. And your flanks feel… well, they feel as expected for someone your age. Now, let’s just take a look at your overall skin condition on your arms and legs. Overall, it seems consistent with the changes we're seeing on your abdomen. Okay, that's all I need for the physical exam for now. Please get dressed, and we can discuss some potential options. Do you have any questions about the exam itself?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just tell me what can be done. I ain't interested in fancy words and explanations, just results. Can you tighten the skin? Can you make my belly… flatter? That's all I wanna know. Don't waste my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. To address your concerns directly, tightening the skin and improving the appearance of your abdomen is possible, but the options depend on the degree of correction you're hoping for, and your overall health. For less dramatic improvements, we can consider non-surgical options like radiofrequency skin tightening, or ultrasound treatments. These can help stimulate collagen production and improve skin elasticity. However, the results are often subtle and require multiple sessions. For more significant correction, surgical options like a tummy tuck, or abdominoplasty, are the most effective. This involves removing excess skin and fat, and tightening the abdominal muscles. However, it's a more invasive procedure with a longer recovery time. Given your age and your comments about not wanting a “major operation,” we might start with the non-surgical options and see if those provide the results you're hoping for. Do either of those options sound like something you would be interested in exploring further?
PATIENT: Radio… what-now? And ultra-sound? Sounds like a waste of time and money. I ain't interested in bein' poked and zapped. I want something that works. If surgery is the only thing that works, then… then we talk about surgery. But I don’t want no long recovery time. I got things to do, remember? And no funny business. I want to look respectable, not like I’ve been carved up like a Christmas turkey.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. You’re looking for a solution that delivers noticeable results without a long recovery time, and you’re rightly cautious about any invasive procedure. A full tummy tuck does have a more extended recovery. However, there's a less invasive option called a mini-abdominoplasty. It addresses the lower abdomen, removing some excess skin and fat, and tightening the muscles, but the incision is smaller, and the recovery time is typically shorter – around 4-6 weeks. It may not provide as dramatic a result as a full tummy tuck, but it's a good option for someone who wants a more moderate correction. Before we even discuss surgery further, I would recommend a consultation with a plastic surgeon to get their professional opinion on whether you’re a good candidate for either procedure, and to discuss the risks and benefits in detail. Would you be interested in a referral to a qualified plastic surgeon?
PATIENT: A… mini-what-now? Sounds a bit better than a full carve-up. Four to six weeks... I can manage that, I reckon. As long as I can still move after it. I ain’t lookin’ to be laid up in a bed for months. A referral… yes. Send me to someone who knows what they’re doin’. Not one of these fellas tryin’ to make a quick buck. Someone… reputable. And tell them I don’t wanna be messed around. I want straight answers and a realistic expectation of what can be achieved.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I understand completely. I will refer you to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected board-certified plastic surgeon with extensive experience in abdominoplasty. She has a excellent reputation for providing realistic consultations and achieving natural-looking results. I’ll also include a note in the referral outlining your concerns about recovery time and your desire for a straightforward assessment. Here is the referral form. It includes Dr. Reed’s contact information. Her office will contact you to schedule a consultation. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call my office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Hmph. No. That'll be all. Just get me outta here. I got things to do. Don’t expect me to be comin’ back unless somethin’ significant happens.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. I wish you all the best with your consultation with Dr. Reed. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions in the future. Have a good day.
