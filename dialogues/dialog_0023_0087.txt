DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just... lab work, I think? The usual stuff, you know. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of these things anymore. Medicare sent something, and I figured I should get it done. Quick as you can, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Right. Medicare does tend to be... thorough. Let’s take a look at what they’ve requested. It appears you’re due for a Complete Blood Count, a Basic Metabolic Panel, a lipid panel, and a urine analysis. Standard preventative care for someone your age, though I find it a bit… passive to simply respond to mailed notices. Do you have any specific concerns you wanted to address today, or are we strictly following the Medicare checklist?
PATIENT: Uh…checklist sounds about right. I don't… I don’t really have concerns, no. Just feeling my age, I suppose. Everything aches a bit, but that’s nothing new. I just want to get the tests done and be on my way, if that’s alright. Honestly, I barely remember what half of those words even mean.
DOCTOR: Very well. We can certainly proceed with those tests. Though I do find it…unwise to ignore potential health issues simply because you don't feel compelled to investigate them. A Complete Blood Count checks for things like anemia and infection. The Basic Metabolic Panel looks at kidney function, blood sugar, electrolyte balance – important things. Lipid panel is cholesterol. And the urine analysis…well, it checks your urine. Before we proceed with the blood draw, let’s just quickly review a few things. Any allergies to latex or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Latex? Hmm… don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I can recall. Used to work around a lot of… machinery, I suppose. Everything was pretty greasy. I really can’t remember specifics, though. Is that a problem? I just want to make sure I don’t hold anything up.
DOCTOR: No, no, not necessarily. We use non-latex gloves as standard protocol now, regardless. It’s simply a routine question. Now, any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Oh! I take something for my knees. A little white pill. Doctor prescribed it a few years back. Can’t recall the name, though. And… sometimes a pain reliever, if they really bother me. Just over-the-counter stuff, you know? Ibuprofen, maybe? I really just take whatever my neighbor tells me to when I complain. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It is…suboptimal. Relying on neighborly medical advice is rarely advisable. The white pill for your knees… do you recall why you were prescribed it?
PATIENT: Uh… for the arthritis, I think? Or maybe just general joint pain? It was a while ago. Things just ache, you know? It’s old age. I mostly just wanted something to make it easier to get around. I used to… work with heavy equipment. That probably didn’t help. Honestly, I’m starting to get a headache just trying to remember. Can we just get the tests done?
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, I understand your frustration, but a proper medical history is crucial. We can proceed with the blood work, but I must strongly advise against simply dismissing potential health concerns. Do you have any family history of diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father… he died young. Something with his heart, I think. But he wasn't really one to go to the doctor. My mother… she lived a long time. Pretty healthy, as far as I know. Everyone on her side was pretty tough. Honestly, I didn't pay much attention to any of that back then. Too busy working. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you trying, but I really just want to get these tests done and be on my way.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the lab work as requested. But I am documenting your reluctance to provide a detailed medical history. It's… concerning, frankly. Now, let’s get started. I’ll have the nurse draw a few vials of blood. Afterward, we'll collect a urine sample. Do you know how to provide a clean catch urine sample?
PATIENT: Clean catch… no, not really. I just… go to the bathroom, you know? Is there something special I need to do? I haven't had to worry about that in years. Just tell me what to do, and I'll try my best. I just… I'm getting tired now.
DOCTOR: The nurse will provide you with a sterile collection cup and detailed instructions. It's important to clean the area thoroughly before collecting the sample to avoid contamination. It’s a simple procedure, but it requires a bit of… attention to detail. I’ll have her come in and assist you. In the meantime, let me document a quick physical assessment. Heart rate is… a little irregular. Lungs are clear, but there’s a slight wheeze. Blood pressure is elevated. 160 over 90. You’ll need to address that.
PATIENT: Elevated…? Oh dear. Is that bad? I haven’t really paid attention to numbers in…well, decades. Honestly, Doctor, this is making me anxious. Can we just get the tests and be done? I feel…lightheaded now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, you are exhibiting signs of hypertension, and your reluctance to provide a comprehensive medical history is hindering my ability to provide you with adequate care. I strongly recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment to discuss these findings and develop a treatment plan. However, we will proceed with the lab work as you requested. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide instructions for the urine sample. She will also take your vital signs again. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please inform the nurse immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Chest pain, shortness of breath… got it. Just… please hurry. This whole thing is making my head spin. I just want to go home and lie down. Thank you… I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse in momentarily. .
PATIENT: .
