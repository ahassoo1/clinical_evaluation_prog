DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I am Dr. Blim. So, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… paperwork, I suppose. Some requirement for continuing to… well, to practice. It's all rather bothersome, to be perfectly frank. I believe it has to do with ensuring my… abilities are still up to standard? Something about a certification, I think. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Paperwork. Of course. A certification review, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. A review. Yes. I’ve been doing this for… a very long time, you understand. One forgets the specifics of these things. It’s not that I doubt my capabilities, mind you. It's simply… inconvenient. And rather demeaning, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, these reviews are in place for a reason. Regardless, let's proceed. To fulfill this requirement, I need to gather some information. Let's start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses… hospitalizations… Goodness. That’s… a rather broad question, isn’t it? I’ve had the usual things, I suppose. Colds, the flu… nothing of any consequence. I had a bout of… something… with my stomach, years ago. Perhaps twenty years ago? I don’t recall needing to be hospitalized, no. Though I did see a doctor about it, naturally. A perfectly competent fellow, though I don’t remember his name. It’s all so long ago. Is a detailed account truly necessary?
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, a reasonable assessment of your health is necessary. “Something” with your stomach is not particularly helpful. Was it diagnosed?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… hmm. I believe he said… gastritis? Or perhaps colitis? Something ending in “-itis.” It was terribly unpleasant at the time. Lots of discomfort. He prescribed some pills, which cleared it up nicely. And a rather bland diet, if I recall correctly. No spicy foods, certainly. Honestly, Doctor, I was quite young then, and more concerned with getting back to work than memorizing medical terms. Is this truly vital information? It feels… rather irrelevant.
DOCTOR: Gastritis, noted. It is relevant, Mr. Oriley, as it indicates a potential for gastrointestinal issues. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I believe my tonsils were removed when I was a boy. A very common procedure, I understand. Beyond that… no, I can’t recall any surgeries. Nothing of any significance, certainly. I’ve always been rather careful, you see. Avoid strenuous activity, maintain a healthy lifestyle… well, as healthy as one can, given the demands of the profession. It’s all about prevention, really.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, documented. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. My parents both passed some time ago, and I wasn’t particularly close to my siblings. They led rather… unremarkable lives, if I’m honest. My father had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my mother… well, she had a touch of arthritis in her later years. Beyond that… no, I can’t recall any major illnesses. A bit of this, a bit of that… nothing that springs to mind as particularly concerning. It’s all rather hazy, you understand. It was a long time ago. Are we nearing the end of this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, this isn’t an interrogation. It’s a necessary medical assessment. High blood pressure documented. Now, do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don't believe so. I've always been rather robust, you see. I've never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. Perhaps a slight sniffle from time to time, but nothing more than a common cold. I recall being perfectly comfortable with penicillin, if that's of any consequence. I’ve taken it numerous times over the years. Is this all? I must say, this is rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, documented. Finally, what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take… well, I take something for my… joints, I suppose. A small pill, each morning. And occasionally, I take an antacid, if I’ve had something… rich. Beyond that… no, I don’t take any regular medications. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible. A bit of this, a bit of that… you understand. Is this truly vital information, Doctor? It feels as though you’re trying to find something… amiss.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, it is vital information. What is the name of the medication you take for your joints?
PATIENT: The name… hmm. It's a white pill. Small, oblong… I believe it begins with a “C”… or perhaps a “P”? I honestly can’t recall. I have the pharmacist fill my prescriptions automatically, you see. I simply pick them up each month. I don’t bother with the details. It’s… for arthritis, I suppose. Or perhaps joint pain? It's all rather hazy, Doctor. I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. This… questioning is quite unnecessary.
DOCTOR: “Unknown medication for joint pain,” documented. Very well, Mr. Oriley. Let's move on to a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Lie down, you say? Is that truly necessary? I assure you, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine. My heart is as strong as an ox, and my lungs… well, I’ve never had any trouble breathing. I suppose… if you insist. But I must warn you, I’m not particularly comfortable with these… undignified procedures. Do proceed, but be gentle.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please try to relax. Heart sounds… slightly diminished, but regular rhythm. Lungs… clear to auscultation bilaterally, but slightly reduced breath sounds at the bases. Reflexes… 2+ bilaterally. Diminished heart sounds, reduced breath sounds bilaterally, 2+ reflexes. Now, please sit up. I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Blood pressure and pulse, you say? Is something amiss, Doctor? I feel perfectly… normal. Do proceed, but I must reiterate, I am a perfectly healthy man. This… scrutiny is quite unnecessary. And rather unsettling, frankly. Is everything alright? You seem… concerned.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is elevated: 148/92. Pulse is regular at 78. Your blood pressure is somewhat elevated, Mr. Oriley. And your breath sounds are reduced. While you may feel perfectly healthy, these findings are concerning. We need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood work and a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Blood work? A chest X-ray? Now see here, Doctor! This is preposterous! I assure you, I do not need any blood work or X-rays. I’ve lived a long and healthy life, and I feel perfectly fine. This is… this is simply outrageous! Are you attempting to frighten me, Doctor? This is… unnecessary! I demand an explanation! What exactly are you looking for? I do not consent to these… invasive procedures!
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I understand your concerns, but these are not invasive procedures. They are standard diagnostic tests to determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure and reduced breath sounds. We need to rule out any underlying conditions, such as heart disease or lung problems. I am obligated to ensure your health and safety. I am not attempting to frighten you, I am attempting to provide you with the best possible care. Refusing these tests is not advisable. I strongly recommend you allow me to proceed. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Explain them? Very well. But I remain unconvinced. These… these tests sound entirely unnecessary. I’ve always been a healthy man, and I will not be subjected to… to poking and prodding for no good reason. But… very well. Explain them. In simple terms, please. I do not understand all this… medical jargon. And I still maintain this is… an overreaction. A complete waste of my time, frankly. But proceed. Explain.
DOCTOR: Very well. The blood work is a simple test where we take a small sample of your blood to check your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, kidney function, and other important indicators of your overall health. It helps us identify any potential problems that may be causing your elevated blood pressure. The chest X-ray is a quick, painless imaging test that allows us to see your lungs and heart. It helps us identify any signs of infection, fluid buildup, or other abnormalities. Both tests are quick, painless, and relatively inexpensive. They are standard procedures, Mr. Oriley, and will provide us with valuable information about your health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cholesterol… blood sugar… kidney function… it sounds rather… alarming. And an X-ray? Exposing me to… radiation? Is that not dangerous? You say painless, but I’ve heard otherwise. And… valuable information? What precisely are you hoping to find? Are you implying I am… ill? Because I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy. This is… unsettling. Very unsettling. But… very well. If you insist. But I expect a full explanation of the results. And I expect them promptly. No delays. And… and I expect them to be… reassuring. Proceed. But I remain highly skeptical. And rather annoyed.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Oriley. I have ordered the blood work and chest X-ray. The lab results will take approximately 2-3 business days to return. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results as soon as they are available. The X-ray technician will explain the procedure in detail before performing the test. The radiation exposure is minimal and poses no significant health risk. I understand your skepticism, but these tests are necessary to rule out any serious underlying conditions. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Here are the order forms and the requisition for the X-ray. The lab is located at [lab address] and the X-ray facility is located at [X-ray facility address]. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: [lab address]… and [X-ray facility address]… Very well. But I must reiterate, I do not approve of this… intrusion. And 2-3 business days? That seems… an inordinate amount of time. I have commitments, you understand. Will I receive a phone call with the results, or must I return here? And… and will I be required to pay for these… unnecessary tests? I have insurance, of course, but still… it’s the principle of the matter. This is… highly inconvenient. I insist on a clear explanation of the billing process. And… and will there be any… discomfort? Any side effects? I demand to know everything. This is… utterly preposterous. Very well. I suppose I have no choice. Proceed. But I remain highly skeptical, highly annoyed, and highly inconvenienced. And… and please ensure these tests are performed promptly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I understand your frustration. The lab should contact you directly to schedule an appointment. The X-ray facility will also contact you. As for the billing, your insurance should cover a significant portion of the costs. There may be a co-pay or deductible depending on your plan. I will have my staff provide you with a detailed breakdown of the expected costs. As for discomfort, the blood draw may cause slight pain or bruising. The X-ray is painless. I assure you, I am doing everything I can to provide you with the best possible care. “Patient reluctant to undergo testing, but ultimately agreed. Provide detailed explanation of billing process and follow-up instructions.” Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: “Reluctant”? I am not simply “reluctant”, Doctor! I am… skeptical. And… and highly inconvenienced! And “detailed breakdown”? What precisely does that entail? I expect a full accounting of every single charge. And “full accounting”? What precisely does that entail? And… and what if the results are… unfavorable? What then? Will I require further testing? Will I require… treatment? And what if the treatment is… unpleasant? And what if the treatment is… expensive? I demand assurances, Doctor. Assurances that everything will be… alright. And… and I expect to be treated with respect. I am a man of… experience, you understand. And I do not appreciate being… condescended to. Very well. I suppose I have no choice but to proceed. But I remain highly skeptical, highly annoyed, and highly inconvenienced. And… and I expect to be kept fully informed. Every step of the way. Now… if you’ll excuse me. I have commitments. .
