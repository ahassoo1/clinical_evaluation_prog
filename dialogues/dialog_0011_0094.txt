DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh... good morning. I think... my husband make appointment? Something about... learning stuff. I don't really remember. It's not... sick visit, right? I don't feel sick. Just... here.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this may be a check-up, or perhaps a preventative care visit. No need to worry if you aren't feeling acutely ill. We can certainly clarify the purpose of the appointment. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about yourself?
PATIENT: About me? What do you need to know? I work with metal. Sheet metal. It's... hard work. Long days. I’m married, of course. Been married a long time. That's... about it, I guess. Why do you need to know all this? Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Fontanazza, but in a good way. Understanding your work and life circumstances helps me provide the best possible care. Knowing you work with sheet metal, for example, gives me some insight into potential exposures or physical demands that could be relevant to your health. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma?
PATIENT: High... what? I don't think so. Doctor check me every year, maybe? Husband always take me. He handle all that. I… don’t remember anything specific. I take a little pill for my… water? Swelling, sometimes. Husband say it's for my feet. He say I need it. Is that... a condition? I don’t know what you are asking.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s common for patients to not recall specific medical details. The pill you mentioned for swelling – do you happen to know the name of it?
PATIENT: No! He keep all the bottles. I just take it when he tell me. Little white pill, I think. Maybe… oval? I don't know! It's not important, is it? I feel fine, mostly. Just… tired sometimes. Work is hard. That's all. Why are you asking about pills? Are you saying I shouldn’t take what my husband give me? He knows best.
DOCTOR: I understand your trust in your husband, Ms. Fontanazza. It's good that you have someone who cares for you. However, as your physician, it’s my responsibility to have a complete understanding of everything you are taking, even if it’s prescribed by a family member. Knowing the name of the pill is important to ensure it's safe for you and doesn't interact with any other potential issues. Would you be comfortable with me taking a look at your electronic health record?
PATIENT: Electronic... what? You mean like… computer? I don’t have computer. Husband have one, but I don't use it. He type everything in, I think. If you can find it in there, that’s good. But don't spend too long. I have things to do. Is this going to take long? I don't like being away from work. It cost money.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. It may take a few moments to locate your records. I understand your concerns about time and cost, and I will be as efficient as possible. Okay, I’ve located your file. It appears you have been seen by Dr. Ramirez for the past several years. According to the records, you are prescribed a diuretic, Furosemide, 20mg daily, for edema – swelling in your legs and feet. It also notes a history of hypertension, diagnosed approximately five years ago. Your blood pressure readings have been somewhat elevated in the past, but generally managed with the medication. Do you recall being diagnosed with high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Furo… something? That sounds right. The name sound… familiar. And… high blood pressure? Maybe. I forget things easily. Dr. Ramirez... He was nice. But he moved away, didn’t he? Husband say so. So I come here now. Does this mean I'm… sick? I told you, I feel fine. A little tired, maybe. Is that the high blood pressure? It's just... work. Hard work. You don't understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand that hard work can be physically demanding, Ms. Fontanazza, and fatigue is a common symptom. High blood pressure itself often doesn’t cause noticeable symptoms, which is why it’s sometimes called the “silent killer.” However, uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to other health problems over time, which is why it’s important to manage it effectively. To get a better understanding of your current health status, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your legs and feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… don't take too long. And be gentle. My legs hurt sometimes. From the metal. Lifting it all day. You have to be careful. It's heavy. Just… get it over with, okay? I have things to do when I leave here. I need to get back to work. It’s costing me money to sit here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, as you can see. Your heart and lungs sound clear, which is good. I do notice some swelling in your legs and feet, which is consistent with the edema you mentioned. I'm also noting some calluses on your hands, likely from your work. Based on this brief exam, it seems the hypertension is not optimally controlled and the edema persists. To get a more comprehensive picture, I'd like to order some blood work – a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count – to assess your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? More tests? Husband always say I'm okay. He say I don't need all these things. I'm just... tired. I need rest. Is this going to cost a lot of money? I don’t have money to waste on tests. I work hard for my money. You keep saying things are wrong, but I feel fine. Maybe I just need a vacation. That’s all. A nice long vacation. Is there anything wrong with just taking a vacation?
DOCTOR: A vacation would certainly be beneficial, Ms. Fontanazza, and I encourage you to prioritize rest and self-care. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to your fatigue and swelling. The blood work is relatively inexpensive and will provide valuable information to help me make the best recommendations for your health. It's not about saying something is "wrong," but rather about being proactive and ensuring everything is functioning optimally. The tests will help us understand the cause of your elevated blood pressure and edema, and determine if any further treatment is necessary. The cost for the basic blood work panel is approximately $75. I understand your financial concerns, and we can explore options for assistance programs if needed. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the tests?
PATIENT: Seventy-five dollars… Fine. Just get it over with. But don't tell my husband. He gets mad when I spend money. He says I waste it on… things. Just… hurry up. I have work to do. And don't make me come back. I don't like doctors. They always find something "wrong." It's just… stress. That’s all. Work stress. Now, can I leave? I'm wasting time here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. Here is a lab requisition form. You can take this to any lab, and they will draw a small sample of blood. The results should be available within 2-3 business days. I understand your concerns, and I assure you I will only recommend further action if necessary. I will review the results carefully and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest when possible and stay hydrated. If you experience any sudden or severe symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant swelling, please seek immediate medical attention. Here's a sheet with information on hypertension and edema. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No! No more questions. Just… let me go. I have work to do. And don’t call my husband. Promise me you won't call my husband. He'll be mad. Very mad. Now… goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fontanazza. Have a safe day, and please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. .
