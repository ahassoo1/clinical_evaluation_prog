DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, honestly? I just… thought I’d come in. My daughter kept telling me to get a check-up, and I figured, why not. It’s not like I’m sick sick. Just… curious, I suppose. Been a while since I've seen a doctor, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly reasonable. A preventative check-up is always a good idea. It's been how long since your last visit, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was… before Harold passed, definitely. Harold… my husband. He always made the appointments for me. Gosh, that was… a long time ago now. Maybe ten years? More? I really don't keep track of that sort of thing. Everything feels like a blur these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. Ten years is a while, but it's good you're prioritizing your health now. We'll catch you up on everything. Let’s start with a general overview. Are you currently experiencing any specific symptoms—anything that's bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Not really. My knees ache a bit when it rains, but that’s just old age, I always say. And sometimes I feel a little… tired. But who doesn’t feel tired? Honestly, Doctor, I think I’m alright. Perfectly fine, just… getting older. It’s a process, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is a process. Knee pain with the weather is common, and fatigue is very common as well. We'll investigate further just to be sure. Do you have any history of medical conditions - like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Harold always handled all that paperwork. Let me see… I think the doctor said my cholesterol was a little high once? Years ago. And I had the usual… you know, the flu a few times. But nothing serious, thankfully. I don’t feel like I’ve got any… conditions. He always said I was a strong Korean woman, built to last.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. We'll confirm everything in your records. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… oh, yes. I had my gallbladder out. A long time ago, when I was still working at the hospital. And… and Harold had a hip replacement. No, wait… that was him. I… I think that was the only one I had. Or maybe my appendix? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I was always so nervous about hospitals, even working in one.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’ll look into the records to confirm. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my daughter, Susan, is the one who brought me here. She worries too much, that one. My son, David, lives out in California, doesn’t visit much. And… Harold, of course. He had a strong heart, always healthy, that man. As for… illnesses, his mother had something with her… joints? Arthritis, maybe? And my own mother… she lived to a very old age, very strong woman. No real sicknesses to speak of, if I remember correctly. Everything's so long ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a complete picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmmm. Not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything. Harold used to tease me about my cast iron stomach. No reactions to any medicines either, as far as I recall. Susan always checks my pills when she visits, but she hasn’t mentioned anything. I don’t go around poking at things, you see. No bee stings, no poison ivy… just a sensible woman living a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes. Well, Susan makes me take a vitamin D supplement. She says I don’t get enough sunshine. And sometimes, when my knees really bother me, I take… what is it called? Ibuprofen, I think. The white little pills. But not often. Just when I really need it. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t like taking pills. Makes me feel… weak.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's helpful. Now, Ms. Calvery, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and reflexes. Just a standard check-up. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a hair appointment this afternoon, you see. And Susan would be cross if I was late. Just… be gentle, Doctor. I bruise easily these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in your lower lungs on both sides. It could be fluid, or just age-related changes. Now, I'm just going to feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let's just check your reflexes… Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is also common with age. Overall, everything seems okay, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and mild crackles in your lungs warrant some further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Crackles? Elevated? That doesn't sound good, does it? I told you I was perfectly fine! Susan will be saying “I told you so” for weeks. What sort of investigation? Do I have to have… tests? Needles? I really don't like needles, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily cause for alarm, Ms. Calvery. These are just things we want to rule out. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few simple tests. A complete blood count to check for any infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and electrolyte levels, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. And yes, there will be a small blood draw for the blood count and metabolic panel. The blood draw is very quick, and we’ll do everything to make you comfortable. It will give us a lot of information. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A chest X-ray… and blood… I suppose… if you really think it’s necessary. But promise me it won't take long? And… and can’t you just give me a pill for it? Something to make it all go away? Susan always says I worry too much. But a hospital smells… awful, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Calvery. We'll get you in and out as quickly as possible. The X-ray is very fast, just a few seconds. And the blood draw will be done by a very experienced phlebotomist; she's excellent at minimizing discomfort. Unfortunately, there isn't a pill to fix everything, but these tests will help us determine what's going on and create the best plan for you. We are just gathering information at this point. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d also like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that can help lower your blood pressure, like reducing sodium intake and getting regular exercise. Would you like me to have the lab technician draw your blood now, or would you prefer to schedule it for another day?
PATIENT: Oh… lifestyle modifications… Honestly, Doctor, I think I’d just like to get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the sooner I can forget about it. Just… please promise me it won’t be a long wait. And make sure they use a small needle. And could Susan come with me? I feel a bit… shaky, you see. It's silly, I know, but she always makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. We can absolutely have Susan come with you. Having someone for support is a good idea. I’ll have the lab technician come in right away. They are very gentle and efficient. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes for the blood draw and the initial processing. And then we’ll have the X-ray technician take the chest X-ray, which should be just as quick. It will probably be 30 minutes total before everything is finished. I'll come in and discuss the results with you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I’m going to write up some information about lifestyle modifications, and I’ll have the nurse explain them to you and Susan. Is there anything else I can get for you while we wait?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… please hurry. And tell the nurse to be gentle with Susan. She gets very upset when she sees needles. It’s silly, really. We’re both grown women, but… hospitals just make me anxious. .
