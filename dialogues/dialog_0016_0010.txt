DOCTOR: Hi Jahaad, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Maskal. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… it’s about some swelling, yes. I’m not entirely sure what’s causing it, to be honest. It’s a bit… vague, even for me to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, “vague” is alright – we can definitely work with that! Swelling… where exactly are you noticing the swelling, and when did you first start to notice it?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s primarily in my… ankles, I believe. And perhaps my feet a little. As for when… that’s difficult. It feels like it’s been gradually getting worse over the past few weeks, maybe a month? It’s hard to pinpoint an exact date, I’m afraid. I don’t really keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month or so of gradually worsening swelling in your ankles and feet. That’s a good start. Is it present all day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It seems to be worse in the evenings, definitely. During the day, it’s… manageable, I suppose. Not completely gone, but not nearly as noticeable. By the time I finish work, though… that’s when it really becomes apparent. I usually have to… elevate my feet a bit to feel comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse in the evenings after being on your feet. Do you notice anything that makes it better besides elevation?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I suppose… resting helps, generally. And cool water feels… soothing, if that counts. I haven’t really tried anything specific, to be honest. I just try to avoid putting too much strain on them when it’s bad. I don’t know if that’s a “solution” though.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting and cool water help. And avoiding strain is a good instinct. Now, have you noticed any pain associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: Not pain, exactly… more of a… heaviness? A dull ache, perhaps, when I’ve been standing for a long time. It’s not sharp or sudden, just… uncomfortable. It doesn't keep me up at night or anything, but it's definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, heaviness and a dull ache with prolonged standing. That's helpful. And just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any changes in your urine output, or any swelling anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: Urine output… I haven’t really paid attention, no. I’m sorry. As for other swelling… now that you mention it, perhaps a little around my fingers, sometimes? But it's very mild, and I always assumed it was just… normal. I don’t know. It’s hard for me to say definitively. It might be my imagination, honestly.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all – we're just gathering information. Mild swelling in your fingers too, sometimes. Okay. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with – anything at all?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I've always been relatively healthy, thankfully. I see a dentist regularly, of course, but no major conditions. I had a bit of a cold a few months ago, but that cleared up quickly. Nothing chronic, at least. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known chronic medical conditions. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, when I was younger, but that was a simple fracture. Nothing major since then, as far as I remember. It was quite a while ago, though, so I could be forgetting something. It's possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a broken arm in the past. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My parents are both… relatively healthy, I think. My mother has some mild arthritis, but nothing debilitating. And my father… he had high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s managed with medication now. I don’t recall any other major health issues in the family, but… I’m not entirely sure. We don’t really talk about it much. I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We’re getting a good picture here. Okay, so some arthritis in your mother and managed hypertension in your father. And finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don't take any medications regularly. Just… the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, nothing ongoing. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Thank you for all that information, Jahaad. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a closer look at your ankles and feet. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine, Dr. Maskal. Please, proceed. I’ll do my best to remain still.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 132/86, which is slightly elevated but not terribly concerning at this point. Heart and lungs sound clear. Okay, I do notice some mild pitting edema in both ankles – that's the swelling that leaves a small indent when I press on it. Your feet also feel slightly swollen. The skin temperature is normal, and I don’t see any redness or signs of infection. No tenderness along the legs, and your pulses are strong in both feet.
PATIENT: Oh… yes, I can feel that. It’s… noticeable. Is that what the pitting is? It feels a bit strange. It doesn’t usually bother me, but it’s… there. It's good to know what it's called, at least. What does this suggest, Dr. Maskal? I apologize for asking, I just… worry a bit sometimes.
DOCTOR: You’re not worrying at all, it’s good to ask questions! The pitting edema confirms the swelling is fluid-based. Given your history of gradual onset, worse in the evenings, and the lack of pain, redness or warmth, it's likely this is related to venous insufficiency or mild heart failure. However, there are other possibilities we need to rule out. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests: a Complete Blood Count , a Basic Metabolic Panel , and a B-type Natriuretic Peptide to assess your kidney function and heart function. I’d also like to order a urinalysis to check for protein in your urine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests, urinalysis… whatever you think is best, Dr. Maskal. I understand you need to rule things out. I apologize again for not being more… specific. I will try to be more attentive in the future, but my memory… it’s not always reliable. But yes, please proceed with the tests. When can I expect the results?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, and no need to apologize at all! We’ll get to the bottom of this. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours. The nursing staff will contact you to let you know when they’re available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, especially in the evenings. You can also try wearing compression socks to help reduce the swelling. Avoid prolonged standing if you can, and stay well-hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this point, or anything you’d like me to clarify?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so… elevation and compression socks, okay. I’ll try to remember that. Thank you, Dr. Maskal. You’ve been very patient and understanding. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I suppose… I’ll just wait for the results then. It's good to have a plan, at least. Thank you again.
