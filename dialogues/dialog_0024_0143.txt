DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s… about maybe having a baby. My… someone I care about and I… we are thinking about it. I think I need to… check things, you know? Make sure everything is okay before… before we try. It’s a bit confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A baby, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s right. I… it's been a long time since I thought about… all this. I just want to be sure I'm… healthy enough. And… well, she wants to be sure too. Is that… is that what this appointment is for? Checking if we are… ready?
DOCTOR: “Ready” is a rather… vague term, Mr. Verrall. We will ascertain your physiological capacity for procreation, if you wish. Let's begin with some pertinent details. You are 66 years of age, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, 66. Though I sometimes… forget exactly when things happened. It feels like yesterday and a long time ago all at once, you know? Is… is that too old? I mean, to… to have a baby? I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, while not common, procreation at your age is… theoretically possible. However, it is fraught with increased risks – both for you and, more significantly, for the potential child. Before we proceed further, let us establish a baseline. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Hmm. Let me think… I had a bad back for a while, years ago. And my knees… they ache sometimes, especially when it rains. Nothing… serious, I don’t think. I go to the pharmacy for… pills for the pain, that’s all. I don't go to a doctor regular, if that makes sense. I just… deal with it. Is that bad? I don’t remember a doctor ever saying anything… important.
DOCTOR: “Deal with it” is hardly a diagnosis, Mr. Verrall. And relying on over-the-counter analgesics for chronic pain is… suboptimal, to say the least. What specific medications are you currently taking, even those purchased without a prescription?
PATIENT: Oh… pills. Right. Let me see… there's… one for my knees, it's white, small. And another one for my back, it’s blue. I get them at the… you know, the drugstore down the street. I don’t really pay attention to the names, just ask for… pain pills. I think… ibuprofen? Or something like that. I take them when it hurts, you know? Not every day, just when I need to. I can try to find the bottles if that helps? They're at home… in the kitchen, I think.
DOCTOR: Vague recollection of medication is… concerning, Mr. Verrall. We need precise information. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; however, the dosage and frequency are critical. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. Maybe a little… itchy sometimes, but nothing serious. I ate… shellfish once, and my stomach didn’t feel good, but that was a long time ago. I don’t eat shellfish anymore, just in case. But… a proper allergy? No, I don't think so. I haven't been to the hospital for allergies or anything like that. Is… is that important? It all feels very complicated.
DOCTOR: It is always important to ascertain potential allergic reactions, Mr. Verrall. Now, let's move on to your surgical history. Have you undergone any surgical procedures in the past?
PATIENT: Surgical… procedures? Oh dear. Let me think… years ago… when I was younger… I think I had my… appendix out? Yes, that’s right. A long time ago. And… maybe tonsils? I'm not sure. It was a long time ago, and I was… under, you know? I don’t remember much. It was all very blurry. I don’t have any… scars that I can remember. Is that… important? I don’t really remember going to hospitals much. It's just… a lot of time has passed.
DOCTOR: Vague recollections are… unhelpful, Mr. Verrall. Now, regarding family history: are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… history. Hmm. That’s a hard one, Doctor. My… my family is mostly back in… well, back home. We don’t talk much. I haven’t seen them in a long time. I think… my father had… heart trouble? Yes, I think so. And my mother… she was always a bit… weak. She didn’t live very long. But… other than that… I don’t really know. We didn't talk about… health things, you know? It wasn’t… that kind of family. It's… difficult to remember. And I don’t want to say the wrong thing.
DOCTOR: A lack of comprehensive family history is… less than ideal. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh no, Doctor. Never. Bad for you, you know? I… I used to see my father smoke, and he always sounded… terrible. No, never smoked. And… I don't drink much either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. I try to… eat healthy. Well, I try to. It's just… sometimes it’s easier to get something quick. Is that… bad? I don't go to bars or anything like that. Mostly just… at home.
DOCTOR: Adequate, though hardly exemplary. Now, finally, regarding your current symptoms, aside from the chronic knee and back pain, are you experiencing any other discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort? Hmm… let me think. Well, I get… tired sometimes. Very tired. But… I’m an old man, Doctor. I think that’s just… getting old. And… sometimes my stomach doesn’t feel good. But that could be the… the food, you know? I don’t sleep very well either. I wake up a lot during the night. But… other than that… I think I’m okay. I don’t have any… sharp pains or anything like that. It’s just… normal old man things, you know? I’m not sure any of this is important. It’s just… life.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your age and the… limited information available, a comprehensive physical examination is warranted. Please follow me to the examination room. And try to recall anything else, however minor, that may be relevant. We haven't got all day.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’ll… I'll try my best. It’s just… it's been a long time. Lead the way, please. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: As if my schedule isn't already strained enough… Please disrobe from the waist down and lie on the examination table. I will begin with auscultation and palpation of your abdomen. And please, attempt to relax.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Relax… right. It's just… a bit cold in here, isn't it? Is there a… a sheet or something? I’m not used to… this.
DOCTOR: The paper sheet is on the table beside you, Mr. Verrall. Please use it if you find the temperature… disagreeable. Breathe normally. Any recent changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh… right. Bowel… habits? Hmm. Well, you know… normal. I think. Sometimes a bit… slow. Sometimes a bit… quick. It depends on what I eat, I guess. Nothing… dramatic. I haven’t noticed anything… strange. It's just… old man things, again. Is this… necessary? It tickles.
DOCTOR: Palpation is necessary, Mr. Verrall. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh! A little… yes. There. Not… sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It's always a bit uncomfortable there, to be honest. Maybe it's… gas? I eat a lot of beans, you know? And… cabbage. Is something wrong, Doctor? You look… serious.
DOCTOR: The area is mildly tender to palpation, with no rebound or guarding. Abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. Auscultation reveals normoactive bowel sounds. Any history of constipation?
PATIENT: Oh, the… constipation? Yes, sometimes. Especially when I… don’t eat enough… fiber, I think that’s what they call it. Or… when I’m stressed. But I usually… manage. With… you know… things from the pharmacy. It’s not something I like to talk about, Doctor. Is this… going to take much longer? I feel… a bit silly lying here like this.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with the remainder of the examination. Please turn over. I will auscultate your heart and lungs. And try not to move. Do you experience any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a bit difficult. Shortness of breath? No… not usually. Maybe… when I climb the stairs. But I think that’s just… old age. I get… winded easily. And… sometimes my chest feels… tight. But it’s not… painful. Just… uncomfortable. It’s probably nothing. Is… is everything okay, Doctor? You don’t look very happy.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but there is mild wheezing on expiration. Do you have a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?
PATIENT: Asthma? COPD? No, Doctor. Never. I used to… work in a factory, a long time ago. There was… dust sometimes. But I didn't have any problems. I just… coughed a bit. And… maybe got a bit… breathless sometimes. But nothing serious. It was a long time ago. Is something wrong, Doctor? You're making me nervous. Is it… something bad?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Verrall. Please sit up slowly. We have sufficient information for a preliminary assessment. Please dress and follow me back to my office. We will discuss the findings and formulate a plan. Do not attempt to stand abruptly. I will need to review your complete medical history and order some baseline laboratory tests, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. And, frankly, a referral to a cardiologist is warranted given your age and reported symptoms. This is going to be a long afternoon…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. A… a cardiologist? What’s wrong? Is it… serious? Laboratory tests? What are you looking for? I don't like tests… they always find something. I just wanted to make sure everything was okay before… before starting a family. Now it seems… impossible.
DOCTOR: Please sit, Mr. Verrall. Let us be frank. Given your age – 66 years – and the constellation of symptoms you’ve described, the prospect of a healthy pregnancy is… highly improbable. The risks to both you and your potential offspring are substantial. Furthermore, your vague medical history and reliance on over-the-counter medications are… concerning. We need a comprehensive understanding of your physiological state before we can proceed with any further discussion. I will order the aforementioned laboratory tests – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an electrocardiogram to assess your cardiac function. And, as I stated, a referral to a cardiologist is imperative. Please schedule an appointment with Dr. Elena Petrova at the City Cardiology Clinic as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? So… it’s… impossible? We can’t… have a baby? I just… I thought… maybe. I didn't want to be too old to be a father. What about… the tests? Is there… even a chance? I just… wanted to be a father. Is that too much to ask? I think… I think I need a minute.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, while I understand your… disappointment, it is crucial to maintain a realistic perspective. The probability of a successful pregnancy at your age is exceedingly low. The tests will provide us with a clearer understanding of your current physiological state, but I assure you, they are unlikely to alter the fundamental prognosis. I suggest you discuss these findings with your partner. Perhaps… alternative options are more appropriate. This brochure outlines various assisted reproductive technologies and adoption services. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients awaiting my attention. Please schedule the aforementioned tests and the cardiology appointment as soon as possible. And… try not to dwell on the improbable. Next! .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Impossible… .
