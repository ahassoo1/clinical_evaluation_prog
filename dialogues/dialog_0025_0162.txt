DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I don’t really have time for this. It’s… my stomach, I guess. Feels all puffed up, like I swallowed a balloon. It's been happening on and off for a bit. Honestly, it's probably nothing, but my wife… well, she’d want me to get it checked. She always worried.
DOCTOR: "A bit" is rather vague, Mr. Kristofik. When did you first notice this "puffing up"?
PATIENT: Ugh, dates… I’m terrible with dates. Months, maybe? Before the heat really hit, definitely. Look, it comes and goes, alright? Some days I’m fine, some days I feel like I'm gonna float away. It’s not like it’s constant torture or anything. Why does it matter exactly when it started? It's just…bloating.
DOCTOR: It matters because timing can help us narrow down the possible causes, Mr. Kristofik. Is it related to what you eat?
PATIENT: Related to what I eat? Honestly, Doc, I eat normal food. Burgers, steak, sometimes some rice and beans… What are you getting at? You think I’m eating something weird? I don’t go around shoving strange things down my throat. It's just… food. Regular food. And sometimes it swells up, sometimes it doesn't. I don't keep a diary, if that's what you're thinking. I work with a pile driver all day, I don’t have time for food diaries.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this bloating accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else? Like what? Pain? No, not really. Discomfort, sure, when it’s really bad, but not pain. Maybe a little… gassy? You know, normal stuff. It’s not like I’m doubled over here. Look, I'm a big guy, I can handle a little puff. Is this going to take long? I got a job waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Do you have any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Seriously? Doc, are you asking me about my… business? Look, I don’t really talk about that with people. It’s… personal. Is that relevant? What does my… going to the bathroom have to do with my stomach being puffy? This is ridiculous. I just want to know if there's something seriously wrong, and if not, I'd like to get on with my day.
DOCTOR: Changes in bowel habits can be very relevant, Mr. Kristofik. Are you experiencing diarrhea, constipation, or a change in the consistency of your stool?
PATIENT: Look, sometimes things are a little… looser, sometimes a little harder. What do you want me to say? It depends what I ate the day before! Burgers tend to move things along, alright? Steak… not so much. It's common sense! I’m not a doctor, but I'm not stupid. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are you just trying to embarrass me? I’m wasting daylight here.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Now you're just being… Look, Doc, I don’t inspect my… waste. That’s disgusting! Seriously. You’re asking a lot here. No, I haven’t noticed any blood. I’m a pile driver operator, not a… a stool detective. I told you, it’s just bloating! It comes and goes, it’s uncomfortable, and I'd really like to know if I need to worry or not. Is that too much to ask? I haven't been feeling well, alright? Maybe it's nothing, maybe it's something. But I don't need a full investigation of everything I eat and… everything else. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration. However, I need a complete picture to assess your health. Dismissing symptoms and refusing to provide information hinders my ability to help you. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
