DOCTOR: Hi Louine, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. This sore… it just won’t heal. I’ve had it for… oh, goodness, a while now. A very long while. And it’s quite painful, you know. Not constantly, but enough to bother a body. I don’t understand why simple things don't fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been bothering you for a long time. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It’s on the bottom of my right foot, near my heel. It started as just a little… well, a little nothing, really. A tiny spot. I probably stepped on something, though I don’t recall what. Then it got red, and started… weeping, I suppose you’d call it. Now it’s a proper hole, almost. And it’s always tender to the touch. I’ve tried ointments, you know, the ones you get at the store. Didn’t do a bit of good. I thought it would get better on its own, but clearly it hasn't.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started as a small spot on the bottom of your right foot near the heel, got red and started draining, and is now more like an open sore. You've tried over-the-counter ointments without much relief. And it’s tender to the touch. When you say “a long while,” roughly how long have you been dealing with this sore?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I’d say… at least six months. Maybe closer to eight. Time just slips away when you're older, you know. It started not long after my husband passed, so that gives you some idea. I really should have come in sooner, but I thought I could manage it myself. A bit foolish, perhaps. It's just… I don't like doctors. Too much poking and prodding, and never any good answers.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright that you waited, and I'll do my best to make this as comfortable as possible for you. It's good you came in now. Eight months is definitely long enough to take a look at. And I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. Losing someone you love is never easy. Now, besides the ointments, have you tried anything else to help it heal – like bandages, soaking your foot, or changing your shoes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, bandages, of course. Lots of bandages. I’ve tried all sorts, the fluffy ones, the waterproof ones… none of them seem to stay put, frankly. And I’ve soaked it in warm water a few times, but it doesn’t seem to help with the pain, and honestly, it's just a bother to sit there for so long. As for shoes... well, I try to wear slippers most of the time. Comfortable, you know. Not much walking these days. I used to be very active, but… not anymore. I don’t think shoes are the problem, to be honest. It just won’t heal. It feels… stubborn.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lots of bandages, some soaking, and mostly slippers. And you feel like it’s just a stubborn sore. I appreciate you sharing all of that. Now, do you have any other medical conditions like diabetes or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The diabetes. That’s… that’s a problem. Doctor told me years ago, but I try to manage it with my diet. Not always easy, you know. And… well, I get a bit of numbness in my feet sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to make me cautious. My circulation isn’t what it used to be, either. I get cold feet easily. Very easily. They say that’s a sign, isn’t it? Of… things not working properly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s important to know, Louine. Diabetes and poor circulation can definitely affect healing, especially in the feet. And numbness is something we need to keep an eye on. Okay, I’d like to take a look at your foot now, if that’s alright with you. I’ll need to examine it to get a better idea of what’s going on. We'll just take a look at the sore, check your pulses, and maybe do a quick check of your sensation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But be gentle, now. I don’t have a high pain tolerance these days. And don’t poke too much. I don't like that. It's just… I worry it will get infected. I've heard stories, you know. People losing toes… legs… I’d rather just get this fixed, if that’s possible. And quickly. I have better things to do with my time than sit in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible, I promise. We won’t poke too much, and we'll definitely avoid anything that will cause unnecessary pain. And we will try to get this fixed for you. Let’s take a look. Could you please remove your slipper and lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: There. Be careful now. It's a bit… sensitive. And don't stare. It's not a pretty sight, I'm sure. I haven’t been able to look at it properly myself for weeks. Too upsetting.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the sore. It is quite deep, as you said. There's some exposed bone, and there's some redness around it. I checked your pulses, and they are a bit weak, especially on your right foot. And I did a quick test of your sensation, and it seems a bit diminished in that area. I’m a little concerned about the depth of the sore and the decreased sensation. It’s possible this is more than just a simple wound. It looks like a diabetic foot ulcer. We'll need to take some steps to help it heal and prevent infection. Do you mind if I clean the wound now so I can get a better look and measure it?
PATIENT: A diabetic foot ulcer? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I knew it. I knew it wasn't just a simple scrape. My mother always said diabetes was a wicked disease. Cleaning it? Oh, very well. But please be quick about it. And don't use anything cold. Cold makes my foot ache terribly. I suppose you have to do what you have to do, but I really don’t relish the thought. I'd rather not know the details, if you don't mind. Just fix it, please. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. I understand. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll use room temperature saline. I’ll clean the wound to remove any debris and get a better idea of its size and depth. We’ll also take some measurements so we can track its progress. I’ll explain everything as I go, but I'll keep it brief if you prefer. I’m going to gently irrigate the wound with the saline solution now. You might feel a little bit of a sting, but it shouldn’t be too uncomfortable. Let me know if it becomes painful. Okay, I’ve cleaned the wound. As I suspected, it’s a bit deeper than it looks, about half a centimeter deep. There’s some dead tissue in there, which we’ll need to address. It's 2cm by 1.5cm. And I can feel no pus, which is good. It's not currently infected, but we need to prevent infection. We will do everything we can to heal it. It's a long process, though.
PATIENT: A long process, you say? Oh, goodness. I haven’t got time for long processes. I have things to do. Still, I suppose I have no choice, do I? What do we do about this… dead tissue? Do you have to cut it out? I really don’t like the sound of that. And will it bleed? I bruise easily, you know. A tiny little bump can leave a mark for weeks. Tell me everything. And keep it brief. I'm not a fan of details.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. The dead tissue – we call it slough – needs to be removed to allow the wound to heal properly. It’s like trying to build something on a shaky foundation – you need to clear away the debris first. We may need to gently remove some of it, yes. It’s called debridement. We usually use a scalpel, but it’s a very precise procedure, and we’ll use local anesthesia to numb the area, so you won’t feel any pain. There will likely be some minimal bleeding, but we’ll stop it with pressure. And I understand you bruise easily, so we’ll be extra careful. We won’t do anything drastic today. We’ll start with a gentle cleaning and apply a special dressing that will help with healing and prevent infection. We’ll also need to offload pressure from your foot as much as possible. Would you be open to using a special shoe or perhaps a walking boot to help with that?
PATIENT: A special shoe? A walking boot? Oh, goodness. That sounds dreadful. I haven’t worn a proper shoe in months. I’m quite comfortable in my slippers, you know. And I don’t go out much. What’s the point of a fancy shoe if you’re not going anywhere? I suppose… I suppose I could try a shoe, but it has to be comfortable. Very comfortable. And I don't want anything bulky. I don’t want to trip. And what about this… dressing? What’s in it? Is it sticky? I hate sticky things. They pull on my skin. And what about this infection? You said “prevent infection.” Does that mean it could get infected? Oh dear. This is all very upsetting. I knew I should have come sooner, but I just hoped it would heal on its own. Now look what’s happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take this one step at a time. You're right to ask questions, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable with everything. Regarding the shoe, we have several options. We can find a comfortable, low-profile shoe that won't interfere with your daily activities. It’s designed to reduce pressure on the wound, which is crucial for healing. It doesn't have to be bulky. We can find something that looks like a regular shoe. The dressing is a special type of wound dressing that contains silver to help prevent infection and promote healing. It's not overly sticky – it's designed to adhere gently to the wound bed. We will make sure it is applied carefully to minimize any discomfort. And you’re right to be concerned about infection. All wounds have the potential to become infected, especially with diabetes. However, we can significantly reduce the risk with proper care – cleaning the wound regularly, applying the dressing, and offloading pressure from your foot. We will monitor the wound closely for any signs of infection – redness, swelling, pain, or drainage. If we notice any changes, we’ll address them immediately. To start, let’s focus on getting the right shoe and applying the dressing. I will have my assistant bring some options for shoes, and we will find something that you are comfortable with. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A shoe… very well. But it has to be comfortable, I repeat. And not too bulky. I don’t want to fall and break a hip. That’s what my sister did, you know. Terrible business. And this dressing… silver, you say? Is it safe? I don’t like putting strange things on my skin. But if you say it’s safe… very well. And my assistant… is she nice? I don’t like being poked and prodded by strangers. I prefer to know who’s touching my foot. I’m a very particular person, you see. I don't like surprises. And don’t forget… no unnecessary poking. I mean it. Just fix it, please. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Comfortable and not bulky – that’s my priority. And safe – the silver dressing is very well-tolerated and widely used. It’s a standard treatment for diabetic foot ulcers. And yes, my assistant, Maria, is wonderful. She's very gentle and experienced, and she'll be assisting with the dressing change. She’ll introduce herself before she touches your foot, and she’ll explain everything she’s doing. She’s very kind. I will let her know you prefer minimal poking. Maria, could you please come in with a few shoe options and the silver dressing?
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose I have no choice, do I? But please tell Maria… be gentle. And explain everything. I don't like surprises. I need to know what's happening. I'm an old woman, you see. I don't bounce back like I used to. And no unnecessary prodding. I mean it. I just want this foot fixed. Is that too much to ask? And what about my slippers? Can I still wear my slippers sometimes? They’re very comfortable. I don’t want to give them up completely. Perhaps I can alternate? Slippers inside, and this shoe when I venture outdoors? That sounds reasonable, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Maria: Hello Louine, it's lovely to meet you. Dr. Ranjan has told me all about you. We have a few shoe options here, ranging in style and comfort level. We’ll find something that works for you. And I’ll explain everything before I do anything, just as Dr. Ranjan said. Yes, absolutely, alternating between slippers inside and the shoe outdoors is perfectly reasonable. In fact, that’s ideal. The goal is to reduce pressure on the wound as much as possible, and the shoe will help with that when you’re walking or standing for extended periods. You can definitely still wear your slippers when you’re relaxing at home. We just want to protect the wound and allow it to heal. Maria, could you please show Louine the shoe options?
PATIENT: Well… they don’t look very soft. Are they padded? And what size do you have? My feet swell sometimes, you know. Especially in the afternoon. I need something that will accommodate that. And is there a back on this shoe? I don’t want to trip. My balance isn’t what it used to be. I might need a heel, just a little one, for support. And don’t try to squeeze my foot into something that doesn’t fit. I have bunions, you see. They’re quite sensitive. And I need something that’s easy to get on and off. I don’t have the strength to wrestle with laces. Oh, goodness. This is more complicated than I thought.
DOCTOR: Maria: Absolutely, we can find something that accommodates your needs. We have several styles with different levels of padding and support. This one has a Velcro closure for easy on and off and a wider toe box to accommodate bunions. It also has a small heel for added stability. We have several sizes, and we’ll measure your foot to ensure a proper fit. We can also try a different style if this one doesn't feel right. Why don't you sit down and we can measure your feet now?
PATIENT: Very well. But be gentle. And don’t squeeze. I bruise easily, you know. And don’t use anything cold. Cold makes my foot ache terribly. And tell me what you’re doing. I need to know everything. I don’t like surprises. I’m an old woman, you see. I don’t bounce back like I used to. And don’t try to sell me something I don’t need. I’m a sensible woman, you know. I don’t fall for tricks. Just measure my foot, please. And be quick about it. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Maria: Absolutely. We'll be very gentle. I’m just going to measure the length and width of your foot to ensure we find the right size. I’ll explain everything as I go. We use a simple measuring device – it won’t cause any discomfort. And I promise, we won’t try to sell you anything you don’t need. We just want to find a comfortable shoe that will help your foot heal. Okay, your foot is a little swollen, as you mentioned, so we’ll go up half a size to ensure a comfortable fit. It looks like you’re a size 8.5 wide. Would you like to try that size on?
PATIENT: But first, tell me… is this shoe expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. I can’t afford anything fancy. I just want something practical. And comfortable. And affordable. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Maria: Here you go. This shoe is specifically designed for people with diabetes and sensitive feet. It's very lightweight and breathable, and it has a cushioned insole for added comfort. And it’s not expensive at all – it’s covered by most insurance plans, including Medicare. Dr. Ranjan’s office can help with the paperwork if you need assistance. Why don’t you try it on and see how it feels?
PATIENT: It's too tight. And it doesn't feel soft enough. And it smells like rubber. I want my slippers. Bring me my slippers. This shoe is dreadful. Absolutely dreadful. I refuse to wear it. I want my slippers. Now.
DOCTOR: Maria: Alright, no problem at all. It sounds like this shoe isn't the right fit for you. We have several other styles that might be more comfortable. Perhaps something with a wider toe box or a softer insole?
PATIENT: A softer insole, you say? Yes, that sounds better. And a wider toe box. My bunions are quite sensitive, you know. And it has to be easy to get on and off. I don't have the strength to wrestle with laces. And it can't smell like rubber. I hate the smell of rubber. And it has to be stylish. I don't want to look like I'm wearing orthopedic shoes. Is that too much to ask? Oh, goodness. This is more complicated than I thought. I just want a comfortable shoe that doesn't smell like rubber and doesn't make me look like an old woman. Is that too much to ask? Bring me my slippers. I'm tired. I want my slippers. Now.
DOCTOR: Maria: No, that's not too much to ask at all. You deserve a comfortable and stylish shoe that meets your needs. Let me see… This one has a Velcro closure for easy on and off, a wider toe box to accommodate your bunions, and a cushioned insole for added comfort. It’s also made of a breathable material and doesn’t smell like rubber. What do you think?
PATIENT: Bring it here. Let me try it on. But be gentle. And don’t squeeze. I bruise easily, you know. And don’t expect me to walk around in it. I just want to try it on. That’s all. And don’t tell me it’s comfortable if it’s not. I can tell the difference. I’m an old woman, you see. I know what feels comfortable and what doesn’t. And don’t try to sell me something I don’t need. I’m a sensible woman, you know. I don’t fall for tricks. Just bring me the shoe. And be quick about it. I haven’t got all day. Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want my slippers. I want my slippers. Now.
DOCTOR: Maria: Alright, here you go. Take your time. Just see how it feels. No pressure at all. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It's… acceptable. Barely. But it's not comfortable enough. And it doesn't look very stylish. And it doesn't feel supportive. It feels… flimsy. Bring me my slippers. Now. I'm tired. And my foot is aching. And I want my slippers. Now.
DOCTOR: Maria: Alright, Louine. It sounds like finding the right shoe is proving to be more difficult than we hoped. You’re right, this one doesn’t seem to be the perfect fit. And your comfort is the most important thing. Here are your slippers. You know what?
PATIENT: Thank you. Thank you. This is much better. Much, much better. I knew I should have stuck with my slippers. They’re the only shoes that truly fit. They're comfortable and supportive. And they don’t smell like rubber. And they don’t make me look like an old woman. This is heaven. Much better. Much, much better. Thank you. What are we going to do about my foot now? Is it still painful? It’s aching a little. And it’s still not healing. And I just want to be comfortable. What are we going to do?
DOCTOR: Dr. Ranjan: It sounds like we’ve learned something valuable today – comfort is key. And that's perfectly alright. We’ll focus on that. Your foot is still a little red and swollen, and it is tender to the touch. It doesn't appear to be infected at this time, which is good. We're going to focus on keeping it clean and protected. I’m going to apply a special dressing that will help promote healing and prevent infection. And we'll continue to offload pressure from your foot as much as possible. Maria, could you please prepare a silver-infused wound dressing and some soft padding?
PATIENT: Silver-infused, you say? Is that safe? I don’t like putting strange things on my skin. But if you say it’s safe… very well. But don’t use anything cold. Cold makes my foot ache terribly. And be gentle. I bruise easily, you know. And don’t squeeze. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And what about these slippers? Can I still wear them? They’re the only shoes that truly fit. They’re comfortable and supportive. And they don’t make me look like an old woman. Please tell me I can still wear my slippers. That’s all I ask. Please.
DOCTOR: Dr. Ranjan: Absolutely, you can still wear your slippers. They're a great option for comfort, and we want you to be comfortable. We just need to make sure we protect your foot and promote healing. Maria, could you please ensure the dressing is room temperature before applying it?
PATIENT: Room temperature, you say? Very good. I appreciate that. Cold makes my foot ache terribly. And be gentle. I bruise easily, you know. And don’t squeeze. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And what about this… pressure? What kind of pressure? Do I need to stay off my foot completely? I can’t do that. I have things to do. I need to be able to walk around. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And will it take long? I haven’t got all day. Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Dr. Ranjan: No, you don't need to stay completely off your foot. We just need to reduce the pressure as much as possible. That means avoiding standing or walking for long periods, and wearing comfortable footwear – like your slippers. We can also use some soft padding around the wound to help distribute the pressure more evenly. It’s like adding a cushion to protect the area. Maria, please ensure the padding is soft and doesn’t create any pressure points. This won’t take long at all. I’m just going to apply the dressing and padding, and then we’ll discuss a plan to keep your foot clean and protected. We'll focus on keeping it comfortable and allowing it to heal. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Soft padding, you say? Very good. And no pressure points. I appreciate that. And no squeezing. I bruise easily, you know. And no cold. Cold makes my foot ache terribly. And no pressure. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And will this… dressing… restrict my movement? I need to be able to walk around. I can’t stay in bed all day. I have things to do. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And will it hurt? I don’t like pain. I’m an old woman, you see. I don’t bounce back like I used to. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Dr. Ranjan: No, the dressing won’t restrict your movement at all. It’s a flexible dressing that will allow you to walk around comfortably. It’s like a protective bandage. And it won’t hurt. I’m going to be very gentle. I’ll explain everything as I go, and I’ll stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. I’m just going to clean the wound gently, apply the dressing, and add some soft padding around the area. It’s like adding a cushion to protect the area. Maria, could you please hand me the saline solution and the silver-infused dressing?
PATIENT: Saline solution, you say? Very good. And silver-infused, you say? Is that safe? I don’t like putting strange things on my skin. But if you say it’s safe… very well. But be gentle. I bruise easily, you know. And don’t squeeze. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And will it take long? I haven’t got all day. Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And please… no poking. I don’t like being poked. Just clean it gently. And be quick about it. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Dr. Ranjan: No poking, I promise. Just a gentle cleaning. And it won’t take long at all. Just a few minutes. Maria, please ensure the saline solution is room temperature and that you clean the wound gently, avoiding any unnecessary pressure. Okay, let’s get started. I’m just going to clean the wound gently with the saline solution. I’ll let you know if it feels cold or uncomfortable. And please, let me know immediately if you feel any pain. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It feels… cool. A little cold, perhaps. But not too bad. It’s… damp. And it smells… medicinal. But not unpleasant. It feels… strange. But not painful. Be gentle, now. I bruise easily, you know. And don’t squeeze. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And will this… cleaning… take long? I haven’t got all day. Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And please… no poking. I don’t like being poked. Just clean it gently. And be quick about it. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Dr. Ranjan: It won’t take long at all. Just a few more seconds. And no poking, I promise. Okay, I’m just about finished cleaning the wound. It looks clean. Now, I’m going to apply the silver-infused dressing. It’s like a protective bandage. It will help promote healing and prevent infection. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It feels… cool. And smooth. A little sticky, perhaps. But not too bad. It feels… strange. But not painful. It feels… secure. Be gentle, now. I bruise easily, you know. And don’t squeeze. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And will this… dressing… restrict my movement? I need to be able to walk around. I can’t stay in bed all day. I have things to do. Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And please… no poking. I don’t like being poked. Just clean it gently. And be quick about it. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Dr. Ranjan: No, the dressing won’t restrict your movement at all. It’s flexible and breathable. You’ll be able to walk around comfortably. Okay, now I’m going to add some soft padding around the wound to help distribute the pressure more evenly. It’s like adding a cushion to protect the area. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It feels… cushioned. And soft. A little bulky, perhaps. But not too bad. It feels… secure. And warm. It feels… strange. But not painful. It feels… protected. Be gentle, now. I bruise easily, you know. And don’t squeeze. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And will this… padding… make my shoe too tight? I need to be able to wear my slippers. They’re the only shoes that truly fit. Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And please… no poking. I don’t like being poked. Just clean it gently. And be quick about it. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Dr. Ranjan: No, the padding shouldn’t make your slippers too tight. It’s designed to be comfortable and discreet. We can adjust it if needed. Okay, all done. There we go. All done. Now, it’s important to keep the dressing clean and dry. You can shower as usual, but avoid soaking your foot in water. I’m going to give you some instructions on how to care for your foot. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to check your progress. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It feels… protected. And cushioned. A little bulky, perhaps. But not too bad. It feels… secure. And warm. But a little strange. And will I have to… change this dressing myself? I’m not very good at things like that. I have trouble bending over. Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. And what about… walking? Can I still walk? I need to be able to walk around. I have things to do. And what about my slippers? Will I still be able to wear my slippers? And how long will it take for this foot to heal? I haven't got all day. Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Dr. Ranjan: No, you won’t have to change the dressing yourself. Maria will change it for you at your follow-up appointments. And yes, you can still walk. Just avoid standing or walking for long periods. And yes, you can still wear your slippers. Just make sure they’re comfortable and don’t rub against the wound. As for how long it will take to heal, it depends on several factors. But with proper care, we can expect to see improvement in a few weeks. We’ll monitor your progress closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Here are some instructions on how to care for your foot. It includes information on keeping the dressing clean and dry, avoiding pressure, and monitoring for signs of infection. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Signs of infection, you say? What am I looking for? I'm not very good at noticing things like that. I'm old, you know. And what if… what if it gets worse? What if I have to go to the hospital? Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. And what about my slippers? Will I have to… throw them away? They're my favorite slippers. Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. And will this… healing… be painful? I don't like pain. I'm an old woman, you see. I don't bounce back like I used to. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And what if… what if it doesn’t heal? Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Dr. Ranjan: No, you won’t have to throw your slippers away. You can continue to wear them as long as they’re comfortable and don’t rub against the wound. And no, it shouldn’t be painful. The dressing is designed to protect the wound and promote healing. But if you experience any increased pain, redness, swelling, or drainage, please call us immediately. Those could be signs of infection. As for what if it doesn’t heal… we’ll do everything we can to ensure it heals properly. We’ll monitor your progress closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed. And if it doesn’t heal, we’ll explore other options. But let’s focus on getting it healed for now. As for signs of infection, look for increased pain, redness, swelling, drainage, or fever. If you notice any of those signs, please call us immediately. We’re here to help. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Increased pain, redness, swelling, drainage, or fever… oh, goodness. That sounds terrible. I'm not very good at remembering things like that. I'm old, you know. And what if I miss something? What if I don't notice it until it's too late? Oh, goodness. And what if I have to go to the hospital? I don't like hospitals. They're scary. And cold. And full of germs. Oh, goodness. And what if… what if I have to get my leg amputated? Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? And what if… what if I just want my old life back? Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask? I think… I think I need to lie down. Oh, goodness. This is exhausting. I just want to be comfortable. And I want my foot to heal. Is that too much to ask?
