DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. DUDNEY. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It’s not like I feel bad.
DOCTOR: Right. The nurse mentioned something about a high reading over the phone. It's good you're coming in to get it checked out, even if you aren't experiencing symptoms. High blood pressure often doesn't have symptoms, which is why it’s important to monitor. "Not feeling bad" doesn't necessarily mean everything is alright. Can you tell me a little more about how you found out about it?
PATIENT: Look, I went to get a life insurance policy for my husband, okay? They made me do a whole bunch of tests, and then that lady started talking about my blood pressure. Said I needed to see a doctor. Honestly, it felt like a sales tactic. They just wanted to scare me into buying a bigger policy.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Ms. DUDNEY. Insurance companies can be… persuasive. But regardless of their motives, the reading itself is what we need to address. Do you know what the actual number was?
PATIENT: No! They just said it was “high.” I don’t memorize numbers. Why would I? I deal with blueprints, not… whatever those numbers are. Honestly, it was probably the machine. Those things are always off.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright. It's good you’re here regardless. We'll take a look ourselves. It's standard procedure to confirm any readings, especially if you have concerns about the equipment. Before we do that, let's go through a little bit of your medical history, just to get a better overall picture. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No. Nothing that I know of. I've always been healthy. I work hard, I eat… reasonably. My mom always said I had strong bones, if that counts for anything. Look, I don’t spend my days at the doctor’s office. This is already taking too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No major medical problems. And family history?
PATIENT: My grandma on my dad’s side… she had something with her heart, I think. But she lived to be ninety. So, clearly, it wasn't that bad. Everyone in my family lives a long time, if you ask me. It’s the good Navajo genes. Now, can we just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of possible heart condition. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I work. I come home. My husband and I watch TV. I don’t sit around drinking and smoking or anything like that. What kind of question is that? I'm a civil engineering technician. We make sure things are built correctly, not… whatever you're implying.
DOCTOR: No implications, Ms. DUDNEY, just trying to get a complete picture. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise? Look, I walk around at work sometimes. Does that count? I don't have time for fancy gym memberships and running or whatever people do. It's hot outside, and frankly, I prefer not to sweat. It messes up my hair.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't had to take anything in years. Unless you count dust, but that's just… a normal thing where I'm from. Now, are you going to actually check my blood pressure, or are you just going to keep asking questions? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. DUDNEY. We'll get to it. Let's just get a reading, and then we can discuss the results. Please relax your arm, and try to stay quiet while I check it. It’s important to have an accurate reading. Okay... 162/98. That is elevated. And your pulse is 88.
PATIENT: Elevated? See? I knew something was wrong with that machine. This is what I'm talking about. It’s always something with these things. Can we try it again? Maybe on the other arm? It's probably just a fluke. Don’t tell me I need pills already.
DOCTOR: Okay, 165/100 on this side as well. It's consistent, Ms. DUDNEY. It is definitely elevated. This isn’t a matter of a faulty machine. We need to talk about this. High blood pressure, if left untreated, can lead to some serious complications—heart attack, stroke, kidney problems… it’s not something to ignore.
