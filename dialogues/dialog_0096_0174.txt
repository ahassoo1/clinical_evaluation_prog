DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Derasmo, welcome. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Burlingham, it's… difficult to explain, really. I suppose you could say I haven’t been myself lately. Just… a heavy feeling, you know? Not enjoying things. And frankly, I’d like to get this sorted quickly if possible. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: A “heavy feeling,” hmm. And not enjoying things… that’s… vague, dear. We need a little more than that to work with. How long have you been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… several months now, at least. Perhaps six? It comes and goes, but it’s been… persistent. I used to love my work, always have, but even that feels like a chore these days. Honestly, it’s embarrassing to admit. I’m a strong woman, always have been, and I don’t usually complain.
DOCTOR: “Several months,” right. And it's affecting your work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, quite. I find myself… less patient with tourists. Ski patrol can be demanding, even in the off-season with the water sports. I’ve made a few… errors in judgement, nothing serious, thankfully, but enough to worry me. I’m usually very careful, very attentive. Now… I just feel… distracted. And tired, constantly tired.
DOCTOR: Distracted and tired. Hmm. Alright. And besides the tiredness and being less patient, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… I haven’t been sleeping properly. I wake up several times during the night, just… thinking. And my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I used to enjoy cooking, preparing nice meals, but now… I often just have a small snack and leave it at that. It’s not like I’m actively losing weight, but I'm certainly not gaining any either. I do find myself a little… irritable, more than usual. Especially with my ex-husband, but that’s hardly news, is it?
DOCTOR: Irritable, trouble sleeping, appetite changes… alright. Let’s see… have you noticed any physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Not really… My joints ache a little, sometimes, but that's just old age, I suppose. I've always been quite active, and I’m not getting any younger. No headaches, no stomach problems… just this… general feeling of being unwell, if that makes sense. It’s not a pain, exactly, more of a… weight. A heaviness. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: A “weight,” yes, you mentioned that. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any medications regularly. Just over-the-counter things for minor aches and pains, when needed. As for illnesses… I had a bout of pneumonia a few years ago, but nothing serious. And I had my appendix removed when I was younger, but that was decades ago. Honestly, I’ve always been quite healthy, which is why this is so… unsettling. I really must get back to preparing the lifeguard schedules. The season is upon us, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. Any family history of… let’s say, depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a difficult question. My mother… she was a quiet woman, always seemed a little sad, but we never really talked about those things. My aunt on my father’s side… she spent some time in a hospital when she was younger, but I don’t know what for. It was a long time ago, and it wasn’t something the family discussed openly. So, I honestly couldn’t say. We weren't a family that shared feelings, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Blood pressure, pulse… And I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please sit back and relax. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is steady at 78. Now, take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Alright. Is that alright? I do hope this won’t take too long. I have a rather tight schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Heart sounds normal. No swelling in your extremities. Alright. Everything seems normal physically, which… isn’t particularly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: No, it isn’t. So what is it then? I feel perfectly capable, physically, but… I just don’t feel right. It's rather frustrating, to be honest. I've always been a practical woman, and I like to have answers. This… vagueness… It’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Derasmo, sometimes things aren’t straightforward. Given your symptoms—the tiredness, loss of enjoyment, sleep disturbances, appetite changes—and the fact that a physical exam hasn’t revealed anything obvious, it’s possible you’re experiencing… what we call a depressive episode. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re “sick,” but it does mean something isn’t quite right chemically in your brain. It’s quite common, particularly at your age, with the various life changes one experiences. I can prescribe you something to help regulate your mood. A low dose of sertraline, perhaps. We’ll monitor you, see how you respond. But honestly, you might also consider… taking a little time for yourself. A vacation, perhaps?
PATIENT: A vacation… I appreciate your… diagnosis, Doctor. But medication… I’ve never been one for pills. And a vacation is simply not feasible. I have responsibilities. People depend on me. Perhaps… perhaps I just need to push through it. A little extra rest, a bit more discipline… I’m sure it will pass. Is there anything else I should know? Because frankly, I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Derasmo. But if your symptoms persist or worsen, please come back. Ignoring it won’t make it go away, you know. And frankly, pushing through things when your body is telling you something is wrong is… foolish. Here's a card with some information about managing stress. And the number for a local therapist, should you… reconsider. I’m discharging you with instructions to monitor your symptoms. Schedule a follow-up appointment in one month, just to check in.
