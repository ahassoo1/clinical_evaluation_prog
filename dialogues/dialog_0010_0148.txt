DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepno. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… well, it's a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been having some… discomfort. Down there. It's been going on for a little while now, but it’s gotten… more noticeable recently. I'm not entirely sure how to explain it properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stepno, no need to be embarrassed at all. It's perfectly normal to feel a little uncomfortable discussing these things. We're here to help. When you say "discomfort," can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache, I suppose. And sometimes, a heavy feeling. It's hard to pinpoint. It's not constant, either. Comes and goes. I... I wish I could be more specific. I’m afraid my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stepno. We'll get there. A dull ache and heavy feeling, coming and going. Can you tell me roughly how long this has been going on – even a general estimate is helpful?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. It feels like… several weeks, maybe? Perhaps a month or so? It’s difficult to say for certain. Things just… blend together, you know? I do remember noticing it more after I was doing some work in the garden, lifting heavier pots of plants. But that was… some time ago. Perhaps two months? I truly apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Ms. Stepno. It’s very common. So, several weeks to a couple of months, perhaps brought on or noticed more after gardening. Does this discomfort change with anything specific – certain activities, time of day, or anything else you've noticed?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Yes, I think it is worse after I've been on my feet for a long time. And… it feels a little tighter when I first wake up in the morning. Not a terrible pain, just… aware of it. Lifting anything heavy definitely makes it worse. And, if I’m being honest, sitting for too long isn't very comfortable either. It feels… constricted, I suppose? Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Stepno. Worse with prolonged standing, tighter in the mornings, and aggravated by lifting and prolonged sitting. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this discomfort?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see… No fever, no chills. I haven't noticed any swelling. And… no, nothing like that. I did feel a bit more tired than usual lately, but I just assumed that was because I’ve been doing a lot of work. It's hard to say if it’s related, truly. I haven’t noticed anything… unusual, if that makes sense. I suppose I’d say no, not really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, swelling, or unusual discharge. Feeling a bit more tired, but not sure if related. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. I've seen a few doctors over the years, of course. I’ve had the usual things – the flu, a bad cold now and then. I believe I had high blood pressure at one point, but it was many years ago, and it was well-managed. And… I think I had some problems with my gallbladder, a long time ago, but it was treated. Honestly, Doctor, it's so hard to remember exactly what was what. I’m afraid my memory is just… not reliable. I’m on Medicare, if that helps?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Stepno. High blood pressure in the past, managed, and gallbladder issues previously treated. Medicare is good to know. Are you currently taking any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, I take a small dose of something for my arthritis. Just a little blue pill, every morning. And… that’s it, I think. I used to take something for my cholesterol, but the doctor took me off of it a few years ago. I’m almost positive that's all. I keep a list somewhere, but… I haven’t been able to find it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small dose of medication for arthritis. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I used to be allergic to bee stings as a child, but that was so long ago, I don’t think I am anymore. And… no, I don’t recall any allergies to any foods or medications. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything in a long, long time. I’m quite lucky in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known current allergies. Now, I'd like to ask a little about your family history. Is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – who has had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: That’s another difficult question, Doctor. My family… well, they were mostly healthy, as far as I know. My mother lived to be quite old, but I don’t remember any particular illnesses. My father… he had some heart problems later in life, but again, it was quite a long time ago. And I had several siblings, but I’ve lost touch with most of them. I’m afraid I don’t really know much about their medical histories. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart problems in your father. Now, just a couple more questions. And please don't feel pressured if you don't know the answer. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I find it absolutely dreadful. My husband… was a smoker, for a long time, but he quit years ago, thankfully. It's a terrible habit. No, I’ve never smoked.
DOCTOR: Alright, no history of smoking. And finally, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just occasionally. A small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on special occasions. I don't drink very much at all, Doctor. It doesn't agree with me, truthfully. And I certainly wouldn't call myself a drinker. Just a little sip, now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stepno, thank you for all of that information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just involve listening to your abdomen, and a gentle pelvic exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me to better understand what’s going on. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: A… a pelvic exam? Oh dear. Well, I suppose if you think it's necessary, Doctor. It's just… rather personal. But, alright. If it will help, then yes, I trust your judgement. Please, be gentle? I haven’t… had one in a very long time. And, could you explain what you’re doing as you go along? It would put my mind at ease. I apologize for being so… nervous.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stepno. I understand your apprehension, and I will absolutely be gentle and explain everything as I go along. We’ll take things slowly, and you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. First, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, to get a sense of how things sound. It won’t be uncomfortable at all. Just breathe normally. Okay, sounds are normal. Now, if you could please lie back on the table with your knees bent and feet flat, I will perform a gentle external examination. Everything seems normal externally. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'm going to perform a speculum exam and a bimanual exam. I will use a lubricant to make it as comfortable as possible. I will let you know each step before I do it. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright… yes, that’s alright. But please, do explain everything before you do it. And go slowly. Very slowly. I truly appreciate you being so… considerate, Doctor. It helps. A lubricant… yes, that sounds good. I’m a little nervous, I must admit. I haven't had this done in… many years. Just… please be careful. And tell me what you’re looking for.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stepno. I will explain everything as I go. Okay, I'm just gently inserting the speculum now. This might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just breathe normally, and try to relax. I'm just opening it slightly to get a better view of your cervix. Okay, the cervix looks normal. No obvious signs of inflammation or abnormalities. Now, I'm going to gently insert one finger into the vagina to feel your uterus and ovaries. This might feel a little uncomfortable, but it will give me important information. Again, please let me know if you feel any pain. Okay, the uterus feels normal in size and shape. The ovaries… there’s a slight tenderness on the left side, but no obvious masses. It’s difficult to say definitively, but there is some mild discomfort with palpation. Okay, that’s all done. Everything seems mostly normal, but the slight tenderness on the left ovary warrants further investigation. I'd like to order a pelvic ultrasound to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, good. At least it wasn't… anything terrible. A slight tenderness… that's… reassuring, I suppose. An ultrasound… yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. It's good to know what's going on, even if it's not a pleasant thing. What exactly does the ultrasound involve? And how long will it take to get the results? I do worry about these things, you know. It’s just… I tend to overthink.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Stepno. It’s perfectly normal to worry. The ultrasound is a painless procedure. A technician will apply a gel to your lower abdomen and use a handheld device to create images of your uterus and ovaries. It’s completely non-invasive, and it doesn’t involve any radiation. It typically takes about 20-30 minutes. As for the results, I should have them within 24-48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any infection and check your hormone levels. It's standard procedure given your symptoms. I will also prescribe a mild pain reliever to help manage any discomfort you’re experiencing. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, that makes sense. And pain reliever… thank you, that would be most helpful. No, I think I understand everything. Ultrasound, blood work, pain reliever… and then a phone call when the results are available. It sounds… thorough. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid? I do a lot of gardening, and I don't want to make things worse. And… is there anything that might cause this tenderness? I tend to worry about these things.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Ms. Stepno. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid any strenuous activity, especially lifting heavy objects. It’s okay to do light gardening, but listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain. As for what might be causing the tenderness, it could be a number of things. It could be a simple ovarian cyst, which are very common and often disappear on their own. It could also be related to inflammation or a minor infection. The ultrasound will help us to determine the exact cause. Here are the lab requisition and the prescription for the pain reliever. The lab is just down the hall to your left. And here's a sheet with some instructions about preparing for the ultrasound. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results, Ms. Stepno. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, fever, or unusual bleeding, please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Annesley. You’ve been very patient and… reassuring. I was quite anxious, but I feel much better now, knowing what’s going on. I’ll go to the lab right away and then get the prescription filled. Thank you again for everything. And… I’ll look forward to your call. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stepno. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and take care.
