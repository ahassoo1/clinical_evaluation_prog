DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nahrwold. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly, it's… well, it’s my stomach. It’s been acting up a lot lately. Just… a lot of diarrhea, I guess. It's been going on for a while now, and it's kind of annoying, to be honest. I don't really remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: I see. Diarrhea can certainly be disruptive. Thank you for sharing that with me. When you say “a while now,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, that’s the hard part. I really don't know. Maybe… a couple of months? Or longer? It comes and goes, you know? Some days are worse than others. It’s hard to pinpoint. I feel like it’s been more frequent recently, though. Definitely more frequent. I just… I can't really say for sure when it started, sorry. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. It's not uncommon for these things to develop gradually. So, it's been occurring on and off for approximately two months or longer, with increased frequency recently. Besides the diarrhea itself, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been a little tired, I guess. Just… more tired than usual. And sometimes my stomach feels… bloated, really uncomfortable. And… oh! Sometimes I get cramps. Not terrible cramps, but enough to notice. I haven’t… I don’t think I’ve lost any weight, though. No, I don’t think so. I haven't been weighing myself or anything. Is that helpful? I don’t know if any of that matters.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Nahrwold. Fatigue, bloating, and cramps are all important details. And the fact that you haven’t noticed any weight loss is also good information. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That’s… a bit of a personal question. I… I think I saw a little bit of blood once, maybe? A while ago. It wasn't a lot, and I just… assumed it was something I ate. It hasn’t happened again, as far as I remember. But, yeah, maybe once. It scared me a bit, but then it didn’t happen again, so I didn’t really think much of it. Sorry, that's probably gross.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Nahrwold, it’s important to be thorough, and you're doing a good job describing what you've experienced. Seeing blood, even a small amount, is something we need to investigate further. Now, let's talk about your diet. Have you noticed any specific foods that seem to trigger or worsen your symptoms?
PATIENT: That’s… another tricky one. I don’t really know. I eat pretty much everything. My husband does most of the cooking, and I don't pay much attention to what’s in everything, just that it tastes good. I guess… dairy sometimes feels a bit… iffy? But I like dairy, so I don’t usually avoid it. And sometimes spicy food makes it worse, but I really like spicy food. So I don’t avoid that either. Sorry, I’m not very helpful. I don’t really have any food restrictions. It just seems random.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Nahrwold. It's common for these things to not have a clear trigger. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or Celiac disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… I honestly don’t remember. I've been to doctors before, of course, but I don’t really pay attention to all the medical terms. My husband usually handles all that stuff. I think… maybe something with my stomach when I was a kid? But I don't really remember what it was. It wasn't serious, I think. I haven’t been told I have any of those… Crohn’s or… Celiac? No, I don’t think so. But I could be wrong. I really don’t know. Sorry. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Nahrwold. We can look into your records to clarify. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any surgeries. Well… I had my tonsils out when I was little, I think. That's… is that a surgery? It was a long time ago. But other than that, no. Definitely no major surgeries. I would remember that, wouldn’t I? It was just my tonsils, though. A really long time ago. And I was really little. So, no. No surgeries, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, tonsillectomy is considered a surgery. Thank you for clarifying. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had some kind of stomach trouble, I think. But I don’t know what kind. Everyone just said she had a “sensitive stomach.” And my uncle… he had some kind of cancer, I think. But not… not colon cancer. Some other kind. I don’t really know much about it. It was a long time ago, and we don’t talk about it much. So, no. I don’t think there’s any history of… those specific things. But I really don’t know for sure. Sorry, I’m not very helpful. It’s a big family, and I don’t remember everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Nahrwold. You're providing me with valuable information. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I don’t smoke. I can’t stand the smell of it. And I very rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. My husband likes it more than I do. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I’m a pretty boring person, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Nahrwold. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but not every day. And… oh! I take something for my allergies. Just… something over the counter. It’s a little blue pill. I don’t remember the name. And… that’s it, I think. Nothing else. Just the allergy medicine, when my allergies are bad. And the multivitamin, sometimes. Is that helpful? It’s not much, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. Do you happen to know the dosage of the allergy medication you take?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I just… I just take one. Or maybe two, if it's really bad. I don't pay attention to the box or anything. My husband buys it, and I just take it when I need it. It's… a little blue pill. That's all I know. Sorry, I'm really not good with these things. I should probably pay more attention, shouldn't I? But I just take what he gives me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Nahrwold. We can look into that later. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Except… I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats. But that's just a mild allergy. Not a serious one. And… no, I don’t think I’m allergic to any medications or food. No. I’m pretty sure I’m not. But… it’s always possible, I guess. I’ve just never noticed anything. Sorry, I'm not very helpful with this stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Nahrwold. Thank you for providing me with all of that information. Now, if you don’t mind, I would like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen, feeling your abdomen for tenderness, and checking your vital signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I just… I hope it’s not anything serious. I just want to feel better. So, yes, please. Do whatever you need to do. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's begin. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your bowel sounds are… slightly hyperactive, which isn't necessarily concerning in the setting of diarrhea, but something we'll keep in mind. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. This means I’ll be feeling for any tenderness or masses. Again, please let me know if anything feels painful. There's a little tenderness here, on your lower left side. Is this where you typically feel the cramps you mentioned?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that’s usually where it hurts. Not terrible pain, but… yeah, that’s where I feel it. It’s kind of… a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it’s sharper, but usually just a dull ache. Is that… bad? Is that what’s causing it? It’s been going on for so long, I just assumed it was normal.
DOCTOR: It’s good you pointed that out, Ms. Nahrwold. Tenderness in the lower left quadrant can have several causes. It’s not necessarily alarming, but it does warrant further investigation. The rest of your abdomen feels soft and non-distended. I don’t feel any masses. Now, let me check your vital signs: your blood pressure is 120/80, your pulse is 72, and your temperature is 98.6, which are all within normal limits. Based on what you've told me and my examination, I'd like to order some tests to help determine the cause of your diarrhea and abdominal pain. I’m going to order a complete blood count to check for signs of infection or anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a stool culture to look for any bacteria, parasites, or viruses that might be causing your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. And… if those tests can help, then yes, please. Please order them. I just… I want to feel normal again. Will they be… painful? Do I have to… you know? For the stool sample?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Nahrwold. The stool sample collection is a non-invasive procedure. You'll be provided with a collection kit and instructions on how to collect a small sample at home. It may be slightly inconvenient, but it’s not painful. The lab will provide you with specific instructions to ensure an accurate result. The blood work is just a standard blood draw, and a phlebotomist will take care of that. There may be a slight pinch, but it's usually very quick. I will also order a test to rule out C. difficile, a common bacteria that can cause diarrhea. Once the results are back, which usually takes a few days, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, eating bland foods like rice, toast, and bananas, and avoiding dairy, caffeine, and alcohol. Do you have any questions about these recommendations or the tests I've ordered?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… staying hydrated and eating bland foods. And the tests. How long will it take to get the results? A few days, you said? And then we’ll schedule another appointment? Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? I’m kind of scared.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be scared, Ms. Nahrwold. It’s always best to be prepared. The results usually take between 3 to 5 business days. The lab will contact you directly when they are available. As for whether it’s serious, it’s too early to say definitively. Diarrhea can be caused by a variety of factors, most of which are not serious—like a viral infection or dietary changes. However, it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. These tests will help us do that. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly at your follow-up appointment, and I’ll explain all of your options. I want to reassure you that we’re taking this seriously, and we’ll work together to get you feeling better. Do you have any particular concerns about the tests?
PATIENT: No… I think I just… I just don't like not knowing. Will the tests tell me… if it’s something I ate? Or if it’s something… worse? Like… something in my stomach? I’ve heard about… IBD and… Celiac disease. Is that what you're testing for? IBD and Celiac disease?
DOCTOR: Those are certainly possibilities we need to consider, Ms. Nahrwold, and the tests will help us investigate those. The stool culture will identify any bacterial or parasitic infections that may be causing your symptoms. The blood work will help us assess inflammation levels in your body, which can be indicative of IBD. And we can also test for antibodies associated with Celiac disease. It’s also possible it could be something as simple as a food intolerance or a viral infection, which we'll rule out with the stool culture. We will gather as much information as possible from these tests to pinpoint the cause of your symptoms. Do you have any specific foods you suspect might be triggering your diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, my husband does most of the cooking, and I eat pretty much everything. I don’t really pay attention. I guess… sometimes dairy feels a little… off, but I don’t usually avoid it. And spicy food sometimes makes it worse, but I like spicy food too much to stop eating it. So, no, I don’t have any specific suspects. It just seems random. I wish I could be more helpful, but I honestly don’t know what’s causing it. Is there anything else I should be doing? Besides staying hydrated and eating bland foods?
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Ms. Nahrwold. It’s perfectly normal not to know the exact cause, and that’s why we’re doing these tests. For now, continuing to stay hydrated and eating bland foods is a good start. You can also try taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, such as loperamide , if your symptoms are particularly bothersome, but I would recommend checking with me before starting any new medication. It's important to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, or signs of dehydration, such as dizziness or decreased urination, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions about those recommendations or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… monitor my symptoms, contact you if anything changes, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment when the results are back. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so thoroughly. I feel a little better knowing that we’re trying to figure out what’s going on. I think… I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Nahrwold. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Remember, we’re a team in this. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here are the lab requisitions and a sheet with instructions for the stool sample collection. The nurse will review the discharge instructions with you before you leave. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Ms. Nahrwold.
