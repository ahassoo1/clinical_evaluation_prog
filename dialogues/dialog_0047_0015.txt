DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… my nose. It’s been… bothering me. A lot of pressure, you know? It’s hard to… explain exactly. It just feels bad. I think it's my sinuses, but I’m not really sure.
DOCTOR: “Feels bad,” is… not terribly helpful, Ms. Boham. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, I’m sorry, Doctor. It’s just… it’s hard to put into words. It’s like… a heavy feeling? And… sometimes it hurts, deep inside my face. Around my nose and… my cheeks, maybe? I don’t know. It’s been going on for… a while now, I think. A few weeks, maybe longer. I forget easily.
DOCTOR: Right. “A few weeks, maybe longer.” And this pressure… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days it’s… better. Not good, but… not so bad. And other days, like today… it's really hard to breathe through my nose. It feels all stuffy. And… I get a little headache sometimes, with it. Not a bad headache, but… annoying. Is that… helpful? I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It's… marginally more descriptive, Ms. Boham. Do you have any fever, chills, or cough associated with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills. And I don’t cough. I haven't been sick, not like a cold or anything. It’s just… this pressure. It’s very strange. Sometimes, I feel a little tired, but I work very hard, so maybe that's just from work. I work with… the drills. Oil, you know? It’s a hard job.
DOCTOR: Right. And any changes in your sense of smell?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. I… haven’t really noticed. I smell… things, I think. I smell food when I’m cooking. And… the oil, at work. It smells like oil. I don’t know if it smells different than usual. I'm sorry, I don't understand, is something wrong? Is my nose broken or something?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Boham, your nose is not broken. I am simply trying to ascertain the extent of your symptoms. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um… I don’t think so. I've never been told I have allergies. My mother… she had allergies to… something with flowers, maybe? But I don’t. I like the flowers at work, sometimes they bring flowers. They smell nice. I don't get… itchy or anything. Just this pressure in my nose. I hope that helps?
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications. I don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy, you know? Hard work and… good food. That’s what my mother always said. No pills. I don't even take… vitamins, usually. Just this pressure. Is this taking a long time? I don't want to bother you.
DOCTOR: We are simply gathering information, Ms. Boham. It's necessary. Now, do you have any history of sinus infections in the past?
PATIENT: Sinus… infections? I… don't remember. I've been sick before, like colds, but I don't know about… infections. My mother, she used to… put something on my forehead when I was little, when I was sick. A cold cloth, I think. But… infections? No, I don’t think so. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at remembering things. I forget so much. It's frustrating. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a quick look at your nose and sinuses. Perhaps a physical examination will be more informative than this… vague recounting of symptoms. Please sit forward.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. I hope you can see what’s wrong. I just want this pressure to go away. Please, go ahead. I’ll sit forward.
DOCTOR: I'm just going to take a quick look inside your nostrils to check for any blockages or inflammation. It might be a little uncomfortable. Take a deep breath… Hmm. There’s some mild mucosal swelling, but no obvious polyps or foreign bodies. Your nasal passages seem somewhat congested. Tenderness to palpation over the maxillary sinuses is present bilaterally. There’s a faint dullness to percussion as well. Based on my examination, it appears you’re likely experiencing sinusitis, most probably a viral infection causing some inflammation and congestion.
PATIENT: Sinusitis? That sounds… bad. Is it serious, Doctor? Will I need… surgery? I’m worried now. And what about the drills? I need to work. People are counting on me. Is there something I can take? Not pills, if possible… but something.
DOCTOR: Ms. Boham, it's not serious. It’s a common infection. Surgery is rarely needed for a simple case like yours. And while I understand your concerns about work, we must address your health first. Regarding medication… ideally, symptomatic treatment is sufficient. However, given the duration of your symptoms and the congestion, a short course of a decongestant and perhaps a saline nasal rinse might provide some relief. A decongestant is a pill, I’m afraid. A saline rinse, however, is pill-free. You can purchase a pre-mixed solution at any pharmacy, or make your own with distilled water and non-iodized salt. Use it twice daily to help clear your nasal passages. Given your lack of insurance, I recommend over-the-counter options for now. If your symptoms worsen after a week, or you develop a fever, chills, or severe facial pain, you must seek medical attention immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. A… saline rinse. And a… pill. Just for a week? And if it gets worse, I come back? I understand. No surgery, that’s good. The drills… they're very dusty, sometimes. Maybe that's it? Is it the dust? Should I wear a mask? I don’t want to get sick again. And… how do I make the… saline? With the salt? Is it hard? I’m not very good with… things like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, the dust at work could certainly be exacerbating the issue. A mask is an excellent idea. An N95 mask would be most effective at filtering out particulate matter. As for the saline rinse… it’s not difficult, but you must be precise. Use one teaspoon of non-iodized salt in one pint of distilled water. Mix thoroughly until dissolved. You can use a neti pot or a squeeze bottle to administer it. There are many videos online demonstrating the proper technique. I’m providing you with a basic treatment plan. If the symptoms persist despite these measures, or worsen, you should consult a specialist. I can provide a referral, but it may require a cash payment. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A… teaspoon. And a… pint. And… distilled water. That’s a lot to remember. And a… video. I will try. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. I… I think that’s all. I just want to feel better. Thank you again, Doctor Press. I hope the… mask and the salt and the video… work. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Try to get some rest, Ms. Boham, and prioritize hygiene. And do try to follow the instructions carefully. Good day.
