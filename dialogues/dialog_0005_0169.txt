DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner… Derick. Yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc… it's this puffiness, see? My face… and my legs. They just… swell up. It’s been happenin’ for a bit now, can’t rightly say how long. Time kinda… slips away, you know? It’s not comfortable, that’s for sure. Makes my boots a real pain.
DOCTOR: "A bit now," right. Well, that's… helpful. Boots being a pain isn’t exactly a medical complaint, Mr. Miner. Let’s try to be a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? Look, I'm tellin' ya, it swells! What more specific do you need? It’s not like I’m makin’ it up! I've lived 59 years, I know what’s wrong with my own body. It's the puffiness, alright? And it gets worse when I’m on my feet all day. I'm a welder, doc. I stand. A lot. Don't need you tellin' me about standin'.
DOCTOR: Welding. Right. And you've noticed this puffiness… consistently with long periods of standing?
PATIENT: Consistently? Hmm… well, when I haven't been standin'? No, I don't notice it much. Not like I spend all day loungin’ around, you know? My wife… she passed, and there’s a lot to keep up with. The house, the yard… always somethin’. So, yeah, it’s mostly when I'm workin’. Unless… unless I eat somethin’ salty, maybe. Sometimes that makes it worse too. But mostly the standin’. Really, it's a nuisance. A real one.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned your wife passed… my condolences, Mr. Miner. When was that, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh… it was… a while back now. Three years, I think? Maybe four? Time… it really does get away from ya. It wasn’t quick, that’s for sure. Lots of… doctors and hospitals. She had her troubles. Not like this puffiness, though. This is just… annoying. A bother. I don’t have time for this. Besides, I don’t even have a regular doctor. Never really needed one ‘til now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. No previous medical history noted. And you say this swelling is… new?
PATIENT: New… well, not completely new. I remember my ankles bein’ a bit swollen sometimes when I was younger, after a long day. But nothin’ like this. Not my face swellin’ up. And it’s not just my ankles, it's my legs, right up to my knees. It’s… uncomfortable, is what it is. Like wearing tight socks all day. And it doesn’t go away, not really. Even when I sit down.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. Let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Exam? What for? I just told you what’s wrong! You don't need to poke and prod. I can tell you what’s wrong with my legs. But… fine. Go ahead, I suppose. Just don’t take all day. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here for me. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your legs and ankles. And please, try to relax. I understand you're busy. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again. Good. Heart sounds are… regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at these legs. Yes… there is noticeable pitting edema in both lower extremities, extending up to the knees. And some mild swelling around the face, particularly the periorbital area. Any pain with this swelling?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain. Just… heavy. Uncomfortable. Like they weigh a ton. And… kinda itchy sometimes, around the ankles. It's not sharp pain, doc. It’s just… a bother. A real bother. And it’s always worse at the end of the day, like I said. You don't need to write down every little detail. I told you all this already. Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing edema, likely due to venous insufficiency. Now, venous insufficiency is… well, it means your veins aren't properly returning blood from your legs back to your heart. It can be caused by standing for long periods, genetics, and other factors. It’s often more noticeable at the end of the day, which fits what you’re describing. We need to rule out other, more serious conditions first, though. I'm going to check your pulses in your feet and ankles to make sure the circulation is good.
PATIENT: Pulses? What for? I feel fine. My legs work, don’t they? I walk, I weld, I get around. You're makin' a big deal outta nothin', doc. This is just puffiness. My wife used to get swollen ankles sometimes, too. It never needed all this… fuss. But… fine. Go ahead. Just be quick about it. I’ve got things to do, remember?
DOCTOR: Pulses are present, but somewhat diminished. Not alarming, but something to note. Alright, Mr. Miner. I'm going to order some blood work. We need to check your kidney function, liver function, and rule out any underlying heart problems. It's standard procedure. Also, I'm going to recommend you elevate your legs whenever possible, especially at the end of the day, and wear compression stockings. They help improve circulation. And I strongly recommend we follow up with a cardiologist. Just to be safe.
PATIENT: Cardiologist? Now you're just tryin’ to scare me! Blood work? Compression stockings? This is gettin’ ridiculous. I came in here for puffiness, not a full-blown medical investigation! I don’t have time for all this, doc. I'm a welder, not a hospital patient. Look, I appreciate you lookin’ at it, but I think I'll just… try elevatin’ my legs. And maybe lay off the salt. That's good enough for me. I don’t need a cardiologist, and I definitely don’t need blood work. I'm not payin' for all that. Thanks for your time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I understand your frustration, but I’m obligated to ensure your well-being. Dismissing potential underlying issues isn’t responsible. While elevating your legs and reducing salt intake are good starting points, they may not address the root cause. And given your diminished pulses, a cardiac evaluation is prudent. I’m not trying to scare you, I’m trying to help you. However, if you absolutely refuse blood work and a cardiology referral, I must document your informed refusal. I'll provide you with a printed summary of my findings and recommendations, as well as information on compression stockings. Please, reconsider. But ultimately, the decision is yours. .
