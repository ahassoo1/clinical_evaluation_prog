DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're ninety years young. That’s quite remarkable. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Ninety years… feels longer some days, I tell ya. It’s my blood pressure, mostly. Been runnin’ a little high, the nurse said when she took it. Don’t like feelin’ all… flustered, you know? Just want it settled, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Flustered,” you say. I understand. Elevated blood pressure can certainly cause unpleasant sensations. Now, when did you first notice this… “fluster,” and has it been consistent, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It ain’t been a sudden thing, not at all. More like… creepin’ up on me. Maybe a month or so ago I started feelin’ it after I’d been bakin’ all day. Lots of standin’ and movin’, see? And then it just… stayed with me some. Not every single minute, but often enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it seems to be exacerbated by activity, specifically baking, which involves prolonged standing and movement. And you’ve noticed it for approximately one month. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings were when the nurse took them?
PATIENT: Readin’s? Oh dear… no, I don’t rightly remember numbers. I just know she frowned a little and said I needed to see the doctor. Numbers always muddle my head. I’m better with flour and sugar than I am with… whatever those little digits mean.
DOCTOR: Quite alright, Ms. Steines. Numbers can be…unnecessary. I'll access the readings from the nurse’s notes here. … Yes, here we are. 158 over 92, taken this morning. And the previous reading three days ago was 145 over 88. Those are somewhat elevated. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes. Sounds… high. No, never been told I had it before. I’ve always felt pretty good, mostly. A little achin’ in my joints now and then, what you’d expect for an old woman. But nobody ever said nothin’ about my blood pressure. Just bakin' and tryin’ to stay busy, mostly.
DOCTOR: I see. So, this is a relatively new development. Now, let’s discuss your medical history a bit further. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbin’ a cherry tree. And I had the flu real bad once, maybe fifty years ago. But never been in the hospital for anythin’ serious. Just the usual scrapes and sniffles, you know? I’ve always been lucky, I guess. Kept myself movin', mostly.
DOCTOR: A fractured wrist in childhood and a bout of influenza fifty years ago. Otherwise, generally healthy. Now, have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had a surgery. Always avoided ‘em if I could. My mama used to say, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!” And I always tried to live by that. Just a little bit of home remedies when I needed somethin', mostly.
DOCTOR: Sensible woman, your mother. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Mama and Papa… they been gone a long time now. Both passed when I was still fairly young, maybe in my forties. Papa had a weak heart, I think. Never really knew much about it, things were different back then. Didn't talk about things like that so much. And Mama… she just wore herself out workin'.
DOCTOR: Parents deceased. Father had a weak heart, mother died from exhaustion. Now, do you have any siblings?
PATIENT: I had a brother, Thomas. He was older’n me. He passed a few years back, bless his heart. He lived out west, in California. Didn’t see him much, but we wrote letters for a long time. He was a good man. Always worried about me, even when he was sick.
DOCTOR: One brother, deceased. Now, Ms. Steines, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mama wouldn't allow it. Said it was a nasty habit and smelled awful. Always told me to take care of my lungs, 'cause they were important for bakin’ and singin’. And I've always listened to my mama.
DOCTOR: Sensible. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little bit of wine, sometimes. On Sundays, with dinner. Just a glass or two. My brother Thomas used to send me a nice bottle every Christmas. But nothin’ heavy, mind you. Mostly just for taste, and to remember Thomas.
DOCTOR: Very moderate alcohol consumption. Now, regarding your diet… you mentioned baking. Is that your primary source of food, or do you have a regular diet in addition to your baked goods?
PATIENT: Well, I do bake a lot, that’s true. But I eat other things too! I have a garden, you see. Tomatoes, beans, squash… I make a good soup, and I eat plenty of vegetables. And I have a neighbor who brings me chicken sometimes. I try to eat a balanced diet, even if it does include a slice of pie now and then. Can’t live on vegetables alone, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course not. Now, do you take any medications regularly, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis in my hands. Helps with the achin’ so I can keep bakin’. It’s… let me see… naproxen, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take somethin’ for my sleepin', if I'm tossin' and turnin' too much. That’s mostly just when I get worried.
DOCTOR: Naproxen for arthritis and an occasional sleep aid. Now, Ms. Steines, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go right ahead, Doctor. I ain’t got nothin’ to hide. Just try not to poke too hard, these old bones are a little fragile.
DOCTOR: Very well. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Heart sounds are…regular, but slightly stronger than ideal. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackling noted. Now, let's check your blood pressure again. 162 over 95. As expected, elevated. I'll also palpate your thyroid. No enlargement or nodules. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes. Reflexes are slightly diminished, consistent with age. All right. Based on the examination and your history, it appears you have Stage 1 Hypertension, likely exacerbated by activity.
PATIENT: Stage 1… what now? Exacerbated… oh dear. That sounds serious. Is that… bad? What does that mean, Doctor? And what can I do about it? I don't want to stop bakin', you see. It’s… well, it's everything.
DOCTOR: “Stage 1 Hypertension” simply means your blood pressure is consistently higher than normal, but not critically high. “Exacerbated” means it gets worse with activity, as we discussed. It is not immediately life-threatening, Ms. Steines, but it does require attention, to prevent it from becoming more serious over time. It is quite common at your age. As for preventing it from worsening… stopping baking entirely is not necessarily the answer. However, we need to implement some lifestyle modifications, and potentially medication. First, let's discuss dietary changes. Reducing sodium intake is crucial. We’ll need to limit processed foods, and be mindful of salt usage when you are cooking. We also need to focus on potassium-rich foods – bananas, sweet potatoes, spinach. I can provide you with a handout detailing a DASH diet—Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension—which is specifically designed to lower blood pressure. Second, regular, moderate exercise is beneficial, but avoid strenuous activity that significantly elevates your blood pressure. Gentle walking, gardening…these are excellent options. Finally, we may need to consider a low-dose antihypertensive medication to help control your blood pressure. We’ll start with a very small dose, and monitor your response closely. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Oh land sakes. That’s a lot to take in. Sodium… DASH… medication… My head’s swimmin’ again. I can try to cut back on the salt, I suppose. And I do plenty of walkin’ in the garden, seein’ to my tomatoes. But medication… I don’t like the sound of that. Are there any side effects? And will it make me feel… different? I need to be able to think clearly for my bakin’, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Steines. Medication is not always ideal, but in your case, it may be necessary to protect your cardiovascular health. The side effects of most antihypertensive medications are generally mild—dizziness, fatigue, perhaps some lightheadedness. We'll start with the lowest possible dose, and monitor you closely for any adverse effects. If you experience any, we can adjust the dosage or try a different medication. As for feeling “different,” some people experience a slight change in energy levels, but these are usually manageable. And, critically, a controlled blood pressure will improve your cognitive function in the long run. High blood pressure puts a strain on all your organs, including the brain. We can begin with a trial of Lisinopril, 5mg daily. I’ll write you a prescription. I would also like you to purchase a home blood pressure monitor so you can track your readings daily and bring them to your next appointment. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to assess your response to the medication and review your diet and exercise progress. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… 5 milligrams… Alright. A home monitor… I suppose I can manage that. And one month… that sounds alright. My only worry is… will it affect my recipes? I’ve been bakin’ the same way for… well, forever. Will I have to change things? Will my pies still taste the same? Old man Hemlock down the street swears my cherry pie is the best in the county, and I don't want to disappoint him.
DOCTOR: That is… a remarkably specific concern, Ms. Steines. And a perfectly valid one, given your dedication to your craft. No, Lisinopril should not affect your recipes in any way. It works on your blood pressure, not your sense of taste or your baking skills. You should be able to continue using the same ingredients and techniques without any alteration. However, it is important to maintain a healthy diet overall, which may involve reducing the amount of sugar you consume. But that is for your overall health, not to change the flavor of your pies. I’ve printed out a handout with information about Lisinopril, as well as dietary guidelines. I’ll also write you a prescription for the medication. Do you feel comfortable with this plan?
PATIENT: Alright then. If it won't mess with my pies, I suppose I can give it a try. And a handout… good. I like havin’ things written down. Yes, I feel… as comfortable as I can, I reckon. It's just a lot to take in, seein’ as I've never had to worry 'bout my blood pressure 'fore. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… patient with an old woman's worries.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Ms. Steines. It is my job to address your concerns, and I understand that this is a significant change. Remember, we will monitor your progress closely, and I am here to answer any questions you may have along the way. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any side effects or have any concerns. Here’s a card with the clinic’s contact information. We’ll see you in one month, then. In the meantime, enjoy your baking – and please, tell Old Man Hemlock I said hello. Have a good day, Ms. Steines.
PATIENT: Well, thank you kindly, Doctor. I will. And I’ll be sure to tell Old Man Hemlock. He’ll be right pleased. You have a good day too. And thank you again for listenin’ to an old woman ramble. .
