DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my back. It’s been really bad. Hurts to move, hurts to sit… pretty much hurts all the time now. It's the same back that... well, you probably see on the paper, right? The cancer back?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see your history of cancer treatment here. And you’re experiencing back pain now. Okay. When did this pain start, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… not all at once, you know? It was like a little ache at first, maybe two weeks ago? But the last three days it’s gotten so much worse. I had to ask my daughter to help me get dressed this morning. That’s how bad. It feels like… a heavy weight, always pushing down.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset that’s worsened significantly over the last three days, making it difficult to perform daily activities… and requiring assistance with dressing. Do you have any pain radiating down your legs, or any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. It's mostly just in my back. No shooting pains down my legs, and my feet feel okay. I can wiggle my toes, and I walked okay to get here, though it hurt to walk, you know? It’s just… a deep, constant ache right in my lower back. Like someone is sitting on me. Sometimes it feels… hot, too. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, no radiating pain or weakness, just a constant ache with a sensation of warmth. The warmth is good to know. Let’s talk a little more about that. Is this warmth constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Like, sometimes it’s just a regular ache, but then other times it feels… like a fire, almost. Not a big fire, but you know, warm and a little… prickly? It doesn't last long when it feels like that, maybe five minutes at a time, but it scares me a little when it does. Does that make sense? I’m not good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Meigs. Intermittent warmth and a prickly sensation. And you said this started about two weeks ago, gradually worsening. Have you tried anything to relieve the pain – heat, ice, over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My daughter, Leilani, she told me to put heat on it, so I did. A warm towel. It helps a little, but not for long. I took some of those… Tylenol? The regular kind. It didn’t really do much, honestly. Maybe took the edge off for an hour, but then it came back just as bad. I don't like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, heat provides some temporary relief, and Tylenol is ineffective. And you’re hesitant to take more medication. Given your history of cancer and this new onset of back pain, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. I understand. Cancer… it makes you worry about everything, right? If you need to poke and prod, go ahead. Just… be gentle, please? It hurts even when I just breathe sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start by having you lie down on your back. First, I'm going to feel along your spine to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Then I’ll check your range of motion. Just let me know if anything causes you significant pain. Alright, if you could lie down for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay. It’s kinda hard to get up here. I’m not as young as I used to be! Just… let me know if you need me to move a certain way. I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just feeling along your spine now. Can you tell me if you feel any pain with this?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. Right there. That’s the spot. It hurts when you push there. Not like a sharp pain, more like a deep ache, but… definitely hurts. It kinda feels like it goes all the way around my back, too, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness at L4-L5 with radiating discomfort. And just to check your range of motion, I'm going to ask you to gently bend forward, keeping your legs straight if you're able. Just go as far as you comfortably can.
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s about as far as I can go. It hurts too much if I try to go any further. My back feels like it's going to break. I can't even touch my toes anymore. I used to be able to, you know? Before… everything. It feels tight, too. Like something is stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion and pain with forward flexion. Now, can you gently try to bend your knees up toward your chest, one at a time?
PATIENT: It’s… okay. Not great, but not terrible either. It feels kinda tight, and my back still hurts, but it's not like that sharp pain when I bend forward. Just a dull ache. Can I lay back down now? This is… tiring.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You've been very cooperative, thank you. Based on your history and the physical exam, there are several possibilities. Given your past cancer history, we need to rule out any recurrence or metastasis. The pain radiating around your back, the tenderness at L4-L5, and limited range of motion suggest possible muscle strain, but the warmth you described is concerning. I want to order some imaging - an MRI of your lumbar spine - to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’m also going to order some blood work to check for inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: MRI and blood work… yes, that sounds… good. I mean, it's scary, but I want to know what's happening, right? Better to find out now than to just keep hurting. Will the MRI show if the cancer… came back? That’s what I’m most worried about, I guess. And how long will it take to get the results? I hate waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, the MRI will help us determine if there’s any evidence of recurrence or metastasis. It’s a very sensitive imaging technique. It will also show us if there’s any nerve compression or other structural issues contributing to your pain. As for waiting, I understand your anxiety. The imaging center typically gets the results back within 3-5 business days. I will personally review them as soon as they are available and contact you immediately to discuss the findings. Here is a referral for the MRI. You can schedule the appointment at your convenience. I’m also going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help with the pain and spasm, and I recommend continuing with the heat, as long as it provides some relief. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Just… worried, I guess. Three to five days… that feels like forever. Okay, muscle relaxant and heat. I can do that. Will it help me sleep? My back hurts so bad, I haven't been sleeping well. And… is there anything else I should be doing? Like, should I be resting? Or is it better to try and stay active? I always get confused about what's right and wrong these days.
DOCTOR: It’s completely normal to feel anxious, Ms. Meigs, and it’s good you’re asking questions. The muscle relaxant should help with both the pain and sleep disturbances. As for activity, it’s a bit of a balance. Complete bed rest is generally not recommended, as it can actually worsen the pain in the long run. However, avoid any strenuous activities or movements that exacerbate your pain. Gentle walking and light stretching are okay, as long as they don’t cause significant discomfort. I’m also going to give you a prescription for a low-dose pain reliever, just to help get you through the next few days while we wait for the imaging results. If your pain becomes unbearable, or you experience any new symptoms like fever, weakness, or numbness, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions about the medications or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… okay. Muscle relaxant, pain reliever, gentle walking, and heat. And call if it gets worse. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I really appreciate you explaining everything. It makes me feel a little… less scared, I guess. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. That’s what I’m here for. I understand your concerns, and we’ll get to the bottom of this together. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if anything changes or if you have any further questions. I'll have the nurse give you discharge instructions as well. And remember, gentle walking and heat. Take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I will. Bye bye.
