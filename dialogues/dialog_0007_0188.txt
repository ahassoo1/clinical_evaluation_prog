DOCTOR: Hi Criston, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I… how you say… my pee is orange. It started maybe three, four days ago. Not normal color, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine. That's definitely something we should look into. Three or four days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, around then. Maybe a little longer, I don’t really… keep track. It’s not hurting or anything, just… different. My wife, she noticed first. She said, “Criston, your pee looks like… mango juice!”
DOCTOR: Mango juice, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Very bright orange. I drink a lot of water, I always do. I work outside, it gets hot. So I thought maybe… but it doesn't go away. You understand? I don't know why it is like this. Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: No, I understand completely. It's good you're staying hydrated, especially with outdoor work. And it's smart to get it checked out when something changes. We'll figure out what's going on. First, let's talk a bit more about this. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I feel… normal. Maybe a little tired, but I always am a little tired. Work is hard. No pain, no… how you say… funny smells. Just the color. I eat normal food, like tagine and couscous, you know? Nothing different there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, no changes in smell, normal diet... good to know. And you said you're usually a little tired, so we'll keep that in mind. Do you have any problems with your kidneys or liver?
PATIENT: Kidneys…? Liver…? I don’t know. I have never been told I have problems with those. I go to the doctor for check-ups sometimes, but they always say I am okay. I think. They ask me questions and poke me, and then they say okay. Do you need to know if my father or mother had problems with those?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, it’s good you haven't been specifically told about any issues. And yes, family history can be helpful. Do you know if either of your parents had any kidney or liver problems?
PATIENT: My father… he died when I was young. Heart problem, I think. My mother… she is still alive, she lives in Morocco. She is old, but she seems okay. She has the normal old people problems, you know? Aches and pains, but nothing… serious. I don’t think she ever had problems with her kidneys or liver. But I’m not sure. We don’t talk about these things so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heart problems with your father, and your mother seems generally healthy despite some aches and pains. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Nothing. I don’t like to take pills if I can avoid it. I sometimes take a little something for my back, when it’s really bad, but it's just… how you say… a pain reliever. Like ibuprofen. But I don't take it very often. Maybe once a month, if that. And sometimes I take a vitamin D, the doctor told me because I don’t get much sun. That’s it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen and vitamin D. Good. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your abdomen. And I'll need a urine sample, of course. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds… good. I don’t like hospitals much, but I trust you, Doctor. A urine sample… yes, of course. Where do I… how you say… do it?
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. The bathroom is right over there. There's a cup in there for the sample. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, and then collect a little bit in the cup, and finish. Don't worry about being perfect, just do your best. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Okay. Mid-stream… I think I understand. I will try.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, let me take a quick look at your abdomen. I'm just going to gently press on your belly to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Okay, your abdomen feels soft and non-tender. No obvious masses or pain with palpation. Your vitals are also normal. Now let’s check the urine. The dipstick shows some elevated urobilinogen, but everything else is normal. This isn’t definitive, but it could indicate a problem with your liver or gallbladder. I would like to order a more complete set of blood tests to get a clearer picture of your liver function and also rule out any other potential causes for the orange urine.
PATIENT: Blood tests… okay. Liver… gallbladder…? Is that… bad? I don’t understand all these words. What does it mean? Will I need to go to the hospital?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take it one step at a time. "Elevated urobilinogen" just means there's a slightly higher than normal level of a certain substance in your urine. It's not a diagnosis in itself, and it can be caused by many things, some of which are very minor. I want to run these blood tests to get a better look at how your liver and gallbladder are functioning. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, it just helps us rule things out and figure out what's going on. And no, you won't need to go to the hospital right now. These tests can be done right here in the clinic. It'll just take a little bit of blood. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, I think so. So, not hospital now. That’s good. Blood tests here… okay. What will the blood tests show? Will they tell me why my pee is orange? And… will they hurt? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: That's right, no hospital right now. The blood tests will help us look at a few different things, including your liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and other markers that can tell us how well your liver and gallbladder are functioning. They will also help rule out things like dehydration or certain infections that can cause orange urine. As for the pain, it's a small pinch, honestly. Most people don't even notice it much. We'll use a small needle, and it'll be over very quickly. The phlebotomist is very skilled. We can also use a numbing cream if you're particularly worried about it. Do you want me to explain what we’re looking for in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe… a little. What are “liver enzymes”? And what is “bilirubin”? You are using so many big words, Doctor. I just want to know why my pee is orange! Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's break it down. Your liver is like a really important factory in your body. It does a lot of jobs, like cleaning your blood and making important substances. "Liver enzymes" are like the workers in that factory. When the factory is damaged or stressed, those workers start to leak out into your blood. So, by measuring the levels of those enzymes, we can get an idea of how healthy the liver is. "Bilirubin" is a waste product that's made when your body breaks down old red blood cells. Your liver usually processes and gets rid of bilirubin, but if there's a problem with the liver, bilirubin can build up in your body, which can cause things like jaundice - that's a yellowing of the skin and eyes - and sometimes, orange urine. The orange urine is likely related to something going on with your liver, but we need those blood tests to confirm it. It could be something minor, like a temporary issue with your gallbladder, but it’s important to rule out anything more serious. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Okay… liver factory… workers leaking… bilirubin… I think so. It's still confusing, but… better. So, you think maybe my gallbladder? What does that do? And what happens if it’s a problem? I am sorry, I am not very good with these things. I just work with machines.
DOCTOR: No worries at all! You're absolutely right, you work with machines, not livers! It's perfectly normal to be confused. Your gallbladder is like a small storage pouch that holds bile, which is a fluid that helps you digest fats. It's right under your liver. Sometimes, small stones can form in the gallbladder, which can block the flow of bile and cause problems. That can lead to things like abdominal pain, nausea, and sometimes, changes in urine color. However, it could also be something else entirely. That's why those blood tests are so important. They'll help us pinpoint the exact cause of the orange urine and decide on the best course of action. We’ll get the tests done, and I promise to explain everything clearly, step by step. How about we get those done now?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Gallbladder with stones… I understand a little. Fine, let’s do the tests. I just want to know what is wrong. Where do I sit? And… will they take a lot of blood?
DOCTOR: Great. Just have a seat right over here. And no, they won't take a lot of blood. Just a few vials - probably around two or three. It'll be over quickly. The phlebotomist, Maria, will be right with you. She’s very good at her job and will explain everything as she goes. Maria, could you please come and draw some blood for Criston here?
PATIENT: Okay. Two or three… I hope it’s quick. Hello.
DOCTOR: Hi Criston, nice to meet you. Dr. Hernandez has explained what’s going on?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Hernandez explained… about the liver and the gallbladder, and the tests. She is very nice. I hope it doesn't hurt too much.
DOCTOR: Maria: It's usually just a little pinch, Criston. I'm very gentle, and we'll have you in and out in a few minutes. We'll start by cleaning the area, and then I'll quickly insert the needle. Just try to relax, and let me know if you feel anything unusual. Here we go... just a little pinch. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Ouch… yes, a pinch. Not too bad… but not very nice either. Is it almost done? It feels… cold.
DOCTOR: Maria: Almost done, Criston. Just a little bit more. The coldness is just from the alcohol, it will pass quickly. All done! There you go, all finished. Just keep that bandage on for a little while, and try not to bend your arm too much for the next few minutes. I've collected the samples, Doctor.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. It wasn’t so bad… I think. How long until we know what is wrong? I hope it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Criston, I've got the preliminary results back. The good news is, your liver enzymes are only slightly elevated, and your bilirubin levels are normal. That's encouraging. Your complete blood count is also normal. However, I do see a slightly elevated level of alkaline phosphatase. That can be caused by a few different things, including mild inflammation of the liver or gallbladder, or even certain medications. It can also be caused by some less common conditions. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order an ultrasound of your gallbladder and liver. It's a non-invasive imaging test that will give us a better look at these organs and help us rule out any stones or other abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ultrasound…? No stones…? Is that… serious? What if there are stones? And what does “non-invasive” mean? I don't like anything complicated. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take it one step at a time. An ultrasound is a very simple test. It uses sound waves to create images of your gallbladder and liver. It's completely painless - there are no needles or radiation involved. "Non-invasive" just means that it doesn't require us to insert anything into your body. The technician will simply apply a gel to your abdomen and move a small device over your skin. It's like getting a massage, really. It doesn't hurt at all. As for the stones, most gallbladder stones don't cause any symptoms, and many people live with them for years without even knowing they're there. If we do find stones, we can discuss treatment options, which may include medication or, in some cases, surgery to remove the gallbladder. But we're not at that point yet. Let's just get the ultrasound done first, and see what it shows. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… no needles… like a massage… no surgery yet. That’s… better. So, just to look and see? And if there are stones, we talk about it later? When can I have the ultrasound? Is it expensive? I don’t have much money.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Just to look and see. And yes, we'll talk about everything later if we find anything. We don't need to cross that bridge until we get there. Let me see… we have an opening tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 pm. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… yes, 2:30 pm is okay. And… the money? How much will it cost? I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good news. Your insurance covers the ultrasound, and your out-of-pocket cost will be $75. We also have a payment plan available if you need it. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: $75… okay. I can pay that. A payment plan is good to know, but I think I can manage. Okay. Tomorrow at 2:30 pm. I will come here? Do I need to do anything special before the test?
DOCTOR: Perfect. Yes, come here tomorrow at 2:30 pm. And no, you don't need to do anything special before the test. You can eat and drink normally. Just try to relax and wear comfortable clothing. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very well. I feel… a little better now. I will see you tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Criston. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before tomorrow. Have a good day, and I’ll see you tomorrow.
