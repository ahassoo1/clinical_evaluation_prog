DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Geho, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Overgaard. It’s good to meet you. Well, the nurse told me it was about my cholesterol. Something was a bit high on the blood tests, she said. I don’t really understand all of it, but I figured I should get it checked out. It’s just…high cholesterol, right? I don't even know what that means for someone my age.
DOCTOR: Yes, your nurse is correct. The results did show elevated cholesterol. And frankly, at 54, it's not uncommon, but it's something we need to address. It’s not about just a number, Mrs. Geho, it’s about your risk. Now, "high cholesterol" means you have too much of a waxy substance in your blood. It builds up in your arteries, and that can lead to…well, let’s just say problems. Now, before we jump to conclusions, I need a bit more information. Do you have any family history of heart disease, or high cholesterol specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That doesn’t sound good about the arteries… Family history… hmm. My mother, her brother, Uncle Jan, he had a heart attack when he was about sixty-five, I think. And my father… well, he always said his heart wasn’t strong, but he didn’t really go to doctors much. He mostly just… slowed down a lot in his later years. I don't know if that was cholesterol or something else. Does that count? And my grandmother, on my mother's side, she lived to be ninety-three, very healthy for her age. So, it’s a bit of a mix, I suppose. I always thought I was pretty lucky, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. A mixed bag, as you say. Uncle Jan’s heart attack is relevant, certainly. And while a long life is good, it doesn't necessarily mean a lack of underlying issues. Now, let's talk about you. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I’ve always thought smoking was a dreadful habit. My mother smoked for a while when she was younger, and it was… not pleasant. No, I don’t smoke, and I don’t really drink much either. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, if I’m feeling fancy. Mostly I just drink water. Is that good? Does that help with the cholesterol thing? I try to eat fairly healthy, too – lots of vegetables, not too much red meat. I walk a lot, I live out in the country, so there’s a good bit of walking involved.
DOCTOR: Walking is… acceptable. Moderate exercise is beneficial, yes. Now, let’s get a better picture of this “fairly healthy” diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Well, breakfast is usually oatmeal with some berries and a little bit of honey. Sometimes toast, if I’m feeling like something a bit more substantial. Lunch is usually a salad with chicken or fish, and maybe a whole-wheat sandwich. For dinner… it varies. Last night we had roasted chicken with potatoes and green beans. The night before was lentil soup. We try to have fish at least twice a week, salmon mostly. I bake a lot, too, but it’s usually fruit pies or whole-wheat muffins – not too much sugar. I do enjoy a good piece of dark chocolate, though, after dinner. Is that terrible? It’s got antioxidants, right?
DOCTOR: Antioxidants are… not a free pass, Mrs. Geho. Dark chocolate, while marginally better than milk chocolate, still contains sugar and fat. Look, you describe a diet that sounds healthy, but let's not pretend it's a perfect regimen. We need to be realistic. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, no, not really. Just… a multivitamin, sometimes. And I take something for my knees, they bother me a little, especially when the weather changes. It’s called… glucosamine, I think. And that’s it. Just the multivitamin and the glucosamine. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. I always thought a good diet and exercise were enough. Is that naive?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a quick look at your knees. It’s important to get a full picture before we jump to conclusions. Please, have a seat and lean forward. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we must be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Very good, Doctor. Thank you. I suppose it’s best to be cautious. My knees are mostly just… achey, you know? Especially in the mornings, and when it rains. It’s probably just old age. Do I need to take my shoes off?
DOCTOR: No, shoes off are not necessary at this time. Breathing seems normal. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. Not concerning, given you just walked over here. Knees… slight crepitus on range of motion, consistent with age-related wear and tear. No significant swelling or warmth. Now, I'll just need to get your height and weight. Step on, please.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I haven’t weighed myself in ages, to be honest. It’s best not to know, I always thought. I’m rather tall, you know. Nearly six foot two. Always have been. It’s probably why my knees bother me so much. Do you think so, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Height is 199 centimeters, weight is 56 kilograms. That puts your BMI at… 14.1. Frankly, that’s underweight, Mrs. Geho. That in itself can contribute to various health problems. Now, let’s get back to the cholesterol. I’m going to order some further blood work, a more detailed lipid panel. We also need to check your thyroid function, given your weight. The nurse will draw the samples before you leave. It’s standard procedure. We’ll discuss the results next week.
PATIENT: Oh. Underweight? But… I eat fairly well, as I told you. And I walk a lot! I always thought I was… healthy. Are you sure? That sounds… concerning. What does that even mean, underweight? And what about my thyroid? Is something wrong with my thyroid? I haven't had any symptoms… I don’t feel sick.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Geho, please try to remain calm. Being underweight is not necessarily a sign of a serious illness, but it can indicate underlying issues. It can affect your metabolism, your energy levels… and it can contribute to elevated cholesterol. As for your thyroid, it’s a simple blood test. We’re just ruling things out. It’s a precaution, nothing more. Now, I suspect your diet, despite your best efforts, is lacking in certain essential nutrients. Walking is good for cardiovascular health, but it doesn't compensate for inadequate nutrition. We'll review the results next week and discuss a plan of action. I'm going to recommend a consultation with a registered dietitian. They can help you optimize your diet and ensure you're getting the nutrients you need. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. A dietitian? I… I suppose so. It’s just… I thought I was doing everything right. All those years of walking, trying to eat healthy… I feel rather foolish, to be honest. And a little bit scared. What if it’s something serious? What if I need medication? I don’t like taking pills… Is my cholesterol very high, Doctor? Please, just tell me the truth. I can handle it, I think.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Geho, your cholesterol is elevated, yes. It’s not critically high at this moment, but it is trending in the wrong direction. And frankly, your low body weight is a cause for concern. The combination of the two is… suboptimal. Now, medication is not necessarily required at this time. We're going to try dietary modifications first, under the guidance of a dietitian. If those are unsuccessful, then we can discuss other options. It's important to understand that simply trying to eat healthy is not enough. You need to be precise, to understand your nutritional needs, and to ensure you're getting the right balance of macronutrients. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. I suggest you schedule an appointment with the dietitian as soon as possible. They’re excellent, and they’ll help you get on the right track.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. I'll… I'll schedule the appointment with the dietitian. Thank you, Doctor. .
