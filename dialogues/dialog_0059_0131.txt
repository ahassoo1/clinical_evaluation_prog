DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having some trouble with my blood pressure, that’s what the nurse said anyway. It’s been a bit high, and she told me to come see you.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, as measured by the nurse. Thank you for letting me know. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I don’t really feel any different, to be honest. I just went for a check-up with my regular doctor and she said it was a little high, so she wanted me to get it checked out again. Then the nurse here took it and said the same thing. I don’t really know what the numbers were, though. She just said it was too high. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It's not uncommon to not feel any symptoms with high blood pressure, especially in the early stages. Do you recall when your regular doctor initially mentioned it was a bit elevated?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was… about three months ago, I think. Maybe April? She said to watch my salt intake and stuff, and to keep an eye on it. I tried to cut back on salt, but… I like to cook, you know? And a lot of my recipes have a little salt in them. I didn’t go back for another check-up right away, and then the nurse at the community clinic suggested I come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three months ago your doctor noted a slightly elevated blood pressure and advised you to monitor your salt intake. And you’ve been trying to do that, but it’s been difficult. That’s perfectly alright; it can be a challenging adjustment. Before we discuss that further, let’s get a complete picture of your health. Could you tell me about any other medical conditions you might have?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, really. I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. Just gets a little stiff sometimes. And I had the flu last winter, but everyone gets the flu, right? Oh, and I have to wear glasses, as you can see! That's about it, I think. I haven't been to the hospital for anything serious in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some arthritis in your hands, a bout of the flu last winter, and you wear glasses. That’s helpful to know. Have you been diagnosed with the arthritis, or is it something you’ve self-diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh, a doctor diagnosed it. A few years back. Said it was just a little bit of wear and tear, nothing too serious. He gave me some cream for it, and it helps when it flares up. I don’t take anything regularly for it, just use the cream when I need to. It's mostly just annoying, especially when I’m cooking. Makes chopping things a little difficult sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. Cooking with arthritis can certainly be a challenge. And it’s good that the cream provides some relief when you need it. Now, just to complete the picture, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully! I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years. Nothing major, honestly. I’m usually pretty careful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And that’s excellent that you haven’t had any surgical procedures. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. Let me think. My mother had diabetes, but she managed it pretty well with diet and exercise. And my father had high blood pressure too, actually. He was on medication for it for years. And… I think my grandmother on my mother's side had heart problems, but I’m not really sure what kind. It was a long time ago, and my mother didn't talk about it much. Does that help? I’m not really the best at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. So, your mother had diabetes, your father had high blood pressure, and your maternal grandmother had some heart problems. That gives me a good starting point. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Okay… Well, I live alone. I've never been married, no kids. I work as a… well, it’s a little bit of everything, really. Personal care, mostly. Helping people with their errands, cleaning, that sort of thing. I enjoy it. I like being around people. I don’t drink or smoke, never have. I like to go to church on Sundays and… I like to cook, as we’ve established. And I like to spend time with my friends when I can. That’s about it, I guess. Pretty simple life.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mykeisha. A simple life can be a very good life. And it’s good to hear you prioritize staying active and social. Finally, just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven't had any trouble with medications before. I've taken some over-the-counter things for headaches and colds, but nothing serious. I think I'm pretty lucky in that department too.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mykeisha. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a really good overall picture of your health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to get it checked out properly.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just sit back and relax. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 158 over 92. That is elevated, confirming what the nurse initially noted. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Now, could you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, your throat looks clear, no signs of infection or inflammation. Everything looks good there. Alright, Mykeisha, based on your history and the physical exam, your elevated blood pressure is a concern. We need to investigate this further. I’d like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. We also need to rule out any underlying causes of your high blood pressure. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Blood work sounds good. No, I don’t think so. Just… what does this mean, exactly? Is it something really serious? I don’t want to have to go on medication if I can help it. Is there anything I can do now? Besides cutting back on salt, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s perfectly understandable to be concerned. High blood pressure, if left untreated, can increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. However, it’s also very manageable in most cases. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need medication right away. The blood work will help us determine the underlying cause and the best course of action. Besides reducing salt intake, there are several things you can do now. Regular exercise – aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days of the week – can help lower your blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight is also important. And managing stress through techniques like deep breathing exercises or yoga can be beneficial. We can discuss these in more detail, and I can refer you to some resources if you’re interested. It’s also important to monitor your blood pressure at home. I can show you how to do that properly. Does that help ease your concerns a little?
PATIENT: Yes, that does help, thank you. Knowing there are things I can do besides medication is good. I do enjoy walking, so I can definitely try to do that more often. And I’ve heard good things about deep breathing exercises. Showing me how to check my blood pressure at home would be great, too. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel a little less worried now. What about the blood work? How long will that take, and how will I get the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. The blood work should only take a few minutes. I’ll write you a requisition form that you can take to the lab at the community clinic. They’ll draw a small sample of blood, and the results should be back in about a week. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan tailored to your needs. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden severe headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, or vision changes, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you so much, Doctor Chagaris. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll go get the blood work done as soon as I can. And I'll try to remember to walk more!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s the requisition form for the blood work. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too! Have a good day!
