DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's my back. It's been really, really hurting. Worse than usual, I think. It started maybe... three days ago? It makes it hard to even stand up straight.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say “worse than usual,” have you experienced back pain before?
PATIENT: Yes. A long time now. The doctors… they told me about the cancer, you see? It's in my bones, they said. This pain... feels different though. Hard to explain. It's not just a dull ache like before. It's sharp, sometimes. And it goes down my leg a little. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Meigs. Sharp pain radiating down your leg is certainly something we need to investigate further. Now, when you say it started three days ago, was there anything specific you were doing when it began?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I was just… doing dishes. Normal things, you know? Not lifting anything heavy, not bending funny or anything. Just… washing the plates. Then I felt a pop, and then ow. It’s been getting worse since then, even with the medicine the other doctor gave me. The white pills.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you said you’ve been taking medication prescribed by another doctor for this bone cancer. Can you remind me what they told you the name of the medication was?
PATIENT: I… oh, dear. That's a good question. I don't remember the name. I'm so sorry. I just know they were white and I take two of them every morning. The doctor at the other place… he wrote it down for me, but I think I lost the paper. It was a long time ago. They told me it would help with the pain from the cancer, but it wasn't always working so great.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s… less than ideal, but not uncommon. We can try to get that information from your previous medical records. In the meantime, let’s focus on this new pain. You mentioned it radiates down your leg. Can you point to exactly where it’s going?
PATIENT: It goes down here. Like, the back of my leg. And sometimes… it feels a little bit in my foot, too. Not all the time, but… yeah. It makes it hard to walk. I’m walking a little slow today, I think. Sorry if I’m taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize. It’s my job to understand what’s going on. Alright, so right leg, radiating down the back of the thigh and sometimes into the foot. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's not always there. When I'm sitting still, it's not so bad. But when I try to stand up, or walk... that's when it really hurts. And if I bend over... oh, no. That's the worst. It feels like something is going to snap. It comes in waves, I guess. Like, it'll be okay for a little bit, then whoosh, a really bad pain. Then it gets a little better again. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense – intermittent, exacerbated by movement, particularly bending. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to assess the range of motion in your back and check your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. I don't want it to be something… really bad. Is it okay if I sit here while you do it? I'm a little scared to move too much.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take it slow, and you can tell me if anything is too uncomfortable. Please remain seated. First, I'm just going to gently palpate your spine to check for tenderness. Alright, I'm feeling some tenderness right here, L4-L5. And there is some muscle spasm on the right side. Now, can you just try to bend forward slightly, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… uncomfortable. I can't go very far. It feels like something is pulling. I don't like that feeling. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is somewhat limited, Ms. Meigs. And you’re right to be cautious. Now, let’s try to bend backwards, just gently. Again, only as far as comfortable. Okay… and how about that?
PATIENT: Oh, no. That's worse. That really hurts. I can't do that. It feels like it's going to snap something. I'm scared. Please, stop. I don't want to do any more bending.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. We will stop immediately. No need to push through any pain. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during this limited examination, it sounds like you may have a lumbar disc herniation, potentially compressing a nerve root. However, given your history of cancer, we need to be absolutely certain. I’m going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. This will give us a clear picture of what’s going on. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever. It’s crucial that you don’t overexert yourself and that you follow up with me as soon as you have the MRI results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… an MRI. That sounds… scary, but I guess it’s okay if that’s what you think is best. Muscle relaxant and pain reliever… that sounds good. I just want to know what’s going on. And I don’t want it to be… something bad. How long will it take to get the results? And… will it hurt? I’m a little worried about the MRI.
DOCTOR: The MRI itself is not painful, Ms. Meigs. You’ll lie flat on a table, and the machine will make some loud noises. You'll be able to communicate with the technician at all times. As for the results, it typically takes 24 to 48 hours for the radiologist to interpret them and send the report to me. I will have my assistant contact you as soon as I have them. Now, while we are waiting for the results, it’s important to maintain a reasonable level of activity, but avoid any strenuous movements, lifting, or bending. If you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, or difficulty with bowel or bladder control, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No bending, no lifting, and… if my legs feel funny, or I can't… go to the bathroom, go to the hospital. Okay. 24 to 48 hours… and you’ll call me. That’s good. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you listening to me. I was very scared. Will this medicine help me sleep? I haven't been sleeping very well.
DOCTOR: The muscle relaxant may have a mild sedative effect, Ms. Meigs. However, it's not primarily prescribed for sleep. If you continue to have trouble sleeping, you may need to consult with a specialist. Alright. I’ve issued all the necessary orders. My assistant will schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the MRI results are available. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Thank you, Doctor Versace. You were very kind. I hope… I hope it's not too bad. I just want to be able to walk again. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Get some rest, Ms. Meigs.
