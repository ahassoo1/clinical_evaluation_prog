DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. Even though I’m using the machine every night, the one for the sleep apnea. It just…doesn’t seem to be doing the trick, and it’s starting to bother me. I feel tired all the time, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Daytime sleepiness despite using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea – that’s certainly something we need to look into. It's good you're bringing this up. To start, can you tell me a little more about how long you’ve been using the CPAP machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… almost three years now, I believe. The doctor – Dr. Ramirez, back in Tampa – he diagnosed me and got me set up with it. He was very good, but I moved here to be closer to my daughter, and she suggested I find someone new. That’s how I ended up with you. Three years… give or take a few months, I suppose. I was pretty hesitant at first, but I got used to it. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, thank you. And good on you for sticking with it for three years – it can be an adjustment. Now, when you say it’s “not doing the trick”, can you describe specifically what that means?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m falling asleep right away, you understand. It's more… a constant feeling of being foggy. Like I haven’t had enough rest, even after a full eight hours. I have trouble concentrating, especially in the afternoons. And sometimes, just sometimes, I’ll find myself nodding off while I’m reading – just for a few seconds, but enough to startle me. It's just not a good feeling, Doctor. And it makes it hard to enjoy things, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That sounds very frustrating, and it definitely warrants investigation. "Foggy" and trouble concentrating are important symptoms. Before we move on, let’s quickly check your medical record to see what information Dr. Ramirez shared. Okay, here we are. It looks like you were diagnosed with moderate obstructive sleep apnea, and your initial CPAP settings were… 12 centimeters of water pressure. Have you ever had those settings adjusted since then?
PATIENT: Twelve centimeters, yes, that sounds right. And no, Doctor, they haven't been adjusted since the very beginning. Dr. Ramirez explained everything carefully, and I just… followed his instructions. I haven’t really felt the need to change anything, until recently, of course. I suppose I should have said something sooner, but I thought maybe it just needed time to… settle in. You know? I wasn’t sure if it was normal to still feel tired after so long.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. It’s common to wonder if symptoms are settling in or if something is still off. The fact that your settings haven't been adjusted in three years is something we should definitely look at. CPAP pressures sometimes need to be fine-tuned over time. Now, outside of the sleepiness, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my mouth does feel dry sometimes when I wake up, and I’ve noticed I’m going to the bathroom more often at night. Not terribly often, but… more than I used to. And my daughter keeps telling me I snore, even with the machine on. She says it’s not as loud, but she can still hear it. Oh, and… sometimes I wake up with a bit of a headache. Not a bad one, just… a dull ache. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very relevant, thank you for sharing that. The dry mouth, increased urination, continued snoring, and headaches could all be connected. It sounds like we need to explore a few different possibilities. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, just to make sure I have a complete picture. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see… I have high blood pressure, which my family doctor manages with medication – a small pill every morning. And… I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, but that wasn’t a problem, really. Aside from that, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I used to be a bit overweight, but I’ve lost some weight in the last few years. I walk every day, as long as the weather is good. And I try to eat a healthy diet – mostly fruits and vegetables. My daughter is very good about reminding me! I don't smoke, never have. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I cut back on that a while ago. Just trying to take care of myself, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s all very good information, thank you. High blood pressure, gallbladder removal, and otherwise active and healthy – that’s helpful to know. And it’s good you're managing your health proactively. Now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one for my blood pressure. A small white pill, Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And a multivitamin every morning, but that’s it. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. I prefer to let nature take its course, as much as possible. My daughter worries about me sometimes, and suggests all sorts of things, but I usually stick to the basics. Simple is best, I always say.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No other medications or supplements, just the Lisinopril and a multivitamin. Alright, Mr. Paske, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your throat and nose just to rule out any obvious causes for your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, I’m happy to cooperate. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I'm used to doctor's visits, after all, being my age! Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, which isn’t entirely unexpected. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear – no wheezing or crackling sounds. Finally, let’s take a quick look at your throat and nose. Your throat looks clear, and your nasal passages are open. There's no significant swelling or redness. Alright, everything sounds and looks reasonably normal on initial examination. Given your symptoms, your history, and these findings, I suspect the issue might be related to your CPAP machine settings or perhaps how well the mask is sealing. We need to investigate further.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. I have been having trouble with the mask leaking a little bit, especially when I move around in my sleep. My wife used to say it made a whistling sound. It’s been bothering me, but I just figured it was something I’d get used to. She… well, she passed away a few years ago, so I'm on my own with it now. But you think that leaking mask could really be causing all this tiredness? It seems like such a small thing.
DOCTOR: It absolutely could be, Mr. Paske. Even a small leak can disrupt your sleep and prevent you from getting the restorative rest you need. It forces your body to work harder to breathe, and it reduces the overall effectiveness of the CPAP therapy. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a sleep study. We can monitor your sleep patterns, your oxygen levels, and your breathing while you use your CPAP machine. This will help us determine if your current settings are optimal and if the mask leak is significantly impacting your therapy. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A sleep study… I haven't had one of those in years. I suppose it's the best way to find out what's really going on. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get a good night's sleep, honestly. It’s just… exhausting being tired all the time. So, yes, please, let’s schedule the sleep study. Where would I go for that, and what should I expect?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll schedule you for a sleep study at Lakeside Sleep Center – it’s a very comfortable facility. They have private rooms and trained technicians who will monitor you throughout the night. You’ll need to bring your usual CPAP machine and mask with you. You'll arrive in the evening, and they'll attach some sensors to your body to monitor your brain waves, heart rate, breathing, oxygen levels, and muscle activity. It’s completely painless, and you'll be able to sleep as comfortably as possible. You'll be disconnected in the morning, and a sleep specialist will analyze the data. The results typically take about a week to come back. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results once they're available. Does that all sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly manageable, Doctor. Lakeside Sleep Center… I'll look up the directions when I get home. And a week to get the results… that’s fine, I can wait. It's better to know for sure what’s going on, rather than just guessing. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure this out. Being tired all the time is just… well, it's hard to explain. It takes the joy out of everything. I’m hopeful this sleep study will give us some answers. Do I need to do anything to prepare for it? Any special foods I should avoid? Or anything I shouldn't do before I go?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. I understand completely. Being chronically tired is incredibly debilitating, and it's good we’re addressing it. As for preparation, there are just a few simple things. Please avoid caffeine and alcohol on the day of the study. You can eat a normal dinner, but try to avoid a heavy meal right before you go. And please bring your usual bedtime routine – whatever helps you relax and fall asleep. They'll provide a comfortable bed and a private bathroom. And most importantly, don't worry about it too much. The technicians are very experienced and will do their best to make you comfortable. We'll go over the results together once they're available and discuss the best course of action. My nurse will give you all the specific instructions when she calls to schedule the appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough and reassuring. I’m grateful for your help. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. I'll just wait for the nurse to call and schedule the sleep study. Thank you again for your time and patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before the study. I look forward to discussing the results with you. Have a good day, and get some rest if you can. .
