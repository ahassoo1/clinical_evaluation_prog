DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Dr. Blim, Family Medicine. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s my family. Lots of… trouble with hearts, you see? My mother, my brother… both gone too early. I just want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Get some peace of mind. I’m 73, and… well, I want to enjoy my time.
DOCTOR: A family history of cardiac issues, you say. That’s… relevant. Though, frankly, anxiety is often the culprit in these situations. Nevertheless, we shall proceed with due diligence. Now, can you be specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. My mother, she had chest pains, lots of them. Then… she just stopped. Suddenly. My brother, he was younger, maybe 60. He had… trouble breathing, and then his heart… it just gave out, they said. I don't know much about it, really. It was a long time ago. I never asked… should have, maybe. I just… worry. I feel okay now, mostly. But… sometimes my chest feels a little tight. Not bad, just… there.
DOCTOR: “Just there” is hardly a diagnosis, Mr. Schwer. We need specifics. When does this tightness occur?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Sorry. When… hmm. Usually after I walk a bit. Not far, you know? Just… to the store and back. Or up the stairs. Not every time, but… often enough to worry me. It doesn’t last long, though. Just a few minutes. And… it goes away when I rest. I guess that's good?
DOCTOR: “Good” is a relative term, Mr. Schwer. And frankly, walking to the store is not a strenuous activity for a man of your age… or should I say, most men of your age. Let’s get a proper assessment. Have you experienced any shortness of breath at rest?
PATIENT: No, not at rest. Never. Just when I’m… doing something. Like walking. Or… bending over. Things like that. It’s not… a bad shortness of breath, you understand. Just… I have to stop and catch my breath a little. It goes away quick. I just… I don't want it to be like my brother.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We've established you experience exertional dyspnea. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. Sometimes. Not every day. But… yeah, a little. Especially at the end of the day. My wife, she used to say my feet looked puffy. She… she noticed things. I don’t always, you know? Is that… bad? She’s gone now, so… I don’t get told these things.
DOCTOR: We shall determine if this is merely the anxieties of a grieving widower, or something more… substantial. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath, Mr. Schwer. And another.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Deep breath… like this? I try to breathe deep anyway. Helps with the… worry, you know? It’s… hard to explain. I just feel… better when I breathe deep. Is everything okay? You're frowning again.
DOCTOR: I detect a slight S3 gallop. Not pronounced, but present. Your lungs are clear to auscultation, thankfully. Now, let's examine your extremities for edema. Yes, there's mild pitting edema bilaterally. Alright, Mr. Schwer, based on this preliminary assessment, we need to run some tests. I'm ordering an EKG, a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a BNP. We’ll also need a chest X-ray to rule out any pulmonary congestion.
PATIENT: Tests… okay. That sounds… serious. Is it bad? Is it… like my brother? I don't want tests if it means… bad news. But I guess you need to know, right? What does the BNP… what is that, exactly? And the EKG…? I don't understand all these… words.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, please. Let's not descend into melodrama. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, assesses your heart’s electrical activity. The BNP, or B-type natriuretic peptide, is a blood test that helps determine if you have heart failure. As for whether it’s “like your brother,” it’s far too early to speculate. These tests will provide data. We need data. The nurse will draw the blood now, and we'll get you scheduled for the chest X-ray. Try to remain calm. Worrying will only exacerbate the situation.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Data… right. I'll try to be calm. But it’s hard, you know? Hard to not think about… everything. And my wife… she always knew what to do. I guess I’m on my own now. The nurse… okay, I’ll see the nurse. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you checking things out. Even if it’s… scary.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will assist you. Let’s not waste any more time. .
PATIENT: .
