DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lason is the name. It’s…well, it’s been these little spells, you see. Confusion, mostly. Not a good feeling, let me tell you. My wife, she’s the one who insisted I come. She says I ask the same questions twice, sometimes three times, in the same hour! It’s…irritating, frankly. I’ve always had a good memory. Always.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. Confusion, repeating questions… that is concerning, and it’s good your wife noticed and brought you in. It’s certainly not typical, especially if you’ve always had a good memory. Let's try to get a better understanding of these "spells." When did you first start noticing this confusion?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It wasn’t sudden, not like a switch flipped. More…gradual. Maybe six months ago? Around the time the mango season started, I reckon. Though, to be honest, I’ve been a bit preoccupied with the price of tiles lately. Everything is going up, you know. Makes a man think. But the questions…they started around then. Asking my son his wife’s name, then asking again five minutes later. That sort of thing. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, about six months ago, coinciding with the start of mango season, and you’ve noticed repeating questions. And it’s causing you some embarrassment, which is understandable. Besides repeating questions, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me see…well, I get…lost easier. Not lost driving, mind you. I know these roads like the back of my hand. But in the house…sometimes I’ll go into a room and forget why I went there. Or I’ll be telling a story and…the words just…won’t come. It’s like they’re stuck. And I’ve been…moodier, I suppose. My wife says I snap at her more easily than usual. Which is unfair, really. She worries too much. But she's always been a worrier.
DOCTOR: Okay, so getting lost in familiar surroundings, difficulty finding the right words, and some increased irritability. That’s helpful information, Mr. Lason. It sounds like these changes are definitely impacting your daily life. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms, like headaches, weakness, vision changes, or difficulty walking?
PATIENT: Headaches, no. Not really. Maybe a little tension now and then, but nothing a good night’s sleep doesn’t fix. Weakness…no. Still able to lay tile all day, though it's harder on the knees these days. Vision…well, my eyesight isn't what it used to be, but that’s just age, I reckon. I wear glasses. And walking…no trouble walking. Steady as a rock. I take the stairs two at a time, just to prove a point.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no headaches, no weakness, no significant vision changes beyond expected age-related decline, and no difficulty walking. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doctor gave me some pills for it, maybe five years ago? I take them, mostly. Sometimes I forget, but my wife reminds me. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy. Never had any serious illnesses. A few colds, a bad bout of the flu once, but nothing that put me in the hospital. I eat fairly well, mostly rice and fish. And I try to stay active, even if these old knees complain.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and generally good health otherwise. That's important information. And your wife helps you stay on top of your medication, which is good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… Ah! When I was a young man, maybe thirty years ago, I broke my arm falling off a motorbike. A silly accident, really. Had to have it set. Aside from that, no surgeries. No hospital stays. I've always been careful. A man has to provide for his family, you know. Can't be laid up in a hospital bed.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm when you were younger, but no other surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my parents are both gone now. Passed away years ago. I have three sons, all grown up with families of their own. They're good boys, though they don’t understand the value of hard work like we did. My wife, Srey, she's still with me, thank goodness. She keeps me in line. As for medical history… my mother had some problems with her memory when she got old, very forgetful. But that was just old age, I figured.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother experienced memory problems in her old age. That's potentially relevant, thank you for sharing that. And finally, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Just the pills for the pressure, and sometimes I take something for my knees when they're really bothering me. A little white pill, I think. My son buys it for me at the market. I don’t pay much attention to the name, just take it when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication and a white pill for your knees as needed. It’s good you’re telling me everything, even if you don’t remember the specifics. We can look into that knee medication later. Alright, Mr. Lason, thank you for that detailed information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my head. It’s unsettling, not remembering things. My wife worries, and truthfully, so do I. A man needs his wits about him.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Lason. It's good you're being proactive about this. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, regular and strong. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Gait is steady, no significant coordination issues. Overall, the physical exam is fairly unremarkable. However, given your symptoms and your mother’s history, I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your confusion. We'll check your thyroid levels, vitamin B12, and perform a complete blood count. I also recommend a brain scan, specifically an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your brain.
PATIENT: An MRI, you say? That sounds…serious. Is it expensive? And will it show what’s wrong? I don't want to be poked and prodded unnecessarily. My wife will be furious if it costs a fortune.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. An MRI is the best way to get a detailed look at your brain and rule out any structural problems. It's non-invasive, meaning we don't need to poke or prod you. You'll simply lie inside a scanner, and it takes detailed images. As for the cost, it can be expensive, but we’ll work with your Medicare coverage and the hospital billing department to minimize your out-of-pocket expenses. We’ll have a dedicated team to assist you with that. The MRI won’t necessarily tell us exactly what’s wrong, but it will help us identify any potential causes of your confusion, such as a small stroke, a tumor, or signs of Alzheimer's disease. We’ll then discuss the results and determine the best course of action. It's a precautionary step to get a clearer understanding of what we’re dealing with. In the meantime, I’d like to refer you to a neurologist – a specialist in brain and nerve disorders – for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A neurologist, you say. More doctors… It’s a lot, isn’t it? I just want to feel like myself again. My wife… she’s already making a list of questions for every doctor she can find. Alright. If you think it’s necessary, I suppose. But please, let’s try to keep the costs down. And make sure this neurologist understands I’ve always been a sharp man. I don’t want them thinking it’s just old age creeping in.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Lason. We’ll definitely keep costs in mind, and I’ll make sure to write a detailed referral to the neurologist, highlighting your concerns and emphasizing your previously sharp cognitive function. It’s important to me that your concerns are heard and addressed. I’m referring you to Dr. Anya Sharma at City General Hospital. She’s highly regarded and has experience with patients like you. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous mental activity. Get plenty of rest, eat a healthy diet, and stay hydrated. And please, continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Just… please tell Dr. Sharma I’m not feeble. I still build things with my hands, you know. Tilework is precise, requires a clear head. I don't want her writing me off as just another old man losing his marbles. And… when will I hear about the tests? And will they make me feel… different?
DOCTOR: I will absolutely write that in the referral, Mr. Lason. I will emphasize your continued ability to work and your need for a thorough evaluation, not an assumption of decline. You are not “just another old man,” and your concerns are valid. The lab results should be available in about a week. We’ll call you as soon as they’re back. And the MRI results typically take a little longer, around two weeks. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss everything in detail. As for feeling different, the blood tests shouldn’t make you feel any different at all. The MRI is completely painless and non-invasive, but some people feel a little claustrophobic inside the scanner. If you’re concerned about that, you can ask your doctor for a mild sedative beforehand. I’m confident we’ll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Lason. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, you’re not alone in this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. My wife will be pleased. She worries so much. I hope this doesn’t cost a fortune.
