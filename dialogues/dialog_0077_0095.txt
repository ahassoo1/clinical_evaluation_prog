DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’d rather not be here. It’s a waste of my time, but… I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of my left ear. And my face feels… droopy, on that side. It’s quite alarming, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I assure you we'll do our best to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are certainly concerning. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me when exactly you first noticed these symptoms this morning?
PATIENT: This morning. As in, when I woke up. I didn't go to sleep feeling like this, I assure you. It wasn't gradual. One minute everything was fine, the next… this. Honestly, I don't recall the exact minute, do you expect me to keep track of that? It was sometime between, oh, six and seven AM, I suppose. When the alarm went off.
DOCTOR: Six to seven AM… alright. And you didn't experience any pain, dizziness, or headache alongside this, Ms. Nissenbaum?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Absolutely no dizziness, and thankfully, no headache. Look, I’m a radiologist, Doctor. I’m not… prone to hysterics. I know when something is simply wrong. It’s just… this suddenness. It's unsettling. I don't have time for this, you understand? I have cases to review.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum, and appreciate you explaining that to me. As a fellow medical professional, you’re right to be attentive to sudden changes. We’ll proceed as efficiently as possible. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing lately – anything at all, even if it seems unrelated?
PATIENT: Unrelated? What could be unrelated? I haven’t been feeling particularly well, generally. A bit more tired than usual, I suppose. And my balance… it hasn’t been quite right for a few weeks now. But I attributed that to… well, life. Being a widow, managing things on my own. It’s enough to make anyone a little unsteady. Honestly, I don’t see what any of this has to do with my ear.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Nissenbaum. Fatigue and balance issues can be relevant. Now, regarding your medical history, do you have any existing medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Perfectly healthy, Doctor. Always have been. Well, except for… the grief, of course. But I don’t think that shows up on any tests, does it? And my late husband… he had a touch of high blood pressure, but that was him. I take excellent care of myself. I eat well, I exercise… as much as one can at my age. I assure you, it’s not a pre-existing condition causing this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely nothing. I prefer to rely on good health, Doctor. And common sense. I don't pollute my system with unnecessary things. A bit of tea, perhaps, but that's hardly a medication. And certainly not enough to cause this. Really, are we going through all of this because I can’t hear properly? It seems a bit… excessive.
DOCTOR: We simply want to gather all the necessary information, Ms. Nissenbaum, to ensure we arrive at the correct conclusion. Now, I'd like to ask about any allergies you might have. Any reactions to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens. No. I've never had an allergy in my life. I’m perfectly robust, Doctor. Really. Are you implying I’m somehow… frail? This is quite insulting, frankly. I’ve spent my career diagnosing people, I know a healthy system when I see one. And this isn’t it, whatever it is. Let’s just get on with it, shall we? What tests are you going to run?
DOCTOR: Please forgive me, Ms. Nissenbaum, I did not mean to imply anything of the sort. I am simply following standard procedure. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any neurological conditions – stroke, paralysis, hearing loss – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. My family history? My mother lived to be ninety, perfectly healthy. My father… a bit of arthritis in his knees, but that's hardly a neurological condition, is it? And my siblings are all… reasonably well. No strokes, no paralysis, certainly no sudden deafness. We're a sturdy bunch, I assure you. Look, is this going to take much longer? I have a backlog of scans waiting for me. Really, I'm wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, before we proceed with any tests, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then I’ll take a closer look at your ears and perform a neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. The sooner we figure out what’s wrong, the sooner I can get back to work. I hope you're thorough, Doctor. I don’t have all day. And please, try not to poke too much. It's rather unnerving.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I’m listening to your heart and lungs now, and your blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s take a look at your ears… Hmm… the ear canal appears clear, no signs of infection. However, I’m noticing a slight weakness in your facial muscles on the left side. Could you please smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that satisfactory? It's quite difficult, you know. This is… unsettling. I can feel it, Doctor. The weakness. It’s not just something I’m imagining. It's quite alarming, really. Are you going to tell me what you think is wrong or are we going to continue this… charade?
DOCTOR: As you observed, Ms. Nissenbaum, there is noticeable weakness on the left side of your face. Combined with the sudden hearing loss, my initial concern is Bell’s Palsy. However, given the sudden onset and your lack of other symptoms, we must rule out other possibilities, such as a stroke. I’m going to order a stat CT scan of your head and a blood test to rule out any underlying causes. We'll need to get this done immediately. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A CT scan, of course. More wasted time. But… alright. If that's what you think is necessary. A stroke? That's… rather dramatic, isn't it? I feel perfectly fine, aside from the deafness and the… drooping. But do what you must. Just… hurry up. And please, try to find someone competent to read the scans. I don’t want any misdiagnosis. I have patients relying on me, you understand. This is… inconvenient. Extremely inconvenient. Get it done. Now.
