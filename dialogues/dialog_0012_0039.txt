DOCTOR: Hi Lindsey, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. My regular check-up came back with somethin' about my cholesterol bein' high. Hyper… hyperlipide- somethin'. That’s a mouthful! My niece, bless her heart, told me I needed to get it checked out. She worries somethin' fierce.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your recent lab results here. Hyperlipidemia – you’re right, it is a bit of a mouthful! It basically means your cholesterol is elevated. That’s good of your niece to encourage you to get it checked. It's common as we get older, and we can definitely talk about what that means and what our options are. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I reckon I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. I’m 88, you know. Things are startin’ to creak a bit, naturally. My knees aren't what they used to be, and I get tired easier now than I did, but nothing too serious. I used to be a supervisor… workin’ with folks who needed help. Kept me on my toes, that job did. Now I mostly just… take it easy. Read a lot, visit with family when I can. I lost my wife, Martha, five years back. Been quiet since then.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Martha. That must be difficult. It sounds like you’ve had a full and active life, though, which is wonderful. And it’s good you're staying engaged with reading and family. Okay, so you’ve noticed some general fatigue and some knee discomfort. Anything else that’s been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! My appetite ain’t what it used to be. I don’t really crave much these days. I eat because I know I should, not ‘cause I’m hungry. And sometimes… sometimes I get a little short of breath just walkin’ up the stairs. Not terrible, just… noticeable. But I figure that comes with gettin’ old, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite and some shortness of breath with exertion. It's good you're paying attention to those changes. And you're right, some of those things can be a normal part of aging, but it’s important to rule out anything else that might be contributing. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well now, that's a good question. Let me see… I had the flu pretty bad when I was a young man, but that's about it. Oh! And I broke my wrist a few years back when I tripped over the dog. But other than that… no, I don't think so. The doctors always said I had a strong ticker. Martha always said I worried too much, and that was good for my heart.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No major medical conditions diagnosed, and a healthy heart according to previous doctors. And it sounds like Martha kept you in check! Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the one, as far as I recall. Appendicitis when I was about twenty. They took it right out. It wasn't too bad, really. I was back on my feet in a week, helpin’ my pa with the farm work. Old Doc Henderson did a fine job. Oh, and I had a mole removed from my back a few years back, but that was just a little thing. Local anesthetic, in and out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an appendectomy as a young man and a mole removal. No complications from either, that’s good. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a bit tricky. My pa… he lived to be 92, but he wasn’t very healthy towards the end. Lots of aches and pains, couldn’t walk much. My ma… she passed when I was young, breast cancer. And my sister, bless her soul, she had heart trouble. She had to have a… a pacemaker, I think they called it. It’s a bit sad thinkin’ back on it, really. Lots of illness in my family.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Lindsey. That gives me a better picture. A family history of heart trouble and breast cancer is important to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, knock on wood. I can eat just about anything… well, except maybe oysters. Never liked ‘em. Martha tried to get me to eat ‘em a few times, but I always drew the line. No, allergies ain’t somethin’ I worry about.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… just a little somethin’ for my knees, really. It's called… glucosamine, I think? My niece brought it for me. Says it helps with the joints. And sometimes I take a little aspirin if I’ve got a headache. That’s about it, really. Nothing fancy. I used to take somethin' for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off it. Said I didn't need it anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine for your knees, aspirin as needed for headaches, and you previously took medication for blood pressure but are no longer on it. That's helpful to know. Alright, Lindsey, thank you for giving me all that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go right ahead, Doctor. I don't mind a bit. Always good to get things checked out, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, though a bit distant. I do hear a very mild murmur, but it's likely benign given your age. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but breath sounds are slightly diminished at the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally, though slightly weak. Reflexes are diminished, but symmetrical. No significant edema noted. Okay, Lindsey, everything seems generally okay, but I do notice your heart sounds are a bit quiet and your reflexes are diminished, which can be common with age. Your pulse is a little weak, too. I’m going to order a few blood tests to get a more detailed look at your cholesterol levels, kidney function, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. We should also do an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That all sounds reasonable, Doctor. If you think it's best, I trust your judgment. I'm not one to argue with a medical professional. Blood tests and an EKG… go right ahead. I just want to make sure I’m not headin' for trouble. When do we do these things?
DOCTOR: Great. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the blood right away. The EKG machine is in the room next door, and it only takes a few minutes. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and get you set up for both. While we're waiting for the results, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, you mentioned my cholesterol being high. What does that mean, exactly? Is it somethin’ serious? And if it is, what can be done about it? I’m not real keen on takin’ a bunch of pills, if I can help it. Is there anything I can do… with my diet, maybe? Or exercise? I used to walk a lot, but my knees… well, you heard. Just tell me, honestly, what I’m lookin’ at here.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Lindsey, and a perfectly reasonable concern. High cholesterol means you have too much of a waxy substance called cholesterol in your blood. This can build up in your arteries, forming plaques that narrow the arteries and make it harder for blood to flow. This increases your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other serious problems. Think of your arteries like pipes. Cholesterol buildup is like rust inside those pipes, making them narrower and harder for water—or in this case, blood—to get through. Now, whether it's "serious" depends on how high your levels are and other risk factors you have. That’s why we're doing the blood tests. As for what you can do, lifestyle changes are a great first step, and often all that’s needed. Diet plays a big role. Reducing saturated and trans fats, eating more fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and limiting red meat can help lower your cholesterol. Exercise is also important, even if your knees aren’t what they used to be. Low-impact activities like walking, swimming, or cycling are good options. We can talk to physical therapy about exercises that are safe and effective for your knees. And if lifestyle changes aren’t enough, there are medications that can help lower your cholesterol, but we’ll cross that bridge if we need to. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that explains it pretty well, Doctor. The rust in the pipes… that’s a good way to think about it. I reckon I could stand to eat a few more fruits and vegetables, I’ll admit. And maybe cut back on the bacon… Martha used to make a mean bacon and egg breakfast, but I suppose my health comes first. So, we’ll wait for the test results, and then talk about what to do next? And you think physical therapy might help with my knees? I’d like that. Gettin’ back to walkin’ would be a good thing.
DOCTOR: Exactly. We’ll wait for the results, and then we can develop a plan tailored to your specific needs. And yes, I absolutely think physical therapy could be beneficial for your knees. They can teach you exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knees, improve your range of motion, and reduce your pain. I’ll write you a referral to a good physical therapist. Sarah should be in shortly to draw your blood and get you set up for the EKG. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that covers most of it for now, Doctor. You've been very helpful, explainin' things so clearly. I appreciate you takin' the time. I'll just sit here and wait for Sarah, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindsey. I’m glad I could help. We'll get those tests done and figure out the best plan for you. I’ll check in with you as soon as the results are back. Just let Sarah know if you have any questions or concerns before she gets here.
PATIENT: .
