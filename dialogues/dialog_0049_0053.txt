DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… it's been a bit difficult going to the bathroom lately. Not… easy, you know? It takes me a while to start, and then it's not a strong stream. It's just… troublesome.
DOCTOR: I see. "Troublesome," you say. Alright. Can you elaborate a little on that, please?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Hmm… well, it’s like this. I have to wait, sometimes a good few minutes, before anything even starts. And when it does, it’s not like it used to be. It’s… weaker, and it sort of comes and goes. Not a solid, steady flow, you know? It feels like it’s not… emptying everything, either. I have to go back again not long after. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does. Weak stream, intermittency, a sensation of incomplete emptying… and waiting to start. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started… maybe three months ago? It was just a little thing at first, I thought it was just because I was drinking too much tea. But it’s gotten worse steadily since then. Not suddenly, just… bit by bit. I can’t really pinpoint a date, but definitely three months, at least.
DOCTOR: Three months, gradual onset… Alright. And have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at all. No burning either. It's not uncomfortable, exactly, just… frustrating. And like I said, takes a long time to get going. It’s more of an effort than it used to be, you know? It doesn’t hurt, it just… doesn’t work properly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And no, not any pain in my stomach, lower part or anywhere else, really. Just… the bathroom issue. Everything else feels normal. I still get up and do my gardening, walk the dog… no other problems, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Are you experiencing any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in… my bowels? Oh. Well… now that you mention it, I haven't been going as regularly as I used to. Not constipation, exactly, but… less often. Maybe every other day instead of daily. I hadn’t thought anything of it, to be honest. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It could be. Alright. Let’s move on. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no blood. I always check, you know, just to be sure. Never seen a thing. Everything looks… normal, except for the difficulty going. I’m very careful about that, always have been. It’s just… the waiting and the weak stream. That’s what’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of urinary tract infections, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… years ago, when I was still living in Lithuania, I had a bladder infection, I think? It was a long time ago, maybe 40 years? I had to take some pills, and it cleared up. Never had any trouble since then. And no, never any kidney problems that I know of. The doctors always said I was healthy as a horse. Except for… well, this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'll do a brief neurological exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… try not to take too long, if you wouldn't mind. I have to walk the little dog when I get home, and he gets impatient if I’m gone too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the examination table, please. I'll start by listening to your abdomen. Breathing sounds normal… no immediate abnormalities detected. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen, just to check for any tenderness or masses. No significant tenderness… abdomen is soft. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs straight. Reflexes are normal. Now, a quick check of sensation… can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. It's… a little cold, but I feel it. Both legs feel the same. Everything seems normal, doesn’t it? I still don’t understand what’s causing the trouble with my… waterworks. It's just so frustrating.
DOCTOR: Everything seems normal, yes. However, given your age and symptoms—the weak stream, intermittency, incomplete emptying—it’s likely a case of benign prostatic hyperplasia – BPH – even though you are female. It’s not uncommon for women to experience similar symptoms due to changes in the pelvic floor muscles and urethra as they age. I’m going to order a urinalysis to rule out any infection, and a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. I also recommend a referral to a urologist for further evaluation and management. They may suggest medication or other therapies to help improve your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Benign… what now? Even though I’m a woman? I always thought that was a man’s problem. I… I don’t understand. And what’s a post-void residual volume test? Is it painful? I’m not a fan of tests, you know. And a… urologist? Is that… serious? It all sounds a bit frightening, Doctor. I just wanted something simple to fix it, not… all of this.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re worried, Ms. Yadao. It can be confusing. While BPH is primarily a male condition, women can experience similar issues due to weakening pelvic floor muscles and changes in the urethra with age. It doesn’t mean anything is seriously wrong, it just means your bladder isn't emptying completely. The post-void residual volume test is very simple, not painful at all. A nurse will use a small handheld device to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. It’s a quick and painless procedure. And a urologist is a specialist in the urinary system. It doesn’t mean anything is seriously wrong either. They are simply the best doctors to evaluate and manage these types of issues. I’m recommending them as a precaution, to ensure you receive the best possible care. Would you like me to explain the referral process?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain the referral. I don’t want to go running all over town on my own. And… will my insurance cover it? I’m on Medicare, you know. I don’t want any surprises with bills. And… how soon do I need to see this urologist? I have my gardening, and the dog… I don’t want to disrupt everything too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have my nurse schedule the referral for you. She’ll contact a urologist who accepts Medicare and is conveniently located near your home. Medicare should cover the consultation, but it’s always best to confirm with them directly. We'll provide you with all the necessary paperwork and contact information. As for timing, it's not an emergency, so you can schedule the appointment at your convenience. However, I recommend seeing the urologist within the next four to six weeks to get a proper diagnosis and discuss treatment options. The sooner we address this, the better. In the meantime, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can worsen your symptoms. And be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly, even the frightening parts. I’m still a bit worried, but I feel better knowing what’s going on, and what needs to be done. I’ll let the nurse schedule the appointment, and I’ll check with Medicare about the bills. And I’ll try to avoid the tea. It's just… getting old isn’t what it’s cracked up to be.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Yadao. It's perfectly normal to be concerned, and I understand your feelings. Getting older does come with its challenges, but we'll do our best to manage them. My nurse will be with you shortly to schedule the appointment and answer any further questions you may have. Here's a printed summary of our discussion, including the referral information. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Yadao. .
