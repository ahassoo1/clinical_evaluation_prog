DOCTOR: Hi Alese, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Well, to be perfectly honest, it's these pains. Down low. Quite bothersome, they are. They come and go, you see, and… well, I believe my records mention something about… a condition? Lupus, perhaps? It's all a bit… hazy, if I’m being truthful.
DOCTOR: Okay, “down low” – is that abdominal pain, pelvic pain, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Yes… abdominal, I believe. Though sometimes it feels… deeper? It's hard to pinpoint, honestly. Not quite the stomach, but… lower down. Is that helpful? I do apologize for my vagueness. It’s difficult to describe, and… well, as I said, remembering details isn’t my strongest suit these days.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Alese, it's perfectly alright. We'll get to the bottom of it. So, abdominal pain that sometimes feels deeper... Can you tell me more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It’s… a cramping sort of pain, usually. Not a sharp, sudden thing, but more of a… tightening? And it can be quite… insistent, if that makes sense. It comes in waves, really. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, barely noticeable, and other times… well, other times it makes it hard to concentrate on anything else. It's been… fluctuating, I suppose is the best way to put it. And it seems to… come and go over days, rather than hours. Does that give you a better idea?
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping, fluctuating waves of pain lasting days… Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. I haven't consciously noticed anything specific, no. I do find… resting helps, a bit. Just lying down, quiet. But that’s not terribly helpful, is it? And… I think eating something heavy might make it worse, but I haven’t been keeping strict track. It’s all so… muddled. Perhaps stress? I’ve been rather preoccupied lately, with… things. But I can’t recall precisely what. I do apologize. It's difficult to pinpoint a trigger, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, we'll sort through it. Okay, resting helps, heavy meals might worsen it, possible link to stress... Has the pain changed in any way recently?
PATIENT: Now that’s a good question… yes, I believe it has. It feels… more frequent, perhaps? And… stronger, certainly. It used to be manageable with just a bit of rest, but lately… it’s been keeping me up at night. And I find myself… more tired, generally. It’s just a little… unsettling, if I'm being honest. It feels like… something is different. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but… it doesn’t feel like the usual aches and pains. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Increased frequency, stronger pain, and interfering with sleep… Okay. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. I see here you have a history of Lupus. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes… Lupus. That sounds right. I’ve had it for… a long time, I believe. I’ve seen doctors about it, of course. Though… truthfully, the details are rather… blurry. I remember something about… flares? And medication? But I can’t recall the specifics. I apologize again. It’s… frustrating, not being able to remember properly. It’s like looking through a fog. But yes, Lupus. That much I’m certain of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. We can go over everything. Do you currently take any medications for your Lupus, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… medication. Let me see. I believe I take something… a small white pill, perhaps? But I truly can't recall the name of it. And… I think there’s another one, a larger capsule, but I’m not entirely sure. I rely on my… assistant, mostly, to manage my medications. She prepares them for me each day. I’m afraid I’m not very good at remembering these things on my own. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful. It's rather embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can try to get a list from your pharmacy. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don't believe so. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. But… it’s possible, of course. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I apologize for my vagueness. I wish I could be more certain. Perhaps it's best to be cautious? I wouldn’t want to take anything I’m allergic to, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll gently press on it to check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, do whatever you need to. I trust your judgment implicitly. I’ll just… try to relax, then. It’s… been a while since I’ve had a proper examination. I’ll do my best to remain still. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m listening now… and gently pressing… Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, there. Just a little… that’s a bit tender, yes. Not excruciating, but… uncomfortable. And… a little bit there too, perhaps? It’s… hard to pinpoint exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache when you press. Is that what you expected? I apologize for my vagueness, it's hard to be precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. I also feel some mild guarding – meaning your muscles are tensing up when I press. It's not concerning enough to indicate an emergency, but we should investigate further. Do you have any changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Changes in… bowel habits. Hmm… now that's a question. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t paid much attention, if I'm being truthful. Everything feels a bit… sluggish, perhaps? I haven’t been as regular as usual, I suppose. But I can’t recall any… blood in my stool, no. Everything has felt… normal, in that regard. But… as I said, I haven’t been closely monitoring things. Perhaps my assistant would know better? She handles those details. I apologize for my vagueness. It’s… difficult to recall these things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your history of Lupus, the abdominal pain, tenderness, and changes in bowel habits, I want to order some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out any other underlying causes. I'd also like to order a stool test to check for any hidden bleeding and rule out infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best, truly. Blood work and… a stool test. Yes, alright. I trust your judgment implicitly. Just let me know when and where I need to go to have those done. I'll… rely on my assistant to schedule everything, if that’s alright. I apologize for being a bit of a bother. I truly appreciate your attention to this matter. It's… comforting to know someone is looking into it.
DOCTOR: No bother at all, Alese. We'll get this sorted out. I'll have the lab orders sent to your assistant’s email. I'll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us in about a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Sending the orders to my assistant is perfect. A follow-up appointment in a week sounds… sensible. And thank you for the warning about the emergency room. I will certainly keep that in mind. No, I believe that’s all for today. I truly appreciate your time and attention to this matter. It's… a weight off my mind, knowing someone is looking into this. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day. .
