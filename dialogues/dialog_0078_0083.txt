DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Solero, you say? Yes, well, it’s good to meet you too. I’m Early Kammer. I just… needed a little something from the doctor. A card, you see. A “Get Well” card. Or maybe just some… encouragement. It’s been a rough time, you understand. Not sick, exactly. Just… low.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're feeling a bit down, and were hoping I could provide some documentation for that – perhaps a note for work, or just something to help you feel supported?
PATIENT: Documentation? No, no, nothing for work. I retired, see? Years ago. Stationary engineer, boilers. Tough work, but I don’t do that anymore. It’s… just nice to have something official you know? From a doctor. To show people. That things aren't so good. It's… a matter of respect, I think. People listen more when a doctor says it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kammer. You’d like a note from me acknowledging that you’re not feeling well, as a way to help others understand what you’re going through. That’s perfectly reasonable. Before I write anything, could you tell me a little more about what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… hard to explain. It’s not a pain, or a cough, or anything like that. It's just… everything feels heavy. Like a weight on your chest, you know? And people… they don't get it. They say, "You're retired, enjoy yourself!" Like it's that simple. But it's not. I used to do things. Important things. Now… now I just sit. And things feel… empty. Does that make any sense? I don’t want to bother you with foolishness, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Kammer. It doesn't sound like foolishness at all. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficult emotions, and that’s valid. It’s common to feel a sense of loss or adjustment after retirement, even if it was something you looked forward to. To get a better understanding, would you mind if I ask a few questions?
PATIENT: Questions are fine, Doctor. As long as they don't take too long. I haven’t got all day, you understand. Though, I suppose I do now that I am retired. Still… best to be efficient. What sort of questions? Not about my body, I hope. Everything's working, more or less. It’s the… the spirit that's low.
DOCTOR: Certainly, no physical exam needed if you prefer. These questions will be focused on how you've been feeling emotionally. First, can you tell me roughly when you started noticing these feelings of heaviness and emptiness?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think. It wasn't right after I retired, no. I enjoyed the first few months. Sleeping in, doing things around the house. Then… maybe six months ago? Around Christmas, I think. Everything felt… flat. The joy wasn't there. And it’s been getting worse since then. Slowly, but steadily. Like a leak in a pipe, you understand? A little drip, drip, drip, until… well, until now. I don’t know exactly when it started, but around Christmas seems right.
DOCTOR: Okay, around Christmas, about six months ago, and a gradual worsening. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite during this time?
PATIENT: Sleep… yes. I sleep too much. Or, I lie in bed and think too much. It's not restful sleep, you understand? I wake up tired. As for appetite… not much change there. I eat when I’m hungry, not much more, not much less. My wife used to make me good meals, but… well, that was before. Now I just fix myself something simple. Doesn't matter much, I suppose. Food tastes… flat too. Like everything else.
DOCTOR: I see. So, increased sleep that doesn’t leave you feeling rested, and a decreased appetite with diminished taste. Have you been experiencing any difficulty with your concentration or memory lately?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. I used to read the newspaper every day. All of it. Now I can barely get through the first few pages. My mind wanders. I forget things. Simple things, like where I put my glasses. Or what I was just saying. It’s not terrible, mind you. But it’s… noticeable. My wife used to say I had a good memory. Now… well, now I have to write things down. It’s humiliating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s not humiliating at all to acknowledge changes, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you're experiencing a number of symptoms that are understandably concerning. Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or thoughts of harming yourself?
PATIENT: Now hold on a minute, Doctor. Harm myself? What kind of question is that? I’m a retired engineer, not some… some broken man. I’m not sick. Just… low. I don't want to harm myself. I just want things to be… different. I want to feel… something. Hopeless? Maybe a little. But harm myself? No. Absolutely not. That’s… that’s a bit much, don’t you think? A little insensitive, frankly. I came here for a card, not a… a psychiatric evaluation.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be upset, Mr. Kammer. I apologize for asking such a direct and upsetting question. It's a standard part of assessing emotional wellbeing, but it was insensitive of me to ask without more context and consideration for your feelings. I should have phrased that differently. I understand you are not experiencing thoughts of harming yourself, and I appreciate you telling me that. Let’s move on. Do you have any family or friends you feel comfortable talking to about how you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: That’s… better. Thank you. As for friends… not really. Most of them passed away, or moved away. I had a wife, you see. But she… well, she’s gone now. Passed away two years ago. It’s just me. I have a son, but we don’t talk much. He’s busy with his own life. He calls on holidays, but… it’s not the same. I don’t want to bother him with my problems. He has his own worries, you understand. So… no. Not really anyone. That’s why I came to you. A doctor is… impartial. Professional.
DOCTOR: I see. You’ve experienced significant loss and feel isolated. That’s a difficult situation, and it’s understandable why you’d seek support from a professional. Mr. Kammer, based on what you’ve told me – the feelings of heaviness and emptiness, changes in sleep and appetite, difficulty with concentration, social isolation, and significant loss – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I want to be clear – I am not making a definitive diagnosis at this moment, but these are things we need to consider. Would you be open to me ordering some basic blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes, and perhaps discussing a referral to a therapist or counselor?
PATIENT: Therapist? Counselor? Now you are talking nonsense, Doctor. I’m a practical man. An engineer. I fix things. I don’t talk about my feelings. Blood work, maybe. To make sure everything's working. But talking to someone? No. Absolutely not. I just want a card. A simple “Get Well” card. Or a note saying I’m not feeling my best. That’s all. Is that so much to ask? I don’t need fixing. I just need… acknowledgement. Is that possible, Doctor? A simple card?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. It is not too much to ask, and I apologize for pushing you towards options you aren't comfortable with. I was letting my medical training overshadow your needs. I can certainly write a note acknowledging that you are not feeling your best, and that you are seeking support. I will state that you are experiencing emotional distress and would appreciate understanding and compassion. Would you like me to include any specific details in the note?
PATIENT: No, no specifics. Just… a general statement. That things aren't good. That I’m… struggling. Something like that. Keep it professional, Doctor. No mention of therapy or blood work or anything like that. Just a simple acknowledgement. And a nice card, if you have one. Something with… flowers, maybe. Not too bright, though. Something… subdued. You understand. It's just… a little something to show people. That I'm not just… imagining things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I’ll draft a note stating that you are experiencing emotional distress and would appreciate understanding and compassion. I’ve selected this card for you – does this design suit your preferences?
PATIENT: That’s… acceptable. Blue is a good color. Calm. Not too flashy. Yes. That will do nicely. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. And for not pushing the… therapy nonsense. Just a simple card. That’s all I needed. Now, how long will this take? I have an appointment later this afternoon. Not important, but… still. I like to be on time.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Kammer. I've signed and dated the note. It should only take a few minutes to review it and make sure everything is to your satisfaction. I apologize again for the initial questions that made you uncomfortable. I will make a note of your preferences for future consultations. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… Yes, that’s… adequate. It says what I needed it to say. “Experiencing emotional distress.” That’s… accurate enough. Thank you, Doctor. No, I think that’s all. I appreciate your time. And for the card. It’s… a nice gesture. I suppose… goodbye, then. And thank you again. I hope you have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kammer. It was my pleasure. And you have a good day as well. Please remember, if your feelings worsen or you find yourself struggling, don't hesitate to reach out. Even if it's just to talk. Goodbye, Mr. Kammer.
PATIENT: .
