DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… hard to explain. Things just feel… weaker. Not all at once, you understand. Slowly. It’s been going on for a little while now. My wife, she says I need to get it checked out. She's probably right.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "Weakness" can mean a lot of different things, and it's good your wife encouraged you to come in. It’s always best to get these things looked at. When you say "slowly", about how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… maybe six months, maybe a little longer? It started with my hands, I think. Dropping things, not being able to hold my coffee as steady. Now it’s… my legs too. Just feels like they don’t want to move as quick as they used to. It’s not pain, not really. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months or so. Starting in your hands and now in your legs. No pain, just a feeling of tiredness and difficulty moving. That’s helpful to know. And is this tiredness all over, or mostly in your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Mostly in my arms and legs, yes. I still get tired, like any old man, but this is… different. It’s a heavy tiredness. Hard to explain. Like trying to push through mud, you know? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Some days are better than others.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand what you mean by “heavy tiredness”. That's a good way to describe it. And it fluctuates – some days are better than others. That gives us something to work with. Now, have you noticed this weakness impacting any specific activities?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. I used to love to garden, you know? Big garden, lots of vegetables. Now… I can't do it like I used to. Too much bending, too much lifting. My wife, she helps a lot now. And walking… used to walk every morning with my wife down by the water. Now I need to stop and rest a couple times. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I can imagine how frustrating that must be, especially with activities you enjoy. Gardening and walking are both good exercise, and it’s tough when things start to become difficult. Let's talk a bit about your overall health. Have you had any other symptoms along with this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think again. Sometimes… my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, just comes and goes. And I’ve been a little clumsy lately, stumbling more than usual. My wife says I seem… forgetful sometimes too, but I’m an old man, maybe that’s just age! Nothing too bad, though. And I haven't been sick with a fever or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision, clumsiness, and some forgetfulness. Those are all things worth noting. And no fever or recent illness, which is good. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was told a long time ago, maybe ten years now, that I have something with my nerves. Multiple… sclerosis, I think that's what they called it. I saw a doctor in the city then, but I don’t really remember much about it. He gave me some pills, I took them for a while, then I moved back home. Things were okay for a long time, and I just… didn’t bother going back.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very important information. Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is a condition that affects the nerves. And you were treated for it about ten years ago. That definitely helps us understand what's going on. Do you remember what kind of pills they prescribed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I honestly don't. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't really paying attention to the name of the pills. Small white ones, maybe? Or blue? I just remember taking them as the doctor told me. He said it would help with the… tingling, I think. It was in my feet mostly back then. I can't remember much else, I'm sorry. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Astores. It’s completely understandable, especially with the time that’s passed. And tingling in your feet at the time of the MS diagnosis is helpful to know. Okay, let's move on to some other things. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That's about it, I think. Nothing else. I’ve broken a few bones here and there, playing football when I was younger, but those healed up alright. Just the appendix, Doctor. A long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, just an appendectomy many years ago. And some football injuries that have healed. Good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My wife, bless her heart, she’s healthy as a horse. Still cooks the best food you ever tasted. I have three grown children, all living on the mainland. They come visit when they can, but they’re busy with their own lives. And… my brother, he passed away a few years back. He had some problems with his heart. Nothing else, really. My family is pretty healthy, all in all.
DOCTOR: Okay, your wife is healthy, three children, and your brother passed away from heart problems. That’s good information. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I can eat anything, take any kind of medicine. My wife always says I have an iron stomach. Never had a problem with allergies, thankfully. Just a simple man, simple needs.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Alright, Mr. Astores, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I want to check your strength, reflexes, and balance, and just get a general sense of how things are going. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I'm an old man, I don’t bounce back as quick as I used to!
DOCTOR: I’ll be gentle, Mr. Astores. We’ll take it slow. Okay, Mr. Astores, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here… is that alright? I’m trying my best. My hands feel a little weak today, like I said.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. A little weaker than I’d expect, but we’ll see. Alright, let’s check your legs. Can you push down on my hands like this?
PATIENT: There… is that alright? It’s a little difficult. My legs feel heavy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's alright. A little bit of resistance, but you're doing well. And I noticed you were a little unsteady. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's check your reflexes. I’m going to lightly tap on your knees with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Go ahead. I’ve had doctors poke and prod me enough times in my life. A little tap won't bother me.
DOCTOR: Alright, and that's good. A little tap. I'm noting your reflexes are a bit diminished. Now I'd like to check your balance. Could you stand up for me and try to balance on both feet for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Woah there… I’m a little wobbly, Doctor. Don’t want to fall over on you! I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s alright. It’s good you let me know. That’s perfectly fine, and we'll have you sit down. Okay, Mr. Astores. That gives me a good starting point with the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve seen so far, your symptoms, along with your history of multiple sclerosis, point towards a possible flare-up or progression of your MS. However, it's important to rule out other possible causes. I think it’s best to get some blood work and an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgment. Blood work and a picture of my brain… alright. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to figure out what's going on with me. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astores. I'll get the orders for the blood work and MRI sent to the lab right away. The lab will contact you to schedule the appointment. As for the MRI, you may need a referral from me to a facility that offers them. I’ll get that processed for you as well. In the meantime, it’s important to be careful and avoid any activities that might increase your risk of falling. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as vision changes, difficulty speaking, or weakness in your arms or legs, please contact my office immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes sense. Blood work, picture of my brain, be careful not to fall, and call if things get worse. I can remember that. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astores. That’s what I’m here for. We’ll get these tests scheduled as quickly as possible, and I’ll contact you as soon as I have the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've answered everything I've been wondering about. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. It’s a relief to finally be getting this checked out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astores. I'm glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have my nurse stop by to give you some instructions for the blood work. And again, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Astores, and be careful out there.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Be well.
