DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Um, well, it's a bit hard to explain, really. It’s my hearing, mostly. It comes and goes, and when it goes, everything spins. And my… my husband, bless his soul, he had something similar before… before he passed. That's why I'm here, I think. I don’t remember exactly what he had, though. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite concerning, especially with your husband's history. It's good you came in to get it checked out. The dizziness along with the hearing loss is definitely something we need to investigate. Let’s start with your hearing. When did you first notice it coming and going?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… that’s a tricky one. It’s been happening on and off for… well, for a while now. Maybe… six months? A year? It’s hard to say. It doesn’t happen every day, not at all. Sometimes weeks go by and I’m fine, then suddenly… whoosh, it’s like someone turned the volume down. And then it comes back just as quickly. It's more noticeable in the mornings, I think. Or maybe that's just when I notice it more… I really can't be sure. I'm sorry, I'm not very good with dates.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Don’t worry about being precise. “Six months to a year” gives me a good starting point. And noticing it more in the mornings is helpful information. Can you describe what the hearing loss feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s not like it’s completely gone, you know? It’s more muffled. Like someone’s put cotton wool in my ears. And sometimes… sometimes it sounds like ringing. A high-pitched ringing. It’s not constant, thankfully, but it’s there sometimes. And like I said, it's usually just in one ear. Not both at the same time. Does that make any sense? I hope I'm not being too confusing.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Mayhugh. That’s very clear – muffled hearing and ringing in one ear, that’s helpful. The fact that it’s only one ear at a time is also important. Now, when you say everything “spins”, can you describe that sensation?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… it’s awful, really. It’s not a gentle spin, if that makes sense. It's like the room is tilting, and I can’t get my balance. I have to hold onto something, usually. Or sit down very quickly. It doesn’t last long, maybe a few minutes, but it’s enough to scare you. Sometimes I feel a bit sick afterwards, too. And I get really sweaty. It just… comes out of nowhere. It’s very unsettling. It hasn't happened recently, thankfully. A few weeks maybe. But I worry it will come back.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very frightening, Ms. Mayhugh. The combination of dizziness, nausea, and sweating is concerning, but good that it hasn’t happened recently. Let’s move on to some other questions, just to get a better picture of your overall health. Have you experienced any headaches along with the dizziness or hearing loss?
PATIENT: Headaches… hmm. Not really, no. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I get the occasional headache, like everyone does, but nothing… nothing connected to the hearing or the spinning. They’re just… normal headaches. I take a couple of paracetamol and they go away. I don’t think I’ve ever had a bad headache. Sorry, I don't think that's very helpful, is it?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Mayhugh. Knowing what isn't happening is just as important as knowing what is. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision… oh dear. I have to admit, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. I wear glasses, you know? For reading mostly. But I don’t think it’s gotten any worse recently. I had my eyes checked last year, I think. The doctor said it was just normal age-related changes. Nothing to worry about. I don’t get blurry vision, or spots, or anything like that. Just… need my glasses to see things up close. Is that what you mean? I hope I'm not rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all. That’s good to know, that your vision is stable and you had a check-up last year. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, the doctor always tells me my blood pressure is a little high, but he says it's nothing to worry about too much. He wants me to watch my salt intake, and I try to. I don't have diabetes, I'm pretty sure. And my heart… I don’t think I’ve ever had any problems with my heart. I’ve never been told about anything wrong with it, anyway. I have arthritis in my hands, it gets a bit painful sometimes, but that’s about it, I think. Oh! And I take medication for that. A little white pill. I can't remember the name of it though. It’s been years. I get it from the pharmacy every month. Does that help? I am truly sorry I'm so forgetful.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Mayhugh. Knowing about the high blood pressure and arthritis is good. And don't worry about being forgetful, it happens to all of us. We can look up your medications in the system. Okay, I see here you’re taking naproxen for osteoarthritis. That explains the white pill! Now, have you ever had any surgery or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Must be… thirty years ago now? It was a very bad pain. I was in the hospital for a few days. And… and I broke my wrist once, when I was younger. Fell off a bicycle, silly thing. That needed a cast, and it was very uncomfortable. Apart from that, no, I haven’t been in the hospital for anything else. No major surgeries, just those two things. Does that… does that cover it? I hope I haven’t forgotten anything important. I feel like I'm failing a test!
DOCTOR: You're not failing any test, Ms. Mayhugh! This is very helpful information. Gallbladder removal and a broken wrist are good to know. Now, thinking about your family, has anyone else in your family experienced hearing loss, dizziness, or balance problems?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My husband, bless his soul, he did have something similar… That’s why I was so worried when this started. He had these spells, he called them, where everything would spin, and he’d lose his hearing. The doctors… they never really explained it properly, I don’t think. They gave him some pills, and he carried on as best he could. My mother… she had tinnitus, a ringing in the ears. Not the dizziness, though. And my brother, he’s got bad arthritis, like me. Apart from that, I don’t think so. It’s hard to remember, though. Everyone in my family keeps to themselves, you know? We don't really talk about these things. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Knowing about your husband's spells and your mother's tinnitus is good to know. It does sound like there might be a family history of inner ear problems. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband used to smoke, a long time ago, but he gave it up years before we got married. I always told him it was a terrible habit. I've always been very careful about my health, you know? I eat a good diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. I try to stay active, though my arthritis makes it a bit difficult sometimes. I don't drink much alcohol either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I’m not a big drinker, never have been. Is that good enough? I hope I'm not boring you with all this information. I just want to help you understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You're not boring me at all, Ms. Mayhugh. This is very helpful. It sounds like you have a very healthy lifestyle, which is excellent. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. No, I don't think so. Not that I'm aware of. I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to any medication. I’ve never had any trouble with food allergies either. I can eat anything, as far as I know. I haven’t ever had any skin reactions, or difficulty breathing, or anything like that. No, I don't think I have any allergies. I'm pretty lucky, in that respect. I really think that's everything, Doctor. Is there anything else you need to know? I want to get this sorted out, you know? It’s just… unsettling, this spinning. And I don’t want it to get any worse.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Mayhugh. That was very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. It doesn't sound like there's anything else immediately. Okay, based on what you've told me, and your medical history, it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. Given the hearing loss and dizziness, one possibility is something called Meniere’s disease. It's an inner ear disorder that can cause those symptoms, among others. Another possibility could be vestibular neuritis, which is inflammation of the inner ear nerve. And we should also rule out any other causes, like high blood pressure or certain medications. To get a better understanding, I'd like to do a physical exam, including a hearing test and some balance tests. Would that be alright with you?
