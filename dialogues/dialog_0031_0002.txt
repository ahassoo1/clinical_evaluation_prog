DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Rakosky, you say? That's a nice name. Hmm… what brings me in… Let me think now. It’s… the water. Yes, the water. It’s hard to… get it all out, you see? Like it’s stuck. It’s been… a while now, I think. Not terrible, just… bothersome. My husband, he says I take too long in the bathroom. He's probably right!
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Ms. Stoffregen. So, it sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with complete bladder emptying. You mentioned it’s been going on for a while, and your husband has noticed you’re taking longer in the bathroom. Could you tell me a bit more about how it's hard to get it all out?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, “bladder emptying,” is that what you call it? Fancy! It’s not a quick rush, you know? It starts okay, then… it just gets weak. Like a little dribble at the end. I have to… push a bit, sometimes. Not always, but often. And sometimes, after I think I'm finished, a little more comes out when I stand up. Does that make sense? I get confused sometimes with explaining things. It's not painful, though, thankfully. Just… annoying.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. You're explaining it very clearly. So, it starts normally, then weakens towards the end, requiring you to strain a bit. And you experience some post-void dribbling – a little more comes out after you finish and stand up. And, importantly, you haven’t experienced any pain with this. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask you a few more questions. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, or anything unusual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes… Let me think. The color… It's usually… yellow, I guess. Like it’s supposed to be. I haven't noticed it being… really dark or anything. And the smell… well, it smells like… pee! I don't spend a lot of time sniffing my pee, Doctor. My husband would think I've lost it! He's a practical man, my Walter. I don't think I’ve noticed anything wrong with it, if that makes sense. Just… regular pee smell. Old lady pee smell, maybe?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Stoffregen. You're perfectly right – no need to analyze things too closely! And "old lady pee smell" is a perfectly acceptable description. It's helpful to know you haven't noticed any significant changes in color or odor. Now, let’s talk about how often you're going to the bathroom during the day and night. Would you say it's a normal frequency for you, or have you noticed an increase in how often you need to urinate?
PATIENT: Hmm… frequency. That's a good question. I… well, I used to be able to sleep right through the night, you know? Now… I wake up maybe once, sometimes twice, to go. It’s not every night, but more than it used to be. During the day… I try not to drink too much water, because of all this trouble. So maybe… five or six times? I don't really keep track. Walter gets annoyed if I'm in the bathroom too long, so I try to be quick! Does that help? It's hard to remember exactly. I’m not as young as I used to be!
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. So, you're waking up one or two times a night to urinate, which is a change from sleeping through the night. And during the day, you’re going approximately five or six times, and you are mindful of your fluid intake. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… Let me see. Walter handles all that paperwork, you know. I get confused with all the doctor names and the pills… I think… I think the doctor once said something about my blood pressure being a little high, years ago. He put me on a little white pill, but I stopped taking it after a while. It made me feel… funny. And I had a bad gallbladder once, they took it out. A long time ago. Nothing else… I don't think so. I’ve always been pretty healthy, mostly. Except for this water problem, of course! Do you need a list of all my pills? Walter has it somewhere.
DOCTOR: No, don’t worry about a list right now. Knowing about the high blood pressure and the gallbladder removal is helpful. We can always revisit medications later if needed. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... besides the gallbladder... hmm... I had my appendix out when I was a girl! A long time ago. That was scary, but the doctor was nice. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy, many years ago. Walter wanted children, but I wasn’t able to have them, so I had that done. That's all I can remember, really. Everything gets a bit fuzzy these days. Did I mention the gallbladder? I think I already said that.
DOCTOR: You did mention the gallbladder, and that's perfectly alright. It's very common to repeat information, especially when discussing medical history. So, to recap, you've had your appendix removed, a hysterectomy, and a gallbladder removal. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history... Now that's tricky. My mother... she lived a long life. I think she had something with her heart when she got older. And my father… he was a strong man, a fisherman. He died in a boating accident when I was young. He was very healthy, as far as I know. My brother... he had problems with his legs, I think. Arthritis, maybe? And my sister… she lived in America, far away. I haven't seen her in many years. We didn’t talk much about illnesses, if that makes sense. We just… lived our lives. It's not a very helpful list, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. You've given me some very helpful information, even though it's not a complete list. Knowing about your mother's heart condition and your brother’s arthritis is a good starting point. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life! Walter, he used to smoke when he was young, but he gave it up years ago. He said it was bad for his lungs. He's a very sensible man, my Walter. And I don't drink much either, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing strong. We mostly just eat healthy food and try to take it easy. That's our lifestyle, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Stoffregen. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Now, lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don't think so. I've never really had any trouble with food, or anything like that. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I use certain soaps, but that's all. And I don’t think I'm allergic to any medications. I haven’t taken many, though, as I said. Just a little pill for my blood pressure, and some for my arthritis when my joints get sore. I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything, but I could be wrong. Walter would probably know for sure. He keeps track of all that!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Thank you for answering all my questions. It sounds like you don't have any known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. We’ll start with checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll do a gentle abdominal exam and a neurological check. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. You seem like a very nice doctor. My blood pressure is probably a bit high, though, as I said. I always get nervous at the doctor's office! And my joints do get a little creaky sometimes. Go ahead, whatever you need to do. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. We’ll take things slowly. I understand that being at the doctor's office can be stressful, and that can affect your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, as you suspected. As we discussed, this could be related to being in the office. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear overall, but I'm hearing some mild crackles, which could be a sign of fluid buildup. We'll keep that in mind. Your abdomen is soft and doesn't appear to be tender. Your reflexes and strength are normal. Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Thank you for your patience. The exam didn't reveal anything alarming, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and mild crackles in your lungs are things we'll want to monitor. Now, based on everything you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention – difficulty emptying your bladder completely – likely related to age-related changes in bladder function. The crackles in your lungs could indicate some mild fluid buildup, which could be contributing to fatigue. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. I’m going to order a urine analysis to check for infection and other abnormalities. I would also like to get a blood test to assess your kidney function and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. Lastly, I want to perform a bladder scan, which is a non-invasive test to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests... more tests? Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I don't like going through all these tests, but I want to feel better. Urine analysis, blood test, bladder scan… it all sounds very complicated. Will it hurt? And will it take a long time? I don't have much energy these days. As long as it doesn’t hurt, I guess I can do it. But please don't make me come back too many times. My husband will get annoyed!
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Stoffregen. We'll take things one step at a time, and I'll do everything I can to make it as comfortable and convenient as possible. The urine analysis is a simple test - you'll just need to provide a urine sample in a cup. The blood test will only require a small amount of blood to be drawn from your arm. And the bladder scan is completely non-invasive - it's just a small device that we use to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder – it doesn’t hurt at all. The lab should be able to process the urine and blood tests quickly. The bladder scan can be done right here in the office today. And we can schedule a follow-up appointment in a week or two to discuss the results. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… better. A little cup for the pee… I can do that. A little prick with a needle… I don’t like needles, but I can handle it. And the scan doesn’t hurt… good. Right here in the office today… that’s good, too. One week or two for the results… alright. Yes, that sounds much more manageable. Thank you, Doctor. You explained it very nicely. As long as it doesn’t take too long, and I don’t have to come back too many times. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. My husband will be happy to know I’m not running around to too many appointments.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m glad we were able to come up with a plan that works for you. And I assure you, we’ll keep the appointments to a minimum. Let's start with the urine sample. I'll have the nurse bring you a cup and some instructions. We’ll get the blood test drawn right after that, and then we can do the bladder scan. Is there anything else I can address for you today, or any questions you have before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. Just get it over with, and hopefully we'll figure out what's wrong. Thank you for being so patient with me. My memory isn't what it used to be, and I get confused easily. Just bring on the cup, I guess. And thank you again. You seem like a very kind doctor.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. Please don’t hesitate to ask if anything comes to mind, or if you have any concerns at all. And don’t worry about your memory – it's perfectly normal to feel a bit confused sometimes. I’ll have the nurse come in right away with the cup, and we’ll take it from there. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
