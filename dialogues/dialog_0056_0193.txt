DOCTOR: Hi Jammal, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Amussen. It is... a problem with the gas. Too much, you understand? It is... embarrassing, really. I hope we can find a solution.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Embarrassing issues are very common, so don't worry about that part. “Too much gas” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, well... it happens many times each day. After I eat, usually. Sometimes even when I do not eat! It is… loud, and the smell is not pleasant, I’m afraid. It started, perhaps, a month ago? Maybe six weeks? I try to be polite, but it is difficult when working at the counter, you know. Customers... they look.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. So, it’s been happening for about a month or so, multiple times a day, often after eating, but also sometimes even when you haven’t eaten. And it's causing you some social concern with your work. Does it happen at any particular time of day, or with specific foods?
PATIENT: Hmm... specific foods... I think beans are bad. And cabbage, yes. But also… sometimes just a sandwich. It does not seem to matter what I eat, only that I have eaten. The time... mostly after lunch, but I had some this morning even before breakfast. It is very strange, Doctor. Very strange indeed. I do not know what has changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so beans and cabbage definitely seem to be triggers, but it’s also happening with other foods, and it’s not consistently related to a specific mealtime. That’s helpful to know. And you said you haven't changed anything in your diet or routine recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing has changed. I eat the same things, I go to work, I come home. I have not tried any new foods. I do not drink much soda, mostly water. I am a simple man, with a simple life. That is why I am so confused by this. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the gas?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Sometimes my stomach feels a little bloated, yes. And… a little cramping, perhaps. Not very bad, just uncomfortable. No pain, really. And… no changes in my… bathroom habits, if you understand me. Just the gas, and the bloating sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating and occasional mild cramping along with the gas. No changes in your bowel movements. Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of those things. No fever, no sickness, no weight loss. I feel… normal, except for the gas, of course. My weight is the same. I weigh myself every week, you see, just to be sure. I like to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And just to get a full picture, do you have any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I do not think so. I have never been allergic to anything. I can eat anything, usually. I have had no reactions to any foods. I do not take any medications, Doctor. I try to stay healthy, so I avoid them when I can. Just a little vitamin D in the winter, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies or medications. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have never been sick with anything serious. I went to the doctor for a check-up every year, but they always said I was healthy. I am a strong man, usually. I have a good constitution, my mother always said. Those illnesses… I have never heard of them before. Are they common?
DOCTOR: Those are all conditions that can sometimes cause gas and bloating, so I ask to rule them out. You’ve never been diagnosed with any of those. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Never. I have been very fortunate. No broken bones, no operations… nothing. I am a simple man, Doctor. I have not needed any serious medical attention, until now, of course. This gas… it is most troubling.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, she is gone now. She lived to be eighty-two. My father, he passed away when I was young. I have one sister, she lives in Budapest. She is healthy, as far as I know. No… no family history of these… stomach problems, no. They were all strong people, mostly farmers. They ate good food, simple food. No complaints.
DOCTOR: Okay, no family history of stomach problems. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your belly with my stethoscope, and gently press on it to feel for any tenderness. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… alright. I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle, please. My stomach is a little… sensitive at the moment, you understand. But if it helps, then please do what you need to do. I want this gas to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Okay, your bowel sounds are normal – that’s good. I’m not feeling any significant tenderness, but you’re a little sensitive in the lower abdomen, as you mentioned. No masses or anything concerning. So, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like we're dealing with excessive gas, likely related to something in your diet, even if you haven’t been able to pinpoint it yet. It doesn't seem like anything serious is going on, but we should try to figure out what's causing it. Have you tried any over-the-counter remedies, like simethicone or activated charcoal?
PATIENT: Oh, that is good to hear, Doctor. Not serious... that is a comfort. Over-the-counter… no, I have not. I do not… I do not know those things. I mostly just try to… ignore it. But sometimes, it is impossible to ignore. Is simethicone… a pill? And activated charcoal… what is that? Is it safe? I am careful about putting things in my body, you understand.
DOCTOR: Simethicone is a pill or liquid that helps break up gas bubbles, making them easier to pass. It’s very safe, and quite common. Activated charcoal is also safe, but it can sometimes interfere with the absorption of medications, so it’s best to avoid it if you take any. We can start with just trying the simethicone, if you’re comfortable with that. I'm going to recommend you try simethicone, 200-400mg after meals, for a week and see if that helps. If it doesn’t, we can explore other options. I'm also going to suggest keeping a food diary for the next few days – write down everything you eat and drink, and when your gas symptoms occur. That might help us identify any triggers. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. A food diary… I can do that. I am good at keeping track of things. And simethicone… I will try it. After meals, you say? I will make a note of it. Is there anything I should avoid eating while I am trying this simethicone? Anything that might make the gas worse? I want to be thorough, you understand. I want to get rid of this problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. While you’re trying the simethicone, it’s a good idea to temporarily reduce your intake of foods known to cause gas, like beans, cabbage, broccoli, onions, carbonated drinks, and artificial sweeteners. Also, eating slowly and thoroughly chewing your food can help reduce the amount of air you swallow, which can contribute to gas. And staying hydrated is important, too. Here’s a handout with more information about managing gas, including a list of foods to avoid and tips for reducing gas production. I’m also going to give you a prescription for the simethicone, just in case it's hard to find over the counter. I want to rule out anything more serious, so if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a week, please schedule a follow-up appointment. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes… perfect sense. I will avoid those foods, eat slowly, and drink plenty of water. And I will take the simethicone after meals. I appreciate your thoroughness. So, to be clear, if the gas does not improve after one week, I should make another appointment? And if it gets worse, I should come back sooner? I want to be sure I understand correctly. I do not want to bother you unnecessarily, but I also do not want this gas to continue.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if they worsen at any point, please schedule a follow-up appointment. Don’t hesitate to come back sooner if you’re concerned. It’s always better to be safe. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not think so. You have been very helpful, and very thorough. You have answered all my questions, and given me clear instructions. I appreciate your kindness, and your patience. I will follow your instructions carefully, and I hope this simethicone works. Thank you again for your time, Doctor Amussen.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jammal. I hope it helps, too! Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was nice meeting you. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
