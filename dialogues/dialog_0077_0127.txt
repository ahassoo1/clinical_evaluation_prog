DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s… nice to meet you. Perhaps you could start by telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve noticed my muscles getting weaker, progressively, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they’re starting to droop. It’s making it difficult to keep them open sometimes.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids… alright. And when you say progressively, can you give me a rough idea of how long this has been going on, and how much more noticeable it's become recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I’d say, around… November of last year, maybe? It was very subtle at first, just feeling a bit more tired than usual. But it’s gotten steadily worse since then. In the last month or so, it’s definitely become much more noticeable. I find myself needing to concentrate just to keep my eyes open during the day, and simple tasks… like lifting things… are becoming harder. It’s a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: November… so about nine months now. And you mentioned lifting things… is this weakness all over, or is it more pronounced in certain areas?
PATIENT: It’s… it’s mostly in my arms and legs, I think. My face feels a little weak sometimes, but not as much. And it’s more noticeable when I’m using them, like when I’m carrying groceries or climbing stairs. It’s not constant, but it’s definitely there. I wouldn’t say it’s painful, exactly… just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness and drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… I've been a bit more tired than usual, as I mentioned. And… now that you ask, my speech feels a little… slurred sometimes. It’s not all the time, and people haven’t pointed it out, but I notice it. And I’ve been swallowing a bit more slowly, perhaps? It’s hard to say. It’s all been happening gradually, so it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly what’s new.
DOCTOR: Alright. Speech and swallowing difficulties… that’s important information. Now, have you had any fever, weight loss, or any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever that I’ve noticed. And my weight… I haven’t really been keeping track, to be honest. I haven’t lost any weight deliberately. As for my vision… no, not really. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, so I assumed that was just the prescription needing updating. Nothing dramatic.
DOCTOR: No fever, no deliberate weight loss, vision blurry consistent with glasses… Now, let’s go through some other things quickly. Any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia when I was younger, maybe ten years ago? I was hospitalized for it. And… I had my appendix removed in university, but that was… a long time ago now. Otherwise, nothing major. I'm generally quite healthy, or at least, was. And… I was divorced about two years ago. I don’t know if that’s relevant, but… it was stressful.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia, appendectomy… and a stressful divorce. Thank you for sharing that. Now, family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My mother had some heart problems later in life, but nothing too specific. And my grandfather… on my father’s side… I believe he had diabetes. But other than that, not really. My family tends to… live a long time, thankfully. We don’t have a lot of serious illnesses, from what I know. It's mostly just… old age. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. And what about your social history, Mr. Schaust?
PATIENT: Social history? Right… Well, I work as a facilities manager, so I’m fairly active during the day. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I live alone, as I mentioned, since the divorce. I don't really have any hobbies to speak of at the moment, it's been difficult to get into anything. I try to eat relatively healthy, but… I haven't been very motivated lately. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: No, that’s good, thank you. And, lastly, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I rarely take medication, to be honest. Just over-the-counter painkillers if I have a headache. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Mr. Schaust. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and… a few other things. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I just… I'd really like to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit here for me… First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 130 over 80… good. Now, let's look at your eyes… Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious abnormalities there. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are… slightly diminished, actually. Not completely absent, but weaker than expected. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like that? It feels… a little weak, doesn’t it? I mean, I’m trying, but it doesn't feel as strong as it used to. I'm not sure if that's helpful… I don't want to exaggerate.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And you’re right, it is weaker than I'd expect for someone your age. It is difficult to assess accurately, but I would rate the strength in your arms as approximately 4 out of 5, and your legs as… about the same, maybe slightly weaker. Now, can you hold your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… starting to feel a bit heavy. And… it's shaking, I think. I don’t normally shake like this. It's only been a few seconds… am I doing something wrong?
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing perfectly fine. That’s… concerning, actually. The trembling, coupled with the weakness… and the diminished reflexes. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the preliminary examination, I am concerned about a possible neuromuscular condition. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing, but the symptoms you’re describing – progressive weakness, drooping eyelids, speech difficulties, swallowing problems, and now the trembling – point in that direction. It could be something relatively benign, but it could also be something more serious.
PATIENT: Neuromuscular… that sounds… frightening. What kind of testing are you thinking of? And… what could it be, if it's more serious? I understand you can’t give me a diagnosis right now, but… even a general idea would be helpful. I’m getting quite worried.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Schaust. It is concerning, and I want to be upfront with you. We’ll need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I’m thinking of a blood test to look for specific antibodies, and an electromyography, or EMG, which measures the electrical activity in your muscles. It can help us pinpoint the source of the weakness. As for what it could be… it could be a condition called Myasthenia Gravis, which causes weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. It is treatable, often with medication. It could also be something else, and that’s why the testing is so important. We need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order those tests right away. I’ll also refer you to a neurologist, a specialist in nerve and muscle disorders. They will be able to interpret the results and provide a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. I want you to know that we're taking this seriously, and we’ll do everything we can to get you the answers you need. Do you have any immediate concerns or questions before I finish these orders?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… That sounds… complicated. And a neurologist… That means it’s serious, doesn’t it? What are the chances… what are the chances it isn’t that? Is there a possibility it could be something… less serious? And what happens if it is Myasthenia? What kind of treatment? I… I’m just a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. I wasn’t expecting this. And… how long will it take to get the test results?
DOCTOR: I understand you’re overwhelmed, Mr. Schaust. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. It’s difficult to say with certainty what the chances are without the test results. There is a possibility it could be something else, yes. Sometimes, muscle weakness can be caused by vitamin deficiencies, or other underlying medical conditions. That’s why we need to rule everything out. If it is Myasthenia Gravis, the treatment typically involves medication to improve nerve function. There are also lifestyle modifications that can help manage the symptoms. In some cases, more advanced therapies may be necessary, but the vast majority of patients respond well to treatment. It is a chronic condition, but it is manageable. As for the test results, the blood test should come back within a few days. The EMG appointment will take a bit longer to schedule, possibly a week or two. I’ll have my assistant contact you as soon as everything is arranged. In the meantime, please try not to worry too much. We’re going to get to the bottom of this, and we’ll develop a plan to address whatever it may be. I'll write a referral to a neurologist. Do you have any questions for me at this moment?
PATIENT: A week or two… That seems like a long time to wait. And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any activities I should avoid? Or anything I should be doing? I mean, I work, and I don’t want to… make things worse. I just… I feel so helpless. And I really appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It’s… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: You are right, a week or two is a long time to wait, and I apologize for that. I'll make a note to expedite the EMG appointment as much as possible. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid strenuous activity that worsens your weakness. Try to pace yourself, and get plenty of rest. If you notice any new symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or swallowing, please seek immediate medical attention. As for what you should be doing… try to maintain a healthy diet and get regular, moderate exercise, if you are able. But don't push yourself too hard. Most importantly, try not to stress too much, as stress can exacerbate the symptoms. I understand you feel helpless, Mr. Schaust. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way in a situation like this. But please remember that you’re not alone. We’re here to support you every step of the way. I’ll write you a note outlining these recommendations, as well as the contact information for the neurologist. And please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you. Really, thank you. I appreciate your time, and your patience, and… just your kindness. I’m going to… try to stay positive. And I'll call if anything changes. I think I’ll head home now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. My assistant will be in touch soon to schedule your appointment. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this, together. Have a good day, Mr. Schaust. And drive safely. .
