DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Londell. Well, I reckon I’m getting on in years, and I thought it was time to see if everything’s still…tickin’ like it should be, you know? My wife always said I should be more proactive about these things. She was a smart woman. This is a “men’s health optimization” visit, right? Just want to make sure I’m doin’ everything I can to stay healthy for as long as possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here it’s a comprehensive wellness check-up. “Optimization” is…a good way to put it. Alright, Londell, let’s start with the basics. Can you tell me a little about any current symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm…symptoms. Not much, really. Maybe a little more tired than I used to be, but I chalked that up to the heat. It’s been a scorcher this summer. And… well, I have to get up once or twice a night to use the bathroom. That’s been happenin’ more lately, too. Other than that, I feel pretty good for my age, I suppose. Joints ache a bit after a long day workin’ on the etchings, but that’s just part of gettin' older, right?
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue and nocturia – needing to urinate more frequently at night. And some joint discomfort. I see. How long have you been noticing the fatigue and the increased nighttime urination?
PATIENT: Oh, the fatigue… probably the last six months or so. It comes and goes, but it’s definitely not like it used to be. I used to be able to go all day without a nap. As for the bathroom thing, that's been gettin' worse in the last couple of months, I'd say. Maybe three or four times a night some nights. It’s a nuisance, mostly. Not painful, just…inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any difficulty starting your urination, or any feeling of incomplete emptying when you go?
PATIENT: Hmm...now that you mention it, sometimes it takes a moment to get things goin'. Not a struggle, exactly, just a little hesitation. And...yes, I suppose sometimes it doesn't feel like I get everything out, if you know what I mean. It’s not every time, but often enough that I notice it. I hadn't really said anything to anyone about it before today, though. It just seemed like another little thing that comes with gettin' older.
DOCTOR: Alright, Londell. We're getting a better picture here. Hesitation and incomplete emptying… that's helpful. Now, let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let's see... my wife, bless her heart, she had high blood pressure, but I never have. Doctor always said I was as healthy as a horse, for an old man. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was a young’un, but that was a long time ago. And I broke my wrist fallin’ off a ladder a few years back, but that healed up fine. Otherwise... no, I haven't been diagnosed with anything major. Regular check-ups, always passed with flyin' colors. I always thought I was lucky.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history. Pneumonia as a child and a broken wrist, but otherwise healthy. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to knives and such. Always figured if somethin’ wasn’t broke, don’t fix it. I’ve been fortunate that I haven’t needed any. My wife had her gallbladder out, but I avoided the operating room like the plague.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. That’s good. Let’s talk about family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, prostate problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, my mother’s side… they tended to live long lives, but not always healthy long lives, if you catch my drift. Lots of aches and pains, arthritis mostly. My father… he had some trouble with his heart later in life, but he didn’t take care of himself. Smoked like a chimney, drank too much. As for prostate problems… I don’t rightly know. Nobody ever talked about that sort of thing when I was growin’ up. It was just…not discussed. My wife’s side… her father had diabetes, and her brother had skin cancer, but that's about all I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, some family history of heart disease, arthritis, diabetes, and skin cancer. And limited information about prostate issues. Now, a few lifestyle questions, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife hated ‘em. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but I haven't had much appetite since she passed, so I don’t really drink anymore. And recreational drugs? Heavens no. I’m an old-fashioned man. Just a little coffee to get me goin' in the mornin'. And I've always been careful about what I eat, try to stick to wholesome foods, you know? Though I do have a sweet tooth for apple pie.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, limited alcohol, no recreational drugs. Good. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I haven’t had much need for medications, thankfully. I took some penicillin for strep throat when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And I don't have any food allergies, no. I can eat just about anything. I reckon I'm a pretty simple man when it comes to that sort of thing. Is this all you need to know for now, Doctor? I'm happy to answer whatever questions you have.
DOCTOR: Alright, Londell, that's very helpful. Just a few more quick questions. What is your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I haven’t been weighed in ages. I’m… well, I’m about 5 foot 8, I reckon. And… I’ve put on a few pounds since my wife passed. Maybe around 160, 165? It’s hard to say exactly. I used to be a leaner fella. And I'm about 72. I don't mind tellin' you, I ain't as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that, Londell. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a brief abdominal and neurological exam. We’ll also need to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. And I'll want to order some lab work, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Well now… that’s a bit more than I was expectin’. A… digital rectal exam? Is that really necessary, Doctor? I mean, I understand you have your reasons, but… it just seems a little…invasive. I’m an old man, but I still have my pride, you know? Is there anything else we could do first? Perhaps just the blood work? I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that part right now. I’m not afraid of needles, it’s… well, it's just a little personal. I reckon I’m more comfortable with the blood work for now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammann, while I respect your concerns, a digital rectal exam is a crucial part of a comprehensive men’s health assessment, particularly given your symptoms of nocturia and hesitation with urination. It allows me to assess the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate, and to check for any abnormalities that could be contributing to your issues. It’s the best way to screen for prostate cancer, and early detection is vital. I understand it's not the most comfortable procedure, but it is medically necessary. I assure you, it is quick and I will do everything I can to minimize any discomfort. We can discuss any concerns you have during the exam, and you are welcome to stop at any time. However, I cannot proceed with a thorough assessment without it. It would be irresponsible of me to do so. If you are absolutely unwilling, I can refer you to another physician, but I strongly advise against it. Perhaps we can delay the exam and focus on the bloodwork first. We can re-evaluate after we have the results and discuss the exam again then. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Well, now you've put me in a right pickle. I don't like the sound of that exam one bit, but… I reckon you're the doctor. And you're right, I don't want to ignore something serious. My wife always said I was too stubborn for my own good. Alright, alright. Let’s do the exam. But… please be gentle, Doctor. And… maybe tell me what you’re doin' as you go? Just so I know what to expect. And I’m a nervous man, so if I squirm a bit, don’t take it personally. And… thank you for explainin' it all so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience. Let’s get it over with, then.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kammann. That's a good decision. I will explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. It will only take a few moments. Please lie on your side with your knees drawn up toward your chest. I'm going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to feel your prostate. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I'm just inserting the finger now… and I’m feeling for the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate. The prostate feels… slightly enlarged, but without any obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. There's a smooth surface… and no significant discomfort reported. It does feel a bit firm, which is not uncommon with age, but we'll need the lab results to get a clearer picture. I'm withdrawing the finger now… Alright, that's all done. I apologize for any discomfort. As I mentioned, the prostate felt slightly enlarged, but otherwise unremarkable. We'll need to wait for the lab results to determine if any further investigation is necessary. Now, let's move on to listening to your heart and lungs. Please lie on your back and take a few deep breaths.
