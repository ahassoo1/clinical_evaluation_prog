DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don't have all day to sit here and explain things. It's this tiredness, see? Just…dragging. And I’ve been…well, eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to be annoying. It's embarrassing, truly. I just need something to make it stop.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candis. It sounds frustrating to be dealing with both the tiredness and…and this other issue. Don’t worry about embarrassment; we're here to figure things out together, no judgment at all. Let’s start with the tiredness. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, "a bit more"? Where do I begin? It's not just feeling sleepy, Doctor. It's like…everything takes so much effort. Getting out of bed, walking to the store, even just thinking straight. It’s been getting worse for months, slowly, but definitely worse. And it doesn’t matter how much I rest, it's still there. I used to be so active! Now…well, now I'm mostly just existing. Is that helpful? I really don’t see what good talking about it will do, frankly.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Candis. Very helpful. It sounds like this isn’t just simple fatigue; it’s impacting your daily life significantly, and that it’s been a gradual process. The fact that rest isn’t helping is important too. You mentioned it’s been months. Can you recall approximately when you first started noticing this increasing tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was right after that terrible heatwave last summer. July, I think? Yes, definitely July. It was so hot, even for this area. I remember thinking it was just the heat, you know? Everyone was sluggish. But then it didn’t go away when it cooled off. It just…lingered. And then got worse, bit by bit. Honestly, I don’t see what the heat has to do with me eating clay now, though. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, July after the heatwave. That gives us a good starting point. And I appreciate you pointing out the connection – or lack thereof – between the tiredness and the…clay. Sometimes seemingly unrelated symptoms can be connected, and sometimes they aren’t. We'll explore both possibilities. When you say “clay,” can you describe exactly what you're eating?
PATIENT: Honestly? Dirt. Regular dirt. From the garden, mostly. Sometimes a little bit from the roadside when I’m walking. It’s not like I’m going out and digging for special clay, Doctor. It just…appeals. It's hard to explain. It's a…craving, I suppose. A weird one, but a craving nonetheless. It doesn’t taste good, believe me. It just feels…right. And I've noticed it gets worse when I'm really tired. Does that make any sense? I'm probably just a strange old woman.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Candis. And you're not strange at all. What you’re describing – the craving for dirt, especially when tired – is something we need to investigate further. It’s a condition called pica, and it can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency. Let’s talk about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Diet. Well, I mostly eat what’s easy. I live alone, you see. So, a lot of canned soup, toast, maybe a little bit of fish if I’m feeling ambitious. Not much fruit, vegetables are expensive. I don't really cook anymore. It’s just…easier this way. I used to be a good cook, but what's the point, really? It’s just me. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but I can’t remember the last time I actually bought one. Is this what you want to know? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: No interrogation intended at all, Candis. I’m just trying to get a complete picture of what’s going on. It sounds like your diet might be lacking in certain nutrients, and that could be contributing to both the tiredness and the pica. Before we get to potential causes and solutions, let's quickly go through some other things. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? My joints ache, especially in the mornings. And I've been more forgetful than usual, although I always had a good memory. Still do, really, but…little things slip my mind. Also, I've been a little breathless lately, even when I'm just walking around the house. And I've noticed my skin feels…dry, and my nails are brittle. It’s probably just old age, though. I swear, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like a broken-down machine. I just want to feel normal again. And quickly, if you don’t mind. I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to mention, Candis, and definitely not just “old age.” Joint pain, forgetfulness, breathlessness, and dry skin… these all point to several possibilities, and we need to investigate further. I’m going to need to do a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It’ll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and looking at your skin and nails. Then, I’d like to order some blood tests to check for things like iron deficiency, vitamin levels, and thyroid function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Fine. Do whatever you need to do. Get it over with. I have things to do, you know. I’m not getting any younger. Just…be quick about it, please. And try not to poke me too much. I hate being poked. I really don't understand why a blood test is necessary, but I suppose you know best. If you insist. Just… let’s get this done.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Your blood pressure is 135/85, and your pulse is 72. That’s within a reasonable range. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and examine your skin and nails. Your reflexes are a little slow, but that could be due to several things. Your skin is definitely dry, and your nails are quite brittle. Now, I'll need to draw some blood for the tests. Do you have any allergies to latex or bandages?
PATIENT: Latex? No. I don’t think so. I used to garden a lot, and I don't recall any problems with gloves. But I’m not a fan of needles, Doctor. Not at all. Please just be as quick as you can. I feel faint just thinking about it. And don’t ask me to look. I can’t stand to see it. Just…get it over with. And make sure you tell me what’s wrong afterwards, quickly. I don’t have time for a long explanation. I have errands, you know. And a life to live, even if it’s a tired one.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Candis. We’ll be as efficient and gentle as possible. Please, just focus on your breathing. I’ll let you know when it’s over. And I promise, I’ll explain the results as concisely as possible after the tests are back. Alright, all done. Just keep that pressure on for a few minutes, and you’ll be fine. The lab usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any dizziness, shortness of breath, or excessive bleeding from the puncture site, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Just… get the results back quickly. And call me. Don’t make me come back here again if you can avoid it. I have better things to do. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. I have errands, remember? And a life to… well, you know.
