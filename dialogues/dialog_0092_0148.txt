DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh, goodness… well, it's a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having some… pain. Down there. In my… well, the area with my… you know. It's been going on for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out. I’m not quite sure how long, though. Things haven’t been the clearest lately, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright, Ms. Stepbro. Many women experience discomfort in that area at some point in their lives, and you've done the right thing by coming in to have it evaluated. It takes courage to discuss these things. When you say "a little while," could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s… very kind of you to say. A rough estimate… hmm. Perhaps a few weeks? Maybe a month? It’s difficult to pinpoint, truly. It comes and goes, you see. Not constant, but enough to… bother me. And it feels… different sometimes. Dull, achy… other times it’s more sharp, if that makes any sense. I really wish I could be more precise, but my memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stepbro. We’ll work with what you can recall. So, a few weeks to a month, with varying types of pain – dull, achy, and sometimes sharp. Can you tell me where exactly you’re feeling the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Exactly… Let me see. It's… mostly in the… well, the scrotum, I believe it’s called? That’s the… pouch, isn’t it? Yes, the scrotum. And sometimes it seems to radiate… up into my groin a little bit. Not always, but when it’s sharper, definitely. Is that… helpful? I apologize if I’m being vague. It’s difficult to explain, and I don’t want to… mislead you.
DOCTOR: You're not being vague at all, Ms. Stepbro. You're describing it perfectly well. Pain in the scrotum radiating to the groin. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, my. A scale… Yes, alright. At its worst… hmm. It’s not constant pain, you see. But when it flares up… I would say… perhaps a six? Maybe a seven on a bad day? It’s not debilitating, but it certainly gets my attention. It makes me… hesitant to move around too much. And I find myself… worrying about it, which doesn’t help, I’m sure. Would a seven be accurate, Doctor? I truly want to give you the best information I can.
DOCTOR: A six or seven at its worst, understandable. And it causes you some hesitation with movement and some worry. Thank you, Ms. Stepbro. That's very helpful. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Triggers… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… I haven't noticed anything specific, truly. Sometimes it seems worse after I’ve been… sitting for a long time? Or after I’ve been… on my feet a lot? But it’s not consistent. I do a fair bit of woodworking, you see, so I’m often moving around, and sometimes sitting at the workbench. Perhaps that… contributes? I honestly can’t say for sure. It just… comes and goes. I wish I had a better answer for you, Doctor. I feel like I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Stepbro. It's common for pain to not have a clear trigger. Sitting or standing for prolonged periods, and activity like woodworking – that’s all useful information. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s kind of you to say. Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think carefully. No… no fever, I don’t believe. No nausea. No… changes in my urination, that I’ve noticed. Everything seems… normal in that regard. I haven’t noticed any… swelling, either. Though, sometimes it feels… a bit heavy, if that makes sense? Like a… fullness? But I’m not sure if that’s just… my imagination. And no… no sores or anything like that. Oh! I have been feeling a bit more tired lately, but I thought that was just… getting older. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Stepbro. No fever, nausea, changes in urination, or swelling. A feeling of heaviness or fullness, and increased fatigue. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My medical history… Well, it's not terribly exciting, thankfully. I’ve always been… reasonably healthy, I suppose. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, rubella… nothing serious. As an adult… I had my appendix removed years ago, perhaps twenty years ago now? And I had a bit of a… problem with my gallbladder a few years back, but it resolved itself with diet. Otherwise… just the typical aches and pains of getting older, you know? I do have Medicare, if that’s helpful. My memory isn't what it used to be, so I may be forgetting something, but I can’t think of anything major right now. Is that… sufficient?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Stepbro. Appendix removed twenty years ago, and a previous gallbladder issue that resolved with diet. And you have Medicare coverage. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, allergies. Hmm. Let me see. I don’t think so. I've never knowingly had a reaction to any medication. No food allergies that I’m aware of. I have a bit of a sensitivity to… dust, when I'm woodworking. It makes me sneeze, but it’s not a true allergy, more of an irritation. Other than that… no, I don't believe I have any allergies. But, as I said, my memory is… a bit unreliable. I suppose it's always possible I’m forgetting something. But I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stepbro. No known allergies, just a sensitivity to dust. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… No, not really. I do take a multivitamin every day, just to keep things… balanced. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for… aches and pains, but only occasionally. Nothing regular. I don’t have any prescriptions. Just the multivitamin and the ibuprofen when needed. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I'm honest. Does that cover everything, Doctor? I hope I haven't forgotten anything important. This has been… a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Stepbro. Multivitamin daily and ibuprofen as needed. No, you haven't forgotten anything important. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam. Yes, please. I trust your judgement completely. Whatever you think is best. I’m a bit nervous, I confess, but I know it’s necessary. Just… let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. I’m not very good with… surprises. And please, don't hesitate to tell me what you're doing as you go along. That always helps to calm my nerves.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stepbro. I will explain everything as I go, and please, don’t hesitate to tell me if anything is uncomfortable. We’ll take it slow. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll gently examine your abdomen. Finally, I'll need to examine the scrotal area to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Listening to my heart and lungs, examining my abdomen… and then the scrotal area. Yes, alright. Please, take your time. And thank you for explaining everything beforehand. It makes me feel… much more at ease. Just… be gentle, if you would. And again, please don't hesitate to tell me if you see anything… concerning. I trust your expertise completely. Do I need to do anything special? Lie down, perhaps? Or just… sit here?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stepbro. You are very cooperative. Please, if you could lie down on the examination table, that would be ideal. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. You can lie on your back with your arms at your sides. I'll raise the head of the table slightly for comfort. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don't hear any unusual noises. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses are palpable. Now, I will need to examine the scrotal area. I will explain each step as I go.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Lying down on the table… yes, that’s… comfortable enough. And thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. It’s… reassuring. Heart sounds regular, lungs clear… that’s good news, isn’t it? Soft, non-tender abdomen… also good. Yes, please, take your time. And thank you again for being so… thorough. Examining the scrotal area… I understand. Please, be gentle. This is… a bit nerve-wracking, but I trust your judgement completely. Do I need to do anything special? Just… relax, I suppose? It’s easier said than done, but I’ll try.
DOCTOR: That’s right, just relax as best as you can, Ms. Stepbro. I'm going to gently palpate each testicle and the surrounding tissues, feeling for any lumps, swelling, or tenderness. It’s important to be thorough. Your left testicle feels normal in size and consistency. No masses are palpable. No tenderness is elicited with palpation. Your right testicle also feels normal in size and consistency. I do note a slight tenderness on the upper portion of the right testicle with palpation, but it's very mild. I also note some mild swelling around the epididymis, the structure located on the back of the testicle. The spermatic cord is intact and non-tender. No evidence of varicocele. Alright, Ms. Stepbro. That concludes the physical exam. Everything appears largely normal, except for the mild tenderness and swelling I noted on the right testicle. Now, to help me get a clearer picture of what might be going on, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a scrotal ultrasound. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Mild tenderness and swelling on the right testicle… hmm. That doesn’t sound… good, does it? Not good at all. Urinalysis and a scrotal ultrasound… yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary, then please, do. Anything to… understand what’s going on. I’m a bit worried now, I confess. Is it… serious, Doctor? Could it be… something terrible? I apologize for being… dramatic, but it’s hard not to be anxious when you hear things like that. And… what will the ultrasound show? Will it be painful? I just… want to know what I’m facing. Is it something we can fix?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Ms. Stepbro, and you're not being dramatic at all. It's good you're asking questions. The mild tenderness and swelling could be due to a number of things, and it's important not to jump to conclusions. It could be something as simple as an infection or inflammation, or it could be a more complex issue. That’s why the tests are important. The urinalysis will help rule out any infection. The scrotal ultrasound is a painless imaging test that will allow us to visualize the testicles, epididymis, and surrounding structures in more detail. It will help me determine the cause of the swelling and tenderness. I don't want to speculate on what it might be until I have the test results. However, based on my initial assessment, it doesn't seem to be an emergency. But we do want to investigate it thoroughly. The ultrasound will provide more information, and then we can discuss the best course of action. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh. Not an emergency… That’s… reassuring, thank you, Doctor. But still… something to investigate. I understand. A painless imaging test… good. I’m glad it won’t be painful. I… I suppose I just worry. It's foolish, but… my husband passed away a few years ago, and I’ve been trying to… take care of myself since then. I don’t have anyone to help me worry, if that makes sense. Will the ultrasound tell you if it’s… serious? Like… cancer? I apologize for asking such a… morbid question. It’s just… it’s always in the back of my mind, you know? I’ve heard so many stories… Is that a possibility? I need to know… even if it’s just a small chance. It’s better to be prepared, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You’re not foolish at all, Ms. Stepbro. And you’re very brave for sharing that with me. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious and want to be prepared. It's good that you're asking these questions, and I want to be completely honest with you. While it's always a possibility, testicular cancer is relatively rare, and the vast majority of testicular masses are benign – meaning not cancerous. The ultrasound will help us determine whether the mass is solid or fluid-filled, and whether it has any characteristics that are suggestive of cancer. I want to emphasize that we are not assuming it's cancer. However, it’s important to rule it out, and that’s why we’re ordering the ultrasound. If the ultrasound reveals anything concerning, we would then discuss further testing, such as a biopsy, to get a definitive diagnosis. For now, let's focus on getting the ultrasound done. I'll write the order for you, and you can schedule it at the radiology department. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them in detail and make a plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Focus on the ultrasound… yes, that makes sense. Not assuming it’s cancer… That’s good to hear. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being so… kind and patient. And for being honest with me. It’s a relief to know that you’re not just… dismissing my concerns. A biopsy… that sounds… frightening. But if it’s necessary, then I suppose I’ll do it. I just… I just want to get this sorted out. I want to be able to… get back to my life. I have a small woodworking shop, and I love making things. It’s… it’s my therapy, I suppose. Yes, please, write the order for the ultrasound. I’ll schedule it as soon as possible. And thank you again, Doctor. You’ve… you’ve put my mind at ease a little, even if I’m still worried. Knowing that you’re taking this seriously… it means a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stepbro. That’s what I’m here for. And I completely understand wanting to get back to your woodworking. That sounds like a wonderful outlet. We’ll do everything we can to get you a diagnosis and a treatment plan so you can continue doing what you love. Here’s the order. The radiology department is located on the second floor, just down the hall. They'll schedule the appointment for you when you arrive. It’s usually a quick procedure, and the results are typically available within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, severe pain, or redness in your scrotum, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. I’ll be here to discuss the results with you as soon as they’re available. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, Ms. Stepbro. And try not to worry too much. We’ll get through this together.
