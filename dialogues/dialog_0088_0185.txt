DOCTOR: Hello, Zelina. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my breath. It smells bad. Really bad. My ex-husband… well, let’s just say he made it very clear that was a problem. It’s probably nothing, honestly. Just…deal with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bad breath is certainly something we can address. And it's good you're coming in to have it checked out, even if you think it's minor. It can sometimes be a sign of something else going on. So, how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Honestly? Forever. Or it feels like it. Probably since… the divorce, actually. Which was… a while ago. Look, I brush, okay? And I floss sometimes. Is that what you need to know? It’s not like I’ve been living under a rock.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been ongoing for quite some time, and you do brush regularly, sometimes floss. That gives us a starting point. When you brush, do you notice where the odor seems to be coming from?
PATIENT: Ugh, like…my mouth? Where else would it come from? Look, I'm not a dentist. It's just… everywhere. Back of the tongue, maybe? I don’t know. I don’t exactly enjoy sticking my tongue out and sniffing it, you know? It’s unpleasant. Are you going to make me do that?
DOCTOR: No, I won't make you do anything you're not comfortable with. But examining your mouth, including the back of your tongue, is helpful. We can use a light and a little tool, and I'll explain everything first. Before we do that, let me ask a few more questions. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? A fever? No. I feel fine. Tired, maybe. But that's just…life, you know? I work on the highway, it’s a hard job. I don't get sick easily. No coughing, no sore throat, nothing like that. Just… bad breath. That’s it. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms, just the bad breath and feeling tired from work. I understand you’re busy, so I'll try to be as quick as possible. Do you notice any changes in your taste or have you had any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No. Taste… hmm. I guess everything tastes a little… dull? But honestly, I eat a lot of fast food. It probably just is dull. I don’t sit around analyzing every bite, you know? Look, I’m really not sure what you want me to say. I brush, I work, and my breath smells bad. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, no difficulty swallowing, and a somewhat diminished sense of taste. That's helpful. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Now we’re getting into history? Look, I had strep throat when I was a kid. And I broke my arm once. Does that count? Honestly, I don't really do doctors. I just…deal with things. I’m fine. Really. Just… tired and smelly. I don’t have…fancy illnesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions other than strep throat as a child and a broken arm. That's good to know. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t like taking pills. Never have. I’d rather just…suffer, honestly. I get headaches sometimes, but I just drink a lot of coffee. That fixes everything. Look, is this going to lead to me having to take a bunch of stuff I don't want? Because if it does, I’m leaving.
DOCTOR: No, we're not jumping to any conclusions about medications right now. I just need to gather some information. So, no regular medications, and you use coffee for headaches. Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally, getting to the end. Allergies? No. I eat everything. I'm Lithuanian, we're practical people. We don’t have time for allergies. Maybe… dust? But that’s everyone, right? No serious allergies. Honestly, I’m getting a headache just sitting here talking about all this. Can we just… look at my breath already?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. I understand your frustration. Let’s take a look. I’m going to use a small light and a tongue depressor – it's just to gently hold your tongue out of the way. It won't hurt. Please open wide. Okay, I'm seeing a little bit of redness at the back of your tongue, and some… buildup. It doesn't appear to be anything dramatic, but the odor is definitely present. I'm also noticing your gums are slightly inflamed. Are you experiencing any bleeding when you brush?
PATIENT: Inflamed? Seriously? Fine. Look, sometimes they bleed a little when I brush really hard. But that’s just… because I brush hard. I have to get all the… stuff off, you know? It’s just… highway dust, probably. And stress. Honestly, everything’s stress these days. I don’t have time for gentle brushing. I need it clean. Can we just get to the part where you tell me what I need to do to fix it? I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Okay, some bleeding with vigorous brushing, and inflammation of the gums. That suggests we're dealing with gingivitis - inflammation of the gums, often caused by plaque buildup. The odor and inflammation are likely related. It’s not an emergency, but it needs to be addressed. I recommend a few things. First, let's switch to a softer toothbrush and focus on gentle, circular motions rather than scrubbing. Secondly, we need to improve your oral hygiene. That means brushing twice a day and flossing daily. I can demonstrate proper flossing technique if you'd like. Lastly, let’s add an antibacterial mouthwash to your routine. Something containing chlorhexidine can help reduce the bacteria causing the odor. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Ugh. Softer toothbrush? Flossing daily? Mouthwash? Seriously? Look, I barely have time to sleep, let alone do all that. I guess… I guess I can try. But I’m not promising anything. And I’m definitely not enjoying this conversation. Is there a pill I can take instead? No? Fine. Just…tell me where to get this stuff. I need to get going. And can I get a note for work? I’m probably going to be exhausted from all the… brushing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You can find soft toothbrushes, floss, and chlorhexidine mouthwash at any pharmacy – Walgreens, CVS, even most supermarkets carry them. I’m printing you a note for work explaining you may experience some fatigue as you adjust to a new oral hygiene routine. I’m also going to write a prescription for a mild fluoride toothpaste – it can help strengthen your gums. I recommend following up with a dentist within the next three months for a professional cleaning and further evaluation. They can assess the extent of the gingivitis and recommend any additional treatment. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Three months? A dentist? Look, I barely have time to breathe, let alone go to another appointment. Fine. I’ll… think about it. Just… give me the note and the prescription. I need to get to work. And please, don’t expect me to call if I don’t go. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care of yourself, Zelina. And remember, consistent oral hygiene is key. If the odor persists or your gums continue to bleed, please do reach out to a dentist. Have a good day. .
