DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. Just...tired. Really tired. And...I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I crave it. It's dumb, I know. Don't ask me why. It just...happens. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, "tired" and… a craving for dirt. That’s… good information to start with. It’s not dumb at all, Hedy, and I will ask you some questions about it, if you don't mind. It helps me understand what’s going on. First, let’s talk about this tiredness. How long have you been feeling this tired?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Years, probably. It just...gets worse. Hard to say exactly. I work, you know? Programming those… machines. It takes a lot out of you. I just thought it was the job. But now it's...different. Harder. Like dragging myself through mud. Does that make sense? I don't remember when it started being this bad. Honestly, I don’t keep track of that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. “Dragging yourself through mud” is a very good way to describe it. Programming is demanding work. So, it sounds like this has been a gradual worsening of fatigue over several years, but recently it’s become significantly worse. Just to clarify, Hedy, when you say “tired”, are we talking about physical tiredness, mental exhaustion, or both?
PATIENT: Both! Definitely both. Like… my body feels heavy, all the time. And my brain… foggy. Can’t focus. Forget things. Like… what was I saying? Oh, right. Tired. Both kinds. It's awful. Makes it hard to do my job. People get annoyed. I get annoyed. It’s just… a mess. Look, is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy, and I'll try to be as efficient as possible. We’ll get through this. Both physical and mental fatigue, okay. And it’s impacting your work. Let’s talk about this craving for dirt a little more, if you’re willing. You mentioned it just… happens. Can you tell me a little bit about when it happens?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. When… I don't know! Stressful times, maybe? When I'm really tired? It’s hard to say. I just get this… urge. Like I need it. I go outside, find some… good dirt. Clay-ish, you know? Not sandy. And… I eat it. Small amounts. Don’t make it a big deal. But it happens more and more lately. My late husband... he didn't understand. Thought I was crazy. Are you judging me?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not, Hedy. I’m not judging you at all. It’s my job to understand what’s going on, and you’re being very open with me, which I appreciate. It sounds like this craving happens more frequently when you're stressed or tired. Clay-ish dirt, specifically. Okay. This craving… has it been happening your whole life, or is it something relatively new?
PATIENT: New. Definitely new. I… I don’t think I ever did this before. Not that I remember, anyway. Started… maybe a year ago? Around the time I started feeling really bad. Like, this level of tired. It's all connected, I think. Stress at work, feeling awful, and… the dirt. It’s just… weird. I don't want to talk about it anymore, honestly. It's embarrassing. Is there a test you can give me? Something to just… fix it?
DOCTOR: I understand it's embarrassing, Hedy, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. It sounds like this craving started around the same time as the worsening fatigue, which is important. There are some tests we can do. I'd like to start with a blood test, just to check your iron levels, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid function, and a few other things. Sometimes, these cravings can be related to underlying nutritional imbalances. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel to see how your kidneys and liver are functioning. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Blood test. Do whatever you need to do. I have to get back to work. People are depending on me. But... will it be expensive? I don't... I don't have insurance. My husband... it was complicated. Just tell me how much it's going to cost. Before you do anything.
DOCTOR: Of course, Hedy. I completely understand. Cost is important, especially without insurance. Let me check the pricing for those tests… The basic blood panel, including the iron levels, vitamin check, and thyroid function, is about $150. The basic metabolic panel is around $80. So, the total would be approximately $230. We may need to add more tests depending on the initial results, but we won't do anything without discussing the costs with you first. Does that sound manageable, or would you like me to explore options for lower-cost labs in the area?
PATIENT: Ugh. That’s… a lot. I don’t know if I can afford that right now. Maybe just... the iron levels? Is that the most important thing? I feel weak all the time. My late husband always said I was anemic. He gave me those… pills. But I stopped taking them. Didn't seem to help much. Can we just start with the iron? And then we’ll see? I really need to get back to work. I have deadlines. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. We can definitely start with just the iron levels test. That’s $60. It's a good place to start, especially given your husband's observations. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and we can discuss them then and decide if we need further investigation. We’ll need to draw some blood now. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol wipes?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. Just... hurry up. And don’t judge me for eating dirt, okay? I don't need that right now. Honestly, it's embarrassing enough. Just get it over with. I have things to do. Important things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Hedy. I won't judge you, and I promise to be as quick as possible. Let’s head over to the lab. It’s just down the hall. Pica… and significant fatigue. And a history of anemia. We'll need to rule out some serious possibilities. .
