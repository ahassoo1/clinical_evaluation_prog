DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing… a lot of pressure in my bladder. It’s quite uncomfortable, and it’s becoming a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Pressure in the bladder, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It doesn't necessarily feel like pain, more… a constant fullness, even after I’ve just gone to the restroom. It’s a difficult sensation to describe, actually. And it seems to be getting more frequent throughout the day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how often would you say you’re urinating now, compared to, say, a month ago?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… a month ago, I’d say I was going about every three to four hours normally. Now? It feels like every two, sometimes even less. And at night, I’ve had to get up a couple of times, which I never used to do. It’s disrupting my sleep a bit.
DOCTOR: Disrupting your sleep, yes. And are you experiencing any pain while urinating, or any difficulty starting or stopping the flow?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, there’s no pain. The flow seems normal – no difficulty starting or stopping, it’s just… the frequency, and that constant pressure. It’s more of a discomfort than anything, but it’s persistent. It doesn't feel like a typical urinary tract infection, if that makes sense. I've had those before, and this feels different.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Different from a typical UTI. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any unusual odor?
PATIENT: No, no blood at all, and the smell seems normal, as far as I can tell. I always try to stay well-hydrated, so it's usually pretty clear. It really is just this… pressure, and the need to go so often. It's starting to affect my day-to-day, honestly. I hesitate to go out sometimes, just in case.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you experienced any changes in your appetite, any weight loss, or any nausea?
PATIENT: No, thankfully none of those things. My appetite is normal, my weight is stable – I haven’t lost any weight, and no nausea at all. It really seems to be isolated to this bladder issue. I’ve been trying to keep track, but it’s difficult to pinpoint anything else that might be contributing. It just… started gradually, and has been slowly worsening.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Well, I was diagnosed with mild hypertension about five years ago, but it's well-managed with medication – I take Lisinopril, 20mg daily. Other than that, I don’t have any major health concerns. I had a pretty standard childhood – all vaccinations up-to-date, no serious illnesses or surgeries. My mother has Type 2 diabetes, if that’s relevant. And, as I mentioned before, I have Medicare insurance.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg for hypertension. And your mother has Type 2 diabetes. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. I did have a bout of pneumonia when I was in my early twenties, but it wasn't severe enough to require hospitalization – I was treated with antibiotics at home. Otherwise, I've been very lucky and haven't needed any serious medical interventions. I try to stay healthy, eat well, and get regular exercise when I can. It's just frustrating that this is happening now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat pretty much anything. No environmental allergies either – no pollen, dust, or animal dander sensitivities. I'm pretty fortunate in that regard as well. Is that all the information you need for now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's a good start. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination. I’ll need to check your abdomen, and perhaps a brief neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. I understand. Please, go ahead. I'll do my best to relax and cooperate. I just want to figure out what's going on, so whatever you need to do is alright with me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie back for me. First, I'll listen to your abdomen. Just try to breathe normally. Normal bowel sounds. No obvious masses or tenderness. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen, just to check for any areas of discomfort. Tell me if anything feels painful. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. Just feels… normal, I suppose. A little pressure, but I think that’s just from needing to go. It's not a sharp pain or anything like that. It's just… a fullness, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here, lower abdomen?
PATIENT: It's a little more sensitive down there. Not painful, exactly, but… a definite feeling of pressure. It's hard to describe. It’s where I feel the discomfort most strongly, I think. It's not a constant ache, it's more of a… a heaviness.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and sensation. This is just to rule out any potential nerve involvement. Patellar reflexes are present and equal bilaterally. Now, I’ll check sensation. Can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It feels… normal. A slight tingling sensation, but nothing unusual. Both legs feel the same, I believe. It doesn’t feel numb or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the examination, there's no significant neurological deficit. Your reflexes are normal, and sensation is intact. However, the tenderness in your lower abdomen warrants further investigation. I'm going to order a urinalysis and a complete blood count. We’ll also need to rule out a urinary tract infection. I'm also going to order a postvoid residual volume test to check how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. A urinalysis and blood work, and then the test to see how much urine is left over. Okay. Will I need to schedule another appointment to get the results? And is there anything I should be doing in the meantime?
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to come back in a few days for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. The lab work should be back within 48 hours. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids – water is best. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. I also suggest keeping a bladder diary – write down when you urinate, how much you drink, and the level of discomfort you’re experiencing. Here's a form for the bladder diary. It will help us understand your symptoms better. And, if you experience any fever, chills, or significant pain, please contact the office immediately.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very helpful. I'll definitely drink more water and avoid caffeine, and I’ll start keeping that diary right away. And I will contact the office if anything changes. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any specific questions I should ask when I come back for the results? I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Good question. When we discuss the results, don’t hesitate to ask about the possible causes of your symptoms, based on the findings. We’ll explore options like overactive bladder, interstitial cystitis, or any other potential diagnoses. Also, feel free to ask about lifestyle modifications or medications that might help manage your symptoms, if needed. It's important to be an active participant in your care, Ms. Creagh, and I want to ensure you understand all of your options. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: That’s… very reassuring, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. Knowing what to expect and being involved in the process definitely puts my mind at ease. No, I don’t think I have any other concerns right now. I’ll focus on drinking water and keeping the diary, and I’ll see you in a few days. Thank you again for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Creagh. I understand it can be unsettling when experiencing these types of symptoms, and I’m glad I could provide some clarity. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before your next appointment.
PATIENT: .
