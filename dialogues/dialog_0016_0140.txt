DOCTOR: Hi Antoine, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s…a bit embarrassing, frankly. It’s a problem in my mouth. A white coating. It’s rather…unpleasant. I’d like it dealt with quickly, if possible. I have commitments, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to be embarrassed at all – we deal with all sorts of things here. A white coating in your mouth…is it painful at all?
PATIENT: Painful? No, not precisely painful. More…irritating. And unsightly. Really, it’s a nuisance. I'm a professional man, Doctor. I don’t have time for…this. Is it contagious, by the way? My wife would be most displeased.
DOCTOR: I can definitely understand your concerns, Antoine. Let's figure out what’s going on. As for being contagious, that depends on the cause, so we'll need to take a look and gather some more information. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't recall the exact date. Perhaps a week ago? It seemed to appear rather suddenly. I haven't changed anything in my routine, Doctor. I assure you. I maintain a very…disciplined lifestyle. Perhaps it’s something I ate? Though I only consume the finest ingredients, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, and you haven't changed anything in your routine. And you eat a very disciplined diet... That's good to know. Has the coating spread at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Spread? Well…yes, I suppose it has. It started on my tongue, and now…it’s on the insides of my cheeks as well. It's becoming rather…extensive. And it’s difficult to eat, honestly. Even good food loses its flavour. It's a complete waste.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. It sounds like it's definitely progressing. Now, I'm going to need to take a quick look in your mouth to get a better idea of what we're dealing with. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, get on with it. The sooner this is over, the better. I trust you have everything sanitized, Doctor? I wouldn't want to contract anything else while I'm here.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, everything is thoroughly sanitized. I always prioritize a clean and safe environment for my patients. Okay, Antoine. I see what you mean. It appears as a fairly widespread white coating. It doesn't look like any open sores or ulcers, which is good. Is it easily wiped off?
PATIENT: Wiped off? Let me see… No. Not easily. It… resists. It’s rather…stubborn, actually. And it leaves a slightly red area underneath. It's quite unpleasant. Really, Doctor, you're seeing why I’m keen to resolve this quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It doesn't come off easily and leaves some redness underneath. That gives us a little more information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Not particularly. Perhaps a… slight loss of appetite, but that could simply be due to the…taste issue. And I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but I attribute that to the pressures of my work. Nothing significant, Doctor. Really. I am generally in excellent health, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so slight loss of appetite and some fatigue, but generally you feel in excellent health. That’s good to know. Now, let's go through some basics. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Absolutely not. I am a very robust individual, as I've said. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though, I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. They simply mask the underlying problem, don’t they? And I pride myself on a natural lifestyle. So, no, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Medications? Heavens, no. I told you, I maintain a natural lifestyle. I wouldn't dream of poisoning my body with those…chemicals. I rely on proper diet and exercise. That is all. I might take a vitamin supplement occasionally, but nothing…prescribed. Absolutely nothing prescribed, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Really, Doctor, I am wasting my time here. I’ve always been in perfect health. Perhaps a mild cold now and then, but nothing…serious. Nothing that required a doctor’s attention, certainly. My father was a very healthy man, and his father before him. Good genes, you understand. So, no, no diagnoses. Nothing. Are we almost finished?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior diagnoses. That's helpful. And what about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Absolutely not. I maintain a very active lifestyle and take excellent care of my body. Why would I need surgery? I assure you, Doctor, this is a healthy, robust constitution. No surgeries. Never. Are we getting anywhere, or are we simply going through the motions here? I have commitments, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, one last thing, let's quickly talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, honestly. My family is… was… remarkably healthy. My father lived to a good age, active and robust. His parents as well. They were… European stock, you understand. Strong genes. No significant problems that I'm aware of. Perhaps a bit of arthritis in my grandmother, but nothing serious. Look, Doctor, I truly believe I've answered all your questions. Can we please move on to a solution? This is becoming rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Based on what you've told me – no allergies, no medications, no prior medical conditions or surgeries, and a healthy family history – and given the appearance of the white coating in your mouth, my primary suspicion is Oral Thrush, also known as Candidiasis. However, given that you describe yourself as very healthy, and without any other risk factors, it’s somewhat unusual. It could also be something else. To be sure, I'd like to do a quick swab to send to the lab to confirm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Are you suggesting I have some sort of…infection? I assure you, Doctor, that’s preposterous! I maintain impeccable hygiene! I eat the finest foods! A swab is simply… unnecessary. And frankly, a little insulting. I told you, I am in excellent health. Are you sure you're qualified to diagnose me? Perhaps a second opinion would be wise. This is… unacceptable. I think I'll just manage this myself. .
DOCTOR: Antoine, please, sit down for just a moment. I understand your concerns, and I don't mean to insult you in any way. A swab is simply a precautionary measure to rule out other possibilities and confirm the diagnosis. It’s a very quick and painless procedure. Given your commitment to your health, wouldn't it be best to have a clear answer?
