DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so just… the blood pressure thing. My husband made me come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. Your husband is looking out for you, and it's always good to be proactive about your health. So, he’s concerned about your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes. He checked it a few times and said it was high. Honestly, I feel fine. Perfectly normal. He’s always going on about something, though. Diet this, exercise that… it’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, even if you're feeling perfectly normal, it's good to get it checked. High blood pressure often doesn’t have any noticeable symptoms, which is why it's sometimes called the “silent killer.” Just to get a baseline, and to put your husband’s mind at ease, let’s take a measurement here in the office. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. It’s probably nothing. I don’t see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It will only take a few moments. I’m going to wrap this around your arm. Please relax your arm and try to breathe normally. Alright, the reading is 148 over 92. Now, a single reading isn’t necessarily cause for alarm, as blood pressure can fluctuate. But this is a bit elevated. Do you know if you've had your blood pressure checked recently, perhaps at a previous doctor's visit?
PATIENT: No. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. I don’t really do doctors. My husband keeps telling me I should, but… honestly, I’m busy. And healthy. As I said. What does that mean anyway, “elevated”? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, "elevated" means it's higher than the recommended levels. Ideally, we like to see blood pressure below 120/80. Yours is a little above that, and consistently elevated blood pressure can, over time, increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. It doesn't mean you will develop those problems, but it's something we want to address. To get a better understanding, I'd like to ask a few questions about your health history and lifestyle, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I eat normal food. Sometimes I skip breakfast. My husband says that’s bad, too. He's always on about something. I work a lot, outside, doing surveys. It’s…physical work. That should count for something, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That does count for something. Physical activity is very beneficial for your health. And skipping breakfast occasionally isn’t a major concern. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. Honestly, I don't really know. My mom… she died when I was young. And my dad… he wasn't around much. We didn’t talk about health stuff. Or anything, really. I guess… my grandma on my mom’s side, she had…something with her heart, maybe? But I don’t know details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's perfectly alright. It’s common not to have all that information. We can work with what we have. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Again, perfectly normal. My husband worries about preservatives and additives, but… I haven't had a reaction to anything. Ever.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all that stuff. Real food is all you need. My husband tries to get me to take a multivitamin, says I’m not getting enough nutrients, but I told him no. He's constantly suggesting things.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's good to know. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Never. Disgusting habit. My husband's uncle smoked for years, and… well, it didn't end well.
DOCTOR: I see. And how much alcohol do you typically drink in a week, if any?
PATIENT: Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not every week. And not a lot. My husband likes to have a beer, but I don’t really care for it. It makes me sleepy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you. That gives me a good overview. Now, I would like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Of course. It will just take a few moments. If you could please loosen your shirt, that would be helpful. Your heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your pulse in your wrists and ankles. Pulses are good and equal on both sides. Blood pressure is still elevated at 146/90, even after resting for a few moments. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything appears to be within normal limits physically. However, your blood pressure remains elevated, and given that we don't have a baseline from previous measurements, I would like to run some basic blood tests and an EKG to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Blood tests and an EKG? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I feel perfectly fine. My husband is going to be so pleased with this whole charade. Look, I don’t like needles, and I really don't have time for all this. Can't you just tell me it’s nothing and send me home?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, and I apologize for any inconvenience. However, it's important to be thorough, especially since this is our first time assessing your blood pressure. The blood tests and EKG are simply precautionary measures to rule out any underlying causes and ensure we're not missing anything. They will give us a more complete picture of your health and allow me to provide you with the best possible care. While you feel fine now, high blood pressure often doesn’t have any noticeable symptoms, and it's important to identify and address it early on to prevent potential complications. The blood tests are a standard panel and don’t take long. The EKG is a quick, painless procedure that measures your heart's electrical activity. If the results are normal, we can discuss lifestyle modifications and follow up with regular blood pressure checks. If there are any abnormalities, we can discuss appropriate treatment options. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But if it turns out to be nothing, I’m holding you responsible for the wasted time. And my husband is never going to let me live this down. Just… get it over with. And no small talk, okay? I really don't have the patience for it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Dudney. No small talk. I'll have my nurse draw your blood, and then we'll get you hooked up to the EKG machine. It won't take long. Nurse Johnson, could you please come in and draw some blood for Ms. Dudney and prepare the EKG machine?
