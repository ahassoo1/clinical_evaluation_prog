DOCTOR: Hi Odell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Yeah. I... something about travel? My wife... she wanted me to come. Before… before everything. It's about going somewhere, I think. I don't really remember all the details. She made the appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like this appointment was set up with some travel in mind. That's a good place to start. Do you have any idea where your wife was hoping you'd travel to?
PATIENT: Hmm… Nepal, maybe? It sounds… familiar. We talked about visiting family. Old family. But I... I don't know where exactly. She always planned the trips. I just… went with her. It was easier that way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nepal. That gives us something concrete. And it sounds like this trip might be connected to family there. You mentioned "old family"—do you know if you’d be traveling to see relatives you haven't seen in a while, or are you unsure?
PATIENT: Unsure. Lots of cousins, I think. Very far away cousins. She had a list. A long list. She liked to… organize. Everything had to be perfect. I didn't really pay attention to the names or places. Just… nodded and smiled. It's… it's hard to think about all of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lot of distant relatives. And it sounds like your wife took the lead on all the planning, which is perfectly alright. So, is this trip still planned, or are you coming in today because something changed with the travel plans?
PATIENT: Changed… yeah. Everything changed. She… she isn't here anymore. So… I don't know if I'm even going. But she already paid for… things. And the lady on the phone said I needed to see you before I… before I cancel. Or… something.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling lost and unsure right now, especially with travel arrangements already made. So, it sounds like the clinic wants to make sure you're medically cleared for travel, or discuss any potential concerns before you make a decision about cancelling. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah. That sounds… right. She was always careful. Always worried about getting sick. Especially in… faraway places. She would make me get shots for everything. Even for just a little trip to the city. I don't really like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, we'll do what we need to do to make sure you're safe, and I promise we'll try to be as efficient as possible. We can discuss what vaccinations might be necessary, and we can absolutely talk about your concerns with needles. First, let’s go over your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions—things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I work. Hard work. Lifting things, building things. I'm strong. Mostly just… tired. Sometimes my back hurts. From the work. She always told me to take pills. For the back. And for my head. When it hurt too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy aside from some work-related back pain and occasional headaches. You mentioned pills for the back and head—do you remember the names of those medications?
PATIENT: No. She… she had a little box. Lots of little pills. Different colors. She would tell me what to take. When. I just… took them. I don't remember the names. She always kept track of everything. It's… hard to think about all of it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely alright that you don't remember the names. We can try to figure it out if it’s important, but it’s not critical right now. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Maybe a little itchy sometimes. After I eat spicy food. But she always said it was just my stomach. She said I couldn't eat too much chili. It made me sweat.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, just some sensitivity to spicy food. Let’s talk about your family history then. Do you know if anyone in your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—has any serious health problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Uh… my parents… they both… gone. A long time ago. Sick. Very sick. But I was young. I don’t really remember what kind of sick. She… my wife… she didn't really talk about them much. She said it was too sad. She wanted me to focus on… the future.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s understandable. It's alright if you don't have a lot of information about your family history. Let’s move on to social history then. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No smoking. My wife didn’t like it. She said it smelled bad. And no… the other things. I work hard. I don't have time for… that. Just work. And… before… just work and her.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. That's good. Now, before we consider any vaccinations or travel concerns, I’d like to get a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. If I have to. I don’t really like doctors. They always poke and… Just… try to be quick, okay? And… gentle?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. And finally, I’ll just feel your abdomen. Take a deep breath for me, Odell… and exhale. Good. Now another one… Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Ears look normal. Throat is a little red, but that could be from a common cold. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Now, can you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Uh… I’m not very tall. I think… around five feet? Maybe a little less. And… I don’t know. About… one-hundred pounds? Maybe a little more. I haven't weighed myself in a long time. She always knew. She kept track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that confirms what we have on file – approximately 5’1” and 104lbs. Given your travel plans – or potential plans – to Nepal, we need to consider vaccinations and potential risks. Do you know if your wife had you vaccinated for anything specifically when you traveled with her?
PATIENT: Uh… lots of shots. In my arm. She said it was to keep me safe. But I don't remember which ones. They all hurt. She would hold my hand. And tell me it was okay. But I don't remember what they were for. Just… shots. In my arm. Lots of them.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you received vaccinations in the past, which is good. Since we don’t know exactly which ones, and given the potential for travel to Nepal, it's best to be cautious. I recommend we review the CDC guidelines for Nepal and consider a few boosters to ensure you're fully protected. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Boosters…? More shots? I… I don’t really like shots. But… if it's to be safe… and she would want me to be safe… okay. But… can you be quick? And… gentle? Please?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll talk through each one before we administer it. Based on the CDC recommendations, I suggest a Tdap booster, a Hepatitis A and B booster, and a Typhoid vaccine. We should also discuss a Japanese Encephalitis vaccine, depending on your travel itinerary. Before we proceed, do you have any concerns about those vaccines?
PATIENT: Uh… Japanese… what-now? Sounds… scary. And what about side effects? She always said to be careful about side effects. She said some people get very sick from the shots. Will I get sick? I don’t want to get sick. I just want to… be safe.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Odell. It’s always good to be informed about potential side effects. The Japanese Encephalitis vaccine is recommended if you'll be traveling to certain regions of Nepal for an extended period, especially during the rainy season. As for side effects, most people experience mild symptoms like soreness at the injection site, a low-grade fever, or headache. Serious side effects are very rare. I will explain the risks and benefits of each vaccine in detail before administering it, and we can adjust the plan if you're uncomfortable with anything. We can start with the Tdap booster - it protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, and it's a standard recommendation for everyone. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Tdap… okay. Sounds… less scary than the other one. As long as it’s just… soreness. And not… very sick. She always said I didn’t handle sickness very well. Okay. Let’s… let’s just get it over with. But… can you tell me exactly where you’re going to… poke me? And… how much it will hurt? Be honest.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as transparent as possible. We'll administer the injection into your upper arm muscle – the same place you likely received previous vaccinations. You might feel a brief, sharp pinch – it's usually over very quickly. It’s a common sensation, and most people describe it as manageable discomfort. After the injection, the area might be sore for a few days, but you can apply a cold compress and take over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. Alright, Odell. Just relax your arm… this will only take a moment. There you go. All done. Just a little pinch, right?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah… a pinch. A big pinch. It stings. Is it… is it over now? It feels… warm. And a little bit… shaky. I don't like this.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s all over now. It’s normal for it to feel a little warm and tender for a few hours. Try to move your arm gently to prevent any stiffness. You can apply a cold compress if you’d like, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage any discomfort. We've completed the Tdap booster. Now, let's discuss the Hepatitis A and B boosters, and whether the Typhoid and Japanese Encephalitis vaccines are necessary. Are you comfortable continuing the discussion, or would you like to take a break for a few minutes?
PATIENT: A break… maybe. Just a little one. I need to… process. And maybe get some water. All this… poking and talking… it’s a lot. She always said I got overwhelmed easily. Just… a few minutes, okay? I need to… think.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Take all the time you need. I'll be right here when you're ready. There’s water in the cooler over there. And please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I’m here to help.
PATIENT: …Okay. I think… I think I'm ready to talk again. But… can we go slow? And… explain everything carefully? I don’t want to miss anything. And… I still don't like the sound of more shots.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll go as slow as you need, and I’ll explain everything carefully. No pressure at all. Let’s start with the Hepatitis A and B boosters. These vaccines protect you against liver infections that are common in many parts of the world, including Nepal. You likely received a series of these vaccines in the past, so we’re just updating your immunity. Do you remember receiving any vaccinations for Hepatitis A or B before?
PATIENT: Uh… maybe. She definitely gave me some shots. Lots of them. But I don’t really remember which ones were for what. They all looked the same. Little needles. She said they were important. She always said to protect my liver. She liked… herbal tea. For the liver. Did she say anything about… the liver? When she gave me the shots? It’s all… a little blurry.
DOCTOR: That's alright. It’s very common to not remember specific details about vaccinations from the past. Since we don’t have a clear record of your previous Hepatitis A and B vaccinations, I recommend we administer a booster series to ensure you’re fully protected. It typically involves three shots, spaced out over several months. Would you like me to explain the potential side effects of the Hepatitis A and B vaccines?
PATIENT: Three shots…? Oh. That’s… a lot. More poking. Side effects…? Yeah. Tell me. I need to know. Is it… will it make me really sick? I don’t want to be sick in Nepal. That would be… terrible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Odell. The good news is that the side effects of the Hepatitis A and B vaccines are usually very mild. Most people experience soreness at the injection site, a low-grade fever, or fatigue for a day or two. Serious side effects are extremely rare. With the Hepatitis A vaccine, you might also experience some mild joint pain or muscle aches. The B vaccine can sometimes cause a mild allergic reaction, but that’s easily treated. We’ll monitor you closely after each injection to ensure you're doing well. Now, regarding the Typhoid vaccine, it’s recommended for travelers to Nepal, especially if you’ll be eating or drinking anything outside of major hotels or restaurants. It protects against a bacterial infection that can cause severe fever and stomach problems. We can discuss that one next. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: More… stomach problems? I already have a sensitive stomach. Okay. Tell me about the Typhoid one. Is it… another series of shots? Please don't say it is. And… how bad are the stomach problems if I don't get it?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's talk about the Typhoid vaccine. Fortunately, there are two options available: a shot and an oral capsule. The shot provides protection for about two years, while the oral capsules require a series of four capsules taken every other day. Regarding the stomach problems if you don’t get vaccinated, Typhoid fever can cause high fever, severe abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, and even internal bleeding. It’s a serious infection that requires hospitalization and antibiotics. Now, the last vaccine we can discuss is the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine. It’s recommended for travelers who will be spending a long time in rural areas of Nepal, especially during the rainy season. It protects against a viral infection that can cause brain inflammation. But given your travel plans and potential itinerary, we can hold off on discussing it for now, if you prefer. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Brain inflammation…? That sounds… terrible. No. No, let's not talk about that one. Not right now. And… I think… I think I’m starting to feel overwhelmed again. Maybe… maybe we should just stick to the Hepatitis ones. The shots. If I have to get shots. And… no more talk about brain inflammation, okay? That's… too much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Odell. We can absolutely stick to the Hepatitis A and B vaccines. That’s a very reasonable decision, and we’ll take things at your pace. No pressure at all to discuss anything you’re not comfortable with. So, for the Hepatitis A and B vaccines, we'll need to administer a series of shots. Typically, it involves three injections, spaced out over several months. The first shot will be today, the second one in one month, and the third one six months later. Are you ready to proceed with the first Hepatitis A and B shot?
PATIENT: …Okay. Just… just get it over with. But… can I close my eyes? And… can you tell me exactly where you're going to poke me? And… how much it will hurt? Be honest. This time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can close your eyes. And I’ll be as honest as possible. The injection will be administered into your upper arm muscle – the same place as the Tdap booster. You’ll feel a brief, sharp pinch – it usually lasts for just a moment. Most people describe it as manageable discomfort – similar to the Tdap booster. After the injection, the area might be sore for a few days, but you can apply a cold compress and take over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. Alright, Odell. Just relax your arm… this will only take a moment. Close your eyes if you’d like. There you go. All done. Just a little pinch, right?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah… a pinch. A big pinch. It stings. Is it… is it over now? It feels… warm. And a little bit… shaky. I don’t like this. When do I get the next one? And… how much longer will this feeling last?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s all over now. It’s normal for it to feel a little warm and tender for a few hours. Try to move your arm gently to prevent any stiffness. You can apply a cold compress if you’d like, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage any discomfort. The next Hepatitis A and B shot is scheduled for one month from today. We’ll send you a reminder a few days before your appointment. The feeling of tenderness should subside within a day or two, but if it persists, you can contact the clinic and we’ll address it accordingly. Are you feeling alright, Odell?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. Just… a little shaky. And… tired. All this… poking and talking… it's a lot. Is… is there anything else I need to do? Any other shots? Or… anything? I think I’ve had enough for today.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You’ve had enough for today. No more shots. For now, just rest and take care of your arm. Avoid strenuous activity for the next few days, and if you experience any severe side effects – like high fever, difficulty breathing, or swelling – please contact the clinic immediately. We’ll send you a reminder for your next appointment in one month. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any further questions for me, Odell?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. I just… want to go home. And rest. Thank you… I think. It was… a lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You’ve been very brave, Odell. And you’re very welcome. Rest is a good idea. Here’s a summary of today’s visit and your appointment schedule. Feel free to contact the clinic if you need anything. Have a safe trip home, Odell. And take care of yourself.
PATIENT: …Bye. .
